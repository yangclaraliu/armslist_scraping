Scott & Sons of England. It was made sometime between 1878 and 1887 as judged by the patent dates and “NOT FOR BALL” markings. This gun was among the maker's best offerings of the era, boasting highly figured wood with a buffalo horn buttplate and very detailed and elaborate engraving that you just don’t see on guns made today, even by custom shops. PLEASE SEE OUR PICTURES!! The design includes “Crystal” loaded chamber indicators, extractors and an automatic safety. The barrels are blue, and we believe they have been refinished. The case colored finish on the receiver and the finish on the wood are original. The shotgun has about 92% of its current metal finish remaining. There are a few light marks in the barrels and the receiver’s case coloring is somewhat muted. There are also a few light marks in the stocks. The bores are bright but show extremely light erosion at the muzzles and in spots scattered throughout. What is really impressive about this shotgun is the fine detailing of the engraving – there is more engraving on the trigger guard than most modern high grades have in total. If you have been looking for a vintage English shotgun to collect, with engraving details that will amaze, then look no further. It even comes with its original fitted factory case that has the original certificate of proofing from W.C. Scott & Sons signed and with the serial number of this shotgun, along with cleaning accessories, tools and spare parts."

He asked me to get everything arranged with his FFL and he would send payment, then backed out. Wasted several days of emailing on his ass. Everyone worries about the seller being legit but half the time the buyer backs out and has no courtesy or respect to be honest about it! So please, if you want this rifle, then let's make a deal. If you don't, then don't contact me and make arrangements! 

Brand new never fired, never even racked the bolt, never even moved the safety, Arsenal SLR-104UR Bulgarian Krinkov! I purchased this rifle from KVAR when they had them, and it has sat in my safe this entire time. I wanted to SBR it, but just don't have the funds or time to complete the project. Needs money for family now so this rifle is leaving the safe. I assure you not a single round has been fired, and if you're local you can swing by to see for yourself. One look and you will agree that it is brand new. 

The rifle will come with the original box, Manual/papers.
Original oil can, cleaning rid, cleaning kit, and sling
Everything is still in original plastic, never opened!
Comes with one 30 round brand new magazine, circle 10

I am also including a brand new ALG Defense AKT Trigger still in package for you!!!

I am selling the rifle at the cost I paid, I still have the receipt to show you. If you check Arsenal's website they state these rifles are no longer being imported for an undetermined amount of time due to military focus and filling military contracts. 

I don't want any trades due to needing the money. The asking price is what I paid, the trigger is on the house! I will ship where legal on your dime. Pick up is preferred.

I've had it for about 1.5 years, it consistently hits torsos at 100yd and 2 inch clusters (that is, strings of 3-3-4 shots) at 25. I've only been shooting for 3.5 years, so I'm pretty sure someone actually good at shooting can make it do better. All the parts that I looked at (mag cover, receiver, top of bolt, trigger assembly) have matching serials, if there's another part you want me to check let me know. Good for collecting or for modification (although I'm sure Simonov's ghost would rather you didn't).

Note: I've zeroed the sights as best as I can for meters, so if you are shooting at 100yd, you will need to aim a little lower, and if you are shooting 25yd, you need to aim a little higher due to the way bullet arcs work.

Note 2: the third picture was taken with the gun and camera to the side, so there was no Rule 1 and 2 violation. Let me know if you want more pictures from different angles

For sale is an AKS74U Clone. This is a Short Barreled Rifle and all NFA Rules Apply. 

It is built on a Bulgarian Arsenal SLR104UR as a base gun. It had the barrel professionally cut and recrowned to just under 8 inches.

It will also come with black polymer furniture and pistol grip, 6 magazines which are a mixture of russian, east german and bulgarian circle 10 mags. Gun will come with a Tapco G2 trigger and an AK sight tool. It will come with a russian krinkov sling, a bulgarian krinkov sling, a russian paratrooper drop case for an AKS74U, and an east german mag pouch. Also comes with approximately 300 rounds of ammunition. Could be less if I shoot some of the ammo up before the gun sells. 

The gun runs 100%. I have never had a malfunction or any keyholing issues with this gun in over 500 rounds through it since new. I do not want to sell this gun but would like some extra money for a car downpayment. Price is OBO. I do not have to sell so please don't lowball me. Serious buyers can come see the gun in person and  possibly shoot it. Contact me for info. 

Armslist will only let me post one picture so email me for more detailed pictures. Also feel free to email me with any questions you have. I am the original owner, purchased the SLR104UR brand new and had it built on a form 1. The gun will transfer on a form 4.

This is pretty self explanatory. This is a 1944 Dated Mosin Nagant M38 Carbine in 7.62X54R. This gun was built by izhevsk, has a great bore and shoots awesome. These M38's are getting tough to find. I bought the gun years ago and believe the stock may have been refinished but not positive. There is a dent on the right side of the butstock which appears to be very old and have been with the gun for most of it's life. I don't know how it got there but I like to imagine the gun could probably tell a good story to go with it. 

The gun groups very well for an old Mosin and the action is pretty smooth as well. 

Email me with any questions. I don't have to sell but would like some extra cash for downpayment on a new car. 

Also email for more pictures. Armslist will only allow 1 photo.

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own."

This is a reciever kit conversion that replaces the mossberg mag tube use, and replaces it with the Saiga drums and magazines to be used in the reciever.  This is not a sidewinder style kit that goes on the mag tube, it is a new lower reciever that replaces the standard mossberg one and the drum/mag goes into the reciever.  Comes with both the pistol grip and standard stock with a railed forend all in black.  The pistol grip and standard stock can be switched in under 5 seconds and there is also a ar-15 style stock that can be purchased and switched out just as quick.  Has a rail on reciever for an aimpoint red/green halo sight that is included.  It uses the 590 style barrel and comes with the 18"" breecher barrel with muzzle brake with heat sheild. I built this 12 gauge shotgun and now need to sell it due to needing money and sad to do so befor being able to even shoot this bad boy.  It is un-modified other than the reciever swap and only needs the Saiga drum/mag to be a complete gun...if I had the drum/mag I would of tried it out befor selling.  This is an awsome gun and will get noticed at the range as it is a pump action 12ga with the ability to easily hold 20 rounds.  If you look up the reciever kit it sells for around $500 alone if you are able it find one in stock and the stock gun set-up goes for another $500.  I am looking to get $850 for the complete set-up with everything included.  
Buyer must be legaly ably to buy and own, and sign a standard purchase form just to document being transfered from me to (name) on (date) with serial # of firearm.  This is just a formality that I have always done and if you are unable to do any of this I will be unable to sell it to you.....sorry.
The picture is of the 500 befor the reciever swap, but the new reciever looks the same as the factory reciever.  I am able to text pictures of the 500 with the swap and halo sight.
Please call or text me rather than e-mail if possible.

This is a fine example of one of Smith and Wesson's ""3rd gen"" semi autos. This particular example is 9mm, blued, is a single stack, 8 round magazine, and is a DA/SA trigger configuration. It has a bobbed hammer, and an ambidextrous safety/decocker. 

It has very minor holster wear on the leading edges if the gun, it was like that when I bought it in 2011. It has been only in the safe and to the range, I only carried it a few times. It is a great carry gun due to how slim it is. 

Included are two 8 round magazines, one has an extended baseplate, one has a standard flat baseplate. Also included is the original box. 

These are great pistols, incredibly reliable and low recoil since they aren't made of plastic like some of today's pistols. I've never had any malfunctions out of it.

Asking $475 or best reasonable offer. 
Will trade for Kahr CW9, Smith and Wesson Shield 9mm, or Keltec PF9 plus an appropriate amount of cash on your end.
Don't low ball me, no spam, no checks, cash only.

Would like to trade for another gun that has a safety on it. It can be striker fired, or DAO. So, email me and let me know what you'd be willing to trade it for. I would also consider the exact same gun with a safety on it. So, if you have an MP .40 with a safety, let me know. I will take .40 cal and 9mm in trade."

Featuring a Duplex IR reticle and illuminated central crosshairs, getting on point has never been easier. Ideal for daytime tactical shooting and rangefinding, the 1.5-5x Riflescope with Green Laser offers the choice of a red or bright green illuminated reticle and 1/2-inch click MOA adjustment. 

Because the human eye is more sensitive to green wavelengths of light than red, the 1.5-5x Riflescope with a built-in green laser is best for daytime shooting. The 5mW laser that can be mounted on a picatinny or weaver rail, this riflescope facilitates quick target acquisition in rapid changing, bright and low-light environments that only a laser can do. 

The flexibility of the zoom from 1.5-5x maximizes the utility of the scope. Set the magnification at 1.5x for a wide field of view and easier close-in target acquisition. Twist the power up to 5x for all of your mid-range target requirements. Precision multi-coated optics are also a distinguishing feature of the Firefield® Tactical Riflescope line, offering a clear view in both bright and low-light situations.

BUSHMASTER 30TH ANNIVERSARY CARBINE...
Thirty years of AR type rifle innovation combined to create a unique Bushmaster Carbine!


(BCWA3F 16FD-XXX)

A special Carbine featuring years of Bushmaster innovation
from Muzzle Brake to Buttstock – including...
• AK47 Flash Hider – Developed from a Russian design and first manufactured in .223 caliber in the mid ‘80s • 16” Dissipator Heavy Fluted Barrel – a design unique to Bushmaster (though copied since). First shipped in
the early 90’s, this Chrome Lined ChroMoly steel barrel features “full radius” front sight placement in combination with a rear (Dissipator) positioned gas block for ultra reliability • Milled Gas Block – allowing placement under the handguards. This “shaved sight base” concept was also utilized on our first competition/varmint rifle – the V Match • A1 “Round” Front Sight Post – adapted from the Viet Nam era M16A1s, and still popular today • Four Rail Split Handguard – first introduced in 2004, featuring Four Picatinny Rails positioned at 12-3-6-9 o’clock, multiple cooling vents, and easy installation into existing Delta Ring and Handguard Cap. Rubber rail covers for comfort and rail protection are included • A3 Removable Carry Handle on “Flat-top” Upper – introduced to Bushmaster customers in 1995 to offer a solid optic mounting platform on the Upper while retaining Carry Handle convenience (A3 Carry Handle introduced in ‘96) • “Stay-Straight” A3 Rear Sight from our 2007 DCM-XR Series Rifles with 1/4 Minute Windage Knob • Carbon 15 Charging Handle and Ambidextrous Safety Selector – from our acquisition of Arizona’s Professional Ordnance in 2003 • 6-Position Telestock – a Bushmas- ter LE and Military standard since 2000 • Also included: ErgoGrip Tactical Pistol Grip; Nickel Plated Pivot/Takedown Pins; BMAS Sling Swivel Stud with Q.D.

Includes: One Shok-Buff* Buffer The WILSON SHOK-BUFF® prevents the slide from battering the frame during recoil by sandwiching a 1/10"" thick poly fiber buffer between the slide and frame contact areas. When you are shooting high performance loads in your 1911 style pistol, you want the extra protection that the original SHOK-BUFF® provides. One ""Imitations"" brand on the market claims they are better because their buffer lasts a little longer. The object of the frame to slide buffer is to protect the pistol from wear, if the buffer is not soft enough to take the damage instead of the pistol what have you accomplished? We feel the original SHOK-BUFF® is the optimum balance between shock absorption and longevity. Easily replaceable after absorbing up to 1,000 rounds of repeated firings, the SHOK-BUFF® slides over the recoil spring guide between guide and spring. Why take a chance on a inferior die stamped copy when you can have the original injection molded SHOK-BUFF®? With over 21 years of competition and street proven experience and hundreds of thousands sold, the original SHOK-BUFF® is still the best. Don't be fooled by imitation products, current production Wilson SHOK-BUFF®buffers are royal blue and bear the SHOK-BUFF® name.

I'll send you plenty more pictures if you're interested
Whole thing was hand built with about 50-60 manhours worth of work.
Made of local red oak hardwood, with pine inlay inserted around the sides.
It has in it about 3500 223 brass, maybe 300 38 special, and about 150 308 brass, all polished up. Worth about 180-220$ in brass alone.
The top opens up with cantilever mounts so it stays flat when its opened up, you can use it as a couch table with it open. 
The inside is lined with felt, looks good. Nice contrast with the brass.
I made 1 big drawer for TV remotes and whatnot with a brass handle.
I made another hidden drawer on the side for a pistol with no handle, it fits a full size 1911 and 1-2 extra mags, I've installed a locking latch on the bottom for safety
Both interiors lined with felt.
You can easily fit any 1 rifle in it for a single display look, or even an arsenal of old mosin nagants, garands, and mausers. 
With the brass I'm looking for about 620$ or best offer
500 without the brass
Or take the table, the brass, and an ar-15 for 1200 dollars"

The first is a NIB S&W 637 that's brand new and unfired. Will come with its box and an HKS speedloader. It has also had an Apex Tactical Duty Carry spring kit installed, so the trigger is much better than stock (comes with the original parts if you want to swap them back out however).

The second is my pride and joy, a S&W Model 10, heavy barrel 4 inch in excellent condition. It is a 10-11 to be exact and it does not have an internal lock. Action is beautifully smooth and it locks up as tight as a bank vault in double and single action. I consistently shoot one hole groups that I can cover with a nickel in double action with it. Was professionally cerakoted to like new condition by FTW here in town. Has hogue bantam grips for easier concealment currently on it, however it also comes with the original wood grips. Have a fair amount of gear for it as well to make it suitable for concealment and competition. Have a Fobus paddle holster, 4 speedloaders (3 safariland comp tac's, 1 HKS), two safariland speedloader belt clips, and an Alien Gear 2.0 Cloak Tuck IWB holster that it is pretty comfortable to carry in (been carrying it this summer occasionally in shorts and a t shirt). Finally I have a 100 rounds of 38 special I will include in the sale. Have over $700 invested in the gun and gear.

Again, I love these revolvers but I've found another one that I've been wanting to get for a long time, so these are being sacrificed for it. Would like to sell both revolvers together for $1000. This would be a great setup for someone who likes to conceal, carry, or compete with revolvers. Feel free to ask questions, thanks! Pretty specifically looking for a certain revolver, so not really wanting to trade."

929,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4572929,For Sale:  Hornady Lock N Load AP Reloading Press w/ Extras,"Carmichael, Sacramento, California",$ 600,"Listed On: Monday, August 3, 2015",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm selling my excellent and lightly used reloading press. I purchased this unit new in 2013. This is everything (sans brass, powder, bullets, and primers) that you need to start reloading your own ammo and saving $$$! This thing is in excellent to like-new condition. There is some minor surface rust (non affecting) on a few of the components like the primer tube housing, shell plate, and powder measure rotor/metering insert. I'm sure most of it would scrub off with a liberal application of steel wool and elbow grease.

Also, I can't seem to find the plastic powder reservoir that sits on the powder measure. It should be around here somewhere, so I'll update the listing if/when I find it. If all else fails, I've included a link below to Midway where you can buy a replacement for less than $10.

I've only reloaded about 5k rounds of 9mm through this press. I'm only selling it because I've recently relocated here from across the country and find myself shooting less handgun and a lot more rifle, so I'll be moving to a single stage setup soon. I have to say I love this press! It's definitely one of the best values in progressive presses on the market right now. It's built like a tank and will last long enough to hand down to your grandkids. Parts and accessory availability is outstanding; as is Hornady's (lifetime) warranty and customer service.

This is a pretty stellar package deal. The press alone has an MSRP of $535. I've got around $800 invested into all this gear, so don't expect me to be in much of a mood to dicker over the price.

Cash and local pick-up only. May consider trades for large, late model Kifaru, Exo, or Stone Glacier hunting packs.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

The CZ is one of the most respected 9mm pistols ever. This is the Pre-B model and has a thumb safety to allow for carrying ""cocked and locked."" The pistol runs flawlessly but it does have a few cosmetic blemishes, most of which are from holster wear. it won't win any beauty contests but it's definitely a shooter. The CZ would make a great pistol for anyone holding or seeking a Tennessee carry permit. Although I have no concrete proof of it, this appears to be Czech police trade in. The pistol comes with a Bladetech belt holster and four magazines: two CZ mags and two Mec-Gar mags. The Mec-Gars are 17 and 19 round magazines, which is quite a bit of firepower for a service pistol. Thanks for looking."
