The Dreyse Model 1907 is a semi-automatic pistol designed by Louis Schmeisser. The gun was named after Nikolaus von Dreyse, the designer of the Dreyse Needle Gun. The Waffenfabrik von Dreyse company was acquired by Rheinische Metallwaren & Maschinenfabrik Sömmerda in 1901, although the Dreyse Model pistols were marketed under the Dreyse name.
The pistol had an interesting feature for the time: when the gun was ready to fire, the firing pin projected through the back of the breech block, serving as an early handgun-cocking indicator. For cleaning, the frame, receiver and slide pivoted forward on a pin in front of the trigger guard. The pistol and its derivatives (Dreyse Model 1907 Pocket Pistol, Dreyse Model 1912 Parabellum) was of simple blowback recoil operation, though of unusual design.[2]

Primarily used by Austrian troops during World War I, especially officers of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg Empire. Also used by officers of Imperial Germany during World War I.
Examples issued to the Imperial German Army will have an acceptance proof above the ejection port on the right as well as the normal Crown N commercial proofs on the left side of the frame and slide near the trigger.
Examples saw use by Wehrmacht troops (especially officers) during World War II. Nearing the end of the war many examples were issued to the Volksgrenadiere and Volkssturm, the latter often with so-called ""last-ditch"" Presstoff holsters. Large numbers of these were brought back to the United States by returning servicemen, which accounts for their availability in the country today. Typically the paper Presstoff holsters have not survived.
A few thousand were purchased by the Czech military in 1921 and 1922, but they were removed from service in 1923 due to unspecified accidents with them.
In 1912 the pope's Swiss Guard acquired thirty of these pistols for use by officers and non-commissioned officers. They remained in service until 1990 when they were replaced by the SIG P225 pistol as the P75.[4]
During World War II this pistol found its way to the Norwegian resistance. Quite a few of these pistols have, alongside home-made Sten-guns and illegal radios, been found hidden within the house-walls of Norwegian resistance members and sympathisers."

The Dreyse Model 1907 is a semi-automatic pistol designed by Louis Schmeisser. The gun was named after Nikolaus von Dreyse, the designer of the Dreyse Needle Gun. The Waffenfabrik von Dreyse company was acquired by Rheinische Metallwaren & Maschinenfabrik Sömmerda in 1901, although the Dreyse Model pistols were marketed under the Dreyse name.
The pistol had an interesting feature for the time: when the gun was ready to fire, the firing pin projected through the back of the breech block, serving as an early handgun-cocking indicator. For cleaning, the frame, receiver and slide pivoted forward on a pin in front of the trigger guard. The pistol and its derivatives (Dreyse Model 1907 Pocket Pistol, Dreyse Model 1912 Parabellum) was of simple blowback recoil operation, though of unusual design.[2]

Primarily used by Austrian troops during World War I, especially officers of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg Empire. Also used by officers of Imperial Germany during World War I.
Examples issued to the Imperial German Army will have an acceptance proof above the ejection port on the right as well as the normal Crown N commercial proofs on the left side of the frame and slide near the trigger.
Examples saw use by Wehrmacht troops (especially officers) during World War II. Nearing the end of the war many examples were issued to the Volksgrenadiere and Volkssturm, the latter often with so-called ""last-ditch"" Presstoff holsters. Large numbers of these were brought back to the United States by returning servicemen, which accounts for their availability in the country today. Typically the paper Presstoff holsters have not survived.
A few thousand were purchased by the Czech military in 1921 and 1922, but they were removed from service in 1923 due to unspecified accidents with them.
In 1912 the pope's Swiss Guard acquired thirty of these pistols for use by officers and non-commissioned officers. They remained in service until 1990 when they were replaced by the SIG P225 pistol as the P75.[4]
During World War II this pistol found its way to the Norwegian resistance. Quite a few of these pistols have, alongside home-made Sten-guns and illegal radios, been found hidden within the house-walls of Norwegian resistance members and sympathisers."

Introduced to the firearms market in 1927, The Colt Official Police is a medium frame, six-shot, double-action revolver with a six round cylinder, primarily chambered for the .38 Special cartridge, and manufactured by the Colt's Manufacturing Company. The intended specific target market for the Official Police was mainly law enforcement agencies and it became one of the best selling police firearms of all time, eventually in the 1950s coming to exemplify typical peace officer weaponry. The Official Police was also used by various U.S. and allied military forces during World War II.

The Official Police was machined of fine carbon steel, with bright royal Colt blued as well as nickel plated finishes, and was offered in 4”, 5”, and 6” barrels. Built on Colt’s .41 or “I” frame, it was manufactured in a variety of chamberings including .22 LR, .32-20 (discontinued in 1942), .41 Long Colt (discontinued in 1938), and the most common and popular, the .38 Special. Colt’s “Positive Lock” firing pin block safety was a standard feature of the revolver, preventing the firing pin from striking the primer unless the trigger was deliberately pulled. The pistol’s sights consisted of a blade front with a fixed iron open rear sight, which was a simple V-notch shaped groove milled into the revolver’s top strap. The top strap had a matte finish to reduce glare down the sight plane."

While the bluing is a little worn from years of storage in cosmoline, I have cleaned every last glob out of the rifle and the metal is in excellent shape. 

*****This is not some Norinco, stamped metal rifle built for a civilan market. This rifle is all milled parts and was built for combat, not export to the USA. You can compare this beside a late production and the difference is instantly recognizable. The barrel is threaded instead of held in place with a single pin. This rifle will last generations if maintained and cared for properly***********
I am including a the cleaning tube, a leather pouch with forty (40) rounds of 124 grain russian steel case ammo, modern manufacture/non-corrosive loaded onto four (4) modern production stripper clips. I am also including an oil bottle and the bore-brushes predecessor: a hemp rope with lead weights and a braided slot for a patch to pull through for jungle cleaning on the run. 
The tube cleaning kit contains a jag, nylon brush and the sight adjustment tool. This rifle is priced to move and is designed for someone looking to get a complete packaged SKS. If this baby is still here a week from now my buddy's getting it so don't wait if you're interested. Same goes for the Tula I have listed as well. Get it while the getting's good.

During World War I, like many nations Italy faced a shortage of modern infantry rifles. As an stop-gap measure, hundreds of thousands of Vetterli-Vitali rifles and a few carbines and musquetoons were converted in Rome and Gardone to fire the 6.5x52mm Carcano round, by adding a 6.5mm barrel liner and a Carcano-style magazine."

Introduced to the firearms market in 1927, The Colt Official Police is a medium frame, six-shot, double-action revolver with a six round cylinder, primarily chambered for the .38 Special cartridge, and manufactured by the Colt's Manufacturing Company. The intended specific target market for the Official Police was mainly law enforcement agencies and it became one of the best selling police firearms of all time, eventually in the 1950s coming to exemplify typical peace officer weaponry. The Official Police was also used by various U.S. and allied military forces during World War II.

The Official Police was machined of fine carbon steel, with bright royal Colt blued as well as nickel plated finishes, and was offered in 4”, 5”, and 6” barrels. Built on Colt’s .41 or “I” frame, it was manufactured in a variety of chamberings including .22 LR, .32-20 (discontinued in 1942), .41 Long Colt (discontinued in 1938), and the most common and popular, the .38 Special. Colt’s “Positive Lock” firing pin block safety was a standard feature of the revolver, preventing the firing pin from striking the primer unless the trigger was deliberately pulled. The pistol’s sights consisted of a blade front with a fixed iron open rear sight, which was a simple V-notch shaped groove milled into the revolver’s top strap. The top strap had a matte finish to reduce glare down the sight plane."

It's also possible the ads are being placed by law enforcement looking to make examples of a few buyers who disregard the new law, or by newspaper/TV reporters wanting to do a story on how this law should be better enforced.

My wife is making me sell some ammo, apparently I have too much. For your consideration, I have 2000 rounds of PMC Bronze .223 that i would be willing to let go for $900 or equal trade. I would be willing to break it up into 500 round lots. I think this is a fair price since it is currently selling online for ~$0.65 a round. If you need to see a picture (it is just ammo) i can send one if necessary.

Like I said, HK made ONLY 500 of these in OD Green so they are near impossible to find. I have it priced at lower than the norm if you can find one (the last one to go on Gunbroker went for 1,300). I have carried it some so it does have a little holster wear but it is in good condition. Wonderful gun but like I said I need to fund another project. The box, gun and two mags with finger plate will be included. Mine is the V1 configuration (DA/SA with decocker & safety) In 40c. It has standard sights as well. In addition I will include a kydex OWB holster (Fobus). Buyer will need a CCH or permit.

Would only trade for an XDM or XDS.


This gun is in 99% condition. I bought it new locally and put under 100 FLAWLESS rounds through it, installed Hogue grips, its a sweet shooter! Has the rounded triggerguard, dovetailed front and rear sights, accessory rail underneath, and captured recoil spring and guide rod assy.


No marks or damage. I have installed a metal SRT (short-reach trigger) that I bought on the Berettaforum.net Classifieds, it replaces the poly coated stocker (included) with a metal trigger with a slightly shorter reach.


This gun shoots great and has fantastic fit and finish. I just find it a tad too large for my hands, my Cougar 9mm just fits my hands so much better. Comes with all factory kit including box, case and 3x 17rd mags, factory plastic grip panels and Hogue rubber finger groove grips. (TLR-1 light in some pics is NOT included)


I want $630 FIRM for this.  Will trade for: XDM pistol (9mm preferred) or XDS (9mm or .45, no matter). Low rd count and comparable condition to my Beretta. I would still entertain a higher-rd count or worn-finish gun, if you would toss in some $$ towards the deal."

PLEASE READ FULL DESCRIPTION BEFORE OFFERING ANYTHING. This gun is the ultimate concealed carry edc gun. I will start with the small upgrades and work my way up to the bigger upgrades. I have installed +1 Pearce Grip Extensions on all 3 mags for $15.00. I installed a stainless 6lb. Trigger spring, a 4 lb. striker spring, and a reduced power safety plunger spring for $20.00. I installed a Ghost Evo 3.5 lb. connector for $25.00, and a polished titanium safety plunger for $20.00. It has an aluminum back plate cover. It has polished skeletonized stainless steel striker for $70.00. It has a tungsten recoil assembly for $70.00. I put Trijicon night sights on it installed for $100.00. It has a match grade KKM Precision barrel that was match fitted for $225.00 with the labor. It has a black on black Zev Tech Fulcrum trigger with polished trigger bar and ejector housing that was $180.00. And I've installed a Vickers Tactical Tango Down mag release and slide catch for $40.00.  I didn't just buy all these parts and throw them on the gun either. The frame has been sent off to be centered and made perfectly even. The barrel, trigger assembly, and guide rod have been tuned to have perfect harmonics. It has been set up for a self defense carry gun with a 3.5 lb. trigger pull, but can be adjusted from 6lb. to 2lb. Trigger pull. You can also adjust the pre-travel and after travel of the trigger, and the trigger reset has been reduced by 50% from the factory setting. It is a very smooth crisp Trigger that breaks very clean. I also have a lot of parts that go with it. I have a Zev Tech V4 race connector, and a Lightning Strike titanium polished safety plunger with spring. Also have 3 5lb. Striker springs and 1 6lb. Striker spring. I have another 6lb. Trigger spring, and all the factory parts that were removed. Factory barrel, factory trigger, factory safety plunger, factory striker, and factory sights. I also have a front sight removal tool, and an I-Tac kydex paddle holster with the button release that was $50.00.  I have the case and all paperwork with the back straps, and factory mag base plates. You won't find a better Glock than this. It has been fine tuned to be a perfect everyday carry self defense gun. I can send more pics upon request if you want to see anything in particular. I know what this gun is worth, and I know what I've got in it. If you want a factory glock this isn't for you. I'm not going to trade or sale it for the price of a factory glock. The parts in this gun are worth more than a factory glock. If you are interested then please make a reasonable offer based on what this gun is worth now. Thanks for looking."

Also, I have the sig factory 22LR conversion slide and magazines (2) for this gun. Just swap the slide over and practice with 22 LR instead of 45. You have to shoot quality 22 ammo for it to fully function reliably. Forget the bargain basement 22 ammo. It comes in its own factory hard case. This kit normally runs around $300 by itself.

Again the gun and everything that comes with it is FACTORY SIG. No aftermarket. (Except for the Hogue Grips)

The gun itself only has a few hundred rounds through it as I tend to shoot my Colts more often. I also take meticulous care of all my guns and you won't find a blemish on it.

I am not looking for gun trades right now as I am trying to downsize my collection. Please note also that all this stuff together amounts to well over $1100 retail worth of stuff."

There is 1500 5.56mm casings.  1500 sierra 5.56mm (224) 53 and 55 grain bullets.  There is lube, some spray stuff and also about a 1000 primers.  I'm asking $600 OBO.  Somebody please just take this stuff!!!!!

Please do not contact me through email, people have tried to do that in the past and it leads to alot of confusion.  I do not have email on my phone like most people.  So if you want to buy a complete reloading kit with all the stuff to reload 1500 rounds of 5.56, then this is the kit for you.

In short, two mags are still good and two mags need springs. 

I have four magazines for this pistol. Two have already exhibited weakening springs. Two still have very strong springs. . The gun has been 100% for nearly 500 (or maybe slightly more) rounds and I have had it for less than two years. Several other experts I have spoken to had a similar issue with mag springs that was remedied with brand new springs. 

I have the original box, all the grips, wax paper, paperwork, lock etc. I also have a very nice Forest City Tactical kydex setup. Holster and magazine holder, holster is molded with a forward FBI cant. Both are matching in OD Green. FCT makes great holsters and I have used them for CCW now for years. They are perfectly molded to fit your exact model of pistol (no, I do not work for them). Slick and easy to draw with just the right amount of tension. 

Why am I selling it?

To be honest, I do not want to deal with obtaining new springs. 

Has seen many different rounds, including:

PMC 230gr
Gold Dot 230 gr.
Winchester Ranger and T series, 230gr
American Eagle 230 gr

Gun has ran flawless with no malfunctions, EVER. I just noticed this spring issue cropping up and would rather invest my time and effort in a different brand that I prefer. The gun has some very slight holster wear in a few spots, but it is very minor.

I can meet in the Lancaster area. MUST have valid Ohio ID. CCW License, Active Duty/NG or LEO ID preferred. Please bring two copies of a simple bill of sale. 

Asking $500 or best offer."

 The SST bullet has earned the reputation as being a tough, accurate, flat shooting hunting bullet. Its polymer tip streamlines the profile to deliver high BC’s and initiate rapid expansion.

Designed with the intent of being a rimfire companion piece to the famous 1911, this pistol chambers .22LR and operates by simple blow-back. Unlike the later ""Service Model Ace"", this pistol does not feature a floating chamber and instead has a specially lightened slide, reduced power recoil spring, special recoil spring guide with leather buffers, and a special firing pin retainer with roller bearing. This pistol is all original. The low 3-digit serial number (295) places her in 1931 production, the very first year of manufacture. The serial number is properly matching beneath the firing pin retainer on the slide. Overall condition is very good with handling marks, general finish wear, and thinning at the muzzle and grip straps. There is a small area of pitting on the left side of the slide. I'd grade the original factory blue finish at about 80% overall. The original full checkered walnut grips show some wear but no cracks or chips. The two-tone magazine is also correct/original and in very good shape. The mechanics appear to be in perfect working order and the bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling. With a production totaling less than 11,000 guns, the Ace is one of the less commonly encountered Colt automatic pistols."

Federal Fusion Lite Ammunition is loaded with a specialized bullet, perfect for deer sized game, that features an electrochemically bonded lead core to copper jacket, eliminating the possibility of a core/jacket separation and a specialized powder that helps to reduce the felt recoil by up to 50%. This reduced recoil load is perfect for the new hunter or recoil sensitive hunter to increase their hunting experience. The boat tail rifle bullets feature a slight dimple in the nose that delivers exceptional accuracy and devastating terminal performance which delivers an impact that radiates lethal shock throughout the target. This energy is optimized through mass weight retention, a top-secret tip-skiving process and superior bullet integrity. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

literally a blast to shoot, This mosin turns alot of heads at the range and earns quite a few compliments.

All the work was done myself and has turned out VERY well, as i am very particular with my projects.

Ive provided a you tube link to show how smooth it functions, its accurate at 100yards with the iron sight, i havent shot out past 100, but it would be kinda trick without a scope anyway.

everything in the picture is included.

A gunsmith would charge you around $350 to $400 for parts and labor hours for the work that has been done.

MODIFICATIONS :

- cut and re-crowned to 17 inches
- ""Brass stacker"" front sight mount

I will not go lower than the listed price, I believe it is well worth it.
