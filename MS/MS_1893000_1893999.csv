The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. 

Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection.

The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. 

Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection.

Styled after the M16-A3 with round handguards and a flat-top upper capable of mounting scopes/other optics. At the moment it has a set of National Match rear iron sights installed. Also installed on it is a MagPul MOE pistol grip. It has a M16-style full stock and an almost brand-new 20"" DPMS heavy barrel with a 1/9 twist on it installed. The gun itself has had less than 5k rounds through it and has always been very well-maintained and cleaned. Also keep in mind that it is an older DPMS from about 2001, before DPMS truly went to heck quality-control wise. Included with the gun is 4 magazines that include 1 BFI steel 30rd. mag, 1 C-Products 30rd. mag, and 2 Korean polymer 30rd. mags. Also includes 4 10rd. stripper clips and the feeding adapter to make loading mags a breeze as well as the original DPMS pistol grip & mounting hardware, an original DPMS barrel nut and handguard ring, a Mako Group handguard rail (screws onto the existing handguards allowing you to mount a bipod or vertical grip without adding a ton of weight), a couple rail covers for the handguard rail, and 60 rounds of Tula .223 steel case (which feeds through the gun fine if kept clean and well-maintained, though you may get a stuck casing occasionally with it). Factoring in everything I have included in the package with the gun, I feel that asking $750 is more than fair for all of it - especially considering you are lucky to find an AR-15 for less than $800-900 right now with just the gun. Heck, I have it on consignment at my local gun shop for more than this! I can meet anywhere in the Eau Claire or Altoona area, but would prefer not to drive too long of a haul. I will NOT ship under ANY circumstances."

Right out of the box this firearm had issues. It seemed like every other round was an FTE with a few FTF's sprinkled in. It was sent back to Ruger & the ejector housing, ejector spring, extractor, extractor plunger, extractor spring, frame insert pin & safety detent plunger were all replaced. Now this LC9 fires like a dream & no issues at all. Kudos to Ruger for standing behind their product, great customer service & fast turn-around time!

I bought this firearm for my wife but she doesn't have the manual strength to pull the slide back. I've already purchased a revolver for her so this LC9 has to go. I hate to see it go because it was a blast to shoot at the range. This is the perfect personal defense or carry weapon. Would also make an outstanding back-up.

You are looking at a box of CCI 22 Long Lead Round nose ammunition. Brand new ammunition that was purchased in the last week.
100 round box.  This is not your standard 22 lr ammo.  29gr bullet, 710 fps, sub sonic round that provide low noise performance. 
It will fire in 22lr guns, but may not cycle semi autos.
Great for target practice and pest control without the noise signature of a higher powered 22lr round.


I would like FTF transactions at this time, preferably somewhere North of Pgh. Cash only."

Using a receiver set manufactured by Granville Gun Works. I hand filed the pivot points on the upper, bedding it to the lower. In doing so, I made sure the upper was in perfect center line with the lower. I also faced off the upper & hand lapped the over sized barrel extension to fit. Over time, oping and closing for regular cleaning. You may lose your bedding. Just take off the pistol grip & tight up on a set screw that pushes up on the back pivot point. Thus, never losing your bedding. 
The Barrel is a mid weight 5.56 (2lb 2oz)  designed for heavy use. Steel is 4150 11595-e milspec CMV alloy, Melonite treated; shown to last 30% longer than chromelined barrels and twice as long as stainless while being more corrosion resistant. This 16"" 1 in 8 twist Hybrid 5R rifling, 5/8-24 threaded muzzle, mid length gas system, uses a standard .750 Troy industries gas block. M4 feed ramps on the extension.
I also dropped in a Geissele Match Rifle Adjustable Trigger AR-15, LR-308 Small Pin .154"" Two Stage Matte. 1st stage pull weights range from 1.3-3 lbs, 2nd stage pull weights range from 4-14 oz.
For a little icing on the cake. I used a Nickle-Boron Coated F/A COMPLETE bolt carrier group 5.56 Cal
For balance, in the rear I added a steal buffer tube. Up front a 15"" AP Tactical Carbon-Fiber Free Float Tube with rails. Giving you the ability to have your iron sights as far apart as possible. 
This baby will rock your socks off. Bad to the BONE!!

Approximately 20 rounds through it, regularly cleaned and maintained. I love her, but I don't shoot her enough to need to keep it around. It's EXTREMELY accurate,  I've owned a Remington 700, and I have to say I like this mossberg more, simply because I get the same accuracy, and it doesn't have any sketchy trigger issues like the 700's are notorious for, and all at a cheaper price. It has a fluted, free-floating barrel. It won't rust, and is made to shoot under any condition, making it an ideal NW hunting rifle. Very light, and easy to carry. I really don't want to part with it, but I need room in my safe for other firearms.
Comes with brand new harris bipod, and lazer bore sight, 3-9x40 scope & mounts. May add 120rounds of hornady/winchester ammo for the right trade/price. Call or text REDACTED for more info or pics."

Springfield XDM 40, 4.5 barell, New in box. The XDM is a polymer framed handgun with steel inserts and a mounting rail. While cosmetically looking superior to the original XD guns with its notably ""all terrain"" grip pattern, the angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. The Major Grasp Slide Serrations were modified for a better more penetrating grasp. All XDM pistols come with grip and trigger safety mechanisms, a loaded chamber indicator at the top of the gun just behind the barrel, and match grade barrels. The surface of the metal has undergone a Melonite treatment, a salt bath nitriding process which leaves a hard, corrosion-resistant surface. Unlike the previous generation of XD handguns, the XDM does not require pulling the trigger to disassemble the gun, making field stripping faster and safer."

These revolvers had a 6 inch barrel, a hard rubber grip, and were chambered for the .45 Colt round. They also had a larger trigger guard and a longer trigger. Many people have incorrectly assumed that this was to allow the revolver to be operated while wearing gloves, but in reality, the larger trigger guard and longer trigger were in response to the Model 1878's reputation for having a very hard trigger pull. The longer trigger was designed to give the user more leverage, thus reducing the perceived force required to pull the trigger. These were called ""Alaskan"" or ""Philippine"" revolvers, as they were originally intended for use in Alaska but ended up being shipped to the Philippines. This gun will be a prize for your collection or a fun toy for the range - after some action work of course. Parts should be obtainable for this gun."

With its 4 click hammer, it sounds and functions like a Colt except the Ruger has more reliable coil springs. So, if you like “period” revolvers, this is as close as you can get with a modern design. The adjustable sights make it easy to adjust for different loads without losing accuracy. The .41 Rem. Mag. cartridge can push a 200 grain bullet to 1500 fps, and makes a great hunting load for small to medium sized game. If you are into Cowboy Action Shooting and have access to a reloading press, this revolver will be good for that sport as well. Of course, there are those of us who just like to make smoke and loud noises while blasting holes in cans and this revolver excels at that, too."

The shipping alone on all these items cost me over $100.00, so I'm just looking to break even or at least make it slightly worth my while after tax and shipping so I'm not out-of-pocket any money.

There is a total of 1,860 rounds combined between .223 and 556 and they include:

.223rem - American Eagle 55gr FMJ Brass Casings - 25 boxes of 20 (500 rounds)
.223rem - Remington UMC 55gr - 8 boxes of 50 (400 rounds)
5.56 x 45mm - Independence 55gr FMJ - 3 boxes of 20 (60 rounds)
5.56 x 45mm - Federal 55gr FMJ - 5 boxes of 20 (100 rounds)
5.56 x 45mm - American Eagle 55gr FMJ - 2 boxes of 100 (200 rounds)
.223rem - Herter's 62gr (both FMJ and Hollow Point) - 30 boxes of 20 (600 rounds)

I'm asking for $1,350 for all the rounds together.  That puts me slightly ahead of the game after shipping and tax.  However, I'm willing to listen to reasonable offers but please keep in mind that I've been inside a Dunham's, a Dick's Sporting Goods, a Walmart, a Bass Pro Shop, a Gander Mountain, and a Cabela's all in the past 3-days and I know what's on the shelf, I know what limits they put on ammo purchases, and I know the prices that they are actually selling these for on the shelf.  So please don't use this as an opportunity to low-ball me with a $500 offer or a ""I only pay 20-cents per round"" email.  Go sell crazy somewhere else, we're all full here.

With the exception of the Herter's, all ammo is in reloadable brass cases and is brand new from the manufacturer less than 30 days ago.  All the non-Herter's ammunition pass the ""magnet test"" for use at an indoor range.  I have shot the Herter's quiet a lot through my AR-15 and it's just as accurate as the rest (and maybe more accurate than the American Eagle at longer distances) but the steel core prevents indoor shooting of those rounds.

I *WILL* reply to all emails. Please be patient. If you don't get an immediate reply, it's likely because I'm at work and have limited access to a computer or my phone to respond to emails.

I have other ammo available! If you see anything else in the photo you want, just ask or see my other listings. People interested in multiple calibers all at once will receive the best prices/offer from me and will be given first consideration.

I value my reputation and stand behind what I sell."

The 284 GNR works fine, but some of the shorter lighter weight 7mm bullets are hard to find these days so only preliminary testing has been done on it. As more and more 7mm bullets become available I will be doing more testing on it. The 307 GNR will be a bit more power than the 300 GNR plus you don't have to do the cutting, trimming and such that is required on the 300 GNR. The downside is that a Ruger stretch frame revolver is required for the conversion. The good thing is that the Ruger 357 Maximum revolvers are easier to get and cheaper than in recent past."
