This “Black Beauty is a Must have for Remington Nylon 66 collectors/enthusiasts.

The CBC (Cia Brasileire Cartuchos, Brazilian Cartridge Company) founded in 1926 is today one of the largest ammunition manufacturers in the world, imported this model rifle through F.I.E (Firearms Import and Export Corporation) of Miami, Florida from the late 1980s to 1990. In the 1930s Remington Arms owned interest in CBC and with the help of Remington’s engineering and production personnel they manufactured Remington firearms for the Brazilian market. In 1981 the Brazilian government nationalized CBC doing away with Remington’s interest in CBC. This new nationalized company was left with the industrial tooling and knowledge that enabled them to make a copy/clone of the Remington Nylon 66. The CBC GR-8 “Black Beauty” was the result.

The Original CBC blue finish is Excellent with some light handling marks and scattered very light discoloration, freckling. The Plastic/Nylon Black stock is near Perfect with only a few Very, very light storage/handling marks. The Nylon stock checkering is still very sharp. The bolt face, feed ramp, chamber and magazine feed tube are Exceptionally clean. The bore is Very bright and the rifling is sharp, showing few signs of being fired. This “Black Beauty” has the Original fully adjustable rear sight, note the large windage adjustment knob found mostly on the earlier Remington Nylon models along with a “Shark Fin” front sight. These CBC “Black Beauty” rifles are Rarely Found in this High Condition. Chambered for .22 Long Rifle, Semi-automatic, with a 19 5/8” Ordinance steel barrel. These rifles have a Unique butt-stock, tube feed, magazine with a total capacity of 14 +1 .22 LR rounds. These Nylon 66 and the replica rifles are well known for their Performance, Accuracy and Flawless function. The Nylon 66 rifle is considered by many to be the Finest .22 caliber, semi-automatic rifle, Remington ever made. A Rarely found, CBC “GR-8 Black Beauty” Remington Nylon 66 replica Long Rifle, semi-automatic rifle that is a Must have for your collection of Nylon 66 rifles. The total production of the Brazilian CBC was only 200,000. This rifle's serial number is GR 50999 and is in 95+% condition.

This rifle has never been fired, which has been really tough for me, considering it’s the most bad ass sniper rifle I have ever put together. You need balls the size of church bells to carry this gun to the field. This rifle may not be for everyone, side effects may include higher testosterone levels, more chest hair, grilling raw meat on a wood fire, patriotism, lots of woman trying to crawl into your bedroom window, being promoted at work, freedom, pouring whiskey on your cereal, and witty James Bond one liners. You will, for the first time, begin to understand the Constitution of the United States and feel the hand of the founding fathers rest on your battle scarred shoulder in approval as the recoil from a .308 caliber hunk of lead greatness beats the wimp out of you, and blows through the engine block of that sissy Prius being driven by Michael Moore and his ISIS friends armed with their pathetic stamped steel abortion of a firearm. If you want precision, firepower, and pure testosterone wrapped a glorious blanket of aluminum perfection then look no further. If you would rather show up at the range sporting your pretty pink .380 that your wife taught you to shoot then just keep scrolling buddy because this masterpiece of modern engineering is too much for your tiny liberal brain to comprehend. You might as well go join your other vegan hippy friends at the democratic national convention. This rifle understands you, and as you take command of the custom aluminum forged Remington 700 bolt knob, you become more and more aligned as one with the patriots of old, the Marines of Tunn tavern, and Chesty Puller himself smiles down on you from heaven’s gates of pearl and concertina wire. You will piss napalm. You won't need to take protein shakes anymore because your muscles are already exploding from your new all-bacon diet cooked from the 800 lb wild boar that you just killed with your bare hands. The Magpul PRS stock is a sturdy adjustable polymer construction and the rubber Hogue grip on this black beauty ensures you get a firm grasp with your blood soaked fingers. Is it made of light weight recycled plastic? No, it’s heavy barrel, because you need to weed out the weak pansies on your hunting trips that whine about the “cold” weather or complain about the “land mines”. This marvel of American innovation eats terrorists for breakfast. If you'd rather a foreign made firearm then call me, and I will send you a bottle of pepper spray instead that you can carry inside your flower print panties. And forget conceal carrying. This gun was not meant to be pampered or concealed but rather to expose those lesser men at the range that have already succumbed to allowing their wives to make the purchasing decisions in their house. How sad. But you won't be one of those ""men"". You'll be the reincarnated Carlos Hathcock, back from the dead, honing his skills on wild bison of the Great Plains and amber waves of grain. Are you really going to let your wife stand in the way of your 2nd amendment rights that so many men died defending in World War II? Of course not. You and I understand that the smell of gunpowder in the morning gives you more of a kick than her mocha latte frappachino ever could. Buried deep with the primal instincts of every man's gut, lives a fire than cannot be quenched with a thousand video games and as you unleash your inner Rambo and bond your itchy trigger finger with her gorgeous display of USA craftsmanship forged from the Hammer of Thor himself, your man points increase 10 fold. The Harris engineering bipod will hold your death machine securely on atop your red white and blue zodiac vessel during nighttime amphibious assaults. The scope is not included because, well, you wouldn't want me telling your mistress what dress to wear now would you? However, if a 6-24x50 illuminated Rangefinder reticule satisfies your lust to reach out and touch that target at 1000 yards well then message me and I'm sure I can accommodate you. If you feel like you’re are interested in it, but aren't a serious buyer because you want to ""sleep on it"", then do me a favor and wait until your balls drop before you send me your pre-pubescent pleas to lower the price. The price is as firm as my... well its really firm, let’s just say that. You won't pay any extra taxes or fees on this rifle because I am not a communist. Shipping is free for my fellow marines. If you don't think that's fair then go write your liberal senator. If you require shipping then I will insure that this metal merchant of destruction is mailed to an FFL near to your house. If you do not have a gun store near your house, then you are likely a socialist PETA member from California and I cannot help you. I reside in Kennesaw, GA where the law requires that every male head of the household own a firearm. *bald eagle screeches in background*. Oorah. Yut. Echo 5 Romeo over and out.

If you know anything about pistols you'll know it gets expensive fast With a sig brace and everything.
With just the flashlight, scope, sig brace and mags I spent $489.74.
So really you're getting the AR pistol for $400. Which is good for a 10.5 barrel. Building the upper was close to $450.

It has had about 100 rounds through it with no failures. It has been cleaned and lubed after every time at the range. 

It is a great little handgun but I am looking to change to 9mm

The gen 2 LCP has a shorter and lighter trigger pull and more pronounced iron sights. Both are a huge improvement over gen 1. 

Mods: 
B-T Premium Stainless Guide Rod. The factory steel guide rod gets chewed up by the recoil springs and becomes gritty. B-T stainless guide rods are butter smooth (factory rod included)

Wolff 13 lb recoil spring set. Greatly reduces recoil on this small gun over the factory 9 lb springs. (factory springs included)

Extras:
1 extra Ruger 6 round magazine with pinky extension 

Outbags IWB leather holster with room for laser. I planned to put a Viridian green laser on this gun but didn't end up buying one.

49 rounds of Precision One premium defense ammo. 90 grain hollow point Hornady XTP bullets. These have been tested as one of the best preforming and most consistent defense load for .380 pocket pistols. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOwCXXpEP50

50 rounds of Precision One premium FMJ ammo. 100 grain flat nose full metal jacket. Fantastic target ammo or if you want to carry hard ball ammo.

20 rounds Winchester Defend JHP low recoil defense ammo. 95 grain jacketed hollow point.

I've dated the manufacture date to 1954, but I could be wrong.

I've fired only 20 rounds through this shotgun. The bolt is smooth, the firing pin is strong, and the action is great. The finish is really amazing to be this old which makes me think it was redone at one point. I also believe that the barrel was shortened, but there is a front bead sight on it.

Here is what I do know.... It was sold to me as a Mauser in .308 about 10 years ago.  I put a box of modern .308 through it and it was silky smooth and accurate.  I replaced the sight with a Mojo peep sight. No don't have the original.  Markings on the action say ""Waffenfabrik Steyr Austria"".  On the top, it reads ""Modelo 1912-61 NATO"".  Barrel is stamped ""M12 .308"".  The stock is dinged and dented.  Looks like there might have been a cleaning rod up front, but isn't there now.  The action is slick as can be, the barrel is clean, and it shoots like a champ.  Great for a throw around camp gun.  I used it as a back-up at Michigan deer camp a few years ago, but the weather was great, so it never left the cabin.  This isn't a flip, it's a safe clean-out.

The DPMS Panther LR-308T ""NIB"" is the tactical carbine. Compared to the LR-308 and LR-308B, the 308T's  Hbar barrel and shorter overall length made this rifle a favorite amongst hunters and law-enforcement alike. The LR-308T has a button-rifled 16"" 4140 Chromemoly heavy barrel with a 6 grooves and a 1 in 10"" twist. Like all DPMS Panther rifles, the LR-308 is built around a reliable gas-operated rotating bolt and an 8620 steel bolt carrier. The upper and lower receivers are made of 7075-T6 aircraft aluminum. The upper receiver is extruded from 6066-T6 aluminum and features a snag-free design and a smooth-side look with no dust cover, no shell deflector and no forward assist as well as a Picatinny rail for easy scope-mounting. The lower receiver is milled from a solid billet of 6061-T6 with a integral trigger guard, a standard AR-15 trigger group, and an aluminum magazine release button. The stock is a standard A2 black Zytel Mil Spec with trap door assembly and the handguards are carbine-length, free-float tube. 20-round magazine. Lever safety."

 BARREL STEEL
Utilizing independently certified 11595E Mil-Spec barrel steel, are more durable than typical commercial barrels and specced to perform under heavy use in high-threat environments in extreme temperature conditions.

BARREL TESTING AND INSPECTION
Every chrome lined BCM® barrel is subjected to the Mil-Spec HPT(High Pressure Test) and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface, guaranteeing a more durable weapon.

BARREL PROFILE
11595E.
Every BCM® barrel uses the same Independently Certified Mil-Spec 11595E Barrel Steel (CMV) used in the USGI M16 family of rifles. Built to perform in extreme environments, BCM® barrels are stronger and more durable than typical commercial barrels, thanks to high concentrations of carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy.

HPT AND MPI
BCM® barrels also undergo a M197 HPT (High-Pressure Test), commonly referred to as a proof load, rating each barrel for 70,000 psi. This hardening is followed by a MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspection) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface, with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 in the current Military-Specification.

MID-LENGTH GAS SYSTEM
Mid-length systems deliver the same compact size of a carbine, with less overpressure and recoil for a smoother running platform with more agile weapon control. The mid-length system also allows for a longer hand guard and by extension, a longer iron sight radius for improved accuracy when engaging with iron sights.

CHROME BORE AND CHAMBER
A chrome lined bore and chamber is now a worldwide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resists against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Comes with steel magpul back up iron sights (MBUS PRO), 3 30 round aluminum GI magazines, and 2 30 round polymer SwampFox magazines."

Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome.

Their melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Their melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ±.001"" and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved. Here is a link to a video about the Huldra Mark IV 5.56x45 Carbine base rifle: www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5UbofiNats  

Will meet somewhere public like shooting range for transaction. I will also be doing a bill of sale and require to see a drivers license (CCL preferred if you have one) for proof of identity and credibility."

This Israeli Bazooka would make a great addition to any firearms collection.  Comes with blast shield, working trigger and hammer, and folds in half!  The built in mono-pod extends to give you better leverage while laying down.  Rotating flip sights give you ranges of up to 400 meters.  It has been made inoperable of course and has a hole the size of a base ball on the right side as well a metal post welded inside.  It is still a great collectors item and would look awesome hanging above the fireplace or in the man-cave.  Also would be cool as a movie prop or reproduction warfare piece.

Price is $750.  Pretty firm on that as these are online running at about $1200  May consider trades feel free to ask.

The Tactical DS (Double Stack) ofers everything the Tactical Lite does, except with a steel frame. The diference of its steel frame feels heavier in the hand and the felt recoil is subdued. Double stack, higher capacity magazines keep you shooting longer and reloading less, while its overall design is easily controlled with a palmable grip.

I'm a better shot with a bolt gun so I'm testing the waters here. 

If you know larue and the OBR they basically sell themselves (although I did have one helpful arms list reader inform me he could get an AR10 for $1000 so I should drop my price...).
The next owner can decide how they'd like to customize it., as it takes commonly available AR15 and AR10 parts.  The original A2 muzzle device will be reinstalled for sale.  Bipod not included, but you'll get the dillo dust and goodies.

 this dates between mid 50's to early 60's I remember my step dad saying he had this when he met my mom in 1964.
 the fly rods condition is excellent just needs your reel !!!
 the original canvass bag to hold the rod pieces has long been gone so is the original container to hold them.
 but the rod has been stored in round PVC tube for years. I've had this since 1994 put away !!!

Built specifically for hunting at night (where legal), the MEOPTA MeoStar R1 3-12x56 Rifle Scope, Z-Plex Reticle (706570) is the ultimate low light hunting scope.

The MeoStar R1 riflescope features a massive 56mm objective lens and a premium grade 30mm optics package that is fully multi-coated with MeoBrite 550 Ion Assisted lens coatings. The MB550 coatings deliver an industry leading light transmission of 99.8% per lens surface.

Precision MeoTrack positive click-stop windage and elevation turrets are 1/4"" @ 100 yards finger adjustable. Fast focus eyepiece allows quick and easy adjustment for sharp, crisp imaging and precise reticle placement on your target.

The MeoStar R1 series features a one-piece, aircraft grade aluminum alloy 30mm main tube, which is CNC machined from a single billet and ""ELOX"" anodized for an incredibly durable, scratch resistant, non-reflective matte finish.

Finally, first focal plane reticle placement rounds out the package making this scope particularly well suited for hunting in extreme low light conditions. As late afternoon gradually fades to darkness, simply increase the magnification as needed to locate the reticle on your target's vitals for a quick, clean harvest.

The MeoStar R1 3-12x56 Riflescope is nitrogen purged and sealed for a lifetime of waterproof, fogproof and shockproof reliability. The riflescope is covered by Meopta's North American Lifetime Transferable Warranty."
