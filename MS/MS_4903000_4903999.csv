I bought this for my 45c, but then decided the NVG route was much too expensive for me at this point in life, so my loss is your gain. These are no longer being made and the IR version is extremely difficult to find.

Selling to get into a ruger LCR or similar poly revolver, just trying something different. 

2 factory magazines included.

This pistol is black but I had coated it in early 2015 to desert tan. After a few hundred rounds I got bored of the tan and removed it (many many hours of cleaning) so you may see some fragments of tan on the interior frame.

This gun has been fully stripped down and cleaned numerous times (full bench strip, not just field strip). I would estimate only about 400 rounds through this pistol."

It has had less then 100 rounds through it and is basically a new gun. Since buying it, it has had an OD green magpul moe kit installed. This will also come with 2 OD green Pmags and OD green carrying case (as seen in pic).

THIS IS PRICED TO SELL!! I would love to keep it but I need the money.
Must have a GA carry permit that I can see.

email me or text me at 5eight5 330 one336

The original build was as follows:

â¢M15SA lower receiver (LRB ARMS) made from aircraft grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging same as currently used by US military, with 16"" inch M4 contour barrel and A3 Upper receiver

â¢M4 Feed Ramp barrel extension

â¢1-9"" twist, 6 grooves, right hand twist

â¢5.56mm chamber (shoot either 5.56mm or .223)

â¢11595E Barrel steel Manganese Phosphate finish barrel

â¢This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer

â¢The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break

â¢It sports M4 contour and length handguards with full heat shields, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function

â¢The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32

â¢The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel

â¢This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection

â¢These barrels are of Mil-spec M4 contour (.750 under the front sight base) complete with the M203 groove in the front

â¢This contour is the perfect balance between light weight, heat dissipation, and accuracy

â¢The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist

â¢The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights

â¢The barrel is mounted on a A3 upper receiver with built in carry handle made from certified forgings, hardcoat anodized IAW, with nickel acetate seal, as per the Mil-spec

â¢This upper has the newest Mil-spec A3 adjustable sights that feature finger adjustable elevation to 800 meters and more than 30 minutes of windage adjustment at 1/2 MOA per click

â¢The upper features a forward assist and hinged ejection port cover

â¢The buttstock tube is the mil spec thickness (1.145"" OD) M4 buttstock (not the cheaper carbine buttstock)

This gun was purchased in September, and has seen less than 200 rounds.  It has functioned perfectly and I hate to part with it.

Included are three mags, 2 holters (1 kydex concealment holster from Blackpoint [$89 new] and 1 holster from Springfield), 3 Springfield magazines, a cleaning rod, a mag pouch, a hard case, a soft range bag, the 19111, and a Surefire X300 Ultra in Tan.

Mainly interested in selling right now instead of trading but would consider trades.  Email or text. REDACTED
Info regarding rifle:
Kel-Tec CMR-30 Rifle is chambered for the .22WMR cartridge (22 Magnum). The design is a rifle version of the popular Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol. The same 30 round magazines are used. The single action trigger mechanism, bolt stop, ambidextrous safety levers, and mag catch are also identical. The CMR-30 rifle includes a collapsible stock and the 16â barrel is threaded 1/2â-28 to accept many different muzzle attachments. The multi-position collapsible stock allows for a short overall length of 22.7â with the stock collapsed, and 30.6â when extended. The long top picatinny rail will accept a multitude of different optics, and the removable under picatinny rail is included. The ambidextrous operating handles are non-reciprocating and latch in the forward position. The stock latch lever is also ambidextrous and located just in front of the trigger guard. An integral sling loop is included near the rear of the grip, on both sides.

The CMR-30 is constructed of hard-coat anodized aluminum for the upper assembly and rails and houses the steel barrel. The collapsible stock is made with aluminum stock rods, and a nylon butt plate. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum. The bolt assembly houses a captive recoil spring assembly. MagpulÂ® flip-up sights included.

The extensive use of aluminum, and a lock time lower than most bolt action rifles makes the CMR-30 a very accurate rifle.

As with every North American Arms Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber.

It also has a second safety feature with the hammer puled back to the first click, (see picture #one) this keeps the hammer away from the cartridge.

The original half-way notch is the best safety feature."

These muskets were originally tubelock weapons, and were converted to percussion cap upon their arrival to the U.S. - mostly imported by the North, the South managed to get their hands on a few. This musket is interesting in that it was not converted for a musket cap, as would have been the standard. Rather, it is fitted for a number 11 cap. This implies a few things. One, that it was a civilian conversion, or two, that it was a Confederate conversion. Civilian is the more likely scenario, but there is no way to be certain.

The musket is in .70 caliber and is smoothbore. Everything works. The hammer cocks back and comes down strong. The musket can be fired, but I do not recommend it. I fired it around ten times with a very light charge of 45 grains, and it does shoot. However, there is a gap somewhere in the lock where some gas escapes out of the bottom. Not enough to be dangerous (again, I fired it like this without incident), but enough for me to recommend against firing it.

The musket is dated 1853. There are unit/regiment markings on the buttplate and tang, but I do not know if they refer to Austrian or American military.
Asking $450. Willing to negotiate to a certain extent."

The RemingtonÂ® R-25 Semi-Auto Rifle is built on the proven AR-10 platform, using the direct-impingement gas system, where gas is ported down a tube into the action to cycle the rotary bolt locking mechanism. The lack of an operating rod and piston allows the barrel to be free-floated, greatly improving inherent accuracy. Movement of the bolt carrier in-line with the bore, and the recoil spring inside the stock reduces recoil and muzzle jump considerably, allowing for rapid follow up shots at multiple targets or running game. The Model R-25's operation controls, including the bolt hold open/release, mag release, and forward assist, are the same as those of AR semi-automatic rifles. The Remington R-25 has a 20"" fluted barrel that reduces weight and enhances heat dissipation. Both upper and lower are machined from rugged aluminum forgings, and a machined aluminum fore-end tube surrounds the free-floated barrel. A receiver-length Picatinny rail allows the attachment of AR tactical sights, or hunting scopes. A crisp, single-stage trigger comes from the factory set at 4-1/2 to 5 lbs. The Remington R-25 Semi-Auto Rifle comes with a 4-round magazine, and is compatible with aftermarket DPMS 308 Win-type magazines of greater capacity. Includes front and rear sling swivels. Made in USA.

I used the heat method to reduce the grip, I rounded some of the edges on the frame, undercut the trigger guard, re-contoured the the finger grooves, and molded the factory 4th gen beavertail. Notice in the pictures that I got the back of the grip a little too hot and bubbled it a bit - didn't burn through and it still seems plenty strong...mags drop free and no issues with the magwell structure. I didn't finish molding the beavertail but its plastic welded on very strongly and just needs to be finished off with a skim coat of acraglass or simply more sanding. This frame can be saved, just needs finished. Includes a factory lower parts (locking block, trigger group, slide release, etc.) Again, this gun has never been fired. Must have CPL or pistol purchase permit.

And yes I realize the scope is very entry level, but it works.Also I don't have to sell it, so cash talks, B.S. walks! So far all I've gotten is B.S.!"
