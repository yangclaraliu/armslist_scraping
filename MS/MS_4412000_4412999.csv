The trigger guard was relocated next to the mag latch, and a G2 customized trigger group (3.5 1b. trigger pull) was and SAW military style pistol grip was installed.

Gun was then coated in GUN-KOTE™ metal coating & finish. Stock is an Tapco Intrafuse Side folding stock. The USA mfg. aluminum quad-rail forearm is lightweight, precision machined from high strength aluminum alloy, features a hard matte black anodized finish and black rubber rail guards.

The rail mount locking system is designed to withstand all recoil. Has a Sunoptics red laser and tactical light, and a Barsca Multi-recticle electro sight.

The Intrafuse polymer vertical foregrip is ultra compact and light weight. The Raptor Claw vented barrel shroud is designed to keep your barrel cool plus it has a built in muzzle break to help reduce recoil. Also, it just happens to have that look- the one that makes everyone’s head turn when they see it! The Raptor Claw screws onto the factory threads of the Saiga-12, and removes quickly with no tools required.

A premium custom gas adjustment system was installed. This allows you to shoot BOTH the less expensive 2¾” game loads and 3” magnum shells with just a click of the external adjustment knob. INCLUDES One 20 round Promag drum, Three Promag 10rd magazines, One Original 5rd magazine,

I've shot roughly 300 rounds through this gun with ZERO MALFUNCTIONS. This gun is the perfect SHTF weapon.

This WASR 10/63 is not one of the cheap clones that are being sold right now. It is stamped 1967 and has the CUGIR ARSENAL triangle-arrow marking. It also has matching serial numbers on the reciever. It has the nice wood furniture, not the cheap glossy stuff they put on the clones. The front sight is not canted. It has a G2 Tapco trigger and side scope mounts. The only modification I made to it is to add a Hogue grip.   

It is barely broken in with less than 400 rounds and has been a ""safe queen"" for the MOST part. I kept it well oiled and clean. I've added a few things to give this AK the authentic look as possible, from the bayonet to the buttstock cleaning kit. I've always cleaned it after shooting and never torture-tested it. 

Included in this deal:

01 WASR 10-63 with matching serial numbers. It is stamped with the rare ""arrow triangle"" indicating CUGIR ARSENAL. It also has the side scope mounts.

Satin Nickel brushed stainless finish is the rarest and hardest to find. 1 magazine has the same finish for its baseplate which Desert Eagle doesn't offer anymore. Made in Israel. Not the US models. Much more desirable.  Not to be mistaken for the chrome plated finish.  This finish will last if you decide to shoot it a lot and not just use as a coffee table piece. Will come with over $200 worth of Hornady XTP ammo. $1350 cash for package  firm on that, trade value to me would be 1650.00 easy with being made in Israel, the brushed Satin Nickel finish, excellent condition. $200 worth of ammo included custom grips, and the value of the older models from Israel rising. Very accurate. Have 2 of them so selling the nice one. Can customize it for hunting or just a BA shooter. 
Had some things come up so need to sell the gun. Pricedto sale fast. $200 in ammo with pistol. Shoot it and if you can wait to sell it make some money. Has custom hand grips $160. Different engraving each side Text or email if interested 719-237 one one one 6, can send more pics as well. 

Only traded I would even possibly consider are handguns. Higher end ones HK, Sig, rarer Glocks 2 for 1 or customized ones, plus cash. Full size only as I have gorilla mitts haha.

Its in excellent shape, has beatiful wood and bluing, and a 26"" heavy barrel. Great target or varmint gun. Not too heavy as a walking varmint gun either.

It includes the gun itself, the timney trigger, and the scope base. The scope shown in it is not included, though i can include a nikon prostaff 3-9 x 40 and rings that is already on the gun and zero'd for and additional $190.

The ONLY trades i would be interested in is something chambered in 6.5 creedmore or 260 Remington, preferably a Tikka T3 CTR, or a high end scope (nightforce SHV or Leupold mark series).  I can add cash if necessary.

It is a magnificent handgun and fires flawlessly

The (very bright) sights are TruGlo Night sights. 
The grips are Hogue G10 Piranhas
Blackhawk Serpa Holster
Three Mecgar magazines

As you can see in the pics, there is some holster wear on the barrel.

I'm selling (or trading) it for two reasons: I have found that I am a Glock guy. 
I have owned a number of handguns.....and I shoot regularly. And I currently have several Glocks. So I bought the Sig in hopes that I could get into something other than a Glock. But this Sig, quite honestly, is too darn big for my hand. And that's the second reason......this P226 is very accurate and has probably a 4-4.5 trigger......no creep.....nice and crisp. But the overall pistol is just too large and heavy overall for me as I'm a small old guy (that's why I carry a weapon:). So the Glock suits me best.

So, the pistol on its own (with a couple of mags) is worth about $700....on the low side. The Hogue Piranhas were just over $100. New Night sights....$100. Serpa Holster...$50. So a total of $950.  But I don't have the original box nor manual (you can run off the manual online).....so take off $50.  Go out and buy a new stock p226 and it will cost over $1000....plus tax. So I will sell mine for $850 and you will have a fabulous pistol. But you'd better be larger guy to handle it well.

Email me for more pics or info.

I will also consider trades. I like All Glocks in 40 cal. Or the new Glock 380. I also would consider an AR 10, quality optics."

Weight - 9.8 oz.In August of 1976, Mark Hazen started his career as a custom knife maker. At that time, he could not afford to purchase a custom knife, so he decided to make his own. That's when it all began. Initially, Mark made knives for his friends and eventually, his creative talent was sought after by customers throughout the USA. After 30 years as a renowned knife maker, Mark decided to retire in 2007. On September 23, 2013, he received a call from Colonel Jack Tobin, president of The Special Forces Association at Fort Bragg, NC. While at an estate auction preview, Colonel Tobin saw a knife which he felt would be perfect for Special Forces active duty personnel, as well as the members of the association. Mark came out of retirement and began his journey by making a knife in honor of his fallen friend, MSG Robert Horrigan, a Special Forces Operator stationed at Fort Bragg, NC.Mark Hazen, who mastered the art of knife making over the past 30 years, is reintroducing classic old world craftsmanship in new and innovative designs. Each knife is hand made without the use of jigs. The blade and edge geometry has been engineered into each model to ensure optimum performance for its intended use. The ergonomically designed handles are specifically contoured to give a comfortable and confident grip. Each Hazen knife is uniquely crafted and well suited for all military and law enforcement personnel, sportsmen and the discriminating collector.All the knives produced at Hazen Knives go through a 3-phase testing process to ensure that each knife meets uncompromising quality standards. Each batch of steel is tested since all are not exactly the same. One knife is made from each new batch and is rigorously tested by chopping through a 2X4 piece of lumber and cleanly slicing through a piece of 20 lb. paper. If the hardness and edge retention meet the standards of phase one, the cutting test, then the testing continues to phase two, the comfort test and phase three, the fit and finish test.Come check this knife out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte. Give me a call @ 980-237-eight9eight1 if you have any questions. Shipping can be arranged for $10.

I bought this new from bimart in 08. It has an unknown round count but Id guess 3000 or less on the receiver and internals.  I used this mainly to host a bull barrel with hogue stock but sold those off and brought it back to stock with a new take-off barrel under 525 rounds ago.  The barrel band was silver but is kryloned semi gloss black.  Stock has holes for sling swivels.  Includes factory 10 round magazine.

Comes with four mags and the gun case. This is a fantastic handgun that is comfortable, accurate, a blast to shoot, and one of the only handguns to pass NATO inspections and tests. Look up reviews for this pistol and see for yourself. This is an all steel gun but considered compact size. I have carried it as my daily carry gun but is a lot easier in the winter or for a bigger framed person. It's just slightly too big for me because I'm pretty skinny. But all in all it's definitely concealable especially for a full size pistol that you can get all fingers on. Please no trades....cash only. Thank you and serious buyers only. Would like to see a conceal and carry permit if you have one, if not- an Ohio drivers license. Since it's a pistol it would make me feel better. Prefer texts at 6I4-2o2-3229. I work a swing shift so I will get back to you as soon as it can. Text for more pictures if interested.  Thanks for looking!"

Weight - 12.8 oz.In August of 1976, Mark Hazen started his career as a custom knife maker. At that time, he could not afford to purchase a custom knife, so he decided to make his own. That's when it all began. Initially, Mark made knives for his friends and eventually, his creative talent was sought after by customers throughout the USA. After 30 years as a renowned knife maker, Mark decided to retire in 2007. On September 23, 2013, he received a call from Colonel Jack Tobin, president of The Special Forces Association at Fort Bragg, NC. While at an estate auction preview, Colonel Tobin saw a knife which he felt would be perfect for Special Forces active duty personnel, as well as the members of the association. Mark came out of retirement and began his journey by making a knife in honor of his fallen friend, MSG Robert Horrigan, a Special Forces Operator stationed at Fort Bragg, NC.Mark Hazen, who mastered the art of knife making over the past 30 years, is reintroducing classic old world craftsmanship in new and innovative designs. Each knife is hand made without the use of jigs. The blade and edge geometry has been engineered into each model to ensure optimum performance for its intended use. The ergonomically designed handles are specifically contoured to give a comfortable and confident grip. Each Hazen knife is uniquely crafted and well suited for all military and law enforcement personnel, sportsmen and the discriminating collector.All the knives produced at Hazen Knives go through a 3-phase testing process to ensure that each knife meets uncompromising quality standards. Each batch of steel is tested since all are not exactly the same. One knife is made from each new batch and is rigorously tested by chopping through a 2X4 piece of lumber and cleanly slicing through a piece of 20 lb. paper. If the hardness and edge retention meet the standards of phase one, the cutting test, then the testing continues to phase two, the comfort test and phase three, the fit and finish test.Come check this knife out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte.
