Fingernail test shows a nice hard bullet that is very hard to mark with a great job on the lubing and casting. Only $50 so another great deal for local pick-up.  I do not respond to 1st time emails due to spam. If you have any questions or want to purchase, email your phone number and I will call you with mine. Thanksp.s. bcn04K- thanks for your interest and yes I still have the bullets, if you are not a bot or tire kicker, email your phone number and we will have a conversation."

These rifles are rare as they were only produced for a couple years.  With an 18"" ported barrel, this is a great setup for hunting, and could be a very nice host for some customizing.  The porting reduces the recoil & increase the speed of a follow up shot.  This a very comfortable rifle to carry and shoot.  

This rifle had the stocks refinished so they have a nice thin profile (also weight reduction).  The wood on this rifle is gorgeous. There is a light scratch on the right side of the receiver & significant scratch/ding on the left side of the receiver.  Otherwise this rifle is flawless & an amazing shooter."

This is a solid, full size, 9mm pistol that you can always depend on. It has a stainless slide and an alloy frame. There is a slight rattle in the slide, as these pistols were apt to get, but it is still accurate and reliable. Anyone who has experience with this gun knows that it will probably be reliable for ever. This model has no safety. It does have a hammer release switch.

I have changed the standard grip panels out for a Hogue ruberized, wrap around grip with finger grooves. The old grip panels are included in case you want to put them back on.

I can not say how many rounds have been through the gun. It was my dad's before I got it. But as I mentioned, it is solid, reliable and firing perfectly.

I am including 2 - 10 round magazines, 2 - 15 round magazines and 2 - 17 round magazines.

The Walther Soft Coil ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.
The CCP’s Soft Coil™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.
With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster.
The CCP comes in Stainless Steel and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation.
This single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface.
Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide.
Specifications:
- Operation: Gas Delayed Blowback- Caliber: 9mm- Finish Color: Stainless Steel- Barrel Length: 3.54""- Trigger Pull: SA 5.5 lbs- Trigger Travel: 0.27""- Capacity: 8 rounds- Overall Length: 6.41""- Height: 5.12""- Width: 1.18""- Weight(mag empty): 1.39 lbs

Here you have it, a simply beautiful Springfield Armory M1 Garand with a 6 Digit Serial ( November 1942 ) as well as being a Letterkenny Army Depot Build. I cannot describe how nice this rifle is as pictures will only do it justice.

It has a consistant like new Silver Finish ( only LEADs have this finish ) on all the parts, a 10-65 New USGI Barrel (1/1) on gauges and All S-A parts to inlcude many are ""Correct"" for the serial #. The Stock is a USGI and has been finished to a ""SHOW"" room quality and is simply unreal.  This rifle is ""HIGHLY"" Collectable as a low serial, the LEAD work and the overall Fit, Finish and parts combination.

This rifle is ready for the range or the safe and will suit either the collector or investor. I will text photos and you are welcome to look at the rifle per appointment.

I AM NOT considering any trades and will require a VA DL for Military or Civilians alike.

The rifle comes with a Hard Case, Certificate, Books, Sling and is a CMP Derived rifle.

The Absolute, Bottom dollar, No less than non-neg price for this rifle is $1350 and is priced to move. Sorry, I simply want to avoid the pleasure of negotiating. It is valued over $1500 as it sits. 

If you ever wanted a USGI M1 Garand with a WW2 history but in perfect like new condition, This is it. Has been sitting for the last 50 years. These rifles just do not come this nice and is as rare as they come.

Please only serious inquires only.

I will post pics soon and can text some to those I speak with.

This is a higher quality build than a common WASR10, and as its says, decked out with accessories.  This is the best shooting AK I have ever owned, the trigger is MUCH smoother than my Daniel Defense AR's trigger.  And with the muzzle brake attached, recoil is seriously as light as an AR.  Sling attachments for ""clip"", ""quick detach"", and ""strap"" are all present. It is also equipped with a Krebbs safety lever, which is my favorite part on the gun.  It is so much easier to manipulate than a standard AK safety that you can operate is with your trigger finger up and down!  This changes everything about the AK, now you can go from safe to fire as quick as an AR.  Gun is showing some signs of wear, but no mechanical problems at all.  

Gun accessories includes:
-KREBBS SAFETY! 
-6 30rd magazines
-Russian style muzzle brake device
-Free floating quad rail system
-Magpul RVG vertical grip
-Magpul AK pistol grip with storage compartment
-Dual sided receiver plate sling clip.
-6 position collapsible butt-stock, with attachment points for quick-detach or strap style slings.

1. Remington 700 tactical 308 20"" heavy barrel
I paid $650 for this rifle yesterday. BUT, it has a high quality ""sniper"" scope I got from Ace Hardware, a set of Weaver rings from the firearms expert at Walmart, and a Champion Bi-pod I got in the tactical section of the same Walmart. I fired 150 grn Remington ammo, which I also got from Walmart, and it shot .025 groups at 1500 yards.
(Chris Kyle was my neighbor and showed me what was up)
Fair price on this is $3000 dollars, or trade for just about anything. Youre gonna have to add a lot of guns and maybe cash because this thing is very rare and special.

2. PSA AR15:  I got this for $599 new, but I added a USMC tactical clamp in rail from Walmart, a UTG flashlight and laser, and a stock from Walmart. Man that guy really knows his stuff. The rail is endorsed by the USMC, so it makes the AR way more accurate and consistent. I also put a Centerpointe Scope on it and it is very high clarity and quality. I shot this for test function only and it shot in the same hole, rapid fire, at 200 yards. YOU JUST CANT BEAT THIS LEVEL OF QUALITY. MY GUNS ARE SERIOUS QUALITY AND TOTALLY ARE WORTH 17 TIMES RETAIL.

I GOTTA GO I JUST WENT ""PRESTIGE"" LEVEL X250 ON CALL OF DUTY IN MY MOTHERS BASEMENT. I WOULD PREFER TO  SELL THESE CASH BECAUSE I AM OUT OF MONEY AND I NEED TO GO TO THE PIGGLY WIGGLY AND BUY SOME MORE HOT POCKETS. MAN BEING AN OPERATOR IS TOUGH WORK....................."

(3) Matching Gold Trigger Models in 20ga, 12ga, and 10ga.

BPS 20ga is 26"" Invector Barrel with 3-Chokes...Quail & Duck Engraving ($660)
- Comes with ($35) Matching Shotgun Case + ($50) 6-Boxes of 20ga Shot Shells ... FREE with Gun!

- Comes with ($35) Matching Shotgun Case + ($140) 6-Boxes of 10ga BB/BBB Magnum Shells ... FREE with Gun!

Set of (3) Special Engraved BPS Shotguns also comes with (2) nice/free Blaze Browning Caps.

It took me a few years to find and purchase all three models.  Browning no longer makes the Special Engraved Models.  My prices are easily $100-$150 less than the New BPS Shotguns (without the engraving, or the ammo, or the matching three cases)  

They are all in solid good-great condition. 20ga is near new, with under 50rds through it.  12ga was hunted with 3-4 seasons, and is really nice.  10-ga went through 2-turkey seasons (has the most wear due to a ""Safe Rub"").  They are not 100% Perfect, as they were utilized.  But...all are nice, and the (3) Matching Engravings make this a Special Set.

If you are a Browning guy, or aspire to be, this is a great set...at a very fair cost.  And without all the effort to locate the matching engraved models.  Buy all three with Ammo and Cases, for less than you can buy (3) plain models today.

If you go to Gander Mountain, they have SHELVES of these at a very reasonable price. Saw them yesterday. I noticed the .85 cent prices some people on here want to charge for a novelty round. There are many others that do the same damage, if not more. So if you want to stack up, check out Gander, Bass Pro, Dick's Sporting goods and a few other shops. You can still find these at .50 or less.

Next Up for trade / sell is my lightly used glock 27 . It says Od but it looks more tan to me . Looks good with hardly any holster wear .
Great gun . I was thinking about using it for conceal carry but I think I'm just going to stick with my 23.
Shoots like a dream , this was my first sub compact so I didn't really know what to expect but it shoots very well .
I'm in no hurry at all to sell or trade, I'm just seeing what offers I get . It uses the same magazines as the 22 or 23 making it a decent back up gun  if you're in that caliber .

Comes with 3 nine round mags ( 2 with finger extension ) , different grips , a kydex holster  and the manuals . Pictures don't don't do it justice .

The light's new in the box and I just got the P30 at the end of November. Comes with original case, manual, two mags, and the aforementioned Streamlight TLR-3 NIB with mounting hardware. I've kept it clean and in great shape. 

This is a great, almost-new gun with very little wear. The price looks pretty in-line with what I've seen, and I'm really only interested in cash or cash plus M&P9c. Thanks for looking. Oh, and valid PTP/PTC."

The SR40c is based on the same high-performance glass-filled nylon frame as those used on the popular SR9, SR9c, and SR40 pistols, offering the same, great ergonomic features, including a slim frame, short trigger reach, reversible backstrap, and ambidextrous controls. The SR40c features a through-hardened, stainless steel slide or alloy steel slide with Nitridox Pro Black finish. Though remarkably similar in size to the popular SR9c, the SR40c's custom slide design reduces recoil and slide velocity, making it more comfortable to shoot than many of its competitors. Its raked-forward front sight allows for easy removal from the holster and the rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable while the front sight is windage adjustable. Other features include an integral accessory rail, retraction grooves, an ambidextrous thumb safety and d-shaped magazine release, and a reverse backstrap. The SR40c comes standard with finger grip extension floorplates and an additional magazine. A grip extension adapter for a full-sized feel is also included. The Ruger SR40c is one of many firearms in the SR series. The SR40c is a striker-fired, compact, double-stack design. The grip is only 1.18″ thick, making it one of the thinnest double-stack handguns available. Overall it is a very easy and fun gun to shoot.Manufacturer: RugerModel: SR40cCaliber: .40 S&W"

It has about 400 rounds down the pipe. Rifling is sharp, overall condition is 90%. Has slight holster wear as it was my cc pistol for last 2 yrs. For any other specs., see google. They are sought after for their rugged reliability, durability, and concealable firepower.They are hard to come by, because nobody wants to part with theirs. Comes with 2 factory sig p245 magazines(extra mag cost me 40$)6rd single stack. I will throw in a box of Hornady critical defense rounds(cost 32$ for 20 rounds), and about 15 Winchester 200 gr fmj rounds. It has been well maintained with Powder Blast, and/or CLP after each range trip. I will sell, but would rather trade for a used, Keltec SU16b. The p245 is a very popular law enforcement back-up due to it's double action and single action function. DA pull is about 10.2lbs, and SA pull is about 3.3 lbs. Sigs are well known for their outstanding trigger in either mode. NO creep, crisp break, and very manageable recoil. This leads to faster, more accurate follow up shots. My Beretta M9 is less manageable then my p245. I am only selling/trading this because I work in a crowded environment, and over penetration with the .45acp could be a real problem. I am not nearly as comfortable with my current cc which is a .380, but I feel safety is more important than comfort. I still have my full size 1911 in the night stand, which satisfies my large caliber preference, and don't need the concealable Sig anymore. I could use a battle rifle for my wife in a manageable caliber such as the 5.56. If I don't make a trade, the cash will go to a Keltec SU16b, or other 5.56 sporting rifle.I would add up to 250$ for the right trade. Thanks for looking, and reading my rant. Max REDACTED.

- 3 Magazines ( 30rd. 7.62x39mm )
- Leather surplus sling
- Cleaning Kit
- I created a very simple and comfortable cheek guard for the wire stock ( purchased copper tube styrofoam insulation from home depot and cut to size, works very nicely )


Some information about this rifle:

- The VZ2008 is a surplus parts kit that has been assembled by Century Arms and sold online and in store by many retailers

- Although the VZ2008 looks very similar to an AK47, the only thing it shares in common is the caliber it fires, the 7.62x39mm ( Magazines are NOT interchangeable with AK47 )

- This gun is a Czechoslovakian design from the 1950's that is still in used to this day by the Czech republic as well as Slovakia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vz._58 )


Technical Information about rifle:

- It is a milled receiver that is lighter and more accurate than the AK47

- Folding wire stock makes this rifle very compact and convenient for storage and transportation

- The gun has a bolt open feature on the last round

- The handguard is made of a wood/polymer mixture and as such, after a few magazines tends to get hot. This can be easily modified by replacing the wood, or adjusting your grip closer to the magazine


Feedback:

-There are many reviews of this rifle, the VZ2008 online, and I can try and provide you with a number of different sources to read through, but a simple search on youtube for VZ2008 or a google search will bring up everyone's experience

- I can tell you that the rifle I have has been 100% reliable when I have been shooting it, and while I haven't put thousands of rounds through it, I have put over 150 rounds and not experienced one problem

**IMPORTANT** Starting after January 1st, 2013, Michigan Law regarding folding stocks on long guns has changed. This weapon was purchased after Jan 1st, 2013 and thus falls under the new legal terms for a long rifle. It meets the criteria set in the law which is the following:

- The rifle is AT LEAST 26"" in over all length WITH the stock folded or contracted And the barrel is AT LEAST 16"" in length


(^What the above means is that this firearm is considered the same as any other Long gun, and what what means is it can be sold/purchased via private buyer in similar fashion, thus why this is being posted here instead of the Handgun forum)"

The Galil is a family of Israeli small arms designed by Yisrael Galil and Yaacov Lior in the late 1960s and produced by Israel Military Industries Ltd (now Israel Weapon Industries Ltd). The rifle design borrowed heavily from the AK-47 and had a modified gas diversion system similar to the AK-47 to reduce the recoil of the rifle making it easier to fire especially in automatic mode.   The weapon system consists of a line chambered for the intermediate 5.56×45mm NATO caliber with either the M193 or SS109 ball cartridge and several models designed for use with the 7.62x51mm NATO rifle round. It is named after one of its inventors, Yisrael Galil. The Galil series of weapons is in use with military and police forces in over 25 countries.

The MAC-10 (Military Armament Corporation Model 10, officially the M-10) is a compact blowback operated machine pistol developed by Gordon Ingram in 1964.   It is chambered in either 45 ACP or 9mm.   A two-stage suppressor by Sionics, was designed for the MAC-10, which not only abated the noise created, but made it easier to control on full automatic.

Military Armament Corporation (MAC), based in Powder Springs Georgia from 1970-1976 was the first company to commercially produce the MAC Model 10 (MAC-10).This is the company started by Gordon Ingram that designed and built the first MAC.    MAC marketed a number of different weapons, but the MAC-10 (chambered in 9 mm and later in.45 ACP) and the high cyclic rate (approx. 1600 rpm) MAC-11 (chambered in .380) were its mainstays.   MAC declared bankruptcy in 1976 and went out of business. 

Military Armament Corporation in Stephenville, TX took the MAC design from the Powder Springs plant and redesigned the gun to be ""better"".  In short they redesigned the trigger mechanism, the safety, and the stock. 

RPB Industries manufactured the only semi auto open bolt variety of the M10 ever made, most were stamped ""sM10"" but a very few were made with the model stamped as ""sapM10"" (an abbreviation for semi auto pistol) These few are the only open bolt M10's which are not banned as assault weapons by the state of CA. This is a very rare variant of an extremely hard to come by pistol.

Other info: This gun has been to the range once, with 50 rounds of reloads down the pipe. Loved it so much I bought the PM40. Surprisingly low recoil and effortlessly manageable for my 6', 220 lb. frame. Lightest and smallest .40 available today. With the 5 round mag you can't even see it in a pocket.

I added the Talon grips to lower the bite of the stock block grip texture. These are rubberized and slightly textured. Amazing improvement. Also I painted the sights with reflective sight paint. Makes them stand out much better than the White bar/dot.

Comes with original box, 3pc trigger lock, cable lock, one 5 round mag, one 6 round mag, manuals, and 50 rounds of reloads.

It holds three rounds in a fixed magazine and allows one in the chamber. 
This is a great beginners rifle for anyone thinking of taking their kid hunting. I bought it this last season for my son and he wants to try a larger caliber (which I think is totally unnecessary but he is a teenager). I am selling it for what I bought it for at $300.00. 

Some details on the rifle:
- Comes with an adjustable 3 x 9 Bushnell scope that is sighted in and mounted solid. Functions beautifully.
- Additional nylon butt-stock sleeve that holds 9 rounds. 
- Padded camouflage nylon sling with sling swivels that screw/lock to the stock.
- Comes with a padded case that latches.

Everything else is stock. No ammo will be accompanying this rifle but HSMs were typically fired through it. 

My son saw it and immediately wanted it because it is a good looking gun and is a tried-and-trued staple in american arms history. I have always hunted with a model 700 and I get something every year I go out. 

There is a little rust on the end of the OUTSIDE of the muzzle but it does not hinder functionality at all. In fact, it is very easy to remedy but unnecessary so I did not do anything for it. At this price I don't see it lasting very long but I would really like to see it spark another kids interest in keeping hunting alive in Montana just like it did for my son.

The MAC-10 (Military Armament Corporation Model 10, officially the M-10) is a compact blowback operated machine pistol developed by Gordon Ingram in 1964.   It is chambered in either 45 ACP or 9mm.   A two-stage suppressor by Sonic’s was designed for the MAC-10, which not only abated the noise created, but made it easier to control on full automatic.

Military Armament Corporation (MAC), based in Powder Springs Georgia from 1970-1976 was the first company to commercially produce the MAC Model 10 (MAC-10).This is the company started by Gordon Ingram that designed and built the first MAC.    MAC marketed a number of different weapons, but the MAC-10 (chambered in 9 mm and later in.45 ACP) and the high cyclic rate (approx. 1600 rpm) MAC-11 (chambered in .380) were its mainstays.   MAC declared bankruptcy in 1976 and went out of business. 

Military Armament Corporation in Stephenville, TX took the MAC design from the Powder Springs plant and redesigned the gun to be ""better"".  In short, they redesigned the trigger mechanism, the safety, and the stock for better fit and  reliability.

My reason for posting this for trade, is that I really don't care for polymer firearms.  I bought this off a friend back in 2012 as a favor to help him out with money for car repairs.

Up for quick sale is this H&K .45 pistol with two 12 round factory magazines, factory case (newer manufacture), owner's manual, lock and dated spent cartridge casing. I don't know what to say about it because it has just lived in one of my safes since new. Since I've never used it, I apparently don't need it. As the old saying goes, my loss is your gain. I have $850 in this package and the first $675 takes it. Sorry, but I am not interested in trades at this time. If you want a new world class quality H&K pistol at a low price, here is your chance. Buyer must have valid IN ID and preferably carry permit. 

I noticed that the price where I bought it is still the same. By the time you add reasonable shipping and transfer, this exact same pistol will still cost you $850 at one of the lowest priced firearm shops on the internet http://grabagun.com/hk-usp-fs-45acp-4-41-bl-v1-2-12rd.html Now of course, if you are afraid of discount firearm places, you can still buy this exact same pistol from a very reputable online 'discount' store and only have a bit over $1000 in it by the time you receive it. Here is the place for you if that is what you prefer http://www.ableammo.com/catalog/heckler-koch-usp45-standard-dasa-pistol-wsafety-m704501a5-polymer-grip-blue-finish-sights-p-83246.html?utm_source=slickguns&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=guns&utm_campaign=slickguns

Needless to say, all I'm trying to say, and prove, is the listed price on this pistol is for a limited time for a quick sale. If you previously responded and I did not reply, I apologize as my spam filter kicked in and stopped sending emails concerning this pistol to me.  That oversight on my part has been corrected.
