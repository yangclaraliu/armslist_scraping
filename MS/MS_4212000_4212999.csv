This rifle is chambered in 5.56 nato. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."

- Less than 3"" groupings @ 50 yards tested by CZ custom

Product Description from CZ: 

The Shadow platform has been known for accuracy and the new Accu-Shadow takes it to the next level. The Accu-Bushing system holds the barrel with much more precision, enabling us to cut group sizes nearly in half. In testing, the pistols returned groups substantially less than 3″ at 50 yards (using Fiocci 124 JHP). Add to that a full complement of custom work including competition hammer, lighter springs (11 lb. recoil, 13 lb. main), thin black aluminum grips, stainless steel guide rod and polished internals.

A short-reset disconnector is used to greatly reduce trigger reset between shots, making this SA/DA trigger reset like a nicely-tuned single-action only trigger. The Accu-Shadow is topped with a fiber optic front and HAJO serrated target rear (adjustable for height, also drift adjustable for windage).

Short of a full custom pistol, it’d be difficult to find greater out-of-the-box accuracy than the Accu-Shadow can deliver.

The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators."

The MAC-10 (Military Armament Corporation Model 10, officially the M-10) is a compact blowback operated machine pistol developed by Gordon Ingram in 1964.   It is chambered in either 45 ACP or 9mm.   A two-stage suppressor by Sonic’s was designed for the MAC-10, which not only abated the noise created, but made it easier to control on full automatic.
Military Armament Corporation (MAC), based in Powder Springs Georgia from 1970-1976 was the first company to commercially produce the MAC Model 10 (MAC-10).This is the company started by Gordon Ingram that designed and built the first MAC.    MAC marketed a number of different weapons, but the MAC-10 (chambered in 9 mm and later in.45 ACP) and the high cyclic rate (approx. 1600 rpm) MAC-11 (chambered in .380) were its mainstays.   MAC declared bankruptcy in 1976 and went out of business.
 
Military Armament Corporation in Stephenville, TX took the MAC design from the Powder Springs plant and redesigned the gun to be ""better"".  In short, they redesigned the trigger mechanism, the safety, and the stock for better fit and  reliability.

The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators."

279,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4212279,For Sale:  Casio Privia PX-575R 88-Key Portable Grand Piano Keyboard,"North Columbus / Powell, Columbus, Ohio",$ 615,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 13, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hello,
I no longer play this keyboard as I now own a piano. It's 100% functional and in excellent shape; I've taken very good care of it. It comes with the keyboard, the stand and the bench (both are very well-made) as well as the necessary power adapter and a plug in pedal for sustain or dampening. I'm asking $615.00 obo, cash only. However,  as this is armslist I'm also interested in firearm related trades (handguns and rifles,  no shotguns or high point).  I can meet you at a location nearby my home on the north side of town in a public place to complete the transaction. I have included several pictures, including ones of the keyboard set up in my home as well as pictures from the internet of what this keyboard and accessories are currently selling for on amazon and ebay. The condition of the one selling for ~735 with shipping (and no accessories of any sort) on ebay looks to be in worse condition than the one I have. Below is the description from the manufacturer. Please let me know if you have any questions.

-----------------------

The PX-575R with 88 full size hammer action keys combines real piano feel and beautiful tone with Auto-accompaniment and a host of other useful features and functions. With 670 preset plus 224 user tones and 166 preset plus 16 user rhythms it's the perfect choice for everything ranging from home use to professional applications. Powerful 2-way bass reflex speakers provide high-quality professional --level sound. The PX-575R can also be connected to your computer via USB and also includes an SD card slot.

Casio PX575R Features

620 Tones include Rich Advanced Tones
A total of 400 Advanced Tones are programmed with DSP tones to make them richer and more powerful. Advanced tones like Stereo Piano and Tremolo Electric Piano enhance the Piano and Electric Piano tones to create a totally new sound. 
50 Drawbar Organ Tones
In addition to the 620 standard tones, the keyboard also includes 50 realistic drawbar organ tones. Drawbar organ tones can be controlled using nine digital drawbars. You can also select percussion or key click, and even edit the parameters of preset tone and save up to 100 original tones in user tone memory. 
Flash Memory
Built-in Flash memory lets you expand your selection of tones and rhythms by downloading data from the CASIO MUSIC SITE, or by the CD-ROM that comes bundled with the keyboard. You can also store up to 200 SMF format music files for playback. 
Piano Setting Button
The press of a button optimizes the keyboard setup for piano play. 
166 Preset Rhythms + 16 User Rhythms
A selection of 166 rhythms includes accompaniments for everything from rock to pops and jazz. You can also transfer accompaniment data from your computer and store up to 16 of them as user rhythms in keyboard memory. 
Auto Accompaniment
Simply play a chord and the corresponding rhythm, bass and chord parts play automatically. One-touch Preset instantly recalls the most suitable tone and tempo settings to match the rhythm you are using. 
Big, Information-packed Display
A big built-in display shows chord names, tempo setting, keyboard information, staff notation of notes played and more for full support of all your keyboard play. A built-in backlight keeps the display easy to read, even in total darkness. 
Song Memory
Record up to six parts in memory, along with their tone, volume, pan position, and other parameters for later playback. Realistic ensemble play can also be created using the Auto Accompaniment function. 
Synthesizer Mode
Edit built-in sounds to produce your own original creations. Up to 120 of your own sounds can be stored in memory for recall, just like the built-in tones. 
General MIDI compatibility
The General MIDI tones of this keyboard let you connect to a personal computer to enjoy ""desktop music"" capabilities. This keyboard can be used as a desktop music input device or sound source, and it's just the thing for playback of commercially available pre-recorded General MIDI music software. 
Powerful effects
A collection of powerful effects, such as DSP, reverb, chorus, and more, give you total control over the type of sound you want. You can change the parameters of an effect to create your own, original effects. A 4-band equalizer is also included. 
USB Port
A USB port provides quick and easy connection to a computer.*
*Note that you will need a commercially available USB cable (A-B type) to connect to a computer using the USB port. 
Mixer
You can specify tone, volume, pan position, and other parameters for each built-in Auto Accompaniment part. You can also control the same parameters for each channel during MIDI input. 
Registration Memory
Digital piano setups can be stored in memory for later recall and instant settings whenever you need them. Up to 32 setups (4 setups x 8 banks) can be stored in registration memory. 
SD Memory Card Slot
A built-in SD memory card slot helps to simplify transfer of data from a computer and lets you store volumes of data for later recall when you need it. You can also load a card with a standard MIDI file (SMF) and play it back on the digital piano.

Also included is a DeSantis 002-T2 custom OWB two position adjustable holster that's in perfect shape. The pistol has HK night sights front and back and they are crazy bright! Firearm has both a thumb safety and de-cocker. Also, included are two HK barrel o-rings. All manuals, boxes, tools and instructions are included. Also will include 200 rounds of Winchester 230 grain white box target ammo. The firearm is almost mint. I have fired exactly 150 rounds of FMJ through it (no BS) Its an HK so don't even think there was any sort of issue at all! I have polished the feed ramp and barrel till they look like a mirror and am so crazy meticulous on cleaning its not funny. If you have read this far than you know what an HK 45C is and will agree there are thousands of cheaper guns on Armslist. these are not and they are worth every penny, especially this one! I don't need to sell by any means but my safe is getting a little tight and I am starting a 1911 build. I would prefer face to face with a WI CCW holder or with a legitimate ID. The price is the price, $899.00 firm. I just went on line and priced it all at over $1425.00 shipped and that's not the paperwork and transfer fees! Its a fantastic deal because there are posts for this price for JUST the pistol ( not a mint clean as this one) on Armslist!  I have many more hi resolution pictures if you would like to see them just ask. Thanks for looking and have a great day."

A truly fantastic factory build. sub MOA performance from a freefloat barreled action with great style and feel. Everyone who has seen this has begged to borrow it, and we all know how that would play out. Attatched is the screen shot from the online build in February. The actual stock is a slightly different color, it is more of a earth tone. The rifle and scope are in immaculate condition. I have shot this just 5 times in order to test the factory adjusted accuracy and 2lb adjustable trigger. And it is 100% spot on at 100 yds. No adjustments needed. I have the 15 round partial box and 2 full boxes of premium match ammo that will be included. The total for this build was $1,031. I paid extra for the Hogue overmolded aluminium pillar block chassis stock and the 6x18x50 Nikko illuminated retical scope. I will throw in a few surprise extras aswell. This is sure to be someone elses favorite. Simply too much goodness to list here! I will sell for 700 or I will trade for a gas piston AR with adjustable gas block and will add cash to make everything fair or a well built direct impingement AR . Below is the build order.

The 1911 RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS comes from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. The RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom rosewood grips. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols feature a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.

From Remington:
""The Remington Model 700,™ a rifle with no equal, and a superior performer in every way. Its accuracy and dependability have become the standard by which all other centerfire rifles are measured and continually fall short. Still the most accurate out-of-the-box rifle made,the Model 700™ brings its famous action and renowned consistency to this diverse family of guns. All are newly equipped with our externally adjustable X-Mark Pro trigger system.

Receiver machined from solid-steel bar stock resulting in uniformity and strength.
Cylindrical receiver design provides a solid bedding area in the stock for consistent shot placement. Recessed bolt face locks up inside the counter-bored breech of the barrel which is surrounded by the receiver, forming ""three-rings-of-steel"" enclosing the cartridge case head for unparalleled strength. Integral extractor is set in a groove inside the rim of the bolt face, uniformly supporting the cartridge head. X-Mark Pro™ Trigger - featuring super-tight tolerance and mirror-like surface finishes, it breaks like glass and is adjustable for trigger pull weight.""

The actual stock is a slightly different color, it is more of a earth tone. The rifle and scope are in immaculate condition. I have shot this just 5 times in order to test the factory adjusted accuracy and 2lb adjustable trigger. And it is 100% spot on at 100 yds. No adjustments needed. I have the 15 round partial box and 2 full boxes of premium match ammo that will be included. The total for this build was $1,031. I paid extra for the Hogue overmolded aluminium pillar block chassis stock and the 6x18x50 Nikko illuminated retical scope. I will throw in a few surprise extras aswell. This is sure to be someone elses favorite. Simply too much goodness to list here! 700 cash or I will trade for a gas piston AR with adjustable gas block and will add cash to make everything fair or a well built direct impingement AR.

Cleaned and lubed, its like new now. I'm now selling it because my hours were cut at work and I really need the money to help cover tuition. 

I'm selling it with a Vortex Diamondback 1.75-5x32 low mag scope, mounted on a Warne scope mount with integrated removable 45-degree picatinny for mounting a canted optic on either left or right side of the scope. I also have the Magpul flip-up rear sights. The Warne mount is awesome because when you take it off and put it back on it holds zero. I'll also include both of the DVD's that S&W included if interested.

I had this rifle built for me by DPMS a couple years back and have enjoyed shooting it immensely. I have a new baby girl at home, so I'm hoping to sell this rifle for a good price and make someone very happy.

The barrel has less than 500 rounds through it (I did the recommended break-in, then haven't been able to get out and shoot much after that).

I have been shooting exclusively handloads which were loaded at relatively low velocity with Hornady 178gr BTHP (2200 fps)

Here's the details: 
20"" threaded barrel, 1 in 10 twist (perfect for heavier bullets) with flash hider (not pinned) - free floated barrel with 4 rail free-float tube 
Magpul PRS adjustable stock in FDE 
JP Adjustable trigger (custom tuned to a crisp ~2.5lbs) 
Flat-top receiver - optics ready 
Panther tactical grip (black), also have a Magpul AR grip in FDE 
Bipod adapter for Harris-style bipods (attaches to rail) 
Bipod included 
4x 20 round steel magazines with Magpul grips x3
Quad rail covers in FDE camo pattern (see pictures)

This rifle is a dream to shoot - exceptional recoil management. Easily shoots sub-MOA groups (I usually average 0.5MOA to 0.7MOA groups at 100 yards). With my handloads, I am able to engage steel gongs (12 inch round) to 1000 yards. I am certain the rifle could go further, but that's all I've been able to find the space for at the moment.

I will ship to your FFL - price quote will depend on where you live. Be sure this rifle is legal in your US State!"
