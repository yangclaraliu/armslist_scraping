9mm 3.54"" 8rd Description: The CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm Luger has an ideal combination of style, ergonomics, size, shape, accuracy, and ability to conceal comfortably. The Walther Soft Coil ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. The CCP’s Soft Coil™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case. With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster. The CCP comes in Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation. This single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface. Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide.

It is a great carry gun and comes with accessories that are worth more than I am asking for the gun. This is a great starter package for someone just getting into conceal carry. The gun has about 800 rounds through it, and has never had a failure to fire, or failure to eject. It does show a little wear as it was carried every day. It is very light wear and is barely visible in the photos. People complain that these guns have a very long trigger pull, and they do. Galloway Precision makes a 50% trigger kit containing a trigger bar, trigger, and springs. It is installed on this gun and it really makes a difference. Below is a list of all of the accessories that come with the gun and their value new. The original parts are all there if you wanted to convert the gun back to stock. The gun comes with the original box, paper work, and pouch. I am throwing in two IWB holsters. I am asking $350. Call if you would like 614 Five eight eight 3091.

I had a magazine disconnect installed (aluminum one) which allows you to fire the gun without a magazine in the frame. I also added the top rail for mounting scope or optic. You also get a green dot Sight Mark Optic (on/off switch has been repaired but works fine) & original box/battery & tools, a set of smooth white 1911 grips & the rubber hogue factory Ruger grips. There are 3 Ruger Mark lll magazines (it only came with ONE from factory) and the box with all paperwork, locks and misc. stuff from Ruger. 

Super nice little .22 is in great shape!!! 

Price is $425 FOR EVERYTHING LISTED> 

Price for just the pistol, one mag, both grips; disconnect & rail is - $350

 I will meet you face to face locally or can ship for $30 including insurance to your FFL.   Be sure your local laws allow a rifle of this type.   Payment if shipped with be a USPS money order.   

 I copied the information below off the web to give you some insight of the different models of the SKS that take AK mags.  

There are about 8 models of SKS rifles that accept AK type magazines. Some require the mags to be slightly modified to fit. Usually at the rear latching area of the mag.
The only one with a bolt hold open button type is the Type84.

All SKS models that accept AK mags are a little balky for mag attachment as this system is not part of the original fireram design.
They generally sell at a price premium. They come in both the 16 inch and 20 inch barrel length varieties.

This listing is for One rifle; dealers, law enforcement agencies, and collectors, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-gun price, and with no additional shipping charges. Here is Panther Arms / DPMS’s response to the economical class of AR15 rifles like Smith & Wesson’s MP15 Sport. Manufacturer is D.P.M.S., Defense Procurement Manufacturing Services, simply known as Panther Arms, parent company to Remington Arms. This is Panther Arms’s A-15 Sportical, a modified descendant of the highly popular Colt C-AR, Collapsible AR-15, that evolved into the U.S. Military M-4 carbine. Like the Smith & Wesson Competitor, it does not have a forward bolt assist, but the FBA is usually not necessary for shooters who practice adequate gun hygiene and keep their rifle bores and chambers clean. Furthermore, according to many of our old head veterans, when it gets so bad that one has to use the FBA, one is already down to a single shot. Barrel is 16 inches of full length medium light contour barrel, 18 inches counting the muzzle brake. The Panther 5.56 NATO Sportical, writes the factory correspondents,  has a 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel  with 6 grooves, right hand 1X9 twist, button rifled Lite Contour with A2 flash hider (birdcage) 16 inch barrel, gas operated rotating bolt, and a 8620 steel bolt carrier. The upper receiver features  flattop Lo-Pro Extruded. The Upper Receiver made of 6066-T6 aircraft aluminum. The Lower Receiver is made of 7075 T6 aircraft aluminum and feature semi-auto trigger group, aluminum trigger guard, and a aluminum magazine release button. The stock is DPMS Pardus Carbine Stock. The handguards are GlacierGuards oval carbine length with aluminum Delta Ring. Neither the receiver top, as the photos show, nor the gas block front sight area have sights; instead, there is a a 12 slot Picatinny or Weaver type base on the receiver and a 3 slotter on the gas block front sight area, either capable of securely anchoring any appropriate optical accessory. Buttstock is solid high impact polymer 6-position collapsible, and it allows overall length from 32 1/2 inches to 36.375 inches, a fully extended 14 5/8 inch length of pull all the way to 10 5/8 fully contracted. Weight empty is 6.3 pounds with center of gravity at the magazine well. Each Panther A-15 Sportical is brand new in its original factory box with instruction manual and chamber protector. It comes with its original black finish 30 shot factory magazine. We’re offering the DPMS Sportical rifle in the photos, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 539.00. 2% Discount if Payment is with USPS Money Order & Not Credit Card.

I went to Gander Mountain over the weekend and purchased 1200 rd's of this ammo.  The total cost was $694.32 that included tax, I have receipt.  After further review of my ammo stock I only need half of what I purchased.  I kind of went hog wild.  I believe  Gander is completely sold out of XM855.  I am not trying to make any $ only get my money back out of it.  This ammo will definitely go up in price once ban hits.  I already see people jacking the price up on different websites, if it is even available.  Price is not negotiable and I am not willing to trade for anything.  If interested I will meet at Sonic on Wabash.  Thanks.  Jeremy 913 707 - eight 7 5 two."

	Hey everyone, 
	I recently got a great deal on some really awesome 45 defense/carry ammo. These usually run $45-50 per box of 50 so when i saw them at this price i bought a bunch for myself, friends, and to list on the group. Check out the reviews and videos online to see how awesome this stuff really is. Here is what I have on hand:
-5X 50rd boxes of Winchester Ranger T-Series 230gr +P $45 ACP-$35 each

	When you check these out look at the comparison of these to the black talon rounds. The consensus that i could find is that these are the “new and improved” “talon” round marketed as a “T-Series” instead of a talon. The physical characteristics and multiple tests seem to support this as well, so take it as you will! haha. 

	In terms of trades, the only thing I would really consider would be for HP 7.62x39 ammo (at what i can find it for price wise online) or towards certain pistol (tokarev chambered pistols, 38 +P revolvers, etc) or possibly other rifles or shotguns. No blackpowder or 22LR please. Need to meet up in Norman on these if possible due to my schedule. To pick some up shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here and we can go from there.
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

Ok, I realize when you build something up this much, it is hard to get your investment back. I am lowering the price of this to $860 beyond firm, it would cost you almost $1100 to build this exact rifle. This is beyond a deal for someone looking for a super nice rifle. I am located in Hartford City and not looking to travel for this price.

These were called ""Kit Guns"" as they were commonly used in a hiker's or fisherman's ""Kit."" these pistols were built on a J frame with aluminum cylinder and frame with black finish and blued steel barrel. They used a frame mounted firing pin with a transfer bar safety. Fully adjustable rear sight with high blade front sight and wood grips with S&W logo. Barrel as I would measure it, from muzzle to forcing cone/cylinder face, is about 3.5 inches. I am including the pictured leather Hunter holster. It has seen a good deal of holster use, judging by condition I would say it has seen more holster use than actual shooting use. Timing is perfect, never shaves lead or has any slop in the hammer and trigger draw. Lock up is tight with very little side to side play. End play is similar, the forcing cone to cylinder gap with cylinder pulled fully aft is .002"" The trigger breaks crisp at 3 pounds on a snap cap every time. There is some apparent wear to the passivation, particularly on the cylinder, but some at high points on the barrel and frame as well. There is some rotation ring on the cylinder, and a little evidence of flash cutting on the top strap, but no more than would be expected of a pistol this old that has been used. Chambers and bore are clean without any evidence of corrosion, crown is in perfect shape. Grips are solid without cracks or structural damage, checkering is sharp with little damage. The grips appear to be original with the last three digits of the serial number stamped on the inside of one side. Frame stamps and crane stamp also match. All in all I have seen guns in better condition, but I have seen far worse. This gun is functionally excellent, and would make a great shooter or collectable piece of S&W history from their golden days. Note that I do have it listed on Gunbroker and if it gets a bid I have to sell to the high bidder. If it does not have a bid there than it is still for sale. Thanks for the look and let me know if interested."

The Anderson Rifle is the only rifle in the world that never requires lubrication. It is only possible because it is permanently treated with  RF85 , the nano technology that injects calcium into the molecular fabric of the metal. RF85 is permanent. It is IN the metal. RF85 reduces friction 85% and wears with the metal. Under heat and pressure the calcium nano particles elongate and form a protective barrier that eliminates the need for lubrication.


An ancillary benefit arises because without an oily film to catch carbon particles, the rifle runs cleaner much longer. A typical lubricated weapon traps the carbon byproducts from explosives. Under the heated conditions found in weapons, the gooey mess turns into tar which bakes into a solid mass and fouls the chamber. The result is life-threatening weapon failure.

Price lowered to $599.00, firm. You can own a beautiful S&W Model 629 for $599!!!  They come up for sale on Armslist or Gunbroker usually in the $800 range.

For sale is a beautiful Smith and Wesson Model 629-1 stainless steel 44 Magnum revolver with a 6 inch barrel.  I am the original owner and the pistol has approximately 500 rounds through it over the years.  It has always been well cared for and the internals have recently been lubricated.  It has the smooth combat trigger and an adjustable rear sight.  The trigger has a very light pull in single action mode.  It comes with the original box, packing, documents, unopened cleaning kit, and the original wood grips, which are in like new condition.  It has never been modified in any way and it shoots great!!  I always shot ""normal"" 44 mag rounds through it, never anything overloaded or excessively abusive like some of the 300 grain bullets guys are loading up now.  It has never been dropped or abused.  It does have a slight amount of holster polishing on the end of the barrel.

The attached photos show the actual pistol for sale and were taken on March 2, 2015.

The pistol is available for face-to-face cash purchase and pickup in Kennewick, WA.

In addition, I have two 20-round boxes of hard-to-find Hornady LeveRevolution .44 mag ammo that I will sell for an additional $50.00, if you want them.

The background check that is now required in Washington by Initiative 594 and subsequent transfer of the gun to the buyer can be performed at the Hole in the Wall gun shop, 7509 W. Deschutes Ave. in Kennewick, WA.  The fee is $25.00, payable by the buyer.  There will be the normal pistol waiting period, unless you have a CPL.  There is no sales tax on the private sale, even though the transfer occurs at a gun store.

Give me a call at the number listed below if you have any questions or would like to see the pistol and purchase it.  

I will not respond to ""lowball"" offers and I am not interested in any trades.  Sorry!

""The Correct Bayonet used with the French Rolling Block Rifle Purchases in 1914. It is marked ""Remington - Union Metallic Corporation"" which is correct. You see a lot of the Non-UMC marked Export Bayonets being sold as French 1914s.

These were issued with the French 8mm. Rolling Blocks acquired in 1914 due to the shortage of adequate arms. Issued mainly to Second Line Troop.  The No. ""65"" is impressed into one of the grips. Most likely a Rack or last two digits of a serial number, but that is speculation.
