I have for sale a Glock 21 .45 Caliber Generation 3. It has the original case, 2 mags, brush, Magazine assist loader, booklet, etc.

I have no idea how many rounds have been put through it (but if I had to guess it would be very minimal). I got it in a trade and planned on keeping it (it's a great looking pistol) but I would prefer to have the money right now. I've put about 2 magazines through it (they are both 13 rd mags) and she shoots straight at 20 yards (haven't shot it farther). 

There are zero scratches on it, and whoever had it before me kept it well oiled (I keep mine well oiled also).  But I still think it was a safe queen but that cannot be verified. The only addition there is a Harley Davidson Motorcycle emblem on the back of the slide. It is not huge or takes anything away from the gun by any means.

I have honestly about $500 in it because of the trade but as I said I planned on keeping it so it didn't matter. I am asking $450 or best offer though.

I am open to trades but would prefer cash. I do not want a 1911, or a FN, or any shotguns to be specific. Anything else just ask; worst I can say is no.

You can contact me by calling/texting me at four 1 niner- ate 9 zero - sixer niner 0 seven or respond to this posting.

Thanks Dustin"

261,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4687261,For Sale/Trade:  Rare Finnish M39 Mosin Nagant,"North Main, Columbia, South Carolina",$ 999,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 5, 2016",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Note: some local guy who is pissed at me for selling this has called it ultra rare, himself. I'm not sure about that. I just think it's rare. Haters gonna hate. Here's my offer and why:

Classic Firearms has sold off the last known batch of Finnish M39 rifles and I was lucky to grab a beautiful specimen.  These rifles have evolved from the very common Russian Mosin Nagant M91/30 when they were captured by the Germans and sold to the Fins.  The extrinsic value of this gun can range from $350-500 before fees.  It's the intrinsic value of this PPARICULAR un that makes it such a hot item.  To be honest, I'm just as happy to keep it and pass it down my family line.  

I learned that the Russion M91/30 numbered between 13,000,000-14,000,000.  Total production of the M39 rifle during wartime period of 1940-1945 was a total of 96,800 rifles.  Total production of the M39 including post-war modifications is approimately 102,000.  Needless to say, this rifle is quite rare these days.  

The gun has the typical hexagonal Russion reciever with an R for Remington.  The major markings on the barrel shank are
SA                    boxed SA indicating Finnish Regular Army
VKT                  later logo
D                      reworked for Finnish D166 cartridge
34905               serial number has no prefixes or suffixes
1941                 year of production

One characteristic noted from observed specimens and from the database of registerred rifles of VKT and Belgian barreled M39s is that the dates on the barrels are not chronological in the order of the serial numbers.  This raise the possibility that the barrels were not date stamped until they were actulaly assembled at AV3.  Of the 30,300 reported barrels that used VKT and Belgian specimens, it appears that 1943 dated VKT barreled rifles are quite scarce and that Belgian produced barrels as used on the M39s are rare as well.  An educated guiss by analysis of known serial numbers and determination of barrels produced apparently in sequence can be ventured as to total numbers of guns produced.

This specific gun is a WARTIME gun.  It has war-time pistol grip stock with war-time stock splices.  The stock is made by Lindholmin Puusepantehdas using the stock marker's cartouche of an ""L"" in the circle.

The buttplate has had all markings rubbed off. 

The Russian symbols include the Izhevsk Bow and Arrow in front of the magazine plate and on the bolt assembly.  The magazine floor plate number has the last four serial numbers 4905.

Interestingly enough, there is also the Tula Hammer symbol on the Cocking Knob.

It also appears to have a faded Tula Hammer within a circle on the bolt body.  The bolt's number is also 4905.

There are other symbols by the bolt body and cocking knob that I can't identify yet.

Lastly, Finnish M28/30s and M39s have sight graduations on the side of the rear sight base that are often mistaken for serial numbers by new Mosin Nagant collectors. 86432.

I'm hoping to snag one more before the end of the year, so I'll keep updating.  More pictures available upon request."

I have an almost new Kahr CW .380 for sale or trade. I bought it for the wife, and she carried it, but now she has her heart set on something else. So, I am just trying to make back most of the money I paid. We went to the range twice and fired around 3 or 4 mags each trip. I thought about keeping it, but I have some pretty big hands, so I am not a fan. 

It comes with one magazine and a DeSantis Nemesis holster as well as a box of Lehigh self defense ammo (Thanks Shooting the Bull). 

I also have a a huge 400 or so round box of LAX .380 ammo if you're interested. 

If you're looking for something that will disappear in a pocket, this is it.

Let me know what you have for trade and if you want the ammo too.

The Bird barrel has three choke tubes (mod. Imp. and full). The condition of the gun and the deer barrel are pristine. The bird barrel was placed in a case with a little moisture (I suspect). It has a strange pattern and has bluing missing. No rust. 

My father traded an early 80's ford ranger for the shotgun. We don't really have a use for it. We all have 870's. 

This Mossberg is a nice piece. My first shotgun was a 500c 20ga. this would be a great first 12ga. or a good field gun. The furniture is in pretty good shape. the one area of concern is pictured. It probably happened in the same event that damaged the bluing.

This is our Glock Small Frame model. With our lower we didn’t cut any corners, these lowers are not just another forged AR15 lower cut for glock magazines. These lowers were designed with not only function in mind but aesthetics and it makes our lowers the perfect platform for shooting small frame glock magazines. These lowers are manufactured by us at our facility in Tucson, Arizona.  They are CNC machined from 7075 aluminum in house on our machines. They will accept all Glock 9mm, 357 Sig and .40 S&W magazines. These lowers were designed for the purpose of engaging targets beyond pistol ranges. This is the perfect platform for any tactical application or just a fun day at the range.

With just a change of your bolt and barrel you can go switch between 3 different calibers all with the same lower and upper. Having one of our Pistol Caliber Carbines and a handgun that shoots the same round enables shooters to carry one type of ammunition, and feed both guns from one magazine. Running short on one type of ammo doesn’t happen; both guns stay in the fight until the last round is gone. The concept is not unique to modern times. Lawmen in the Old West sometimes carried revolvers that chambered the same rounds as their trusty lever-action rifles. Maintaining only one kind of cartridge made sense to a lot of men on the trail back then, just as it still does for many officers and civilians on the street today."

Got this gun in a trade and really don't need it and have no use for it as I have other shotguns I use for turkey. I'm not sure on the round count on it, as I'm the second owner but the bore is bright and clean, no pitting or areas of concern. I had it examined by my smith before I shot it and everything checked out on it as far as function. As stated, its well used. There are areas where the camo finish is chipping or chipped, the recoil pad could use some help and there are wear marks on the carrier and action bars. Threaded for screw-in chokes and currently has a Remington Full Turkey Choke installed and included. 

I added a Beard Buster Dead Ringer sight set on it and also an aluminum, Teflon-coated GG&G Magazine follower. I have all of the fiber optic pipes for the front sight (one orange, two yellow/green) as well as the original magazine follower if the buyer wants that. Included with the gun is a Quake Claw sling and a Remington 12 gauge choke wrench. This one won't win any awards for appearance but it goes bang every time and would be a fine truck gun or one to leave at camp that wouldn't break the bank if something happened to it.

The SB-X barrel provides the versatility of a short barreled rifle (SBR) without the burden of red tape paperwork.  The SB-X barrel allows the addition of a suppressor without drastically increasing the overall length of your firearm.  

The barrel length of 12.375” would be considered an SBR if not for the shroud which brings the overall length to 16.625”.  This barrel avoids cumbersome paperwork and provides a shorter, light-weight solution for those who love shooting suppressed.  With the standard threaded end, attaching a suppressor is easier than tying your shoe.

Comes with the 6"" pinned barrel and a six round recessed cylinder. The barrel ends are fantastic and there is very little holster wear and some slight freckling from storage. This gun has a serial number of S243XXX and has been researched to be manufactured in 1965. The gun is in very nice condition for being fifty years old. The Eagle target grips are relieved, and they come with silver medallions. They show very nicely and the rich wood contrasts beautifully with the bead blasted top strap and blue frame finish. The finish on all the model 28's top straps have been bead blasted to deflect any glare in bright conditions. The condition of the bluing is very well preserved with only the most limited signs of age. Smith & Wesson released this model as a lesser option variant of the 27 and quickly became a favorite among service personnel and those in the line of duty. This 28-2 also features the checkered  semi Target Hammer with a serrated Trigger and both have been finished with distinctive case hardened coloring. If you ever had the desire to add one of these to your collection of fine iron, I got a 6"" for your consideration. All engineered mechanics on this model 28-2 function perfectly, and as with all Smith & Wesson revolvers of this generation, she comes pinned and recessed.

Less than 40 rounds total fired through it. No failures or malfunctions of any kind. Cleaned and lightly oiled after each use. Otherwise has simply sat in my padded safe. As you can see from the pictures, it's in like-new condition.

Comes with everything it came with originally, including case, lock, cleaning rod and brush, manual, replaceable backstraps and three 15-round magazines. Even comes with test-fired casing.

Great gun--I simply do not shoot that much. Also, I recently bought a new gun and wife says I can only have ""X"" number of guns so this one must go.

Due to recent change in Oregon law, sale must be done through a private dealer. Buyer pays the dealer's transfer fees. I'm pricing this low so that it's fair. Prefer to meet at Keith's Sporting Goods in Gresham.

I also have a spare factory Glock 17 magazine with a +2 basepad. It has never been used (and in fact, the basepad is not even installed on it yet--still separate in packaging). Will sell the magazine and basepad for $20 additional.

Thanks!"

The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Rogers Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. Our stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is simply the best collapsible stock for your AR style rifle.

If trade, will meet at a local gun shop.  I have known the owner for years and he will check your gun for me (may disassemble it).  Of course you can check mine too.

If sale, we can meet somewhere else safe (e.g. local Police Station).

I have up for grabs an amazingly well put together 1981 Romanian battle rifle from one of the best in the business, ARMA RIFLES from right here in parker colorado. They are very well known for their solid builds and attention to detail. This one is chambered in 7.62x39 and is covered in Russian red wood. It is built on a Nodak reciever and has most features found on a krebs build. Upgraded safety, tuned/polished internals, trigger, buffer also the wood is refinished to factory new Russian red and the rifle is given a coat of duracoat paint. I would rate this rifle at 95% +. The only real issue is a couple parts could stand to be touched up with paint, but other than that it is in perfect shape and shoots like a dream. Extremely accurate rifle. These builds are going for much more when available. Im asking $950 cash or trade in the denver/englewood area.

The magazine catch is steel and secures a sheet metal magazine holding six rounds. Almost unheard of in a sub-compact pistol, the DB380 even sports windage-adjustable sights.

Never got the courtesy of a reply. Makes me think some folks simply post ads so they get email.
Oh I know, some folks figure if their not interested in the offer, they just won't answer, let the buyer/trader figure it out.
 Yeah, they figure out your a smuck!! Then they check all your ads, where you are located if possible, but do their best to identify you, then add you to the No Sale list.
