Allow me to elaborate... I bought this gun with a can thinking that it would take a while for my gunsmith to thread my barrel, but luckily he's a God among we mere mortals and he had it done in a matter of hours... anyway. This is a Remington R1 Enhanced AAC edition, and it's one of only 1,000. The gun is brand new, never fired, and comes with the cutout 1085 Pelican Case, bushing wrench, shoulder strap, papers, and two magazines. The gun itself has a fantastic trigger, suppressor straight 8 sights, VZ grips, and a lot of other great stuff that I'll let you read about below. Guns.com says that MSRP is $2,261, so I'll just cut that down to an even $1,200 to make up for the cost of the can + tax stamp that I pirated out of it. Must meet around Oxford-ish area. Really great pistol here though. (Cannot emphasize that enough.)"

It was purchased from Builders Hardware here in Charlotte and ordered with the following upgrades.
1 Grade 3 wood instead of the grade 2 that came standard on all Super Grades.
2 Winchester Custom Shop island express safari sights no longer made due to cost.
3 Kickeez recoil pad.
The stock has great figure and color and only very minor handling marks. The bluing is perfect except for one small rub on the floor plate. The bore is mint condition and the rifling looks like it was cut yesterday. The rifle has been fired less than 50 times since new and very well cared for. Comes with original dealer hanging tag and owners manual. Also comes with a Browning model 1915 that was purchased from the same dealer as the rifle in the early 70s. The case is in mint condition and looks like it was made yesterday. Comes with both locking keys owners manual and care card from Browning. I have seen these sell before but never one as complete as this. Also comes with a vintage hand tooled Torel Cape Buffalo sling that was purchased along with the case and one box of vintage Winchester Western 458 solids and one box of empty's. You will look long and hard before you will find another Super Grade 458 African this complete or in this condition."

IWI US TAVOR® SAR OVERVIEW
 
The dynamics of the battlefield are forever changing. With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Research & Development teams, developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF. The TAVOR® was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the “father of the TAVOR,” spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities – seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990’s through the early 2000’s, the TAVOR underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies in the world.
 
IWI and IWI US have brought the same dedication to craft and commitment to performance and reliability to the American customer with the TAVOR SAR rifle. 
 
TAVOR® SAR Features Include:
-Bullpup configuration allows for short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy
-Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease-of-use
-Clean, long stroke piston operation
-Detachable, cold hammer-forged barrel (CHF), chrome-lined with 1:10 twist, CrMoV steel

-Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles with push button swivels
-Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies
-Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR SAR parts
-Last round - bolt holds open on an empty magazine
-All metal parts treated for corrosion resistance
-Integral rubber recoil pad"

The Tactical Tailor Fight Light line of tactical gear features the same combat tested designs as our regular gear but in a 30% lighter, FR lined package! The Fight Light gear line is contructed of lighter 500 denier Cordura, compared to the 1000 denier material of our regular gear, with strategic reinforcements and flame resistant lining so that it still holds up to whatever punishment you can dish out.

The Fight Light Modular Operator Pack is the mid level three day pack style entry in our Fight Light packs. Comparable in size to a regular three day pack, but with many more features than you would find in the competition's packs.

For storage, you will find a large main compartment, and a medium sized front pocket with a zippered accessory pocket. A large hydration pocket fits a 3L hydration bladder and includes covered ports to route a drinking hose.

The outside is covered with modular webbing on the front, sides and bottom for attaching pouches as well as loop fastener for attaching patches and nametapes. Padded back and contoured shoulder straps are lined with Air mesh for comfort. Side compression straps, large drag handle, heavy duty zippers, sternum strap and removable waist belt round out this already impressive pack.

The Modular Operator Pack is the ideal choice for a short stay in the field or just a trip to the airport. Available in ATACS, Coyote Brown and MultiCam®

Very faint barrel stamp says: ""JC Higgins Model 103.13 22CAL Sears and Robuck and Co S-L-LR."" Sat in the back of a closet for about 30 years. It's been reblued, stock refinished, new extractor, new buttplate, new cartridge guide, general cleaning and fixing wear and tear. It shoots great with a brand new williams rear peep sight installed. More money in new parts and work than what I'm asking. The toe of the stock was cracked and fixed to the point it's barely noticeable. A terrible sling stud install was filled and repaired, but apparent. This has ballard cut rifling which puts it prior to 1953. A great 22 with a lot of history and still ready for more.

All are 8 +1. Gun comes with original box, as well. This gun is in great shape. I have a picture showing the one small mark it has on the slide from a funky unholstering, but it is purely cosmetic. If that bothers you too much, this gun may not be what you're looking for. Other than that, this gun functions and fires great. The holster is a handmade leather ""COMMANDER"" from The Masters's Holster. I wont bother with giving you a cost break down. This is a good deal, if you want the proof Im sure you will do the research! Reason for selling, I want more stuff for the jeep and am willing to have less guns for it. This gun has about 1-200 rounds through it, not a safe queen but not my EDC. Asking price is $850, am willing to negotiate and will entertain SERIOUS offers.

This gun was bought new by my dad in 69 or 70 and used as his side arm on deer hunting trips to the Maine wilderness and was used for shooting the heads off grouse for camp meat,yep it's that accurate,personally shot a turkey in the head for camp meat myself at 50 feet and many copper heads too. Iisthe6.5""model. Whether you want a reliable home defense gun, or an accurate plinker it won't disapoint and 22mag will get the job done in a self defense situation. there is some bluing wear from the holster and usage on the wood grips but other than that it's100% ready. I have been seeing these early models selling for $450 and up so it is at a fair price and a good trade for someone with an extra SKS.I had an sks once before and love them, I am disabled now and living on a fixed income that doesn't allow me to just purchase one and a trade is he only way for me. If It needs to be shipped,shipping will be $20 but only to the U.S. where owning a handgun is permitted by law. I will accept payment to paypal at this email, or money order.But again a trade for a good working SKS is my main goal. Thanks for taking the time to read."

Take a true classic to the range. When it was introduced early in the 20th century, the Browning Hi Power 9mm pistol was a revelation. It offered the perfect balance of handling, size and firepower, with an impressive 13-round magazine capacity. Over the years, the Hi Power has aged gracefully and continues to have a loyal following among those “in the know.” Whether you are a novice or a seasoned shooter, you will appreciate the fine craftsmanship and function of these classic pistols, the sure heft of the machined steel frame and slide, and their natural pointability.

Even with the double-column magazine, the grip is narrow to neatly accommodate nearly every hand size, and the single-action trigger provides a smooth, consistent pull. As reliable, accurate and easy to shoot as ever.

Sure, there are many, many  other full-size 9mm pistols on the market that are made to meet many different requirements. But in the end, every true firearm enthusiast should have a Hi Power in their collection. Having and shooting the best just means something.

Includes Box, Lock, 1-6rd Magazine w/Pearce Magazine Extension  The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol. It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

Well, I did, shot a mag through it and I'm just gonna stick to my AR Pistol and my SKS. So, this is up for trade/sale for someone who may be looking to get into an AR on an entry level or for not a lot of money. This come with what I believe to be an DPMS Upper, SCT BCG and a ATI OMNI Lower. It also comes with an adjustable stock and a 30 round Troy Industries magazine. I believe it to be an 18"" barrel and the unit is Mil-Spec. 

I've taken quite a few pics to depict the condition of the rifle. I'm not one who will sit here and try to tell you I know everything about AR's I'm sure you guys are more informed. I believe this to be a good rifle and would make a fine shooter for someone who knows about them more than I do. There is a crack on the lower that I've taken a pic of so you may decide to buy a billet or forged one to replace this one and I'm sure you should have a great rifle then or you may already have a good stripped lower ready to go.

It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.Specifications

They are the Japanese firm that also makes the Weatherby Vanguard rifles.

This rig began as a Howa 1500. Then the barreled action was fitted to a polymer sniper stock with a 5 position telescoping butt. The action was converted to handle a 10 round box magazine, the trigger was tweaked, a Simmons 4-12 x 44 SF scope was mounted and a bipod was added. 

The total rig less ammo weighs 10.2 pounds which is about right for long range shooting. It is heavy enough to be steady but not so heavy as to require wheels.

If the sniper stock doesn't ring your bell, you can have it with the Boyd's laminated wood thumbhole stock. Maybe you will want both."

This is a one owner rifle I bought it and built it. The weapon has had less than 200 Rounds through it and that is rounding way up , almost all have been match grade except  5 rounds of wolf put through it just to help a friend at the range determine if his issue was his M1A Or his ammo.  Well that is what I can remember for now there is quite possibly even more I will find as I keep digging. So if there are any more questions please feel free to ask anything and everything and I will make sure to do my best to reply in a timely fashion. 
And as always remember it is your responsibility to ensure this is legal in your area! , I Prefer face to face however if it comes to it, Buyer is responsible for all shipping cost! And I will not ship to the obvious places this is not allowed. All accessories and such if shipped will ship direct to you but the rifle will ship only to your local FFL. Again any fees accrued are your responsibility. 

And finally, I am looking to sell, so with that said I am not really looking for trades, however if it is something truly equal in value I am willing to listen to offers, worst I can say is no right, but I am not desperate either and I don’t need the low-ball offers or those who want to trade 12 cheap pawn shop guns and an old pick up for my rifle either as most of you who read this know exactly what I am talking about ….

More pics available if they are needed I have around 30 pictures of everything mentioned , I did not know we could only post 5 as this is my first time posting on here ....

Springfield's Description:
The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® redefines what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition.
The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M)®, which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XD(M)® features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place.

Unlike the Judge, however, the Governor chambers .45ACP as well, via moon clips and has six chambers instead of five. Also unlike the Judge, the Governor is built considerably better, from materials used to fit and finish. It is a typical Smith in that regard, which is too say it is excellent.

OK, I'm English, I'm going home, this is a Glock, It's pretty new, it works, it's got all this stuff with it.
If you have $425... then you can't buy it. If you have $150... then you can buy a HiPoint.... if you don't really value your life that much. 
If you have $600 then you can buy it. 
That's as simple as I can break it down.
Have a great day.

Can meet at Point Blank Gun Range Blue Ash or Target world where you can also shoot it if you require.
My asking price is that of Target worlds second hand beaten up Glock 40 with no box and 1 mag.

H&K USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. The USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the American shooter in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high energy +P loads. Service life is engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

This handgun features corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame • grooved target triggers • polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life • can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes • specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing • corrosion resistant ""Hostile Environment"" blued finish steel slide • no snag, bobbed hammer • flared recurve trigger guard • choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines • one piece machined steel slide • universal mounting grooves for installing accessories • ambidextrous safety • Night sights"

U.S. Army Standard-Issue Backup Sight For M4/M16A4
Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for M4 carbines and M16A4 rifles flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down.

Compact, Ruggedized Red Dot Sight System for Fast, Accurate            Targeting
As tough as Trijicon’s legendary ACOG® scopes, the low-profile RMR™ (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) sight enables fast, both-eyes-open, target acquisition—even in poor lighting conditions. Unlimited eye relief allows natural presentation from almost any shooting position, plus clear, unobstructed panoramic views for maximum situational awareness. Mount an RMR on your rifle to supplement your ACOG, and you’re ready to address targets at any range.
Performs in the harshest operating conditions thanks to a computer-optimized geometric housing of high-strength, forged, military-grade, aluminum that absorbs shock and diverts stress away from the lens. Simple to operate, no switches to toggle, or forget to activate under stress, because the sight is always on. The True-Color 28-layer coated, non-magnifying lens delivers a crisp, clear shooting picture. Fully adjustable for windage and elevation, 1 MOA per audible click. Each RMR is pre-adjusted at the factory to be parallax-free at 50 meters.
Battery-free Dual-Illuminated models use a combination of powerful, light-gathering fiber optics and self-illuminating Tritium to project a bright amber dot on the sight in any light conditions from pitch darkness to broad daylight. Automatically adjusts brightness and contrast of reticle to ambient light."

It has all matching numbers and full length stock.  It was manufactured in 1952 so it has the miracle trigger.  This gun is a shooter (setup for competition shooting) and not a safe queen; unless you want it to be (comes with an extra stock in great condition).  I am selling my complete M37 collection to fund another rifle.  So this comes with a lot of hard to find extras.  
•	Original Remington front sight w/1 insert (front sight mount included), rear sight, and receiver mount (made by Parker Hale).  I have measured this with a dial indicator and the elevation and windage is spot on.  It also comes with original aperture with “6” predetermined size holes.
•	Single shot adapter.
•	Extra Remington Model 37 stock (full length).  It is great condition, no dings or scratches.  Includes front sling swivel hardware.
•	Original Redfield receiver mount.  This is a very hard to find mount.  
•	Original Unertl scope mounting blocks.
•	Handstop
•	Trigger Shoe (I do not know if this is original)
•	Complete spare miracle trigger.  It does have some slight damage on the mounting pin holes on one side.  A gunsmith could easily fix this or can be used for spare parts. 
•	Spare front guard bow screw nut
•	Original leather sling.
•	Quick detach sling hook.
•	Original front sling swivel
•	Original manual.
Now for the nitty gritty details.  The barrel bluing is on the lighter side, but there are zero rust spots.  When I bought the gun, it arrived with a crack at the wrist of the gun.  I had my gunsmith fix the crack with threaded rod and epoxy.  You can hardly tell where the crack was and it is completely solid.  I leave the barreled action in the original stock 95% of the time so I don’t mess up the extra stock I bought.  When I got it, it also had plumbers putty in the barrel channel (1/3 of the length of the barrel).  The putty was deteriorating, so my gunsmith sanded it out.  Luckily he didn’t sand away the stamping numbers in the barrel channel.  
This rifle has a great back story too and is probably one of kind.  It was originally export to Great Britain so it has all the British stamps on it.  Then it was imported back to the United States (came back home!).  This is a great rifle and fun to shoot. Only reason I am selling it is because I don’t shoot it enough and need funds for another project.  I am looking for a good home for this rifle.  You can contact me through email REDACTED or call/text (Three one nine)404-seven three zero one.  
Package deal for everything $1,550 + shipping.  I am not considering splitting anything up at this time. If I do split it up, rifle must go first.  Then I would sell everything else individual.

* I have put about 6 Magazines through the Gun when I first purchased to make sure the Gun operated consistently since it was going to be my main, go to home defense pistol.  Never had a FTF or anything.  Cleaned the gun after initial use and has been in my bedside, nightstand ever since.  

This gun comes with a ""Limb-saver"" grip for extra shock absorption.  This really makes an already smooth shooter even more buttery soft.  You would shoot this thing all day and not feel a thing.  

The gun also comes with a Protec Elite HP-190 rail-mounted gun light for operating at night in a dark house.  The light serves to illuminate the object being acquired and the light is bright enough that it will stun/blind whatever is in it's path.  

Both of these extras are great additions to an already nice kit.  $275 OBO.  (a great deal with the extras included.  What you see in the pics is what you get.  Gun comes with 2 (16 round) magazines.  

The reason I'm selling is because I'm looking for a small package for daily CCW.  This gun is a little to large for me to comfortably carry on a regular basis so I want both a CCW and good 9mm home defense option.  Besides the gun being a little big for my taste, it's perfect in my humble opinion.  Feel free to ask any questions.  Thanks.  (Call REDACTED)"

Compact, Ruggedized Red Dot Sight System for Fast, Accurate            Targeting
As tough as Trijicon’s legendary ACOG® scopes, the low-profile RMR™ (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) sight enables fast, both-eyes-open, target acquisition—even in poor lighting conditions. Unlimited eye relief allows natural presentation from almost any shooting position, plus clear, unobstructed panoramic views for maximum situational awareness. Mount an RMR on your rifle to supplement your ACOG, and you’re ready to address targets at any range.
Performs in the harshest operating conditions thanks to a computer-optimized geometric housing of high-strength, forged, military-grade, aluminum that absorbs shock and diverts stress away from the lens. Simple to operate, no switches to toggle, or forget to activate under stress, because the sight is always on. The True-Color 28-layer coated, non-magnifying lens delivers a crisp, clear shooting picture. Fully adjustable for windage and elevation, 1 MOA per audible click. Each RMR is pre-adjusted at the factory to be parallax-free at 50 meters.
Battery-free Dual-Illuminated models use a combination of powerful, light-gathering fiber optics and self-illuminating Tritium to project a bright amber dot on the sight in any light conditions from pitch darkness to broad daylight. Automatically adjusts brightness and contrast of reticle to ambient light."
