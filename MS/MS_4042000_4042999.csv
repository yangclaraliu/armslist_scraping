Comes with one box of vintage Winchester Western 458 solids and one box of empty's. You will not find a nicer transitional Super Grade African or one that has been cared for like this one.

This 130gr., hard cast, 327 Federal load, is the direct result of customer request for such a load. It is designed primarily as an 'outdoor' load as it penetrates deeply and does not expand. It will perforate a large bear's skull and will also serve well for any application that requires very deep penetration. This load utilizes flash suppressed powder, so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire should he need to fire in low light situations.

As always, Buffalo Bore uses stock over-the-counter firearms to determine our published velocities, so the shooter will know what to expect in the real world. The industry wide practice of using extra-long laboratory test barrels, that generate unrealistic and exaggerated velocities, is dishonest to the customer. The below velocities were fired from my personal stock, out-of the-box revolvers.

also included with the gun is somewhere around 100-300 rounds of ammo. once i go back home i will check and revise this listing to reflect the actual amount.

I'm selling my Palmetto State Armory / Adams Arms AR15. This thing is in stupendous shape. I bought the FN cold hammer forged upper, and I matched it with an Adams Arms complete lower. The Adams Arms is fully milspec, and it looks pretty cool.

This rifle is almost immaculate. I have less than 180 rounds down the tube. Comes with a Bravo Company BCG (the best for the $$) and some other Magpul goodies.

- K2 Grip $25
- UTG Rear A2 Sight $25
- BCM MOD4 Charging Handle $45
- BCM Bolt Carrier Group $180
- MOE Handguard + AFG $55
- Adams Arms Milspec Lower (staked castle nut, machined chevrons, whole 9 yds) $200
- PSA CHF FN Upper $340

Total cost: $905. I'll list it at $800.

I would like to trade for another AK. I've fallen in love with that weapon system. Vepr 7.62x54r, WASR + Cash/Ammo/Mags/etc, Arsenal SLR107FR etc. If your trade is worth more, I'll add cash, ammo, mags, etc.

I mean it doesn't have to be an AK, I can entertain other offers. Just not any pistols, bolt guns, or shotguns. Worst I can say is no! Just please be courteous with offers. I will use MSRP and condition of rifle + accessories to see the differences in value. 

The AR will come with one poly 30 round magazine.

I'd rate it a 98% easy. It had cheap Weaver bases put in it before I got it and the screw heads are slightly boogered. The gun takes bases for a Browning A-bolt, so they are readily available and cheap.

It is in excellent shape and would possibly pass for new. Looks like it was never issued. Only shot once at the range and it did great. Not a single problem to report. Felt recoil is very low and the gun is accurate. 

Two magazines are included with the gun and the box it was shipped in.

The trigger pull is very smooth. There is no magazine block meaning that the hammer can be dropped with the mag out of the gun. These guns fire 8 round single stack magazines with 1 in the chamber for a total of 9 shots fully loaded.

I am only selling because I am saving up for a new car. Otherwise I would keep it. 

If buying locally I will include a full box of 50 rounds.

If you have a C&R license I can ship directly to you but it will probably cost a large amount since UPS will demand next day delivery. 

Otherwise we have to meet in person. 

In order to buy this you need ONE of the following: 

1. Concealed Carry License 
2. Pistol Purchase permit
3. C&R license 

I do not live in Asheville but rather, over an hour away. Google my location and see what you think. I can meet in Sylva if you prefer since its closer. 

I have a little bit of wiggle room for negotiation.

(the ammo that I have sells at around $1-1.75 per round, so you would be getting it at 60% of retail cost.)

if you want the gun and ammo, but not ALL of the ammo, we can negotiate how much you want at about 15-20 dollars per box depending on the type. (I have an assortment of range ammo, and ammo that you would use to take down a buck)"

I have good reasons for selling it, but I won't allow anyone to step on me to get it.
IF you want one done right, this is it.
Straight up, full disclosure, ALL it needs is a rear night sight. It's getting dim. Easy fix)

I had listed it at 2k the other day, to make you happy and cover the cost of a site and having it slid in there I'll knock a $100 off reflected in the $1900 price.
(4/10/15) I have reduced the gun 2 times the FIRM! NO TRADE Price is the $1650 in Green at the top of the post where it says ""Price) Sorry for confusion.
Unless you show me a Trevor, I'm only looking for cash
The gun also comes with the 2 original flat bottom Dan Wesson mags, quality made for them by Checkmate. Nice stainless mags.
Has some marks on that rear sight from carry. The tough finish on the gun doesn't!)
The gun has the very best parts, no MIM. It's bad ass. The hand fitting done at CZ is perfect. The slide is tight, and feels like it's sliding on ball bearings.
I had the barrel crowned more for looks.
10/8 Performance 1911 extended Magazine Release 
10-8 PERFORMANCE LLC - 1911 Performance HD slide stop (flat bump on weak side)
STI Black Curved Trigger  
Complete Trigger job done at that time (can't recall but I think 3.5 lb break, like glass for sure)
The gun was completely done in Black Diamond Black DLC  Matte Ionbond ($300 plus $40 Shipping for a standard 1911.)
That isn't comparable to the black duty coat that CZ uses. The duty coat is susceptible to discoloration, chipping and peeling in bad situations. Ion-bonding is a molecular  bonded to the metal. It is scratch resistant, rust inhibiting, and adds lubricity to moving parts.
I did every small part all the way down to the grip screws and bushings.
Light scratches can be wiped away with gun oil. I'm not saying it's impermeable but it's the best thing I've found PERIOD. Bar non (Same company that does FN SCAR Uppers and Kahr PM9 DLC and the like)

I have treated it in frog lube since birth. When you run the gun the frog lube heats up and bonds to the porous surface creating a rust shield. It was developed by Navy Seals for salt water operations. Look it up.

I have installed VZ 320's in Carbon Fiber. I took them off and reshaped them taking off all hard edges and thinning the thickest part of the grips down. They look stellar.


You simply can't buy one like it. Don't hesitate. If you want a bad ass, this is your chance to get one......."

Infrequent full-frame ""SB"" model. Blued finish, rounded trigger guard, slide safety, 1st model series with the magazine release near the trigger guard.  4.9” barrel, “No Dot” sights, straight grip front strap.

This is a used DOE re-sale. Holster wear evident, some light pitting on slide. Night sights, ambidextrous safety, oversized Pachmayr grips. Greater shooter, quality Italian Beretta manufacture.  Doubtful if collectible condition IMO.  

Full Disclosure:  there is a flange missing near the ejection port (see photo).  Does not affect operation of the 92SB.  Pull as fast as you like, the pistol runs true.  No claim of bad goods bought:  the Beretta shoots full-on, despite slide guide rail issue.

Bought these at a gun show out west in 2 years ago.  Looks like they might be bringbacks? Paid $800 for them asking $550.

Operates on 2 AA batteries (one in each side) so rechargeables solar batteries should work.  

They perform perfectly - very loud -  and everything works well.   Microphone, earpieces, volume switch/on-off switch are 10x10 ;)  Rugged looking, a little scratched up from obvious use. 

They fit comfortablly under a helmet.  Don't know alot about the radio connection or the PTT.

The problem is many of the groups there have become nothing short of a high school filled with cliques, whiners, complainers, pictures of internet jokes, silly rules and a whole lot more 'Bullshit' than actual trading, buying and selling!
If you are entertained by this sort of thing then join them and have fun. 
But if you are interested in a streamlined alternative to them, armslist and craigslist, we are starting up a new Facebook group that will be strictly buying, selling and trading gear without all the other Bullshit!

I noticed that the numbers are great on some of these groups, yet the posts and chronic complainers who troll other peoples posts always seem to be the same few. 
We're looking for grown adults who just want to trade without all the other bullshit rules, trolls, internet jokes and pics and opinions

If you're ready for something different go to your facebook page and search 
""NH Outdoorsmen Trading Post"" and click 'join'

There you can buy, sell, and trade Guns, Ammo, Gear, Parts, Fishing and Hunting Gear, Military Surplus, and anything related to the outdoors.

Two Id`s required -NO EXCEPTIONS
2007 Taurus PT1911 .45
I bought this last year from the original owner . It had NEVER been fired . He bought it and stowed it away in his safe . I know this to be true because when I cleaned it it had all of the factory grease still on it.  I have since put around 1000 rounds through it . People talk crap about  Taurus , but I seriously have not ever had an issue with any ammo or mags I have used . This pistol has ALOT of features that are usually reserved for higher end 1911 `s .
Polished feed ramp , front slide serrations , and great checkering on the frame .  and matched slide and barrel . Full length guide rod . Comes with two factory mags , original box , with paperwork ,and takedown tool .  I have misplaced the original black plastic grips . I installed RAASCO Dymondwood walnut grips with thumb relief for easy mag release . This has been one really reliable pistol . Meticulously maintained , with very little wear . Perfectly broken in . The ONLY reason I am even considering selling this great pistol is , I recently came across a Colt Gold Cup . : )  I am firm on the price . WIll also include a Bianchi holster with the deal .

I am looking to potentially sell or trade my socom ii in a sage EBR stock.  I installed a TRW oprod and trigger group, sadlak piston, and badger spring guide.  The rifle has had a few hundred rounds through it.  I can include upto 12 20rd mags (mostly korean surplus, almost as good as usgi, and some springfield armory).  I can toss in the vortex sparc red dot if wanted.  Just a quick breakdown of the cost behind the rifle;

socom ii - 1900
ebr stock - 800
USGI trigger and oprod - 400
mags, red dot, sadlak piston/badger spring guide - ~300

All in all I have put near 3500 in this rifle, not counting shipping/tax/etc..  Obviously with the way the market is I won't get near that.  I am looking for around 2500 cash.  TRW made the best USGI m14 parts and they are exceedingly hard to get these days.


I also would be interested in trades.  I don't have anything in particular that I am looking for, so shoot me an offer that you think is fair.  I am located in Orlando, but willing to drive a bit if the deal is worth it.

I have a LNIB Glock G27 bought new, fired 3-4 times, never carried. It has everything that came with it new plus 3.5 LB trigger connector installed, 2 pinky/+1 mags extensions making them 10 rnd mags, frame plug and polished feed ramp.

Cash price: I would take $600 for the gun with all the extras and 300 rounds of ammo

Small, light, accurate, powerful: all accurately describe the GLOCK 27. With its comfortable dimensions and the proven advantages of the GLOCK pistol family, the G27 is popular with police, both on and off duty. That's why so many law enforcement agencies issue this subcompact pistol, in .40 caliber, as their official backup pistol.

What I am hoping for is that someone out there has a 9 mm Glock and would like to bump up to a 40 cal, maybe they have more 9 mm's than they need.
Plus I have 300 rounds of ammo to trade for 9mm ammo.

As I said I love the gun and I don't have to get rid of it the so don't waste our time with low-ball offers the gun is like new and I would like to trade for a like new G19 or G26 gen 3-4."

Nikko was the manufacturer for the Winchester 101 during the time this gun was manufactured.  So basically, most everything on this gun is the same as the Winchester 101.  This makes getting replacement parts relatively easy if you needed to.  It is not uncommon for a Nikko M 707 Shadow to sell for $1,000-$1,500 in excellent condition.  This particular of mine is in perfect working condition.  The exterior of the gun is 90%-92% condition.  There are a few minor scratches and the wood and the blueing is starting to wear thin in a couple of spots, but overall the blueing is in great shape.  It has raised aluminum ribs to increase accuracy.  This gun has absolutely beautiful engravings and diamonding."

This is touted as the original piston AR since it combines an AK style piston that runs an AR style bolt. Takes AR magazines and is chambered for .223/5.56 ammo. Simple takedown and runs much cleaner than an AR due to no gas fouling in the breech. I fired 30 rounds through it with no problems whatsoever, very accurate and fun rifle to shoot.

The Ti-RANT series are ultra-high-performance sound and flash suppressors for today's 9mm and .45 Auto handguns. Advanced material selection gives the Ti-RANT series unequalled durability despite compact dimensions and light weight. For 2011, users will be able to remove the 17-4 PH stainless steel and hard coat anodized 7075-T6 aluminum alloy baffles from the Grade 9 Titanium tube for cleaning and maintenance using a supplied end cap spanner.   Class-defining sound reduction is worthless if your silenced handgun is unreliable. To ensure reliable functioning with all popular host pistols, the Ti-RANT series incorporates a second-generation A.S.A.P (Assured Semi Automatic Performance) booster system. The fully integrated A.S.A.P. System enables flawless semi-automatic operation and can be quickly and easily disassembled for service by the end-user without the use of tools.   The previously military-only ""Short"" versions are available for civilian purchase. For added sound and flash reduction on these short models, a wet charge of 5cc's of water will increase performance by up to 30% and will remain effective for 20 to 50 shots.

The integrated ASAP System of the EVOLUTION silencers achieves complete reliability under the most demanding conditions. The ASAP System is a recoil boosting mechanism which ensures reliable pistol operation, allows for zero-shift adjustment, provides for modularity to support multiple weapons platforms, and aids in making the EVOLUTION one of the most efficient silencers in the world. Compact and light weight, the EVOLUTION silencer preserves the balance and handling characteristics of the pistol, making full-time suppressor use a reality. The reduction of muzzle report eliminates the need for ear protection, preserves field communications and masks the location of the shooter.
 
For weapons with fixed, non-moving barrels, an accessory fixed barrel spacer is available to ensure reliable and safe operation.
 
A spring loaded, 3-lug coupler enables users to attach an EVOLUTION 9 to an H&K MP-5 or any host weapon featuring a 3-lug barrel or adapter manufactured to H&K specifications. When installed, a self locking feature prevents the 3-lug coupler from inadvertently unscrewing from silencer body. The Matte Black treated alloy steel construction of the 3-lug coupler acts as a blast shield and further protects the other internal components during fully automatic firing.
