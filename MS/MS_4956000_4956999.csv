Gun has been shot maybe 20 times, it's ideal for anyone into big bore revolvers and great for hunting!  Comes with scope mount and two sets (medium and high) of fiber optic front sights that are interchangeable between red and green, plus the standard black ramp front sight too.

These are really nice guns, without question they're nicer than any Ruger single action.  From the factory it has a hand lapped barrel, recessed cylinders (it's a 5 shot), a free spinning cylinder, a locking base pin, drilled and tapped for scope use and has a good trigger on it too.  Recoil is there but due to it's size and heft, it's really not that bad.  Also shoots .45 Colt ammo, which through this gun is about like shooting a .22.

The gun is very nice, shoots extremely well and is practically brand new, I just don't shoot it, you could call it a safe queen. These run new at Buds for around $950 before tax and two extra front sights run over $50, but I'm asking $775 OBO for a practically new gun and a few extras.  Also comes with a soft MidwayUSA zip up case.

The box includes the original mini-screwdriver for sight adjustment that I have not seen offered with any other resale of this pistol. Fully adjustable rear sights!! This iconic pistol began the trend towards the production by other manufacturers of compact 1911-style pistols, which continues to the present day, but without the grip safety. Weight empty is 25 oz – specs can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Model_PD.
Late production – 1989. I Sprinco PLATE+ moly-coated (http://www.sprinco.com/plateplus.html) the barrel for 72 hours and treated all metal parts. A total of 382 shots have been fired since I bought it NIB, without any issues. On last shot, the after-market mags don't always keep the slide open - I never shot enough to justify trying to work out why.  The pistol uses an internal, hard plastic buffer to reduce the battering effects of recoil on the alloy frame. This buffer gradually wears with use, and requires replacement after firing approximately 1000 rounds. It is still in good condition and I can refer you to a supplier of these. The bore, finish and grip are very good, reflecting the low bullet count and infrequent carry. The trigger pull is light and crisp.

Bought this monster because I was loading 44 mag for a Super Blackhawk and I wanted a fun lever toy to go with it. But after trading the Super Blackhawk, I started to lose interest. I found out that I was NOT going to become Buffalo Bill Cody. Oh well. The one thing I did do was swap the sights out for Steve's Gunz bullseye ghost ring in the rear and a red fiber optic front (still have factory sights). Much easier than the stock sights to zero in on target. The action is great, pumped out any ammo I fed it (around 100 rounds or less). Kept it clean and well maintained. This thing is built. Solid, hefty.
Selling this because I found something else I'm intersted in, and the rule is ""One in means one out""
Not the best pics, I know. More available if needed.

This rifle has light chamber rust. Rounds chamber just fine, but the fire-formed brass shows denting from the rust and is difficult to eject. I haven't attempted to remove the rust but I found a few methods online that might work and save you the trouble of honing the chamber. 

The rest of the gun works perfectly, and I have shot sub-MOA groups with factory ammo on multiple occasions (smallest I measured was .55 MOA) so it's a real tack driver.

 Remington put their all in the Golden Saber line and this 357 Magnum round shine like the rest! In developing the Golden Saber line, Remington demanded that it would meet the following four precarious fundamentals; match-type accuracy, deep penetration, maximum expansion, and virtually 100% weight retention. Remington Golden Saber also feature mouth and primer waterproofing for longevity of the rounds, are treated with powder for low muzzle flash and primers that must go through three (3) inspections before being put out on the market.

Comes in original box with safety /instruction manual and one magazine. 
Gun does fire, but when the trigger goes back to the start position, it does not reset. The person who sold it to me, failed to mention this issue. I called the gunsmith and they said it was probably the trigger spring needing to be replaced, but they were busy until the middle of January. 
So, if you can fix these things, here you go. I'd rather have Christmas money right now anyways, than wait.

Buyer must be able to provide TN drivers license as well as be able to legally own/purchase a firearm. Please include name AND phone number or I will not reply.

This was my Father's gun, he passed in March of this year.
I have not looked up the serial number, but I know it dates from the early 80's.
It does have some minor handling marks, he did hunt with it, but overall it is still 97%.
This is a 12 gauge, with 2 3/4"" chamber.
This has the high gloss wood that is beautifully engraved with checkering.
The receiver is also engraved as well, Remington certainly does not make guns like this anymore.
This pre dates rem chokes, so it has 3 barrels total, I am selling this as a package and not interested is selling the barrels separate.

All the barrels have the vent rib, which is a nice touch.
They are as follows:
Full choke 30""
Modified 28""
Skeet 26"" The gun is currently wearing the Skeet barrel. All three barrels are in outstanding condition.
Unfortunately I do not have the box or anything else for it, just the shot gun and the barrels, they will be delivered in 2 soft cases which are yours to keep.

If the ad is up, then yes it is still available.
Must be 18 or older with a valid IN DL, LTCH (carry permit) would be nice, but not a deal breaker.

The rifle currently has installed an ultimak gas tube, CNC warrior brake pinned and welded. Magpul akm hanguard, us palm grip, and a tapco g2 trigger. The rifle will come with 4 black circle 10, 3 clear circle 10, and 3 black polish magazines. The rifle has a brand new barrel that is cut to the correct length. It is ready to SBR as soon as it is engraved. The only thing I really want to keep is the sling. I also widened the rear sight to help with quick sighting. I got the rifle from one of the nightmare people everyone is worried about on the internet. Once I got the rifle home, I realized it had a horrible jamming problem. After sending the rifle to have the problem fixed, I got it back, tried to sight it in and realized the barrel was bent. Another 2 trips to a gunsmith had the rifle running problem free. The rifle is guaranteed to work. If it does not, I will gladly help you out. A SLR-106CR that is guaranteed to work is a hard thing to find. I really like the rifle and don't want to trade it, but I need a shotgun as I no longer have one that I would trust my life with. The only trade I want is a benelli m4. If you are interested, send me a message. The reason I don't list a cash price is because of the screwing I got from the guy who traded it to me. I have 500 dollars in it just to get it to work correctly not including the accessories and magazines. Also, as I said, I do really like it, so I'm not going to trade it for something I don't need or that has no practical use. Thanks for looking."
