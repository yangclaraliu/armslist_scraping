Slightly used Taurus PT111 G2 chambered in 9mm Luger. This weapon is an outstanding choice for a number of applications ranging from concealed carry to daily duty. This is by far one of the safest pistols on the market today. Not only does it have a lever safety on the slide, but it also has a trigger safety, and a lockable action which you will only find on Taurus brand handguns. This weapon is SA/DA which is single action/ double action. Basically, you rack the gun once and go. The SA/DA co figuration makes for lightning fast follow up shots, and if you happen to have a dreaded light primer strike, (which never happens in these weapons) then you can follow with another pull of the trigger, instead of jacking the bullet out and hoping it doesn't fire afterwards. This gun has been a daily carry for me for about a month and I absolutely love it. The weight, the balance, the ease of use, everything is outstanding about this pistol. The two magazines it comes with will hold 12 rounds a piece, so if you have a full mag with one in the chamber, you've got 25 rounds on you at all times. This gun is insanely accurate, and has been meticulously cleaned and rebuilt days ago. Perfect as a first pistol, or for someone with a lot of experience. Most Glock guys love these pistols, because they are built with a lot of similarities. This one is just safer! I can't say enough about this gun. Comes with two magazines, a versacarry concealed carry clip holster, the original box and equipment, and 26 RDS of ammo."

Beginning with its significant role in the Civil War to its renowned status as one of the most sought-after rifles in the Western frontier, the Henry rifle has become a legendary part of American history. To this day, all Henry rifles continue to be ""made in the USA and priced right."" High-end American-walnut stock on this rifle compares favorably to the quality found in guns costing three times more. The blued-steel 18 inch barrel is machined with state-of-the-art multiple groove rifling for exquisite accuracy. Fully adjustable semi-buckhorn rear sight with a white diamond insert and highly visible brass beaded hooded front sight seated in standard 3/8"" dovetail slots. Metal barrel band secures the barrel and the high-capacity 15 shot tubular magazine to the stock. Receiver is grooved for scope mounting. Easy-to-load tubular magazine. Made in USA. This gun has never been fired. Has original factory box."

Designed specifically for wild boar hunting, Winchester Razorback XT Centerfire Ammo delivers the deep penetration and maximum expansion needed for wild hogs. The one-piece, lead-free, gilding metal bullet features a beveled profile for optimum weight retention and strength to drive through a hog's tough hide and bone. Then the deep hollow point expands the Razorback XT to its maximum potential for extreme knockdown power. Powered by flash suppressed powders that reduce muzzle flash, this cartridge works great in low light hunting or after dark with night vision technology. The Razorback XT's nickel plated, re-loadable brass shell case feeds and functions smoothly in both high performance bolt-action rifles and modern sporting rifles.

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 can pack six or seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame, depending on the magazine (this version includes both).

Sig Sauer has included both a 6-round (flush fit) and 7-round (extended) magazine with a finger-grip extension. In addition, this P938 also comes equipped with a SIG laser.

X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser

The SIG X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser for the P938™ Pistol is a compact, lightweight, red pointing laser used for aiming. The X38-TGL combines pinpoint accuracy and rapid target acquisition with intuitive operation, in a form fitting package weighing only 1.0 oz.

$340 firm in cash.

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, so I will be pretty picky.  If offering a trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  Below are items I will consider.  I already have several firearms in the platforms and calibers listed below along with plenty of ammunition for all, but again, I may trade if the deal makes sense on my end, otherwise I will pass on trades and wait for cash.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants.  

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP(HK, Beretta, XDM 5.25, maybe the 4.5"", depending) maybe .357 Sig or 10mm, but may consider other models, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag., maybe others.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590 models & 930 SPX), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars, maybe gold in grams

Maybe quality optics like Vortex 4-16x(mid level models) or greater, maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

I've owned this gun since 2009. I purchased it as a target shooter when I was a member of the Outdoor Sportsman Club of Mitchell. I haven't been a member for about nearly as long as I've owned the gun. I shot about half a box of 555 rds, so about 270 rds. It's a fun gun. It's futurist looking. 

This gun has received the full recall servicing required by Beretta to repair the recall issue in which some of the pistols had fired even when the safety was activated. There were some cases, in which pistols would fire when the safety was moved from the OFF to the ON. 

I disclose this fact because I was completely unaware of this issue until I decided to sell the gun. I strongly advise before buying any gun to be educated about it. As soon as I found out about the recall, I requested an RMA from Beretta and sent it to them for servicing. This is a beginner pistol and safety is paramount with firearms."

It is a Vietnam bringback that a family member of mine brought home after his service. Obviously, it has no import marks on it. The M21 SKS was manufactured by the Chinese and has no manufacturing arsenal marks or other Chinese characters on it. This ""sanitized"" version was made like that so they could be supplied to the North Vietnamese quietly while China could claim that they weren't supplying them. The rifle is a milled receiver type. The stock and handguard set that are on it now are a replacement set that I put on it. I also have the originals that it had when it was picked up in the field. The original stock that it had on it appears to have been hand made in the jungle as the inletting is fairly crude with rough chisel marks and it looks like the butt was cut with a hand saw. I am including both sets with the rifle. The rifle is a fine shooter and is more accurate than most SKS's I have fired. I can't remember ever having a jam or malfunction in the 20 something years I have owned it. I am selling the rifle with both stock sets for $400."

THE SIGMA WAS SMITH & WESSON 'S FIRST VENTURE INTO USING SYNTHETIC MATERIALS IN GUN CONSTRUCTION, USING HIGH-STRENGTH POLYMER MATERIAL FOR THE FRAME. THE GUN IS SIMILAR TO A GLOCK SAFE-ACTION PISTOL IN BOTH ITS DESIGN AND OPERATION.

IN 1999 SMITH & WESSON INTRODUCED THE VE SERIES. THESE MODELS WERE BILLED AS 'ENHANCED' AND FEATURED AN IMPROVED GRIP, IMPROVED TRIGGER, AND ENLARGED EJECTION PORT. THIS MODEL RETURNED TO THE BLACK COLORATION OF THE POLYMER FRAME MATED WITH A STAINLESS STEEL OR BLACK MELONITE SLIDE.
AT THIS TIME SMITH & WESSON RETIRED THE 4.5 INCH BARREL AND SWITCHED ALL SIGMAS TO THE 4.0 INCH BARREL. SIGMAS FROM THIS ERA ONWARD ARE CONSIDERED '2ND GENERATION' SIGMAS. SHORTLY AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE VE SERIES, SMITH & WESSON FURTHER IMPROVED IT BY ADDING AN ACCESSORY RAIL BUT DID NOT CHANGE THE MODEL NUMBER TO REFLECT THIS UPDATE.

Up for sale is a like new Barrett M82A1 CQ (20.6” barrel) in .50 BMG. I bought this gun new and have put about 35 rounds through it. It has been very well cared for. This gun is an absolute blast to shoot, the recoil is very soft and it really is something to squeeze off a round from this rifle and feel the power you are unleashing.
It comes with all of the factory equipment (Pelican case, cleaning kit, manuals, and 1 10 round magazine. In addition, it has the following extras:
- 1 extra 10 round magazine ($150 value)
- Rear Monopod ($148 value)
- Barrett Accessory Rail Kit ($169 value)
- Webbing Kit, Sling, etc ($49 value)
- Three piece military M107 Takedown pins ($75 value not available from Barrett)
That is a total of almost $600 in extras!

Thanks!
