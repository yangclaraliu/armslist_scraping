Hi i am getting out of Nitro RC and getting into hunting, so I am selling this Nitro Rustler in absolutely excellent shape, and nothing is wrong with it at all! This truck has had about 12 tanks of fuel through it since brand new and was broke in EXACTLY how manual said to, it does show signs of use as any truck that was driven should but wasn't abused at all. After run oil was always used, and the truck was ran a tiny bit rich for longevity.

Truck will come with all stock parts and upgrades plus the EZ start wand, charger, battery, plus the glow plug wand and the original tools it came with...it will need fuel and the carb adjusted slightly for the cooler temperatures.
-The EZ start wire wasn't giving the plug fire, so I disconnected the glow plug wire...then i bought a glow plug wand, and kept the EZ start motor so now it works flawlessly! 

Overall this is a really nice truck, and I hate to see it go but hunting is more my style! $350


Upgrades are as follows...
-New better receiver with another slot for an extra servo/lights/telemetry
-RPM A-arms on front and new rear ones not yet installed
-RPM front bumper 
-Blue Aluminum Resonator pipe(better overall and good amount more low end power too) 
-Jato wheels and tires hardly used, no more than 5 runs 
-Jato front shocks (stiffer and better for my purposes)
-New glow plug wand(comes with extra battery)

Extra parts that are included...
-body clips
-2 air filter elements
-1 54T, and 1 72T spur gear
-3 extra glow plugs (2 brand new)
-2 extra axles
-1 new axle carrier
-tie rod ends with balls
-RPM rear A arms
-Servo arm
-1 extra wheel bearing and nut

All stock parts, and everything in the box when new will come with it including...
-original wheels and tires (used a little bit but tons of good tread left)
-front bumper
-Front shocks
-front A arms
-original exhaust, pretty much new
-all suspension shims and revalving pieces.
-EZ start glow plug wire
-Traxxas transmitter

These 3"" K-frames are regarded by many as the perfect concealed carry .357 Magnum. This reputation was gained on behalf of the size, weight, round butt frame, barrel length, fixed combat sights, stainless steel, and full length ejector rod. These M&Ps were one of the last revolvers to see widespread use by Law Enforcement, with the FBI being the most high profile user of these guns. If you intend to carry a .357 IWB, then this is one of the best choices available. For those of you that camp, hike or hunt, the 3"" K-frames make for the perfect Florida woods gun.

This particular gun is in excellent overall condition. This is not a beat-to-hell Police trade-in gun. There are some small nicks here and there, which is normal for a revolver this old. The gun has an estimated 500 rounds through it. There is no evidence of flame cutting on the top strap and the forcing cone looks great. This gun comes with the original factory Magna grips.

Several of these S&Ws, in similar condition, recently SOLD (not LISTED) for $700 on Gunbroker. The pre-lock guns have steadily risen in value. They have become highly desirable and their market values have adjusted accordingly. I personally believe these pre-lock S&Ws will continue to rise in value, as Smith and Wesson no longer makes them with this level of parts quality and hand-fitting. Sorry folks, but I won't be trading this one for your Taurus, Ruger, or Grandpa's old single shot. Ridiculous offers that are not even on the same playing field will be ignored. 

**SALE PENDING** Price is $700 FIRM face-to-face in Tampa Bay. Florida Driver's License and CCW required. If no CCW, then a signed Bill of Sale will be required."

REAL 50-320 (great hunting bullet for 50-caliber muzzleloaders)

$13 for each.  This is a great deal!  $40 for all!

Also available is a CUSTOM size .306 sizer.  This odd size is great for duplicating standard 7.62x38R Nagant loads and has applicability in other cartridges.  This cost me $40 since it is custom made.  If you have a use for it, it is yours for $15

Thanks for looking!  Happy casting and shooting!"

Glock 23 Gen 3, two 13-rd mags and case. Pistol slide has the latest NiB-X military grade coating, the best firearms coating in the industry, read about it: hardest yet smoothest coating for superior lubrication and wear resistance. Don't take my word for it, research it yourself. Upgrades include mag well plug and extended mag release button.
Gun has little use, no ""smiley"" marks on barrel. It is basically new in 100% condition.
Trying to fund an upgrade to a Gen 4.

So, that makes it pretty special. I also have done some searching and found the original Bipod and NIGHT SIGHTS that are impossible to come by. Still have original box also.
I think this rifle was number 9 out of 14 (I'm going to call Czechpoint to confirm which number via Serial#). After running out of the Beech, they went to the composite furniture and then the folding metal stock, which is where they are now (sold out though).

In case you think this is just another AK, then you are very wrong. No parts are interchagable and they are VERY different (although they DO look the same). Here are some of the differences:

Short gas piston
Milled receiver, not stamped
About a pound lighter
Hold open cover at the end of the magazine
Can be fed by clip while open
Striker fired (similar to Glock)
Tilting lock action with dropping block (similar to Walther P38, or Beretta 92s)
Aluminum Alloy Magazines

When it is first picked up, it is noticed how well it is balanced. Has been said that it feels like an M14. It will shoot a 123 grain projectile at over 2200 fps. A bit faster and very accurate as hell.

I have it set up right now with the Zahal furniture, which is worth a pretty penny too. Little compartments everywhere and rails upon rails. Nice tactical set up compared to older set up. I can deliver in either configuration. Both are in EXCELLENT condition."
