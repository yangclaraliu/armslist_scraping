•	Nagant Revolver: $400. 1938 Tula arsenal refurb. Wood grips, comes with holster and lanyard. Early import with discreet import marks under the barrel. Comes with 34 boxes of milsurp ammo (476 rounds). I have done a little work on the spring to lighten the trigger pull. 
•	Romanian Tokarev Pistol: $550. 1953 dated pistol, great bluing, shoots great. Comes with leather military holster and 2 original mags. Comes with around 1,000 rounds of military surplus ammo packed in 72 round boxes. 
•	Antique Vest Pocket Pistol: $175. Single shot, nickel plated wood grips, .22 short caliber. Wood grips are perfect, some pitting throughout but functionally great. Comes with around 30 rounds of .22 shorts. I have fired this gun and it works. 
•	French Berthier Rifle: $500. Nothing wrong or missing. Handguard wobbles a bit from side to side but nothing major. This is the earlier 3-shot version of the rifle. Many were later converted to 5-shot versions. It comes with an early bayonet with zinc handle. Later bayonets had a brass handle. The bayonet is in great shape, with a scabbard in equally great shape. This rifle fires 8mm Lebel ammo from Mannlicher-style clips. This rifle comes with 4 of those clips, newly manufactured by a company in Australia; they function perfectly. Original clips are ridiculously expensive when you can find them. Includes a box of 8mm Lebel ammo.
•	Bullets for Reloading
x1: half box, 120 gr. Sierra Matchking HPBT 6.5mm bullets, approx. 50 ct. ($15)
x3: Hornady A-Max 6.5mm .264” 100 gr. bullets, 100 ct. ($25 each)
x1: .452 45 cal 250 gr. XTP bullets, 100 ct. ($25)
•	Japanese Arisaka Type 99: $500. 1941-produced rifle. Great rifling, chromed bore. Intact aerial rear sights. Defaced mum. Comes with Hornady die set, 1 box of Norma 174 gr. round nose bullets, 3 boxes of Hornady 150 gr. bullets, and around 120 pieces of PPU 7.7 Jap brass. 
•	1851 Colt Navy Revolver: $50. This gun is complete, but taken apart and needs refinishing. Includes everything to make a full pistol, including all the main parts and guts of the gun, save for one leaf spring that broke. Just needs to be refinished and I don’t have the time. 
•	H&R .38 S&W Top Break Revolver: $320 Good condition revolver, nickel plated with black rubber grips. Grips are perfect and not chipped. Nickel plating is very nice, Rifling in barrel is great, a bit of pitting in barrel. Comes with Lee die set, 30 rounds of black powder ammo, around that many cleaned cases, and about 350-400 lead bullets. 
•	VERY RARE Japanese VZ24 Mauser Rifle w/ Original Sling: $700. This VZ24 Mauser rifle was made in Czechoslovakia for the Imperial Japanese Navy. It is in great condition, bluing is good and so is the bore/rifling. Comes complete with the original cleaning rod. This rifle is NOT import marked anywhere, likely a veteran bring-back from WW2, although I do not have documentation. The receiver ring has no crest, only the date of 1937. The side of the receiver reads “CESKOSLOVENSKA ZBROJOVKA, A.S., BRNO” with “V.Z. 24” below it. The bolt serial number does not match the receiver. The serial number on the receiver and stock match, but the stock serial number has a “C” prefix. C and P prefix serial numbers are indicative of Japanese use. The jury is out as to what the serial number prefixes mean. Some say the P-prefix rifles were made for China (which were subsequently intercepted and used by the IJN), while those with C prefix were made for Japan. Others say that the C and P prefixes represented which Czech factory made the rifle. Most Japanese-used VZ24’s you see will exhibit the P-prefix serial number, but research indicates that C-serial numbered rifles were used by the Japanese as well. The NRA museum agrees with me, see the link below. The only way to tell for sure if the rifle was used by the Japanese is the presence of capture papers from WW2 or a sling marked with Japanese Kanji letters. This rifle has the original sling marked with Kanji letters, which are white and vibrant. Placing a value on this rare rifle is difficult as not many are offered for sale. Rock Island Auction estimates the price of a P-prefix rifle that is missing the cleaning rod and sling to go for $950-$1600. See link below. While I think this price is a bit optimistic, it indicates that this is no ordinary run-of-the-mill VZ24 rifle. My price is $700. Reasonable offers will be entertained. I prefer to deal locally, but can bend. Don’t miss this opportunity to add a very rare Mauser rifle variant to your collection!

I've only put 50rds through it and got it in a trade used (sling and stock pack a new).  Prior to me, I do not know the round count.  Everything works and is in proper condition.  I had a mishap with solvent and it stripped the clear coat from the left side of the stock that runs from above the trigger assembly forward by the checkering (about the length of a hand).  You can sort of see it in the picture, it's lighter looking.  The wood is fine though.
I'm not interested in trades, just cash.  I'm not parting-out either, with the rifle gone, I have no use for the other items.  I can meet in the Augusta-to-Aiken area.  Let's make a deal.

It comes in the box and with a cowboy style holster and, if you are in AZ, 50 rounds of cowboy action load 45 Long Colt as I won't need it anymore.  

I will ask for a cash transaction and will meet you at my local FFL gun shop so everything is above board with an FFL transaction.  I checked with them and they will only charge you the normal $35 Background check fee.  If you have a CCW you will be able to take it home.  If not they will hold it for you until you pass the background check.  Once we meet and you let me know you want to buy the gun you will pay me and they will do the FFL portion.  Once I leave the gun shop with payment I will not be responsible for you passing the background check and will not give refunds.  In other words the deal is final.

If you want me to ship it I will do that, but will ship from my FFL to your FFL and will add $60 to the price as that is what I was told it will cost.  I will ask for payment before I ship in this case as I don't know any other safe way to do the transaction."

There are a couple small scratches on the barrel I will include pictures of.  Other than that it is a beauty.  My kids are getting too old and want to shoot bigger guns now.  Teenagers!

It comes in the box and with the manual.  I also have a couple of holsters I will give you and I have 4 clips instead of the two it came with.  

I will ask for a cash transaction and will meet you at my local FFL gun shop so everything is above board with an FFL transaction.  I checked with them and they will only charge you the normal $35 Background check fee.  If you have a CCW you will be able to take it home.  If not they will hold it for you until you pass the background check.  Once we meet and you let me know you want to buy the gun you will pay me and they will do the FFL portion.  Once I leave the gun shop with payment I will not be responsible for you passing the background check and will not give refunds.  In other words the deal is final.

If you want me to ship it I will do that, but will ship from my FFL to your FFL and will add $60 to the price as that is what I was told it will cost.  I will ask for payment before I ship in this case as I don't know any other safe way to do the transaction."

Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery ,providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling. The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you''ll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot.

Original manuals, hang-tags, unused case key, and original two-barrel case (that looks amazing for being 50+ years old). Has been kept oiled and rust-free for its entire life, barrels are (of course) Belgian as well. 

Barrels: 
#1: 28” Vent-rib, modified choke, made in Belgium and original to the firearm
#2 30” Vent-ride, full choke, made in Belgium and also original to the firearm
No rust, and bluing is true and even; it’s slightly worn where the forestock has touched it over the years on both barrels.

Case:
Original Browning locking case (with original unused key) in truly stunning condition--it is also original to the firearm and has its “nauga-hide” hang-tag. 


There are no repairs and no cracks and the bluing is terrific on the gun and both barrels, but there are marks on the stock that tells you it’s has been out before (and got a few clays and ducks).

No rust, no issues whatsoever, oiled and cleaned regularly. It was last fired six months ago. The only condition issue would be the original purchaser's social security number on the underside of the firearm behind the trigger guard (family member).

It’s a 1958 model, as are both (made in Belgium) barrels. They were all purchased together in Sunnyvale, CA at a Coast-to-Coast hardware store in the late 50s.

Please, local Oregon or Washington residents in-person and face-to-face. The legalities and pain-in-the-butt of shipping these things is not something I'm interested in (unless you're having a gun shop do it).

I’m in downtown Portland, Oregon and am more than happy to let any potential buyer fully examine, insepct, and check out this firearm before any funds change hands. Cash-only, local-only, no trades, and (please) no shenanigans."

Second I have a bolt action 20 guage shotgun. It's a mossberg has a 2 shot magazine and can fit one in the chamber. The barrel is ported and has the adjustable ""versa choke"" has rifle sights on it. And the choke is quite effective. Makes a perfect slug gun and I've shot basically everything threw it. Doesn't like to feed the cheap silver  bottomed target loads. Another cool thing about this is it has the cut out and is tapped for the ""one man trap gun"" it was a clay thrower that would attach to the gun(very rare if you could find) 

 Asking best FAIR offer. Just ask most I can say is no, Xmas is coming sonincan use $$$ looking for quick sale Or trade I'm into many things mostly older guns.
