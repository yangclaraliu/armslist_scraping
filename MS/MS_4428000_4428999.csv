This is NOT the standard Accu Shadow. It is the Custom Accu Shadow. See below description from CZ Custom:

CZC ACCU Shadow  (CZC Custom Version with Match Fit Barrel) 
CZC MATCH BARREL & FIXED SIGHT

CZC 75 SP01 ACCU Shadow #91735
USPSA Production Approved!
Features
*CZC Fitted Match Barrel
*CZC Stainless steel barrel bushing.
*CZC Stainless steel reverse plug.
*CZC SHORT reset trigger system “CZC SRTS”
*CZC Competition Fixed rear sight.

Let’s talk about the difference

We have hand fitted the ""Made in the USA"" CZC Match Grade Barrel, tighter fit and tolerance then standard factory barrel.

The new barrel bushing is threaded into the slide; the bushing is fitted to the barrel creating far less play than the current bushing system. The bushing also retains the new stainless steel guide plug.

Ransom Rest testing at 50 yards with Fiocchi 125 JHP (A ZERO bullet) has proved group of less than 3” compared with a factory new gun at about 5.0”. At 25 yards the groups were around 1.2” a one-hole group."

From the website:
One of the first things a GLOCK owner should consider is upgrading the stock trigger. ZEV builds the best triggers in the business and ZEV’s Adjustable Fulcrum Drop-In Trigger Kit was used to set multiple world records. The Adjustable Fulcrum Drop-In Trigger Kit only requires one tool (a standard 3/32nd punch), and 15 minutes of your time.
You will immediately notice the difference in your gun’s performance after installation:
• The trigger face is flatter and the trigger safety is three times wider than a stock trigger; this is ideal for quickly placing your finger in the optimal firing position. This will help build proper muscle memory for improved consistency and accuracy.
• Because of ZEV’s proprietary trigger bar refinements the trigger operates smoothly through the entire length of pull.
• The trigger’s crisp tactile reset gives the user a clear feeling for the moment of reset. This feedback improves the user’s ability to “ride the reset” to improve follow up shot speed and placement.
• The trigger weight can be adjusted to as low as 3 lbs. A lighter pull weight requires less pressure, reducing trigger fatigue and improving accuracy.
• The pre-travel and over-travel are adjustable to allow for a shorter pull, crisper break and faster reset.
• Trigger adjustments will give the benefit of shorter take up, post break travel and will result in a shorter reset.

Note: The differences between ZEV’s Drop-In Kit and the Ultimate Kit are a Skeletonized Firing Pin. The benefit of adding the Skeletonized Firing Pin is its lighter construction, polish, and the tip of the firing pin is extended for more positive primer ignition.
ZEV Parts always incorporate design, feel and performance. A Fulcrum Adjustable Trigger kit will upgrade the look of your gun as triggers come in a variety of color combinations. Finally, ZEV Trigger components are designed to last; replacing plastic stock parts with aluminum or stainless steel assemblies."

I have an all black Kimber Pro Carry II with night sights in great condition. I am the first owner; bought it 2ish years ago from NW Armory and have put fewer than 800 rounds through it. It is incredibly accurate, and is very light because it has an aluminum frame. Night sights are made by Meprolight, and are somehow still brighter than any on my other guns. There are a few small nicks on the underside of the frame, but nothing that hurts its appearance.

It will come with the original Kimber box/goodies, Kimber 8rnd mag, and takedown tool.

As far as trades, what I am mostly looking for would be a S&W Shield (9mm no safety prefered), a small 380, maybe a kahr, or potentially other small carry guns. I'm also a sucker for anything firing a pistol round that's threaded for my suppressor, so offer up any of those, including 300blk. May go for a hunting rifle.

Picked this up a bit ago but haven't the time or money to really go shoot it at all now so I'm selling it off. To my knowledge this doesn't apply to 922r laws either which is great since I'm including four thirty round magazines in this deal in addition to a five rounder for hunting or cheaper practice and its original 10 round magazine that can have a five round plug inserted.

Insert individually, use clips, or load up the magazines. This rifle can meet all those needs. Has some stock scratches and dings but its internals are beautiful and still in very good condition. Has original bayonet, cleaning kit in stock, and sling already attached.

All matching numbers and imported by D.I.G. in Virgina Beach."

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

Noticeable differences are MUCH better trigger, shorter reset as well, better safety made of steel with polymer overmold, easier takedown, more reliable on different types of 22lr, all American made parts, better sights, slightly larger threading on the barrel (with an adapter, you can throw in a silencer if that ever becomes legal in Iowa). Including 100 rounds CCI 22lr rounds, box, 2 mags, manual. NEW, never fired. Mag disconnect removed, found it got in the way of the trigger sometimes (briefly makes it a little choppy), no affect on the performance on the firearm, if anything an improvement. But if you prefer, I can re-install the part, it takes less than a couple min.

Un-altered. Not been tampered with. 7+1 Rim Fire cartridge capacity through the butt stock to the chamber. Lever action repeating rifle. The Model 1860 was manufactured from 1863-1865 (according to the serial number 25791, this rifle was made in 1863). 22” barrel. Six groove rifling (the post-Civil War altered conversions with Stabler device were three groove rifling and those made by Burnside Rifle Company in Providence, Rhode Island). Sling swivel at butt stock (an original factory feature). Only 45,785 were made in 1863. Low 5 digit serial number 25791 (the serial numbers started at 11,000 and went up to 61,000). Stock shows combat use. Metal ok condition. Bore ok. Mechanically good. Full functional. Very rare Civil War collectible. All of these made in 1863 were sent to the battlefield and used in combat, mainly by the North, or Union Cavalry (though some carbines fell into the hands of the South, or Confederacy). After the Civil War, over 11,000 1860’s were converted to metallic center fire cartridge; this gun wasn‘t. This carbine, as well as others like it, remained un-touched and un-altered, and were used by the military and civilians, including the American Indians, outlaws and law enforcement throughout the American West. There is no telling who originally owned this rifle during the Civil War and afterwards. It has quite a history to tell. “If it could only talk”! (see Flayderman’s Guide p. 633).

The total Hartford, Connecticut made series was 340,000. By the end of the Civil War in December 1865, production had reached 280,000. The 1849 Pocket was the successor to the Baby Dragoon, and the pre-version of the 1851 Navy Revolver. More 1849 Pocket’s were produced by Colt than any other of their percussion handguns. Many variations of the model were manufactured. A complete collection of Pocket’s would include 200 various revolvers. During the Civil War, the revolver was designed to be primarily used by Union officers for up-close personal protection. All 1849 Pocket’s were .31 caliber with 5 or 6 shot cylinders with attached loading levers. All barrels were octagonal with 3, 4, 5, or 6 inch lengths (no barrels were half octagon and half round). The common, standard barrel lengths were 4, 5 or 6 inch (the 6 inch bringing more money). The grips were one piece walnut. The trigger guards were small oval. The grip straps were silver plated brass. The markings include COLTS/PATENT on the left side of the frame, a stagecoach “hold up” scene on the cylinder, .31 cal. on the left side trigger guard frame and address on the top of the barrel. Three basic address barrel markings were used. This particular 1849 Pocket is a  Civil War revolver with a  5” barrel and 6 capacity and has the “one line New York“ address: ADDRESS COL. SAM L COLT NEW-YORK U.S. AMERICA. It was made in 1863 (SN 249951). Appears to be all original with all matching numbers. Action works and locks up tight. Nipples show normal use. Cylinder moves backwards and forwards just a little from use, but not side to side. It is not loose in the frame. Front sight worn. No cylinder scene, but shows serial number.

They acquired 127,156 of them over the course of the war. By the end of the war, Colt had produced 156,000. A total of 200,500 were manufactured from 1860-1873. The 1860 was a single action percussion revolver firing a .44 caliber round in a 6 shot cylinder having an 8 inch round barrel (the early models up to 50,00 had 7.5 inch barrels). The grips were a one piece walnut. The trigger guard was brass and the back strap was blued steel. There were two basic markings on the barrel: the early marking up to 50,000 was - ADDRESS SAML COLT HARTFORD CT. The later and standard barrel  marking after SN 50,000 was - ADDRESS COL. SAML COLT NEW-YORK U. S. AMERICA. Standard on the left side of the frame was: COLTS/PATENT. Stamped on the left shoulder of the trigger guard strap was: .44 CAL. The cylinder scene was the Texas and Mexico battle. Before serial number 50,000, was the use of the 4 screw type to accommodate the shoulder stock yoke.  After 50,000, was the use of the 3 screw type. Inspector markings may be found on the grips and various metal parts. Variations of the 1860 include: Standard model (and most common); 2nd and 3rd Model Type for the shoulder stock; and the LONDON marked (the LONDON marked were made in the Hartford factory and featured the barrel marking: ADDRESS COL. COLT LONDON). My particular Colt Model 1860 Army The Colt Model 1860 Army was one of the first great American side arms. It was the successor to the 3rd Model Dragoon and a modification of the Colt Model 1851 Navy. It ranks third in the total number produced of the various models of the percussion Colt handguns.  It is best known for its use during the American Civil War as the primary side arm used by the Union and Confederate troops. At the outset of the Civil War, the U. S. is the standard model in .44 caliber, 6 shot, with the 8 inch round barrel. According to the serial number, 97,463, it was manufactured in 1863 and was issued to the U. S. Military and saw action in the Civil War. It appears to be all original, with matching visible serial numbers. The action is smooth with correct indexing and the cylinder locks up tight when cocked. All the nipples are present and in good condition. The bore is good with decent rifling. The metal is good showing normal wear for its age. The gun has the correct visible markings on the barrel, cylinder and left side of frame. The cylinder scene is not completely visible due to age and use. The grips appear to be original with good walnut wood. It is an old gun and a real nice Colt 1860 Army Civil War revolver!"

(Also referred to as the “ARMY .44” or “REMINGTON ARMY .44”)


Remington & Sons of Ilion, New York began production of percussion revolvers based on the Fordyce Beals design in the 1850’s and early 1860’s. By the beginning of the Civil War, Remington was ready to produce the Remington-Beals revolver in .44 caliber Army and .36 caliber Navy models, which collectively became known as the Remington Model 1858. The revolvers were single action, 6 shot percussion revolvers with hexagon barrels. The Remington 1858 and the Colt 1860 were similar and were both used extensively in the Civil War (though historical accounts suggest that the soldiers on both sides preferred the Remington over the Colt due to durability and accuracy; the Remington allowed soldiers to keep a second loaded cylinder on hand to exchange quickly during battle and not to have to re-load so often as with the Colt). Eliphilat Remington died in 1861 at the outset of the Civil War, so the 1858 was one of the very last models for him to oversee. The 1858 was a successful design and helped to contribute to the manufacture of additional Remington revolvers such as the Model 1875 and 1890. The first Remington-Beals Army Model was made from 1861-1862. Only 1900 were made and 80% of them went to the U.S. Army. They were .44 caliber, 6 shot with an 8 inch octagon barrel. Remington-Beals also made the Navy Model in .36 caliber, 6 shot with 7.5 inch octagon barrel. The total estimated quantity was 14,500. Remington made the 1861 Model called the “Old Army” which was produced in 1862. It was a .44 caliber, 6 shot, 8 inch octagon barrel. The total quantity was 6,000. Remington made the 1861 Navy Model called the “Old Model Navy” which was produced in 1862 with a total quantity of 7,000. It was a .36 caliber, 6 shot and 7.38 inch octagon barrel. Remington made the “New Model Army” from 1863-1875 with total quantity being 122,000. It was .44 caliber, 6 shot, 8 inch octagon barrel. It, like all the others, had walnut wood grips and blued finish and a screwed-in front sight. The “New Model Army” had a low spur hammer as opposed to the others that had a high spur hammer. All model 1858’s had the same barrel markings: PATENEDSEPT.14.1858/E.REMINGTON&SONS.ILION,NEWYORK.U.S.A./NEW
MODEL. The “New Model Army” was the last of the Remington .44 caliber percussion revolvers. “Buffalo Bill” Cody carried a New Model Army from 1866 clear up into the mid 1870’s. He used his revolver to hunt buffalo, fight American Indians during the “Indian Wars” and claimed, “It never failed me!”  This revolver is an original, authentic, antique Remington “New Model” 1858 Army Percussion Civil War Revolver. 44 Cal. 6-shot. 8” Octagon Barrel. Serial #43655. Made in 1863. Standard Markings, “Patented Sept 14 1858/E Remington & Sons Ilion New York, USA/ New Model” are worn off. Has military inspector’s markings on various parts. The bore is good. Action works well and locks up tight when cocked. Metal is good and clean. Walnut grips fit tightly with no cracks or gouges. Remnants of a cartouche on left side. Overall a good collectible, original, authentic, antique Civil War Era Remington “New Model” 1858 Army 44."

I have included a description of the gun below and if you have any questions please feel free to ask. Thanks

DESCRIPTION:
Be the envy of your shooting friends with the GSG 522 SD. This GSG MP5 22lr rifle has it all...the looks, accuracy, price and cool accessories. If you're looking for a great shooting tactical 22 rifle that doesn't look like an AR15, the GSG 522 is one of the best options for you. 

You can easily add on some of the fun GSG 522 accessories like a retractable stock, a nice BSA Red Dot or a 110 round drum magazine.

The 522 SD has a sling loop built into the left side of the standard stock and one on the trigger guard. The SD does not have a front sling loop like the 522 carbine does.

All versions of the GSG 522 has a tactical rail up top that allows you to easily mount red dots, reflex red dots or any size scope you'd like to put up there. The rail is built in so there is no added parts to buy.

The GSG 522 SD features a rubber ribbed hand guard and larger ""SD"" barrel shroud. The GSG 522 carbine features a more rigid plastic hand guard and smaller barrel shroud. You can easily remove the front hand guard for cleaning or to put on an after market front hand guard."

This .40 caliber has a stainless-steel slide and barrel, as well as a stainless guide rod with captive spring assembly, an ambidextrous slide release, and steel 3-dot combat sights, not to mention a much better trigger than a Glock. This model doesn't have a manual or a magazine-disconnect safety. It is in excellent condition, and appears to have been kept in the case and not carried or shot a lot. It comes in the factory hardcase with all the factory paperwork, lock, and three different sized grip-inserts. It came with three 10-rd. magazines (one flush, two with extended-grip bases), and I purchased a 15-rd. mag and an X-Grip adapter that I will also include in this deal. I'm asking $425, which is less than I paid but EXTREMELY fair for an M&P. I'll even throw in a box of 180-grain JHP ammo (50 rounds, not 20) to fill all those magazines! I live in Garland, but I'll travel a REASONABLE distance to meet if needed. Please be prepared to show a photo ID."

That is solely YOUR responsibility to determine, and solely YOUR problem if you don't.JG Firearms Inst. 727/455-6596 Tarpon Springs -U.S. Army Veteran owned -I am an FFL, by appointment dealer (flexible hours)-Prices are firm, and are subject to change-Prices plus: $5 background check (Florida sales only)-+ sales tax (Florida sales)-For local sales there is a 3 day wait unless you have your CCWP (handguns only – not long-guns)-Don't send me any texts. All firearms should be checked by a gunsmith before firing.As I am not an expert, no guarantees of any kind are made. I have no way of personally test shooting the guns listed for sale.Stock photos maybe used and are listed only for illustrative purposes.Will sell guns on consignment.Trades possible, but only firearms.All sales are final and ""AS IS"".

The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCK history. Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size.When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.Specifications: Item #: PI-43502-01UPC_Code: 764503002533Description: GLK 43 9MM PST 6RD FSManufacturer: GlockModel #: 43Type: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: Black MatteStock: Hot Pink DuraCoated PolymerSights: FT: White Dot RR: White OutlineBarrel: 3.39""Overall Length: 6.26""Weight: 16.19 ozCaliber: 9mmCapacity: 6+1Action: Safe Action# of Mags: 2Packaging: Black Plastic CaseReceiver: Hot Pink DuraCoated Black PolymerWidth 1.02"

2 boxs of 325 rounds from Federal is designed for semi-automatic firearms chambered in .22LR. Where other rimfire loads fail to cycle a .22, Auto Match often gets the job done. These loose-packed cartridges use a 40 grain lubricated lead round nose bullet and achieve a muzzle velocity of around 1,200 feet per second.

An inexpensive round ideal for target practice, high-volume plinking, or helping a new shooter acclimate to firearms use, the .22LR is the top-selling cartridge in the world.

The rifle is in excellent shape cosmetically and it shoots very well. There are only two flaws worth mentioning, first it does have typical stock chipping right near the bolt (very minor but common problem on Lee-Enfield rifles) and the second is that it does not have the brass identification disc on the side of the stock (these brass discs are readily available online for only about $10). I would really prefer a face to face sale at Checkmate Pawn in Bellingham (I-594 compliance), however if there are no quick takers in Washington State I will ship the rifle to your FFL for $450, Checkmate Pawn in Bellingham can act as an escrow service."
