This is a genuine Leupold scope. Made in the USA with typical Leupold quality. Lifetime warranty, even if you buy it used.

I have used this scope a handful of times on a .22 rifle, and I've taken good care of it. It has a couple minor scuffs on the outside of the tube, but they are purely cosmetic. The lenses are in excellent shape. It's never been thrown in the back seat of a truck or dropped down a mountain. It holds zero and has great clarity. It's just not the right scope for my .22, so I'm letting it go.

Asking $200 for the scope, rings, and lens covers. If you know how much these go for normally without the rings & covers, you know this is a very fair price.

Cash only...I'm not interested in any trades at this time. I'm in Lynnwood, but may be willing to meet you somewhere else depending upon where you are."

Everyone needs a 30-06 in their rifle cabinet, here's a chance to get one with legendary Ruger reliability and performance.  Hinged floor plate on the magazine so nothing detachable to worry about - nor a stupid blind box like all the cheap new entry level guns.  3 position safety and locking bolt so you don't have to worry about it falling out on you going through the woods - again, like all the stupid new entry level guns without 3 position and no locking bolt.  Good shooting gun and the scope is clean with no scratches on the body or lenses.  Give a call if you're interested.  Steve @ (MT Area Code) 2o7-6828.  Asking $550/obo."

Background:
I am the original owner, and purchased this about a month ago. As soon as I got the gun I ordered an Apex Tactical forward set sear and aluminum flat face trigger. I had never shot an Apex trigger M&P before, but now I know what all the support is about. I've never felt a better trigger on a striker fired gun. It has the reliability of a striker fired M&P but with the smooth and light trigger pull of a 1911. I put 100 rounds through it and it shot great. Super easy follow up shots. I was originally going to shoot USPSA limited 10 with this but chose to continue shooting production with my Glock 34. This gun really needs to be seen, these triggers really are amazing. The gun itself goes for around $600 with the factory night sights. The Apex parts cost me $175. You could always buy this, install the factory trigger and sell the Apex parts and have yourself a great gun and some extra cash.

Price:
I am asking $500

It has a standard carbine length handguard, 16"" barrel, 1:9 twist so you can shoot heavier grain bullets, 6 position stock, and flat top rail.

On the rail is a very nice Nikon scope, 3x-9x power with dust caps.  It is zero'd at 100 yards and is extremely accurate!  A bipod is mounted on the handguard (I know, its on backward in the picture - just turned around so it would fit in my safe).  It also has a Magpul single point sling. Comes with two 30-round magazines.

It is in excellent condition with less than 150 rounds have been run through it.  I've got a bolt gun in .223 that I use more often, so this one needs to go.  This is NOT a fire sale.  I just figure there is someone out there that might give it more use than I ever will.  You will NOT be disappointed with this setup.

Asking $695 or best REASONABLE offer.  Again, this is not a fire sale.  I can wait for the next movie theater or school shooting to get more money out of it.

I will only meet in Greenwood or Franklin for a FTF exchange.  I am not interested in any trades except for CASH.

Please reply with your name and phone number.  I will call you to schedule a time and place to meet.

It has a standard carbine length handguard, 16"" barrel, 1:9 twist so you can shoot heavier grain bullets, 6 position stock, and flat top rail.

On the rail is a very nice Nikon scope, 3x-9x power with dust caps.  It is zero'd at 100 yards and is extremely accurate!  A bipod is mounted on the handguard (I know, its on backward in the picture - just turned around so it would fit in my safe).  It also has a Magpul single point sling.  Comes with two 30-round magazines.

It is in excellent condition with less than 150 rounds have been run through it.  I've got a bolt gun in .223 that I use more often, so this one needs to go.  This is NOT a fire sale.  I just figure there is someone out there that might give it more use than I ever will.  You will NOT be disappointed with this setup.

Asking $745 or best REASONABLE offer.  Again, this is not a fire sale.  I can wait for the next movie theater or school shooting to get more money out of it.

I will only meet in Greenwood or Franklin for a FTF exchange.  I am not interested in any trades except for CASH.

Please reply with your name and phone number.  I will call you to schedule a time and place to meet.

Winchester called these ""fancy sporting rifles"" and this one is certainly fantastic looking in the best caliber and configuration. And it's also in the desirable early serial range for which the original factory records remain. As you can see, the metal was refinished a long time ago, so it's starting to develop a mellow aged look. The blue is about the right color and sheen, and the markings and edges remain quite sharp, slight dishing on a couple screw holes and part of the barrel address is very slightly blurred. The good news is the wood was not refinished at all, and has its original factory deluxe finish and checkering completely untouched and intact. The wood is beautiful with rich color and fantastic feather crotch figure. These original fancy H-checked stocks alone are very valuable. Because the metal finish is starting to age, the wood is completely original, and the wood to metal fit is perfect, this gun looks much better, and more ""right"" than most typical refinish jobs. So here's a chance to own a stunning looking early factory lettered deluxe 1894 in the best caliber and configuration at a fraction of what a completely original finish gun would cost. Perfect mechanical function, after market tapped for a receiver sight if you ever wanted to use one, and a very nice sharp bore. Marbles sights. Assembly numbers are correctly placed and match on the stock, lower tang, and buttplate. And it matches the original factory records at the Cody Museum,  Photos taken in extremely harsh outdoor light that magnifies every flaw and thins the look of the blue.

Winchester called these ""fancy sporting rifles"" and this one is certainly fantastic looking in the best caliber and configuration. And it's also in the desirable early serial range for which the original factory records remain. As you can see, the metal was refinished a long time ago, so it's starting to develop a mellow aged look. The blue is about the right color and sheen, and the markings and edges remain quite sharp, slight dishing on a couple screw holes and part of the barrel address is very slightly blurred. The good news is the wood was not refinished at all, and has its original factory deluxe finish and checkering completely untouched and intact. The wood is beautiful with rich color and fantastic feather crotch figure. These original fancy H-checked stocks alone are very valuable. Because the metal finish is starting to age, the wood is completely original, and the wood to metal fit is perfect, this gun looks much better, and more ""right"" than most typical refinish jobs. So here's a chance to own a stunning looking early factory lettered deluxe 1894 in the best caliber and configuration at a fraction of what a completely original finish gun would cost. Perfect mechanical function, after market tapped for a receiver sight if you ever wanted to use one, and a very nice sharp bore. Marbles sights. Assembly numbers are correctly placed and match on the stock, lower tang, and buttplate. And it matches the original factory records at the Cody Museum, Photos taken in extremely harsh outdoor light that magnifies every flaw and thins the look of the blue.

General Features
The Weaver style accessory rail located on the barrel runs from the chamber area to right behind the front sight allowing the use of scope rings (optional) and aftermarket optics.  The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up.
The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy.
The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate.
Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting.  The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.
The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired.

Safety
The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters. When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged.

Construction
Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel."

852,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4599852,For Sale:  K31 rifle,"Northern Minnesota, Bloomington, Minnesota",$ 385,"Listed On: Tuesday, September 8, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Arguably the most accurate of the WW2 battle rifles featuring the lightning fast, straight pull bolt action, chambered in 7.5 X 55 mm with a 23 ½ in. barrel. The 7.5 X 55 cartridge produces a very flat trajectory with approx.. 15-20% more muzzle energy than the standard 308 / 7.62 X 51 cartridge. There at least four sources for this cartridge.

 If you are a collector of military firearms or a hunter looking for rifle that will take almost any North American game, the K31 would be an excellent choice for your collection.

 The rifle shown below is the most accurate rifle I have ever owned. The K31 in original condition is inherently accurate but this rifle has also been pillar bedded and receiver bedded making it capable of even tighter shot groups. It will consistently shoot 1 MOA with Swiss GP11 surplus ammo (I have some of this for sale).

 This rifle was purchased from the importer as “Excellent” grade. It has 90%+ bluing, a bright shiny bore, a 6 round detachable magazine, and an incredibly smooth 3 ½ to 4 # trigger.

 As shown, the rifle is fitted with an easily removable, no mar bipod mount and scope mount made by Swiss St. Marie, and a Bushnell 3-9 scope. These items will be priced separately. Please ask for prices if you are interested.

 The beech stock has been respectively and lightly sanded to preserve all of the original contours and historical markings. It has 7 coats of hand rubbed Tung Oil giving it a beautiful and tough finish.

 I am asking $385 for the rifle stand alone. I will give a package price with the items listed above if you are interested.

 To see this rifle, or for more information, please contact Jim at REDACTED or email REDACTED .

 Thanks for your interest."

The wood on both is fantastic. I have about 3 too many shotguns, so these are the 2 I am choosing to part with. I believe both are 26"" barrels, but I will check and make sure. I'm looking to trade for handguns, mostly S&W revolvers in 357 or larger calibers, but will consider all reasonable handgun offers. Or I will just sell out right. I would like to move the 2 as a pair, but will consider breakin them up on a case by case basis. This is a perfect combo for a husband and wife/boyfriend and girlfriend. All low ball offers will be ignored. I feel $1000.00 cash for the 2 or $1100.00 trade value for the 2 1100's is a very fair price and I am pretty firm. I will include 2 soft cases as well.

They come with a forever warranty no matter who owns it. I still have the box it came with. These scopes are some of the best kept secrets out there, they retail for $600 and at that price point you will not find a better 3X9 FFP scope. Most reviewers put them on par with the Gen 1 Vortex Razors in terms of clarity. There is a ton of information out there about these, they are tough as hell, please drop in into your search engine and see for yourself. Its a top notch piece of glass. Only reason I am selling is because I went with the same scope in a higher magnification for precision rifle shooting, although this thing stretched out to 400 plus yards with no issue. Scope is equally at home hunting or target shooting.
The only mark on this scope is on the bell, it is purely cosmetic and does not affect the operation at all, put a scope cap on it and you will never know its there, else I would have asked more.
Could possibly be interested in trades, no boltguns though. Can add cash for the right trade if needed. 870 tac shotgun is really what I am after trade wise. I can take paypal and ship provided you pay the fees."
