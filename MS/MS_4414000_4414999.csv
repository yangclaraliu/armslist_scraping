At H&R, we’re proud of our single-shot heritage and the fact we’ve been a part of the American hunting and shooting tradition from the beginning. This versatile and economical shotgun design has changed very little since we started building them back in 1893, because it works. Our break actions have long been the choice of straight-shooters who want the most out of their single shot at game or a clay target. They’re lightweight, quickpointing and have very few moving parts to maintain. These guns open smoothly when you press the lever, lock up tight as a bank vault door, and our Transfer Bar System acts as a safety to prevent unintended firing. Also, each gun comes complete with its own special locking device for safe storage.

Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 700,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 10, 2015",Rifles,no type,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I am selling my DDI AK I bought brand new on Tuesday May 28th, 2015. It has been fired exactly 140 rounds to check function and it runs great. It is 100% reliable with every magazine I have tried with it. Magazines lock up tight and function great. This is by far the most accurate AK I have ever shot. 

To improve upon the accuracy potential it has an adjustable trigger installed. The trigger pull is crisp and breaks cleanly at 2.5 pounds. This is the best AK trigger you have probably ever felt. Or if you want I will install the factory Tapco FCG group which gives a ~5-6 pound trigger with plenty of creep.

The Magpul Zhukov-S Stock is a no-compromise folding stock for the modern AK. The Zhukov-S Stock casts aside traditional AK stock shortcomings and offers a folding, collapsible stock with QD sling mounts, modular Cheek Risers, and a shock-absorbing rubber butt-pad for superior traction. The Zhukov has right-side folding for compatibility with side-mounted optics. Designed to fit most common stamped AK receivers without modification via a unique wedge block, the durable injection molded polymer Zhukov-S Stock redefines the human interface with the AK platform. It does have one QD sling swivel loop installed.

This gun comes with a three, yes THREE, year factory warranty. It will also come with one free recoat of the finish anytime within that time frame. It will not require the gun to be shipped anywhere to have it recoated. I will provide details to the buyer. 

DDI AK47 Black Stock Model , 7.62 x 39 semi auto, Destructive Devices Industries stamped AK is built using a DDI stamped receiver, Green Mountain 4140 barrel, TAPCO FCG, like new Hungarian AKM kit. This DDI Stamped Ak47 has a  KG Gun Coat finish, Fenocited bolt, bolt carrier, cleaning rod, axis pins, rear sight assembly, spring guide, and Green Mountain barrel. Fenocite provides superior corrosion resistance, increased accuracy, and reduced wear, barrels can last a third longer than conventional barrels. Hogue grip/handguards, and a Phoenix Technology stock has a LARGE storage compartment in the rear. One 30 round polymer magazine, rail sections and hardware for the Hogue hand guard, additional railed upper hand guard, and slant brake found on all modern AKMs.

The price is $800 with the Magpul folding stock or $700 with the factory stock.

And because it is made right here in Tennessee no federal regulation will ever ban it because of the laws recently passed in Tennessee like SB 110 as well as the Tennessee Firearms Freedom Act. Get this before Hillary gets into office and prices on ALL AKs go through the roof.

Watch review videos and read about the DDI AK here:
http://ddiarms.com/about-us.html

This gun is literally like new. I bought it new and installed the trigger. I fired 100 rounds to ensure reliability, which it is 100% reliable, then I installed the Magpul Zhukov folding stock. Then I fired 40 more rounds and I must say I LOVE this stock. After that it was cleaned and stored in a soft case.

And if you are looking for a custom 1911 too check out my other auction.
http://www.armslist.com/posts/4406624/knoxville-tennessee-handguns-for-sale--1911-carry-package
If you are interested in both I will let both go for $1,400 with the Zhukov stock or $1,320 with the Phoenix Technologies stock.

Again, this gun is literally a brand new gun with only 140 rounds through it."

This custom setup is an absolute dream to shoot and one I am not going to be happy to get rid of. But I am trying to consolidate my firearms to one brand family and this one has to go as a result. 

The features include;
Cave State Custom Professional Grip reduction and stippling ($220)
Streamlight TLR-1 HL 500 lumin light ($130)
       I also have a grip switch for this light that activates it when you hold the firearm ($30)
Trijicon HD night sights Green/Green with Yellow outline on the front ($120)
Suarez International Flat face trigger, set to 3-4 lbs (and its a dream to shoot!) ($140)
Apex tactical extractor ($60)
Storm lake threaded barrel (silver / not shown) ($130)
Kydex Holster which holds light and firearm (not shown) ($35)
Original glock parts including case and 2 magazines. One with the +2 Pearce grip extension. 

This is a dream gun to shoot, a breeze to clean with the NiB-X coating, and has been tastefully modified with a priority of function over form. Its been a great gun to me but its time to move on. 

It has some slide ware from holstering the firearm. 

I have over 1300 into this gun with the gear. I dont expect to get it all back. But dont low ball me here. This is a fantastic gun with a low round count which has been very well maintained.

In my opinion, this is the best tactical pump on the market. It feels and looks so nice it makes stock Mossberg 500/590's and Remington 870's seem like bargain specials. This model has the factory extended magazine tube which brings the capacity from 4+1 to 6+1 2 3/4"" shells (up to 3 1/2 inch magnums) and retails for $559. This is the straight stock version with ghost ring sights. I bought it 3 months ago in Adventure Outdoors for $570 after tax and is in perfect condition. No rust, no scratches, and only has 60 rounds through it.

I'm selling this because I want to get the new DP-12 bullpup shotgun and need to raise funds."

Chances are if your looking at this listing, you know what this rifle is. Russia's rare semi-auto rifle from World War Two. These are rather rare to come across unlike the millions of Mosin Nagant's we are all  accustomed to seeing everywhere. This rifle is surprisingly accurate and has strong rifling down the barrel (see photos). Its obviously in used condition as these rifles were shipped out for use as fast as they could be made. This particular rifle was bought from a veteran's collection and was a bring back rifle from either Korea or Vietnam. There are no import marks on it at all but like most of these rifles I'm guessing it went back through the arsenal after WW2 for a general look over and to be maintained to replace any worn parts. Most but not all of the numbers are matching and the action is extremely- almost surprisingly smooth. I have quite a few Russian rifles and this is by far the smoothest. I've owned a PSL before as well and This is by far a better shooter.

Since buying it about two years ago, I only have shot about 5-6 rounds through it. Its mostly been a safe queen and also a great piece to bring out to show and talk about. However at the range, the rifle shot just fine and all of the rounds ended up on target with a pretty good grouping for its age.. within about a drink coaster 4"" or so maybe? I have not and did not adjust the iron sights since I bought it and at 100 or so yards, its pretty spot on but I'm sure with the right ammo and or optics, it would be a nail driver. 

It comes with one 10 round magazine, sold as is, and is an awesome piece of history. This is one rifle that most people have read about, but not everyone has seen or held let alone shot. This is your chance to own one. 

I'm primarily looking for cash. That being said, I will entertain the a trade plus cash if the deal is really right. Interested in Saiga 12's, WW2 firearms (Lugar pistols) & Unusual and rare firearms- however they must be able to shoot modern day ammo that is easily accessible. I enjoy my firearm collection as one would enjoy a collection of high end cars and believe that If you cant get out and drive them, what's the point. :-) 

Looking forward to hearing from serious buyers. Low ballers and tire kickers, please move on! If you would like more photos email me and let me know what you would like to see in particular and also please include your email address for me so I can get additional photos over to you.

Have a great day and thanks for checking out my listing!"

Meticulous triggers built by our staff toolmakers ... without a stopwatch in sight. No question, we’re particular about accuracy. Everyone knows that one of the smartest improvements an AR-owner can do to their rifle is a precision trigger upgrade. Everyone also knows that LaRue Tactical has a track-record of doing things right. The LaRue MBT-2S was purposefully designed and manufactured to render the greatest benefits from our legendary line of accurate rifles. The MBT-2S can also replace the stock trigger on any mil-spec AR lower receiver. Sparing no expense, all major components are precision-machined from S7 Tool Steel. The result of this extra effort is a glass-smooth, hyper-consistent trigger that will satisfy even the most scrupulous competition shooter, but also be overly rugged for the battlefield. The MBT-2S breaks crisply at 4.5 lbs (2.5 lb first stage, 2 lb second stage) and has a smooth and positive reset.

Up for sale is my 2 month old Benelli Vinci in perfect condition. This is the perfect high end gun and comes with a choke kit (pretty much every type available, see main product site for more details). This gun has a number of features including a 3 piece construction for small storage, the ability to switch the stock module out for a tactical pistol grip model or turkey model, adjustable stock with shims included, and a recoil system that is as clean as a pump action. If you want a semi auto shotgun that you never have to clean, this is the gun for you (see demonstration of the recoil system above for more details).

This gun retails for $1,449 and I picked it up on Gunbroker for $1,370 shipped. It is in perfect condition with no rust or scratches and it only has about 50 rounds through it. I'm selling it because I don't hunt, and I never go skeet shooting anymore, and this is an expensive gun to have laying around with no usage."
