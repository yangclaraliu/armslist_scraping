It has the 18.5"" bead sight 12G barrel for 2.75"" and 3"". It has a +2 extension on it like the Tactical models. I added a Choate Mark V Pistol Grip Stock to it and a 5 round side saddle onto the side of the stock (which is affixed with 6 screws and can be removed).
It runs pretty darn smooth and has no blemishes on it. Much smoother than a new Express. The barrel is in awesome condition. This weapon is nickel plated inside and out for the ultimate in corrosion protection. This includes bolt, sling studs, mag tube extension, bead sight, mag tube clamp, etc. It makes a great truck gun or JIC gun. To my eyes, it seems to have a plastic trigger housing (like the Express models) with a different coating on it and I think the standard springs but seems to have the machined extractor. I have a Tactical model to compare to and the Tac has the mold seams and the little dot imprint on the extractor whereas the Marine Magnum has grinding/machining grooves on most of the sides of the extractor like it was cut from a block of steel. I have the original stock as well. Front grip (which is an express) was machined and chamfered to not overlap the receiver for side saddle install on the receiver itself. I had a TacStar 6 round saddle on it for a while so I know those fit. Boyt case, MOLLE pouch, radios and feet not included.
My price is shipped from me to your FFL in CONUS except CT, NY, CA or MA or otherwise illegal to purchase. If I need to go to an FFL on my side, the cost is not included. No PayPal please. Photos are in a photobucket album if you want more images.
I am thinning the pump gun herd, but I'd be interested in some potential parts for hunting 870 stuff (chokes, rifled bbl, etc.) or towards an 1100 Tac-4 or 12G Auto-5 to play with and the like. Ammo is always good; 4~6 shot, buck anything, slugs, etc.

This thing is a shooter capable of anything. I've had it out to 400 yards making easy hits on steel w/ a 4 MOA Aimpoint H1 using off the shelf M193 ammunition prone using the magazine as a monopod.

It is corrosive, but it is easy to prevent rust if you are prepared and clean your gun properly. I am asking $450 firm, which works out to about 36 cents a round, roughly the same as the steel cased stuff. I also have for sale 240 rounds in boxes from a crate I opened. I want $75 for that. There is a neat video on YouTube about how to convert Berdan primed cases to boxer primed so you can reload them. I would like to meet in the Green Bay area. Thanks!"

These highly sought after pistols have been a mainstay of the Special Operations community for years for the simple reason that HK works, and works well. This one is the prefered variant #1, meaning that the slide lever acts as a de-cocker and a safety. You can carry this ""cocked & locked"" in 1911 fashion, or uncocked as a double action. This gun is outfitted with a 6"" stainless steel National Match Grade, Compensated (cuts in the exposed end of barrel that allows excess gas to vent upwards during fire, reducing muzzle rise) barrel, that mitigates muzzle rise down to next to nothing. It has a HK competition recoil spring, making the racking of the slide feel like hot butter on teflon. It is easier to rack than EVERY 9mm I own. One of the most significant features of the USP is the mechanical recoil reduction system. This system is incorporated into the recoil spring assembly, and consists of a captive coil spring around the guide rod. This feature, combined with the compensated barrel, make this gun feel more like a 40 S&W, even with 45 +P loads. It has the HK short reset combat trigger, that allows for a higher cyclic rate, without being dangerously light like a competition trigger. Included with the gun are 3) 12 round factory, and 1) 22 round aftermarket magazines, a black leather pancake style belt holster. She has HK installed night sights, that are dimming, but still work like a charm. The frame rails, exterior of the chamber and feed ramps have all been polished to a mirror shine. This was my personal sidearm on a security detail in N. Africa, and she served me well, not once giving me a click when I asked for a bang (regardless of ammo), always supremely accurate and manageable. She has some minor scratches on the proprietary ""Hostile Environment"" nitride finish, but nothing down to the bare metal. There is also some minor scuffing at the heel of the grip. Overall, I'd put the finish in the 80-85% category. The bore is bright and shiney, with great rifling, and the gun functions flawlessly. This isn't a civilian toy, but rather a professional's tool."

Seems like every AK add I see claims to be ""the best"" AK ever made, but talk is cheap. The SLR-95 actually is the most rare, & highly sought after AK47 ever produced. Here's the history;
The SLR-95 was made in the original ARSENAL factory in Bulgaria. This factory is world renouned for producing the highest quality AKs ever produced. The 95 has a milled reciever, milled fire control group and Steyr barrel. The 95 was originally milled to accept double stack magazines and was the only AK imported with zero US made parts. It was only imported from 1995-1998. All other Arsenal SLRs were produced in the U.S. from a satalite arsenal factory in Nevada. The Arsenal factory in nevada uses the same specs as the Bulgarian factory, and they produce some of the best AKs on the market, but they simply cannot compare to the AKs produced in the original Bulgarian factory. Simply do a little research on the web, and you'll understand why the SLR-95 is in a class of its own. You rarely see these things on armslist, and if you do, they're expensive & they go fast....why... because THEY ARE FREAKIN' BAD-ASS!!!

I've replaced the original front & rear sight with mepro-light tritium night sights, but I still have the original sights for all you pure-ist out there. I've also added a tapco T6 adjustable stock, hogue grip & aluminum front quad-rail, but again for you pure-ist I've still got the original thumbhole arsenal stock & foregrip. I'm also going to throw in 10 steel mags & 1860 rounds of 7.62x39 wolf & tulla hp & fmj.

For the right price/trade I'll even cerakote it the color or camo pattern of your choice.

For the right trade I could also throw in my trijicon reflex sight w/ quick detach ARMS mount

I bought this rifle new several months back and did the work myself, so I know its done right and opperates flawlessly! It has the following components.

I'm not really sure if I wanna get rid of this, but I'm curious to see whats out there. Feel free to text me any cash or trade offers, the worst that can happen is that I can say ""no thanks"". Please keep in mind that I built this package from the ground up, and I know its value, and I'm only interested in trading it for something of equal value. I'll even throw in cash and/or extras for the right trade.

The last price on buds for these was $509 so I expect your trade offers to be valued in the $450-$500 range as these sell for more than that on gunbroker,gunsamerica,and local gun shows for that or higher without the factory gear.If your gun is worth less than 500 then add cash or ammo.

In addition, the IBNS is designed to be upgradable to our EBNS using a single pole and fly. This givesyou protection from the elements in addition to the IBNS's unsurpassed protection from insects. The IBNS is constructed of 70 Denier 1.9 ounce ripstop nylon and fine mesh. It is EPA registered and has Permethrin bonded to the material for insect repellency. It is supported by a strong and ultra-light .134 diameter pultruded fiberglass rod which winds around the shelter, expanding it to its given shape. When the rolled up IBNS's cinch strap is removed, the shelter is released and snaps into shape automatically; no assembly or set-up is required. A carry bag is included. The coiled, stored size of the shelter is 13"" x 13"" x 3"". CPAI-84 Fire Retardant rated.

This is an EG model which means longer (24”) and heavier barrel, checkered grip & forearm, brass rotor in the magwell, and walnut stocks. Only about 10% of 99’s were EGs. The more common E models were made after the EG and intended to be an economy model (lighter barrel, cheaper materials). This is one of the finest hunting rifles ever made. My hunting days are behind me and I don’t have anyone to pass it along to, but it needs to be out there doing what it was made for.
This weapon was bought new by my father in 1957.  I have had it since 1982.

This particular rifle even has it's original pre-war stock with the two screws in each sling well.  Also, this rifle includes it's original matching bayonet.  You just can't find one like this anymore.  I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country (to an FFL or C&R) but I prefer a face to face sale in Arkansas. I will do a bill of sale requiring DLN and date of birth of Arkansas residents. I will also accept a Concealed Weapons License number on the bill of sale which would eliminate a DLN and Date of Birth. 

I also have cases of 7.62 x 54R ammunition made for the Mosin Nagant from Russia.  I will sell a can of 440 rounds of ammo for an additional $100 with a rifle purchase.
Thank you!"

I bought this about two years ago, and was able to test it out before I bought it, and it was shocking how well made, and accurate it is. Hi Point has a well deserved bad rep, but in the case of this C 9 model, the reputation is suspended. I ran 150 rounds through it, 3 different cheap, over the counter  Wal mart specials, and not ONE SINGLE jam or failure occurred. I was hitting head shots on my FBI target from 50 yards, and could knock down things as small as an aspirin bottle from 15 yards, with no problem. Someone at Hi Point was doing their job the day this gun was made. I bought  it for $179.00 and have used it 3 times, but it's just not a carry pistol, and I have not been able to go out target practicing and plinking with my job the way it is now, so I am selling it. It comes with an 8 round magazine (costs about $10.00 new from Cal Ranch) and 77 rounds of ammo.  No down pricing or trades, the price is firm, but I guarantee you you will be satisfied."

Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun."

Shoots great, as all Kimbers do. Very cool gun! $750 or make me a reasonable cash offer. You won't see many Kimbers at this price.
