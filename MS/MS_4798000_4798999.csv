Total round count is somewhere around 150.
I bought it and it worked and shot well, but it shot high would not zero. Springfield sent a call label and repaired it. It shoots to the sights now with adjustment left over. It shoots very good with the Springfield test target showing a little over 2"" group at 25 yards with federal 124 grain ammo.
I bought this after a shoulder surgery and didn't get to use it. I am having another surgery in November and will probably never get to appreciate this nice pistol.
Springfield sent an extra magazine when they returned it to me so it has everything that came with it new plus an extra 19 round magazine for a total of four, test target and repair order from Springfield.
I have misplaced the manual, I had it out for the return and can't locate it. Free on line if I can't turn it up. Otherwise everything that came with it new plus extra mag. Very nice factory trigger.
Like new in every way except for slight wear on barrel hood.
This gun is not a lemon and I'm not dumping it. It was in for adjustment and came back really nice. Please check my feedback on E-Bay under mstuhr63670 and Gunbroker under mstuhr and buy with confidence.
Looks great, shoots great and works great!
Listed on Gunbroker would take 600.00 if bought before any bids on GB
Will be pulled if a  bid shows up on Gunbroker
Local buyers welcome to shoot this gun

Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing. Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days. The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol.

Hello;

I have a good-nice condition (for these Swiss rifles) Swiss K31 ( K-31 ) that has been dated to 1946. The post-WWII K31's (1946 and on...) are some of the better mechanical K31's due to defects being worked out after years of K31 production, and lack of firing due to WWII being over.

The bore is nice and shiny, sharp groves. The stock and especially the buttstock has the normal snow and military drilling wear one see's on K-31's. The Swiss were just tough on their stocks, but not abusive. That said, the stock is solid and no cracks as most K31's are.

Also has the troop tag. All numbers match on gun. The troop tag reflects the person in Switzerland that was issued this gun and kept it at his house. Swiss requirement.

K31's are the the most accurate WWII rifles as well as the Swedish Mauser. Look it up if you don't believe me. These guns shoot MOA and ballistics\recoil similar to a 308. The steel used is top notch and to produce one of these today would be $2,000 as I have read.  All precision as Swiss stuff is noted for.  And OMG, the 2-stage trigger is absolutely crisp with about a 3-3.5 break. Sadly, better trigger than on some on my more expensive and modern rifles.

Be an awesome whitetail gun for the upcoming season, from swamps to 300 yards. I mean, when was the last time you shot a deer with a genuine WWII weapon..or a bolt action rifle with open sights...? Fun challenge and bragging rights at deer camp.

Straight pull bolt action. Very fun to use! And ammo is easy to find. For example, Prvi Partisan is good stuff, easy to find, and sells for anywhere from $15-18 a box. http://www.sgammo.com/product/prvi-partizan/20-round-box-75x55-swiss-174-grain-fmj-prvi-partizan-ammo-pp721

GP11 Swiss ammo is usually $300 for a case of 480 rounds and that ammo is match quality.

Priced to sell at $320, especially with the sling, troop tag, and case.

FTF only, do not want to ship at this time.

NO TRADES PLEASE and please dont ask. Hate to sell, but need car repairs that came up.

Thanks.

Here is a good writeup of the K31's and its predecessor, the K-11.

http://www.iraqveteran8888.com/the-iv8888-blog/the-k31-swiss-service-rifle



""Accuracy:

The K31 is likely one of the finest military rifles ever produced. Much care and detail when into their manufacture, and since they were not under the duress of war, they were able to take their time and build them right. This equates to an extremely accurate and top notch firearm. The steel used by the Swiss is very high quality with a high nickel content. Barrels are extremely well made and I have never shot one that did not group at least 1.5"" at 100 yards with GP11 ammunition. The triggers are very well thought out two stage arrangements with a nice clean 3-4 pound break. Sights are typical tangent sights that would have been found on most rifles of the era, and are adjustable for windage and elevation. The accuracy of the K31 is often attributed to Adolf Hitler's refusal to invade the Swiss during WW2. Probably the best decision he ever made, as they were all heavily trained to be expert marksmen.""

The Sig Sauer P238 is different from most other .380 “pocket” pistols on the market today. In terms of size and shape, the P238 is very similar to other comparable micro .380’s. Instead of a polymer frame, however, the Sig Sauer P238 uses an all metal frame with a single action design, and is almost identical in appearance to the legendary Colt Mustang.The Sig Sauer P238 operates with a locked-breech short recoil action. The hammer must be cocked either manually, or by the action of the slide, to fire each shot. The advantage to this method of operation is two- fold. First and foremost, similar to the Colt 1911 or Mustang, the Sig Sauer P238 has a superior trigger pull when compared to similarly sized double action only designs like the Ruger LCP, Smith & Wesson Bodyguard or Kel-Tec P3AT. In turn, this leads to greater accuracy. Second, the P238’s single action design allows Sig Sauer to incorporate a high ride beavertail grip frame, which leads to greater control under recoil by safely placing the shooter’s hand higher along the bore axis.In addition to being a great-looking pistol, the Sig Sauer P238 is much easier to load than other micro pistols on the market. For shooters that do not possess strong hands, the P238’s smooth and easy slide is one of its most highly appreciated features. There are also positive vertical serrations on the back of the slide that further enhance loading or unloading.The Sig Sauer P238 slide locks to the rear on an empty magazine, and the slide latch release is easy to reach with the thumb of the shooting hand. Similarly, the P238 has a user friendly manual thumb safety which further enhances shooter usability. The Sig Sauer P238 has stippling on the grips for a secure hold while firing the pistol. As mentioned, the frame has a generous beavertail to protect the web between the shooter’s thumb and trigger finger, and the hammer recesses into the beavertail section, to avoid any chance of hammer or slide-bite while firing the pistol. The Sig Sauer P238 is a very compact design, and while it may be slightly heavier than the polymer .380ACP pistols on the market, it is just as small.  We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $595.

The Ruger® LCP® Semi-Auto Pistol fitted with a Laser sight makes a lightweight, fast handling concealed carry gun that is extremely quick to get on target, and relatively easy to deliver well placed shots with. The lightweight, compact design of the Ruger LCP makes it comfortable to carry all day, so you'll have it ready when needed. The LCP utilizes a double-action only, hammer-fired mechanism, with the hammer recessed into the rear of the slide to prevent snagging. The double-action only firing mode makes it simple to use in stressed situations—no levers or switches to remember—just point and shoot. The LCP features low profile front and rear sights integrated onto the slide that do not snag on clothing when pistol is drawn from a concealed position, and all sharp edges have been eliminated on the LCP to aid in concealment and to reduce wear on clothing. This LCP model features an alloy steel slide with a blued finish. Right-handed shooters can comfortably reach the magazine release on the LCP with their thumb, while left-handed shooters have no problem using their trigger finger. The mag release pushes in easily, but not so easily that the magazine pops out unexpectedly. Unlike many small semi-automatic pistols that operate with a blowback action, the Ruger LCP operates on a locked-breech system, which mitigates recoil and does not necessitate the user to pull the slide back against an excessively heavy recoil spring during loading. The LCP also has a manual slide hold-open latch for inspection and cleaning. 

The LaserMax CenterFire® laser sight fits flush with the front of the LCP's frame, with nothing to snag or catch while drawing the weapon. A 1/3N Lithium battery (included) provides a 5mW red laser with over 5 hours of continuous run time; the laser can be activated with either right or left hand, and a distinct On/Off switch turns the laser on only when you need it. The laser sight comes factory aligned for 10 yards, and is user adjustable for both windage and elevation. When not wanted, the sight can be easily removed from the pistol. The Ruger LCP Semi-Auto Pistol with LaserMax Centerfire Laser is a lightweight, reliable firearm that is easy to operate for most any shooter regardless of experience, making it a perfect combination for concealed carry and home-defense. Made in USA."

This gun suffered some unknown damage on the right side of the barrel but it doesn't really detract from the overall aesthetics. 

It has a couple of dings that I wanted to mention for full disclosure.

It has a slide mounted safety, IWI, KBI Inc, and H-3 markings as well as a Serial Number of 01017X (I can sent a picture of the full SN to serious buyers). This is not one of the new ones... this one was imported in 90/91. It is a quality and historical pistol that hasn't been made in over 20 years. 

The Jericho 941 is a steel pistol designed for the Israeli military and police. After being imported by IWI industries for a few years the Israelis sent the design to Magnum Research and changed the name to the ""Baby Desert Eagle"" after changing the design. I wish I could keep it forever, but I don't go pistol shooting that often and it's time to move it to a new home.

I am asking $350 for this pistol (OBO). I've been looking for almost a year, and I cannot find anyone else selling an original. The new ones are okay, but they lack the historyIts steel body and SA/DA hammer helps keep the sights on target for accurate follow up shots.

The only problem with this pistol is the Safety. If you use the slide release to send the slide forward instead of slignshoting it the Safety may turn off. The internet says this can be fixed with a single part from a CZ pistol, but I don't have the time or emotional investment to fix it. It's still shootable, just not safe for carry in its current shape.

Don't give up your chance to get this historical pistol. It will be a long time before you see another one for sale... if you ever do. One of the reasons they are so rare is this pistol was featured in Cowboy Bebop, a famous Japanese comic. Its fans snatch these originals up really quickly.

Additional information and picturehistoryItse upon request.

Meeting will occur in public area in Woodbridge, VA.

For sale I will need to see 2 government IDs showing Virginia residency. One must be a Voter ID card, Concealed Handgun Permit. Bill of sale will also be signed by both parties.
