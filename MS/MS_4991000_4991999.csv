It is a strong and reliable weapon and relatively small in size (about 6"" long), with a distinctive large rounded front blade sight. I really like the easy field stripping to take off the barrel. Only one twist of the latch and it unlocks. This one is in good working condition and has one magazine. Quite a few returned with the GI's after WWII, but few have strong working springs for crisp action like this. Wear on the grips hints to its history. I am also including a vintage holster (though not as old)---------------------Note: The picture can display good detail from the original size.

Prefer cash but open to trade for Glock 43 (legal FFL transfer)

Description
The G33 magnifier is shorter and lighter than the G23. It offers an improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.

G33 with Quick Switch to Side (STS) mount is faster than ever, just push the magnifier to the side and it will lock securely in that position until you push it back into place for magnified viewing.

Specifications:

- Magnifcation Fixed: 3.25X 
- Eye Relief: 2.2 in 
- Field of View: 7.3 degrees

- Temperature: -40 degrees to 160 degrees F

This is a fun old rifle and bayonet in the Mauser 98 tradition made by the State armory of Czechoslovakia at Brno and accepted by the Czech army in 1939. -------------------------------------------------------------------- (Tiny second rampant lion followed by ""39"" side of receiver.). ""G5"" leading the serial number designates the production lot and factory. (See detail at the bottom of the pics.) ""G"" is for the 7th lot within one of 5 production cycles before the German annexation. 1939 would be the last cycle. ""5"" means it was made by the factory Povaska Bystrica in Slovakia. At that time Czechoslovakia had the largest small arms industry in Europe and enjoyed exports to many armies worldwide. This Mauser style rifle was one of the favorite service weapons through WWII. ------------------------------------------------------------------  This one is in good condition and works even though it has seen a lot of history as the pictures show. The rifling grooves in the bore are a little dark but the lands are quite strong and crisp. It sure has a lot of sling mounts. My favorite feature is the bold lion crest of the armory. My second favorite is the sighting system which appears to be designed to minimize damage from rough handling and yet preserve precision. This same sighting system is still used in Czech guns being made today. Of course the Mauser type bolt action is great and so simple to remove. The rifle comes with its VZ-24 bayonet. The spring action locking mechanism works well. Bayonet marking is CSZ. 4 digit marking on the wooden hilt is probably a unit number. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: The picture can display good detail from the original size. Just click on it to get a larger window and click again for original size. Enlargement on the phone is often by expansion gesture with two fingers.   Picture shows detail if your enlarge to original size.Detailed bayonet pics are in the 2nd picture, right hand side. Hard to find a VZ-24 with this visible history. Most exports have the crest polished out and you can only see a faint trace. A footnote to history... After WWI from 1918, Czechoslovakia developed into a healthy democracy in Central Europe. But it was in the shadow of what became Hitler's expansionist Germany which occupied it piecemeal and finally annexed entirely in 1939 as western Europe watched. After WWII in 1945, it was nearly independent until 1948 when Stalin installed a puppet government. The VZ-24s for the small Czech army were only produced in the 5 production cycles preceding 1939... those not exported to earn hard currency. After 1939 their factories were appropriated for German or Soviet arms. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, CZ was organized as a company, and once again it is producing the renowned VZ-24 rifles. The rifle listed here was produced in the tiny flicker of hope in 1939. It was not used by the German troops, those had Nazi marks. Perhaps it was a partisan? The Czechs had an active and organized underground in those years.

The Marine Corps Scholarship Foundations (MCSF) Mission:

… is to provide financial assistance in the form of scholarships for higher education to deserving sons and daughters of Marines and children of former Marines, with particular attention being given to children whose parent was killed or wounded in action. We are proud of our long history and commitment: Since 1962, we have awarded more than 21,000 scholarships and bonds totaling more than $34.6 million, including $3.49 million to 1,044 scholarship recipients in 2007. We hope you take time to explore this site and learn more about our mission and scholarship program.

Support our Marine Corps Family. Give to the American Patriots Campaign.

The Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation (MCSF) has embarked on a historic fundraising campaign. We have met our intermediate goal of doubling our average scholarship award to $3,000 a year for children of current and former Marines. We also award $30,000 in scholarship assistance to every child of a Marine, or of a Navy Corpsman serving with the Marines, whose parent is killed in the Global War on Terror. This is a five year capital campaign (2006-2010) to raise $50 million and is entitled ""American Patriots Campaign""."

I don't prefer ACOGs because of the eye relief, was hoping to trade for an Aimpoint Micro or Comp M4. The price is fair for a working ACOG with mount. 

I have called Trijicon and confirmed Authenticity however the Optic is on the Older Side.
It is not a Military/LE model so it didn't come out of an Arms Room.

I invested so little time into this setup I never even managed to get around to putting a flash hider on it.  It's been sitting in a safe untouched until about 6 weeks ago when I got the itch to convert it to an M4 so I bought a new upper and collapsible stock kit.  I have kept the Colt pre-ban lower, BCG and charging handle those are not for sale.  This sale is for the barreled upper assembly in the pictures only:  

- .223/5.56
- 1 in 9 twist
- non-removable carry handle
- 20"" HBAR 
- original Colt factory A2 stock/buffer tube/buffer spring/buffer/latch plate/castle nut. This is the old style A2 that has the field kit compartment.  
- 43"" Uncle Mikes Tactical soft case with 5 external mag pouches.  
- Barska M16 carry handle 4x20 scope especially designed to keep irons available for use underneath the scope via a peep hole.  New never mounted.

The upper is absolutely cherry and it's difficult to discern if it's even been fired you will not be disappointed if this is what you are after.....would guesstimate 300 rounds at most? 

This is a CASH sale only and for pick up at my home in South Tampa only.  No shipping, checks, money orders, PayPal etc.  Thanks for your understanding."

But it adds a great deal when it comes to aiming accuracy and confidence.

it needs new tires, oil, and speedo cable and tachometer cable. Right turn signal works and breaklight but I think it just needs a new taillight bulb as it doesn't work. Back left turn signal works but not front left, bulb? Side fairings are off. No key to the ignition but it's rigged under the seat with a fuse bypassing the ignition fuses, it could easily be turned into a toggle switch. It's a 673cc with an in-line four, runs pretty strong. Just not the prettiest bike out there. I did spray paint it because the paint on it was bad, though I did not paint it properly by sanding it. 

Looks to trade or sell, would really like to trade for a carry pistol, and I can carry a 1911 and full size pistol semi comfortably.

The revolver was unique in that it had the ability to fire several rounds per minute before having to reload. Revolvers were typically issued to officers and mounted soldiers, however some were purchased privately or found on the battlefield by infantrymen. Distinguished by its octagon barrel and lever style loader, the 1851 helped to begin both the expansion of the West and the Civil War. The 1851 Navy is commonly considered to be one of gunfighter “Wild Bill” Hickok’s favorite handguns. The British government licensed the manufacturing rights and produced what is commonly known as the London Model. This revolver features an 7.375"" octagonal barrel, brass frame, brass guard, and walnut grip. It is available in .44 caliber, weighs 2.5 lbs., and is 13.5"" in length.1851 Navy Black Powder Revolver Features: .44 Caliber7.375"" Blued Octagonal BarrelBrass GuardWalnut GripBrass FrameHammer/Blade Sights Overall Length: 13.5""Weighs 2.5 poundsThis is a redi-pak and comes with everything you need to shot all you need is powder and caps.Free Shipping"

Take a moment and search google or the firearm blogs or YouTube if you want to be totally impressed! This firearm has precisely 60 rounds run through it. It was ""froglubed"" the day I took it home. I keep it in a humidity controlled gun safe as well. I did a few upgrades. Meprolight night sights, CZ custom shop 13 lb recoil spring, CZ custom shop reduced power mainspring, Cajun works upgraded ejector spring and upgraded to a solid steel ejector pin, CZ extended firing pin, titanium grip screws, and polished feed ramp. Included are 3 x 18 round CZ magazines, box, packing, all paperwork and all original parts. It's one SWEET SHOOTER! I have fired 40 FMJ and 20 HP. Zero issues.  This pistol is the most consistent, accurate balanced smoothing shooting pistol I have ever shot. Much more accurate than me! No wonder numerous competition shooters choose it!  Every review will bear that out. I am in a position where I would like to sell a few of my collection. This gun is a gem and as clean and lubed as it comes. I don't HAVE TO sell it so please don't ask for a much lower price. I have about $875+ invested in this firearm and it is worth every penny. However, in an effort for it to sell quickly I will settle for $700.00 FIRM Please be able to show ID or CCW should you decide to purchase it."

This is an awesome gun unfortunately it sits in the safe.  Has less than 200 rounds thru it.  It's serialized as a blew but I never found one. Will consider trades of equal value/value + $$. Only looking for a .308 long range rifle.   Will throw in leather holster with asking price.
