Clean Green Title

351 Cleveland Motor
Automatic
80s Bronco Sub Frame

Has a Kenwood DVD player and 2 RF Solo Barics.

Still a ongoing project, engine will need work, along with gauges (some do not work), and door latches have to be opened manually from inside(I just take the doors off when I drive).
The engine runs great at a stand still but when put into gear it loses power. Possibly a vacuum leak. 

With all that said, seats and interior along with paint is good. I was planning on having it wrapped just no time to finish all the little things. I might be interested in a trade with or without cash for a 4x4 3/4 or 1 ton Crew Cab, Jeep Wrangler, 4 Seater RZR, or $15000 obo. Call or text REDACTED"

All brass starts off as once fired Lake City head stamped 5.56 brass and we hand sort all brass and any damaged brass is discarded.  The cases are then wet tumbled. The brass is then processed using a Dillon Super 1050. The primer pockets are swaged and the cases are cut formed with a Dillon carbide die and an RT 1500 carbide cutter to an overall length of 1.358” +/- .005”. This will allow for multiple reloads without trimming. The brass neck is then expanded to .308” it maybe necessary to chamfer the case for some projectiles or further neck expansion for cast bullets.  The cases are then tumbled a last time for a minimum of 1 hour to remove any case lube. Then sorted once again sorted for quality assurance.

Quality Assurance
We hand sort all of our brass and discard any defective brass. Every batch we check every 25th case by using a Sheridan Gauge to ensure it meets SAAMI spec and prime the case to certify proper fitment. We add an additional 2% overage to each order to account for any damaged cases we may have missed.

This pistol is used but has a relative low round count, I'd guess around 200 rounds.  It is in excellent condition with minimal slide and holster wear.

I bought this pistol a couple years ago and it served as my primary carry weapon when I first got my CCW.  But now carry either a G19 or a Sig P232 so I really haven't used or needed this gun.  It now just sits lonely in the back of my gun safe...taking up space where other guns could sit.

I am offering this package for the low, low price of $200 firm.  I am not interested in trades at this time.

This pistol is available for inspection and pick-up at my house in the Delaware/Powell area near the intersection of Home Road and US-23 (Columbus Pike).  

I prefer to deal with fellow CCW holders but I will sell to non-CCW holders who show a valid Ohio Drivers Licence and who are legally eligible to own a firearm.

If you respond or reply without including your name and other contact information, your email will be deleted as spam/phishing. I do Not Text! REad listing before wasting my time. No Trades.. Thank you. Factory built Romanian Dragunov sniper rifle in good condition in 7.62x54r (TGI FPK Dragunov). This rifle is a TG KNOX import NOT Century Int'l. As with otherl PSL variants, the bayonet lug is no longer intact and the barrel is threaded, but has a spot welded brake in place. These rifles, also known as a Romak-3, SSG-97, and PSL, are very reliable. The style Dragunov design has been in use since the mid 60's, and is still the official design of Russia and other Com-bloc countries. This is the Romanian version, which improved on the Russian design as far as reliability goes. This is a great weapon for several reasons. First, it uses the same type of action that an AK-47 uses, which makes it drag-through-the-mud reliable. Second, it's semi-automatic, which means if you miss with the first shot, you have an immediate chance to make up for it. Third, it uses a very powerful 7.62x54R caliber bullet, which is a powerfull monster round similar to 30-06 ballistics. The large size of the round and the long barrel of the rifle combine to allow shooting out to 1000yds. These features make the perfect long-range weapon for any situation. Nice condition with light surface rust due to in storage for a few years, fired approximately 20 rounds. Very reliable collector gun that will no longer be imported to the USA. NO SCOPE Not included. Only 1 10rd magazine included. Case also included as pictured. Nothing else included!!

It comes with one 10 round magazine and an Allen gun pouch.  It features a ghost ring sight in place of the factory 3 dot sight.  It is in excellent condition with minimal slide and holster wear.

I bought this pistol a couple years ago when 9mm was in short supply.  It was always easy to get .40 S&W ammo so I used to take this to the range when when the mood struck.  It is a very heavy gun, but that makes it a very stable platform.  It is a fun plinker for such a large caliber.  But I have since acquired a used G22 so I really haven't used or needed this gun. Now it just sits lonely in the back of my gun safe...taking up space where other guns could sit.

I am offering this pistol for the low, low price of $120. Perfect for the first time gun owner. I am not interested in trades at this time.

This pistol is available for inspection and pick-up at my house in the Delaware/Powell area near the intersection of Home Road and US-23 (Columbus Pike).

I prefer to deal with fellow CCW holders but I will sell to non-CCW holders who show a valid Ohio Drivers Licence and who are legally eligible to own a firearm.

SIG history...  introduced around 1975 to replace the P210 which was far too expensive to manufacture in mass quantity for the military.  This gun is the predecessor to the P226 and was needed for the demand of a higher capacity pistol.  The P220 was altered to .45 ACP which is today's standard chambering.

The manufacture date per a SIG forum is 1984.  Holster manufacture date is 1991.  Includes one mag.

This is a unique opportunity to own an awesome piece of SIG history and an excellent gun overall.  You are not likely to come across another.

Would be willing to sell the gun without holster.

I do Not Text! Thank you. FPK 7.62x54R Rifle by Tennessee Guns International. Built using new US manufactured Nodak Spud PSL/FPK Receiver with riveted gusseted re-enforcement plate, and a Romanian PSL parts kit and Romanian chrome lined barrel. Features Original Romanian flash hider, TAPCO G2 Trigger kit, one 10rd mag. No Scope.
These Romanian FPK Dragunov PSL are built using new US manufactured Nodak Spud PSL/FPK square-backed receiver with riveted, gusseted re-enforcement plate that facilitates a US MADE Ironwood Designsstandard AK-47 butt stock and pistol grip. As with all PSL variants, the bayonet lug is no longer intact and the barrel is threaded, but has a spot welded brake in place. These rifles, also known as a Romak-3, SSG-97, and PSL, are very reliable. The Dragunov style design has been in use since the mid 60's, and is still the official design of Russia and other Com-bloc countries. This is the Romanian version, which improved on the Russian design as far as reliability goes. This is a great weapon for several reasons. First, it uses the same type of action that an AK-47 uses, which makes it drag-through-the-mud reliable. Second, it's semi-automatic, which means if you miss with the first shot, you have an immediate chance to make up for it. Third, it uses a very powerful 7.62x54R caliber bullet, which is a powerfull monster round similar to 30-06 ballistics. The large size of the round and the long barrel of the rifle combine to allow shooting out to 1000yds. These features make the perfect long-range weapon for any situation. Nice condition with light surface rust due to in storage for a few years, fired approximately 20 rounds. Very reliable collector gun that will no longer be imported to the USA. NO SCOPE Not included. Only 1 10rd magazine included. Case also included as pictured. Nothing else included!!

This rifle is in immaculate condition with less than 150 rounds through it. It was cleaned and maintained after each use and has been stored in my safe. Virtually zero signs of wear. If you are looking for a high end, piston driven rifle then this a great opportunity. Will include all original packaging and 1(one) Pmag, just how it arrived from the factory. Here is a description from the website:

The LWRC M6A3 rifle is LWRC's Designated Marksman Rifle variant. It features their new midlength short-stroke gas-piston system that is the perfect blend of tactical carbine and sniper-capable rifle. The midlength operating system’s softer recoil allows for faster return-to-target and follow-up shots. 

The LWRC M6A3 rifle features our adjustable gas system. Four positions - (O-Off, S-Suppressed, N-Normal, A-Adverse), which allow for optimum performance in any situation. 

Designed with optics in mind, the LWRC M6A3 rifle is perfectly suited to accept a red dot sight or a high-powered scope. It features an integrated flip-down front sight and patented ARM-R free-float rail system. The easily removable top platform gives quick access to the barrel and piston system and reinstalls in seconds with no tools required. 

The new LWRC M6A3 rifle is the perfect all-purpose weapon for the modern warfighter or law enforcement professional. 

I have the receipt showing I paid $2,000 and I am only asking $1,600. 

Will met at FFL to perform transfer. I will cover any cost associated with transfer.

To say these are made in limited quantities is a understatement! As I remember it, Czechpoint has only released 8 builds with the wood furniture this year! Of those, this is the ONLY one featuring a surplus Czech wood kit in as issued condition! The beauty is really something else! This is not a cheap, US made CAI VZ2008! Czechpoint went right down to the mags to get 922 compliant. This is the most original, authentic representation of a VZ 58 you will find in the US. With the wood kit rifles being the first variant made, and very limited at that, don't miss out! These rifles are made off of new D Technik receivers and feature the original Czech CHF chrome lined barrel. Utilizing only the best quality original Czech surplus parts to construct these rifles; They also have bayonet lugs and muzzle brakes installed. This one is still new in the box folks! Unfired by me, and featuring all the accessories that come factory new! I also ordered the side rail that will come with it, just not installed. You will also receive a wood handle bayonet, and authentic bipod! Along with the rifle will come the screen shots printed off the website, as well as a letter from Czechpoint explaining the rifle. A very nice rifle for the serious collector! Still under full factory warranty! Have questions, please ask. Actual price paid for the rifle and side rail only was 1410.00. Do a quick Internet search to see how much a bipod and wood handle bayonet go for. I can accept DISCREET friends and family PayPal payment. Please message me for details on how to complete."

Pulling from his background in law enforcement, training and his passion for competition, allowed a truly special pistol to be formed. The 5"" Shadow Hawk Government with the RMR sight is a unique blending of the pistolsmithing skills at Nighthawk Custom along with Mr. Fisher, and the electronic sight geniuses at Trijicon. The Trijicon RMR (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) is the most rugged miniature red dot sight available and works in any lighting condition. This red dot sight allows faster first-shot target acquisition and follow-up shots. The RMR helps those with aging eyes to enjoy handgun shooting again or just be more proficient in their shooting. Attention to detail starts with the one piece machined steel magwell/mainspring housing for quick and sure reloading of the Shadow Hawk. You will notice the chiseled look and feel of the black flat faced trigger preferred by competition shooters. The gun is topped front and rear with Trijicon Tall Tritium Night Sights. The rear sight is integral to the base plate used to mount the RMR. This one piece unit is built for sturdiness and durability. An advantage of these sights is that a suppressor can be used effectively without having to change out to other sights, as long as you have specified the threaded barrel option. They will co-witness with or without a suppressor attached. Your hands will quickly notice the high undercut on the trigger guard along with 25 LPI checkering on the front strap. The high beaver tail will amaze you with the almost seamless fit and finish. Spiral cut black and gray G10 grips add a subtle highlight to the black nitrite finish. The stainless bushing contrasts nicely with the slide and frame. The aggressive cocking serrations are not just for looks but provide a sure purchase to rack the slide. Finally, leaving nothing to chance, we have beveled and recessed the slide stop to allow for the addition of Crimson Trace Laser Grips if you so choose. One you get the chance to use the Shadow Hawk Government with the amazing Trijicon RMR sight, you'll have a true appreciation for the experience, thought process, and technology that went into this particular pistol.

The standard weapon comes with 2 – 8 shot magazines, there are an additional 3 more making a total of 5 – 8 shot magazines all are S&W. 

This 645 is all stainless steel with wood grips and white outline adjustable rear sight plus red insert front sight.  There are no marks on the frame or slide at all it is the best one that I have seen in years.  This one has been shot but it looks new.  This is the most complete package that I have seen and the weapon is the best looking on the net.  Check out the others and you will see.

$795 cash or trade.  The only item I am interested in are handguns.  No Taurus, Glocks, Kahr,Hi Point, Keltec Derringers,  handgun. Partial trade and cash OK.  Handguns must be in excellent shape as this one is.  Please respond to the email below since I do not always get a timely response from this site.

This slim design makes it perfect for those looking for a concealed carry pistol. Like the whole XD® line of pistols, the XD-S® offers an ergonomic design that makes it easier to point and shoot. The design offers a single-position Picatinny rail, making this one of the only pistols of its size that can be accessorized with lights and lasers. The low profile sight also makes this firearm more holster-friendly.

In addition to the slim contour frame, the XD-S® pistol has many features that make it more comfortable and easy to shoot. Two interchangeable backstraps allow you to customize your grip. The modified contour of the grip also makes it possible for nearly any size hand to release the magazine without twisting or moving from your firing grasp.

The XD-S® has many of the safety features found in other XD® models, such as Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, and grip safety. The XD-S® also has an enhanced secure grip texture.

Combined, all of these features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S® provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and ergonomic point and shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best."
