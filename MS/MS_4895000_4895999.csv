This is a Rare and Beautiful Complete LEW HORTON Colt Custom Shop EL Presidente, 38 Super with the 5” barrel and Bright SS finish. Only 350 of these were ever made. The El Presidente represents the beginning of the Colt EL series pistols and this one is Serial Number 4, manufactured in 1990. The pistol does not appear to have been fired much. The pistol does have a few minor handling marks. I would rate this pistol at 99/98%. The pistol comes with the original three mags, the original gray fabric case, paperwork and the original outer cardboard box. If you collect Colt EL series pistols, this is one you may want in your collection as there were only three made before this one. The buyer must arrange for the items to be shipped to a FFL holder in his area. Buyer must mail a signed, current copy of the FFL holder's license before item may be shipped."

The Redfield Revenge Dial-n-Shoot Rifle Scope brings you high quality features and durability at an affordable price. The Dial n Shoot features a precision exposed 1/4 MOA turret installed and comes with four (4) ballistic matched turrets in common calibers .243 Win., .270 Win., .30-06 SPRG, .300 Win Mag. These turrets provide hunters with a simple way to shoot accurately at long range without guessing holdover. Additionally the Accu-Ranger reticle allows the hunter to determine an accurate distance to the target by bracketing the target in the ranging brackets in the top of the reticle and then simply dialing in to the desired magnification, all without taking your eye off the target. The advanced fully multi-coated lens system provides ultimate light gathering capabilities from dusk to dawn and produces unmatched clarity and resolution. The ample field of view makes target acquisition simple in even the brushiest hunting conditions. Other exciting features include pop-up resettable adjustment turrets with a wide adjustment range, easy gripping power selection ring, Fast focus eye piece and a nitrogen purged body for 100% weather proofing. Covered by the Redfield Limited Lifetime Warranty.

 It used to be that if you wanted a quality 1911 you would have
to trade an arm and a leg and still have to have a gunsmith run a
reliability package to ensure function with defensive ammo. All in
all most people would pick up a 1911 and feel frustration
immediately because they just would not run unless you dumped a ton
of money into them. Enter Armscor. Armscor is a Philippine Company
that manufacturers 1911's that are well built, use excellent
components, and are offered at a fraction of the cost of their
competitors. Armscor has a solid reputation that can be verified
with a little research for producing some the most reliable out of
the box 1911's available anywhere... The Rock Island 1911's. If you
are looking for a shooter and not a safe queen you will hard
pressed to find a finer 1911 at this price point than the Rock
Island 1911 family. Explore their full line of firearms and get
more bang for your hard earned buck with Armscor. The Armscor Rock
Island 1911 is ""Right on Target. Right on Price.""
Chambered in .38 Super and outfitted with smooth wood grips and a
parkerized finish, this is the 1911 Standard GI Series. Faithful to
the original 1911 design, the Standard GI is equipped with a 5""

I have put this gun together over the last few years. It has approximately 30 rounds through it. It is in excellent condition. The only thing it needs is a rail bi pod mount. The MP stock does not have swivels. I installed an Mlock rail piece. Once you get the bi pod mount or install a swivel you’ll be good to go. I recently swapped the scope into the ADM mount and did not get a chance to zero it. This gun is extremely accurate and fun to shoot. It also comes with the factory HS precision Stock.

10 arrows, all are ICS hunters 340 grain, 3 have luminox and thunderhead broad heads 100 grains. 2 were used as practice, and 5 of the arrows have never been shot. 

The bow was purchased at Van's Archery in Whitmore Lake and put together by them as well. Bow alone was purchased at $899.99 before tax. I estimate I have shot well less that 300 arrows through it. It's a great bow, really quiet, dead in the hand. Easy to shoot with it being 33"" axle to axle. Deadly accurate. With all the items here this bow's value is about $1,600 - $1,700 and with as little as its been used I feel $1200 is a fair price.

1 20 rd mag 
1DSA arms Extreme Duty scope mount not installed. Bought it last year but never really had the time to put it on and shoot.
Built on Century upper reciever
Adjustable peep sight, Grenade Gas setting sight aperture
Recoil is surprisingly subtle. Doesnt have a sharp AR kick more AK like. Every time a person shoots it for the first time they are surprised as to how soft and controlable it is for a 308. Never had an issue shooting 2-5 rd bursts and the sight bouncing around or the peep coming out of focus.
The gun is heavy but it's balanced. Never had a problem with fatigue when shooting w/ friends 1-2 hrs standing.

I am looking for cash offers, I know how much I could get for it and I dealt with so many self described ""FAL experts"" either wanting me to part it out or give a detailed descriptions on everything from serial numbers down to the shape of the screws and Im not going to do that anymore. So I'd rather sell it to someone who has the time to shoot it. I havent really shot it in over 10+ mths but I lend it out constantly to friends and family who do. The only thing I don't have is the dust cover which i must have misplaced but they can be found brand new for $15 online or at gun shows. 
I am looking For Cash but if there's trade +$ deal With a nice semi auto rifle Bigger than .22lr then I would consider it. Email Me at REDACTED If you are interested. I have more pics as well but i cannot upload them on here

They made 19,999 of these rifles sound like a lot but they made over 7 million of the 1894/94/94ae before they discontinued them in 2006. Which mean every year that passes these will be harder to get and go UP in value. The rifle is in next to new condition and appears to have been shot only a hand full of times. I have 2 boxes of ammo that will go with the rifle.

Product Info: 
One of the first things a GLOCK® owner should consider is upgrading the stock trigger. ZEV™ builds the best triggers in the business and ZEV's Adjustable Fulcrum® Drop-In Trigger Kit components were used to set a world record. The Adjustable Fulcrum Drop-In Trigger Kit only requires one tool (a standard 3/32nd punch), and 15 minutes of your time.
You will immediately notice these differences in your gun's performance after installation:
The trigger face is flatter and the trigger safety is three times wider than a stock trigger; this is ideal for quickly placing your finger in the optimal firing position. This will help build proper muscle memory for improved consistency and accuracy.
Because of ZEV's proprietary trigger bar refinements the trigger operates smoothly through the entire length of pull.
The trigger's crisp tactile reset gives the user a clear feeling for the moment of reset. This feedback improves the user's ability to ride the reset to improve follow up shot speed and placement.
The trigger weight can be adjusted to as low as 3 lbs. A lighter pull weight requires less pressure, reducing trigger fatigue and improving accuracy.
The pre-travel and over-travel are adjustable to allow for a shorter pull, crisper break and faster reset.
Trigger adjustments will give the benefit of shorter take up, post break travel and will result in a shorter reset.
The Ultimate Kit has a Skeletonized Firing Pin, the benefit is its lighter construction, polish, and the tip of the firing pin is extended for more positive primer ignition.
Was installed fired, unistalled and polished.

The rifle also includes 5 extra barrels: 1x .22 WALDOG with very little use, 3x 6mm PPC barrels, 2x 30BR barrels (both Krieger -- newest is installed). 

This is an ""oldy but a goody"" and has been through lots of battles (matches :-) ). It does show it's ""experience"" but still shoots extremely well. Last time out this rifle scored 250-24X on a IBS 50 yard rimfire targe set at 100yds!!

You can see from the picutres that there are a few nicks and dings.  Many of these are from shooting on an indoor range next to someone shooting an autoloader with the brass flying across the bench.  So while it might looked ""used"" (it is :-)  ) it still performs extremely well and is a lot of fun to shoot."

Real Russian Bakelite AK-47 7.62x39 caliber 30 round mags for sale. These are used 'Very Good' to 'Like New' with some imperfections like minor surface rust on the floor plate, follower and locking lugs from long term storage. The body is made of orange color Bakelite, which is a high strength polymer that does not dent or rust.  Some mags may have scratches, scuffing and wear, but many are like new. Condition will vary mag to mag and sold 'as is' but from what I have seen these are extremely nice in condition and most are like new. Some mags may have ink stamps and others do not,  some are proofed as Tula and some are Izhevsk, special selection is not available. Bakelite AK47 Mags are known for being rare and of excellent quality and functionality. They also weigh about 0.2 pounds less than regular steel AK-47 mags, saving you some total gear / gun weight when used. AK aficionados  consider authentic Bakelite mags to be the highest quality mag ever produced for AK47 Rifles."

It comes with 1980 rounds of 5.45 x 39 Russian ammo (no longer available for import) and 10 mags. I believe I still have the original parts that I've upgraded if you'd like those as well. This rifle runs great and I'm a big fan of this caliber. There is one small scratch at the back of the forearm, but it I purchased it like that and it's barely noticeable. I'm asking $1500 for the package and don't care to break it up. Considering this rifle is no longer produced, the ammo can no longer be imported and the quality of the upgrades, this is a very fair price.

Meprolight night sights—standard. Front strap and trigger guard checkering—standard. Extended ambidextrous thumb safety—standard. Kimber Tactical pistols are no-compromise, purpose-built pistols that leave nothing out, and Kimber quality brings it all together. Like all Kimber pistols, each has rounded and blended edges to prevent snagging, along with match grade barrels, chambers and triggers. No other pistol design equals the 1911 for true tactical performance; and no 1911 brand matches the quality and dependability of Kimber.
Small and light enough for backup, perfect for concealed carry.
