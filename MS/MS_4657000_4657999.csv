I am a 72 year old disabled Vietnam era veteran of the United States Marine Corps and a former deputy with Rockwall and Hunt County Sheriffs Office. I have a strong regard this Sig Sauer 1911 Scorpion Carry with Threaded Barrel this particular model features as integrated features, designed and built into the pistol at the time of manufacture, features that make it a safe carry weapon, a home defense weapon, primary defense weapon for persons in law enforcement or as a pepper weapon if that is the end use that you embrace.

A scenario close to my heart involves a perceived intruder in the early morning hours! With the included Laser Aiming module/Laser Sight, in complete darkness (or daylight for that matter) a highly visible intense green laser beam constantly illuminates the target revealing the weapons true bore sight. You, the shooter, intuitively, immediately and precisely, place the tactical laser green dot on the target, and you will also be able to immediately discriminate that target is not a spouse (husband, wife) or other loved one. The mechanics of holding the weapon to achieve sight alignment is also not a part of the larger equation at a time when the adrenaline is running high.

Unless one is a match shooter, then the objective of owning a weapon is under some preconceived scenario, a shooter desires to render an adversary incapacitated. Then the adversary is no longer capable of advancing his or her sinister deed. This is accomplished by using a weapon and load that is designed to deliver a bullet with a sufficient amount of kinetic energy in order to introduce the effects of a ballistic trauma in order to render the adversary incapacitated. An elementary discussion of muzzle energy and the kinetic energy of a bullet can be found at the following URL, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy

I will include below two ammunition ballistics charts the ballistics101.com web site for a quick review of Ammo Ballistics, Muzzle Energy for both 9mm and .45 cal ACP capable weapons. I am of the opinion that a large number of people that are carrying 9mm weapons do so for the wrong reasons. Early on the 9mm pistol was introduced as a light weight as well as light duty secondary weapon that would be used immediately should the primary weapon become UN-serviceable. It was also used by individuals that were not likely to be cast in a combat role.

While I own combat capable rifles, my primary side arm is not intended to serve as a light duty weapon. Instead, it must be a pistol that meets the highest engineering standards while being capable of rendering an adversary incapacitated with a single shot. At this point as an old and crotchety, gimpy, disabled Marine, one shot may be the only opportunity that I have to confront an adversary. I want to have engineered reliability, kinetic energy and ballistic trauma working to my advantage, not for the bad guy! Like so many things in life, when it comes to kinetic energy and ballistic trauma, more is better, assuming that recoil and weapon management are not an issue for the shooter…

So now, let me speak to this shooter. This weapon is NOT like new, it is absolutely brand spanking NEW! Sig Sauer has topped the 1911 Scorpion with the release the Carry version, the newest Sig Sauer 1911 incarnation! It is the Sig Sauer 1911 Scorpion Carry and with a Threaded Barrel (.578” x 28 TPI)! This is a real “Big Boy” shooter and readily concealable.

It remains un-fired. And because words mean things, it has not even been fired once! It has only been mauled by me as I added the following accessories:

A James Bond style removable muzzle break/flash suppressor, .45 cal threaded barrel w/right twist in .578” x 28 tpi. You can also accessorize the threaded barrel on your Scorpion Carry version with your own sound suppressor as you wish.

A because the 45 cal Scorpion Carry versions’ frame has an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail under the dust cover for mounting lasers or lights, I added a detachable laser aiming module in addition to the steel flash suppressor.

This detachable Laser Aiming module/Laser Sight is a superb laser sight. It emits a highly visible intense green laser beam constantly, and facilitates bore sighting to the weapons physical bore sight, enabling the shooter to intuitively, immediately and precisely, place the intense tactical laser green dot on the target, and then delivering an incapacitating round on target with a single tap/shot with no need to achieve sight alignment under any target lighting condition. This gives the shooter an unequaled and unsurpassed winning advantage in any shooting scenario! Now that’s a winning advantage that I want for myself and I want it for all of my brother Marines, other military, spooks, law enforcement and all of the other “good guys” that stand up each day, keeping our country safe! Special Ops has it And So Should You!

This Vokul detachable 532nm Tactical Green Dot Laser Sight includes：Green Laser sight ×1,Metal 22mm Picatinny Rail Mount, Switch button Pressure Pad Switch and “8”type mount, Allen Wrench and a 3V CR123A Lithium Battery

Based on the S/N and features it is a Carbine 1st Model. Built between 1904/5-1914. It is not in perfect shape but is a solid shooter. It has a 20"" barrel and the flip up rear sight with pinned front blade. The front blade is not original. The rear stock was either broken or shaved on the bottom side. It is the crescent style butt plate. Checking into it the stock may be original, just someone worked on it. The saddle ring is missing but the staple is still on the gun. The saddle ring is what denotes it as a 1st Model as it was removed from the 2nd Model line. The serial # is only 4 digits with an ""A"" prefix. I am not quite sure what this is worth, considering condition. I am willing to entertain offers while I have it appraised. I do not expect it to be of high value as I regard it as an everyday shooter with some history. Looking at $600 OBO. I accept a money order or bank check and will ship via USPS insured for actual amount. Any questions or need more pics please send me an email. I prefer to deal only in WI but can ship to a valid FFL. Thanks for looking. Brandon."

I am a 72 year old disabled Vietnam era veteran of the United States Marine Corps and a former deputy with Rockwall and Hunt County Sheriffs Office.  I have a strong regard for this Sig Sauer 1911 Scorpion Carry .45 ACP weapon with a Threaded Barrel.  This particular model features a number of features designed, built and integrated into the pistol at the time of manufacture, features that make it a very effective and safe carry weapon, a home defense weapon, primary defense weapon for persons in law enforcement or as a pepper weapon if that is the end use that you embrace.

A scenario close to my heart involves an intruder in the early morning hours, an intruder which poses a perceived threat of the most vile kind!  With the included Laser Aiming module/Laser Sight installed, in complete darkness (or daylight for that matter) a highly visible intense green laser beam constantly illuminates the target revealing the weapons true bore sight.  You, the shooter, intuitively, immediately and precisely, places the tactical laser green dot on the target, and you will also be able to immediately discriminate that target is not a spouse (husband, wife) or other loved one.  The mechanics of holding the weapon to achieve sight alignment is not a part of the larger equation at a time when the adrenaline level is running high and time is absolutely of the essence.  As the responsible party in your home, you want to point and click, not a whole lot different than the intuitive operation of the mouse on your home computer or on your smart phone.  Having made certain that those that you love are out of harms way, you need to point and click, just one time!
With no hesitation, you are able to verify, point and click, and you or your bride can be assured that they will immediately incapacitate the “bad guy” with a single click.  With a 9mm, two or three shots may be required…  In my SO days, on the range, ALL peace officers are indoctrinated to shoot in two round groups due to the ballistic characteristics of the 38, 357 and 9mm ammunition.  This engendered habit could increase the likelihood that this peace officer would go home to his or her family at the end of the day!

Unless one is a match shooter or a pistol hunter, then the likely objective of owning a weapon of this type is the preconceived scenario where a shooter will need to render an adversary incapacitated.  In this model, the adversary is no longer capable of advancing his or her sinister motive or deed.  This is accomplished by using a weapon and load designed to deliver a bullet with a sufficient amount of kinetic energy in order to introduce the effects of ballistic trauma, rendering an adversary incapacitated.  Restated, rendering an adversary incapacitated immediately!  An elementary discussion of muzzle energy and the kinetic energy of a bullet can be found at the following URL, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy


I have included below two ammunition ballistics charts from the ballistics101.com web site for a quick review of Ammo Ballistics, Muzzle Energy for both 9mm and .45 cal ACP capable weapons.  I am of the opinion that a large number of people that are carrying 9mm weapons do so for the wrong reasons. Early on when the 9mm pistol was introduced as a light weight and a light duty secondary weapon, it would be used should the persons primary weapon become UN-serviceable.  It was also used by individuals that were not likely to be cast into a combat role.

While I own combat capable rifles, my primary side arm is not intended to serve as a light duty backup weapon.  Instead, it must be a pistol that meets the highest engineering and reliability standards and be capable of rendering an adversary immediately incapacitated with a single shot.  At this point, as an old and crotchety, gimpy, disabled Marine, one shot may be the only opportunity that I have to confront and dispatch an adversary.  I want/need to have engineered reliability, kinetic energy and ballistic trauma working to my advantage, and not for the bad guy!  Like so many things in life, when it comes to kinetic energy and ballistic trauma, more is better, and assuming that weapon management and recoil are not an issue for the shooter, a weapon with moderated recoil in a .45 caliber load is the choice I have made from the Vietnam conflict days through today…

So now, let me speak to this shooter. This weapon is NOT like new, it is absolutely brand spanking NEW!  Sig Sauer has topped the 1911 Scorpion with the release of the Carry version, the newest Sig Sauer 1911 incarnation! It is the Sig Sauer 1911 Scorpion Carry .45 ACP with Threaded Barrel (.578” x 28 TPI)!  This is a real “Big Boy” shooter and with every  thing going on for it, it is readily concealable too.

It remains un-fired.  And because words mean things, it has not even been fired once!  It has only been mauled by me as I added the following accessories:

A removable muzzle break/flash suppressor, .45 cal threaded barrel w/right twist in .578” x 28 tpi.  You can also accessorize the threaded barrel on this Scorpion Carry version with your own sound suppressor as you wish.

A because the 45 cal Scorpion Carry versions’ frame has an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail under the dust cover for mounting lasers or lights, I added a detachable laser aiming module in addition to the steel flash suppressor.

This detachable Laser Aiming module/Laser Sight is a superb laser sight. It emits a highly visible intense green laser beam constantly, and facilitates bore sighting to the weapons physical bore sight, enabling the shooter to intuitively, immediately and precisely, place the intense tactical laser green dot on the target, and then delivering an incapacitating round on target with a single tap/shot with no need to achieve sight alignment under any target lighting condition. This gives the shooter an unequaled and unsurpassed winning advantage in any shooting scenario! Now that’s a winning advantage that I want for myself and I want it for all of my brother Marines, other military, spooks, law enforcement and all of the other “good guys” that stand up each day, keeping our country safe! Special Ops has it And So Should You!

I am a 72 year old disabled Vietnam era veteran of the United States Marine Corps and a former deputy with Rockwall and Hunt County Sheriffs Office.  I have a strong regard for this Sig Sauer 1911 Scorpion Carry .45 ACP weapon with a Threaded Barrel.  This particular model has a number of features designed, built and integrated into the pistol at the time of manufacture, features that make it a very effective and safe carry weapon, a home defense weapon, primary defense weapon for persons in law enforcement or as a pepper weapon if that is the end use that you embrace.

A scenario close to my heart involves an intruder in the early morning hours, an intruder which poses a perceived threat of the most vile kind!  With the included Laser Aiming module/Laser Sight installed, in complete darkness (or daylight for that matter) a highly visible intense green laser beam constantly illuminates the target revealing the weapons true bore sight.  You, the shooter, intuitively, immediately and precisely, places the tactical laser green dot on the target, and you will also be able to immediately discriminate that target is not a spouse (husband, wife) or other loved one.  The mechanics of holding the weapon to achieve sight alignment is not a part of the larger equation at a time when the adrenaline level is running high and time is absolutely of the essence.  As the responsible party in your home, you want to point and click, not a whole lot different than the intuitive operation of the mouse on your home computer or on your smart phone.  Having made certain that those that you love are out of harms way, you need to point and click, just one time!

With no hesitation, you are able to verify, point and click, and you or your bride can be assured that they will immediately incapacitate the “bad guy” with a single click.  With a 9mm, two or three shots may be required…  In my SO days, on the range, ALL peace officers are indoctrinated to shoot in two round groups due to the ballistic characteristics of the 38, 357 and 9mm ammunition.  This engendered habit could increase the likelihood that this peace officer would go home to his or her family at the end of the day!

Unless one is a match shooter or a pistol hunter, then the likely objective of owning a weapon of this type is the preconceived scenario where a shooter will need to render an adversary incapacitated.  In this model, the adversary is no longer capable of advancing his or her sinister motive or deed.  This is accomplished by using a weapon and load designed to deliver a bullet with a sufficient amount of kinetic energy in order to introduce the effects of ballistic trauma, rendering an adversary incapacitated.  Restated, rendering an adversary incapacitated immediately!  An elementary discussion of muzzle energy and the kinetic energy of a bullet can be found at the following URL, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy


I have included below two ammunition ballistics charts from the ballistics101.com web site for a quick review of Ammo Ballistics, Muzzle Energy for both 9mm and .45 cal ACP capable weapons.  I am of the opinion that a large number of people that are carrying 9mm weapons do so for the wrong reasons. Early on when the 9mm pistol was introduced as a light weight and a light duty secondary weapon, it would be used should the persons primary weapon become UN-serviceable.  It was also used by individuals that were not likely to be cast into a combat role.

While I own combat capable rifles, my primary side arm is not intended to serve as a light duty backup weapon.  Instead, it must be a pistol that meets the highest engineering and reliability standards and be capable of rendering an adversary immediately incapacitated with a single shot.  At this point, as an old and crotchety, gimpy, disabled Marine, one shot may be the only opportunity that I have to confront and dispatch an adversary.  I want/need to have engineered reliability, kinetic energy and ballistic trauma working to my advantage, and not for the bad guy!  Like so many things in life, when it comes to kinetic energy and ballistic trauma, more is better, and assuming that weapon management and recoil are not an issue for the shooter, a weapon with moderated recoil in a .45 caliber load is the choice I have made from the Vietnam conflict days through today…

So now, let me speak to this shooter. This weapon is NOT like new, it is absolutely brand spanking NEW!  Sig Sauer has topped the 1911 Scorpion with the release of the Carry version, the newest Sig Sauer 1911 incarnation! It is the Sig Sauer 1911 Scorpion Carry .45 ACP with Threaded Barrel (.578” x 28 TPI)!  This is a real “Big Boy” shooter and with every  thing going on for it, it is readily concealable too.

It remains un-fired.  And because words mean things, it has not even been fired once!  It has only been mauled by me as I added the following accessories:

A removable muzzle break/flash suppressor, .45 cal threaded barrel w/right twist in .578” x 28 tpi.  You can also accessorize the threaded barrel on this Scorpion Carry version with your own sound suppressor as you wish.

A because the 45 cal Scorpion Carry versions’ frame has an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail under the dust cover for mounting lasers or lights, I added a detachable laser aiming module in addition to the steel flash suppressor.

This detachable Laser Aiming module/Laser Sight is a superb laser sight. It emits a highly visible intense green laser beam constantly, and facilitates bore sighting to the weapons physical bore sight, enabling the shooter to intuitively, immediately and precisely, place the intense tactical laser green dot on the target, and then delivering an incapacitating round on target with a single tap/shot with no need to achieve sight alignment under any target lighting condition. This gives the shooter an unequaled and unsurpassed winning advantage in any shooting scenario! Now that’s a winning advantage that I want for myself and I want it for all of my brother Marines, other military, spooks, law enforcement and all of the other “good guys” that stand up each day, keeping our country safe! Special Ops has it And So Should You!

I am willing to discuss and trade in any combination that works for you: ""off-the-grid"" survival skills, building small-scale solar power and water generation systems, video/audio transfer/archiving, military-grade computer data archiving & storage (including EMP protection of your data), basic firearms training with an emphasis on safety and familiarity and/or designing/building ""ghost"" ARs - even restored some houses and cars.

Willing to go to the range with examples of my work. Work full time and willing to make plain old cash payment arrangements or help you with a ""build"". Have some up-front cash, silver, ammo, or collectible firearms I'd be willing to trade.

315,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4657315,For Sale:  AR500 Steel Targets,"North, Lincoln, Nebraska",$ 70,"Listed On: Friday, October 2, 2015",Targets,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I placed an order, and my wife is a bit perturbed by it, so I am going to offer some of them for sale to (hopefully) make amends. Since I have already had a lowball offer on one of these targets, let me clarify things. I do not NEED to sell these, nor am I entertaining offers. The prices I will accept are listed. If you don't want to pay them, then move on.

I have the following 3/8 inch targets:
1 - 7""x11.8"" mini silhouette, weighs approximately 7.5lbs. = $37
1 - 8""x8"" square, weighs approximately 7lbs. = $33

These 3/8"" targets may not seem like much, but they are rated for rifles up to 308/30-06 at a minimum of 100 yards. They will work fine with standard pistol (22, 32, 380, 38, 9mm, 40, 45) at a minimum of 10 yards, and magnum pistol (357, 44, 454, etc.) at 25+.
This is hardened steel that is designed to stop a bullet, with a hardness of 500 Brinell.  Unlike the mild steel others are selling here, this is the type of steel used to armor cars and military trucks and will stop most small arms easily.  
As for mild steel, I have seen a 308 go THROUGH 3/4 inch mild steel...like grade 50 which has a hardness of 135 Brinell.  If you want a good target that will not crater, buckle, pit, or FAIL, get AR500!

I can also degrease and paint the targets bright orange as shown in the last pic. That is an 8""x8"" target.


SAVE ON SHIPPING, buy from me!  If you want some other sizes, email and ask what else I have that I may part with, or what I can get. 

I'm close to exit 399 on I-80 and will meet within a reasonable distance of there."

I've put about 200 rounds through it and have never had a jam that people complain about(I'm very meticulous about cleaning it too) As close to new as you will get. Have all boxes and paper work. Even have my receipt where I paid $1000. This is what it comes with:
 *The IZ109 Saiga 12
 *5 round magazine
 *10 round promag
 *Around 100 rounds of birdshot(cant remember if I used any)
 *5 rounds of buckshot
 I just was shown by a guy how much they really are now so I have come down. $850 and you pay the transfer fee($25)
 **Buds gun shop has them for $895(a dealer will charge you $50-$75 to have it shipped to them) http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/81156/RWC+Group+IZ109+Saiga+Shotgun+5%2B1+12ga+19%22
 **Heres the promag for $32.50
 **$30 worth of ammo
 So you can get all of that new for $1002.50-$1027.50(plus taxes you pay on the guns) and this ones as good as new and you wont have to wait weeks to receive it. Used a little but 200 rounds is nothing and it was extremely cleaned after.
 This gun is great. Literally the real deal AK47 chambered in 12 gauge(made by the exact same people that make the real AK47 in Russia)"

The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Rifle Scope was designed specifically for the US Special Operations Command SOPMOD M4 Carbine and features the reticle bullet drop compensator and range finding stadia lines that are based on the trajectory of the 62 grain bullet from a 16 inch M4A1 barrel. The black, daytime reticle of the Trijicon ACOG 4x32 glows amber at night and in low light due to its tritium composition. Unique to the Trijicon ACOG sights is its internal adjustment capability - only the prism housing moves - making this the most rugged scope available. This rifle scope by Trijicon will withstand exposure to temperature extremes, salt spray, fog, fungus, humidity, sand, dust, shock vibration and a free fall drop onto a hard surface. Aerospace seals make Trijicon riflescopes waterproof to depths greater than 500 feet. The user does not need to make any special adjustments between shots at different ranges.

Manufacturer is Chiappa Firearms Ltd. / Kimar Plant in Brescia, Italy. Importer and Warrantor is Chiappa Firearms of Dayton, OH. Service address 6785 West Third Street, Zip 45417, and that address is on the back of the instruction manual. National distributor is Legacy Sports of Nevada. Type is blowback action rimfire semi automatic rifle. Construction is a two piece sleeved steel 18 inch 1:16 rifling barrel; steel bolt and hammer and springs; polymer receiver; polymer operating handle and trigger group; polymer rear aperture sight with steel screws for windage and elevation adjustmet; polymer collar type post front sight; polymer magazines; polymer barrel band and bayonet lug; zinc alloy trigger; and Harvest Moon dark camo colorized polymer stock that holds a steel butt plate. This rifle is cosmetically faithful to the U.S. Carbine. Its only departure that is readily conspicuous is the grooved receiver that is capable of holding 3/8 base scope mounts, and that is an advantage. Overall length is 35 inches, with a 13 1/8 length of pull on the Buttstock. Weight empty is 4 pounds 8 ounces with center of gravity at the magazine. Magazines hold 10 rounds of .22 Long Rifle caliber ammunition, and each M1-22 comes with a total of two magazines. This little rifle exceeds its Erma ancestors for looks and balance, and it matches them on performance. We test fired one Chiappa, and got up to 3 consecutive shots before a jam on Remington Golden Bullet High Velocity ammunition, and up to 7 consecutive shots before jamming on Winchester Super X Copper Coated. That is on a par with the Ermas, from our poor memory. If a person wants better feeding than that, the best thing for a new owner to do, is to get a return authorization and send it to Dayton, perhaps a time or two. This is a looker, after all. If a person wants a shooter, best to stick with the most prolific product from a different factory on Sunapee Street in Newport, New Hampshire. Each Chiappa comes in its factory box with protective padding, instruction manual that includes warranty statement, and total of two magazines.

The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistant and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 and includes an AAC 51-tooth blackout flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight's Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group's nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158 phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 Ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used.Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by Magpul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are not included.The recommend optional sound suppressor is the AAC SDN-6 or any 51-tooth 5.56 or 308 AAC suppressor which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition."

The enhanced carrier has fewer points of contact resulting in less friction area and the slight increase in carrier mass extends dwell time and ensures proper gas pressures for reliable extraction.
*Material: Case-hardened 8620 steel (complete care is taken during the heat treat process, so as to not harm the metal)
• Finish: Black Nitride. This advanced low friction coating minimizes the need for lubricants, as well as being very resistant to wear. Most recognize Nitride as “Melonite” or “Isonite”. This is a salt bath nitrocarbonite coating, that has proven to be very good for hard use parts.
• Gas key: 4130 Steel, attached with Grade 8 hardware, torqued and properly staked into a milled “valley” around a fully encased ejection port area, for added strength and rigidity.
• Cam Pin: Hardened 4340 cam pin.
• Firing Pin: Mil Spec firing pin made of 8740 steel, center-less ground and Hard Chrome coated.
Bolt
Bolt Assembly: The Bolt is “true” Mil Spec dimension and external surfaces are CNC ground after heat treat for a precision fit. These bolts are held to the highest possible tolerance possible. The “trumpet” area behind the gas rings, where carbon normally collects, is precision CNC Ground after heat treatment, to ensure as smooth of an area as possible, easing clean up, and longevity.

I'm looking to either trade it for an AK or for an SKS plus cash. ---Read carefully--- AK's I'm not too worried about the condition, just don't show up with a busted rusted piece of crap. SKS's I either want a Russian or Norinco. NO YUGOS. SKS should be all original with matching numbers and not beat to hell and back. I don't mind a small amount of pitting/rust as long as the bore is nice with deep grooves. I will consider one with a Tapco stock as long as it has the bottom rail for attachments. The amount of cash I'll accept for the booster depends on how nice your trade is..............Also in the market for Springfield XDs and XDM's of any caliber. Thanks for looking, pics of the AR will be up soon."
