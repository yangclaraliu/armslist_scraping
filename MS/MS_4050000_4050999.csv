Comes with hard case, 2 magazines, and multiple sized back and side straps. Please email with any questions. You can pick up in person or I can ship to your FFL. I accept cash, credit cards, and paypal. I will consider trades. If the ad is active then It is still available. Cash discount price $579. *please note* Texas residents must pay state sales tax.In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.      Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis."

Purchased for my wife.  Who has never taken out of box to test fire. this gun has literally been touched maybe twice, once for the pictures to follow...  If you have any questions, ask away.  However price is firm.  The pistol is brand new so please no ""tire kickers"" I have another one tucked away for myself which I absolutely love for special occasions where weight and size are really a consideration.  I believe this gun weighs about 11-12 ounces. 

Please be 21 with a valid ID (I will be writing your name down).  Concealed weapons permit preferred.  Cash only.  Thanks for looking!

By popular demand, Buffalo Bore is introducing five new 38 Super+P loads. With three different expanding loads and two penetrating loads, we have covered the basis of anything you'd like to accomplish with the 38 Super+P cartridge. These are full power 38 Super+P loads. All five of these loads feature flash suppressed powders so the shooter will not be blinded if firing in low light. Feeding, function and accuracy was very good in all three of our test pistols.

Two Titan Tiger 38-Specials with snob nose one is for $150.00 it does not have the fron site.  The other Titan Tiger is $165.00 it has the front site.  These gun weight is about 1 lb 12 oz.  

Three Davis model P-380, two are all black and one is chrome.  The Blacks are going for $135.00 and the Chrome is $140.00.  These are small conceal and carry firearms.  The length is 5 inches and the depth is 4 inches and about an inch wide.  These would be very nice carry guns for hiking, hunting or traveling.  

Two Black Lorcin model L380.  One is missing the safety / fire selector.  I tested fired all these firearms.  The Lorcin without the safety selector is $135.00 and the other Lorcin is $150.00  I would say these firearms are full size.  They fell nice in the hand.

I have other used firearms. I am only listing my new firearms on morrisonmall.com at present.  If you are looking for an inexpensive American Made Firearm go to morrisonmall.com  The webstore is national but I am local. If you see anything at morrisonmall.com, I can get that for you locally.  All prices, include a required background check.  The background check is $15.00 pluse tax.  If you purchase a firearm on line and need a transfer agent - federal firearm license dealer email me and I will arange to have the firearm shipped to me and I will do the required background check.  Not bad for $15.00.  

For inexpensive American Made pistols, Look at the line of Cobra and Hi Point pistols.  Cobra has a large selection of derringers, Freedom Series, CA, Denali Series.  All are small, reliable, concealable firearms.  A little biger firearm are the Hi Point model CF380 380 ACP or the model C9 is 9 mm.  I own several Hi Point pistols.  two 40 S&W and they are very accurate and reliable, the Hi Point carbines are great shooting and use hand gun ammo. I have a Model 995 and a Model 4595TS.  I shoot what I sell.

A final note both Hi Point and Cobra Firearms have one of the best lifetime warrantees on the firearm market.  Both companies warrantee the gun not the owner or not for just a year.
Thank you and God Bless"

These have a MILLED receiver = Springfields have a cast receiver --- military uses a Milled receiver.  An independent review done back in the early 90's between the 3 companies selling  M1A's - Polytech was the only rifle to complete the test without an incident. Springfield finish LAST - with a function failure after only 500 rounds and Armscorp had firing pin problems with punctured primers.

This is one of the lightest handguards on the market today weighing a little over 9 oz.  Never installed, opened only to photograph it, I bought more than one so this one is unneeded. This uses a standard barrel nut so you don't even need to remove your barrel to install it!

Fortis REV™ is an extremely lightweight yet robust free floating rail system. When designing the REV™, we didn’t want just another rail system, we wanted a better, lighter, feature rich handguard that was robust and within budget. We’ve managed to reduce as much weight as possible while maintaining strength by utilizing a 1 piece body design. KeyMods were added at the 6 & 9 o'clock positions for modularity and additional weight savings. Its unique mounting system captures a standard AR15 barrel nut for easy installation. Check out all the features and see for yourself why the Fortis REV™ beats the competition. Because of the anti-rotational tabs, the REV™ rail may not fit all uppers without slight modification. Fits most mil-spec forged uppers without any issues.

It's the newest version with the improved slide release and somewhat better trigger reset.

I don't really want to outright sell it, but if you really want I think $600 is fair. 
I would trade for a CZ 75 or similar, Beretta, Sig Sauer, 1911 of some type or maybe something else. NO XD's!!!

It has been manufactured to the strictest tolerances in order to perform in the harshest environments. The 3-15x50 Tactical riflescope is waterproof, fogproof and shockproof. It has a 30mm, single piece tube construction. This riflescope is endowed with an Enhanced Mil-Dot reticle and has fully multicoated lenses that contribute to the brightness and contrast of the optics. Locating the reticle in the first focal plane allows the size of the pattern to increase as the magnification is increased. This is preferred by many tactical groups for use as a point of aim and as a means of measurement and adjustment at any power level. 

The side focus feature allows parallax adjustment to keep the reticle and target aligned regardless of the shooters head position. An extra-hard coating on the exterior lens surfaces protects the optics from the scratches and abrasions that all too often occur in the rough and tumble world of tactical endeavors. With a comfortable eye relief at full 4 inches and a 1/10 Mil value for the windage and elevation turret adjustments, this riflescope is provisioned with all the features required for serious tactical work. This is a serious glass for serious situations.

Built on the G30 SF frame, the G30S combines the full capacity .45 AUTO round count with a slimmer slide. This pistol offers a lighter, more easily concealable option for Law Enforcement and legal concealed-carry enthusiasts. Built in conjunction with elite law enforcement, the newest edition to the GLOCK product line brings a venerable history of consistency, dependability and safe performance in the powerful .45 Auto round."

MSRP for this item is $1080. I'm selling because I've decided to switch to a 5.56 upper. Trades welcome that are comparable with my sale price. What you see in the box is what you get. Less than 100 rounds fired for testing operability. Works great!! I can meet locally at a range for you to test fire yourself. You just need to pay for ammo and range fee.

Description from their website:
Advanced Armament Corporation complete MPW rifles are chambered for 300 AAC BLACKOUT. (*All NFA rules apply)

A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. 

Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. Optics, mounts, and silencer are not included.

The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition."

Holds 6 shots, and is single action only. 

I am not the original owner, I received this in trade from a family friend, I would love to keep it but promised the old lady I would downsize some.  The grips are not original, those were cracked many years ago and were replaced by custom made ones (I forget what type wood) prior to me getting it.  Pistol does have some nicks (see pictures), but still locks up nice and tight.  Just trying to most accurately represent it and be honest with potential buyers.

According to the serial number, this one was made in 1959. 

Buyer must have either NC concealed carry or valid pistol permit (I will have to keep permit), and be willing to sign a bill of sale (each party will receive a copy). This is non-negotiable, so please don't ask me otherwise.  Asking $340 OBO, not interested in trades or shipping at this time.

Best way to reach me is through phone (text is the quickest) at REDACTED.  If you email me, please give me some time in order to respond back because occasionally emails get routed to junk.

I will not budge on the price because it is in new condition and do not need to sell it.

An excellent tactical or hunting rig it could be made into an M24 clone if you had the inclination. This gun has about 200 rounds through it. It was broken in well and cleaned after every shot for the first 40 rounds and then every 5 rounds up to 100. It has never shown much of anything in the way of fouling when cleaned just a few black smudges. It is a tack driver even with commercial 180gr ammo. It does have some minor speckled rust on it from putting it under the bed for a few months once...ugh see pics nothing a little cerakote wouldn't cure. There are no other dings or blemishes. Ask if you want more pics. I always intended to really work with this gun, shorten the barrel, cerakote, develop some handloads and really make it into something I used every day. But life interfered. Anyway I need to sell it as I need the money more than another project. Mind you it functions perfectly fine as is. I have shot 3 deer with it, all brain shots at greater than 100 yards, no misses. I paid $1300 for it; firm at $900.  Also will sell Bushnell Elite 6500 4.5-30x scope with it for $550 or separate.

The large target grip fits snugly in my hand and is very stable when shooting. I've only fired 50 rounds through it to see what it could do and then put it away. The retail sticker says $350, but I think $250 is pretty fair.

Thanks for looking"

The barrel exterior is very nice, the body is very nice, there is a definitive turn ring on the cylinder. The barrel nut removes as it should and the barrel threads are in excellent shape. The action is smooth and firing ignition is reliable.

If you have something in a revolver that you might like to trade let me know. It would need to be a Ruger or a Smith & Wesson to be of interest to me at this time. 
Thanks for taking a look, I will respond to each that contacts me."

I got very excited over AR's last month with the flurry of AR sales all over the country, and couldn't resist using my tax returns(thanks Federals!) to get the nicest M4 I could find. Up until last week I had never even held an AR style rifle. But, once I got a chance to play with it, and inspect the internals, I realized that I just liked AK's much better. Call me old-school; I prefer my guns to be conscript-proofed. But now, my loss is your gain! (unless you're wanting to trade, which we'll get to in a minute)


     Price is firm, I'm actually taking a loss on the price(it was mostly the goodies, ammo, and new barrel that drove the price up), but I wound up not liking the AR as much as the AK, and with limited safe space, I'd rather sell this one off quick and take advantage of the AK sales going on right now.

    The manufacturer is nominally Bear Creek Arsenal, but that really only applies to the lower receiver, hand guard, and trigger assembly at this point. The rest were, as far as I'm aware, third-party options that Bear Creek offers in place of it's own standard parts. It was all through their customer service via the phone however; they do not offer those options online for whatever reason.

It strikes beautifully in case you're curious, and there are three test rounds), still in it's original packaging, original factory lube, manuals, everything. I opened it, dis-assembled it, figured out how it functioned, and put it back together and back in the case, deciding ""meh, it's pretty, but damn, I should have bought another AK"".


I apologize for the blurry gun photo; I have a very old phone with a low-quality camera. The other photo is stock.


Included, just to be perfectly clear:

-Bear Creek customized M4 style AR
-2 magazines, 30 rounds
-Hard carry case with foam inserts
-Manual/Safety pamphlets
-3 test rounds from factory with test date stamp
-1,000 rounds silver bear 5.56 NATO, all brand new, sealed in packaging.



Everything is new, never touched save for my one dis-assembly of the rifle, and opening one pack of 20 rounds to make sure they were all nice and pretty. Other than that it has sat in a humidity controlled safe, awaiting judgement.




TRADES:

   I'm looking primarily for cash, because frankly I just want to go get a very nice AK in this M4's place, but I will always consider trades. My current hunts are:



-Mosins of any type. Will trade direct if you have enough Mosins. Seriously; I love Mosins. Priority is given to non-91/30's, even though those are my favorite, I have plenty of the basic Mosins. That being said, ANY Mosin will get my attention.
-Mausers of any type(excepting the Spanish .308 models), I vastly, VASTLY prefer German WWI/WWII models, as opposed to Turkish, Yugoslavian, etc, but I will look at them all.
-AK's, somewhat obviously, the cheaper the better(I prefer to do my own upgrading)
-Maxim MG of any type, any style, any caliber
-Dragunov Sniper
-SVT-40(If you have this or the Maxim, you have my undivided attention. Both are one of the few pieces still missing from my Soviet Firearms collection)


   I think my ideal trade would be for an AK, plus a handful of Mosins. But that's a stretch that assumes Portland is full of people who collect Mosins, like myself. So offer away, the worst I can say is no. Shotguns are an automatic no, just to clarify. I have a 12ga, and that's really all the shotgun I ever need.

   I'm willing to consider partial trades and cash, or direct trades, or any combination we can think of. This is first come, first served, so email me ASAP if you'd like it; I can't imagine any AR sitting on Armslist for more than a few days, but then again I've never had one before, so what do I know!

    The only thing this M4 is missing, in my noobie opinion, is a proper scope, but that being said, the iron sights are already after-market upgraded, and they work beautifully."

Even today it still has varnish on the sling estutcheons. I have fired fewer than 40 rounds through it and kept it meticulously clean and protected, with its condition reflecting this care.  See photos.  It has matching serial numbers on the receiver, bolt, buttplate, bayonet, and magazine floorplate (floorplate has been renumbered during the arsenal rebuild and the old number is lightly visible and lined through). The bore is clean and bright and has not been counterbored. Trigger has a crisp break. There is a discreet import mark on the underside of barrel for TG KNOX TN. This rifle comes with the following original arsenal-provided accessories: cleaning rod, bayonet, dog collar sling, and oil bottle.
