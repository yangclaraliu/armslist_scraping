The Mosin Nagant has been in active service in militaries around the world for almost 120 years. It's elegant simplicity, rugged dependability, and accuracy, make it one of the greatest bolt action battle rifles ever developed. Ballistically very close to the 30.06, so close in fact, 7.62x54r is commonly referred to as Russian 30.06. The 7.62x54r is a hard hitting, long range, and surprisingly affordable round. Surplus ammo for the Mosin Nagant is being imported from Russia, and the former soviet bloc, for as little as 20 cents/ round, or 440 rounds for $88"

You can shoot .410 buckshot (four .36 caliber balls per shot) or birdshot, as well as .45 colt! While this thing is heavy (could be used as a club too!), it takes up very little space. Best carried with tighter pockets or in a pocket holster. It has a great safety as well. This gun is slightly used (shot about 60 times) and has one barely noticeable scratch on the front of the barrel.  I uploaded a picture of the scratch. Comes with a few .410 buckshot and .45 colt.

I do not know where the original wooden stock is. Sorry.  And something you need to know about the gun, is that the last time I went to shoot it, it was not cycling the next round.  It would eject the spent casing, but would fail to return to battery like something wasn't lubed right, or something was hanging up.  A few years ago, I was shooting it, and it was functioning flawlessly, until the tiny extractor went flying out into the woods somewhere.  So after the gun sat in the closet for a few years, I finally ordered a new extractor and put it back together.  But went to shoot it, and it started doing this thing of not returning to battery after extracting the spent casing.  So it maybe just need lubed better, it might have something caught in the action, I don't know.  It still fires, and all the pieces are there, and it's in good condition other than that little hangup which I'm sure is an easy fix.  I just haven't taken the time to do it.

Lightweight with bobbed hammer. Red fiber optic front sight. Been used to kill snakes around camp and shows holster wear but functions flawlessly. . . Great for snakes, light and small to pack at camp or hiking, perfect car or home defense gun. Very comfortable and fun to shot with the padded grips on it there is very little recoil and easy to shoot. It's illegal in California because it's considered a sawed off shotgun. Shoot me an offer or a trade least I can say is no. I am wanted to sell and will consider all offers and be fair on price.

410 Ammo is:
Winchester PDX1 - 87 rds

.45 LC ammo: 5rds Winchester HP, 10rds Remington HP; 24 rds of Hornady Critical Duty

All the ammo I put in a metal ammo can to save space some still have boxes.  I'm guessing close to $300 worth is what I think is left if you went to the store to buy it. I will make you a great deal on all of it. Easily worth a little less then $900 all together but selling for way less.

I did however replace the factory 26 lbs factory main spring (HEAVY!!) with a Wolff 21 lbs main spring as well as install a short reset trigger. This put the DA pull smoother than current production P226's. I also must say that this SRT kit rivals that of tuned 1911's. As you can see, the rail condition is great for a KA stamped SIG. There is a little wear on the slide, but they appear to be just from odd ball scrapes here and there; not from holster wear. 

I'm looking for 300$ cash and you pay the transfer fee at West Coast Armory (60$ if memory serves). That's 360$ total. Don't bother low balling or offering less. I collect West German SIGS and know that you CANT get a half decent P6/225 anywhere at this price, even w/o SRT and reduced hammer spring. Needless to say this gun runs 100% and would not be selling it if not for eye procedure medical bills and rent money."
