Glock's Gen4 series of semiautomatic pistols incorporate all the features and benefits Glock is famous for, along with upgrades to enhance performance and shootability. This series still boasts nearly indestructible polymer frames that are stronger than steel. Tenifer-coating on slides and barrels makes them as impervious to the elements as their predecessors. And Safe-Action-Pistol integrated safety features are still standard. Upgrades includes Rough-Textured Frames (RTF) to make them even easier to handle in extreme conditions. RTF improves Glock's all-weather performance when shooting with or without gloves. Each Gen4 includes three differently sized backstraps, so shooters can adjust the grips for a custom fit. Magazine-release buttons are larger and reversible to make them easier to operate for both right- and left-handed shooters. Dual recoil spring assemblies increase durability and reduce recoil and muzzle flip"

Shawn Michaels was a pro wrestler until he retired. He then started his own hunting show on the Outdoor Channel called,""McMillan River Adventures"".
I bought this gun Jan. 10, 2015 at Cabela's in Louisville, KY. for $229.00 but never got to shoot it because winter set in.  The first thing I did was sell the scope that came with it because they are poor quality.  I put a Leapers UTG 4 X 32 scope w/milldot reticle, 35yd. parallax setting, and flip-open lens covers.  (They do come off)  Leapers scopes are specifically designed for high velocity springers, because the recoil on these guns are so punishing, it will destroy most scopes.  It's nitrogen filled, fog-proof, rainproof, and shockproof.  Adjustable eyepiece so as to focus to your own eyes.  Sapphire coated lenses.  Rated almost 5 stars, out of 39 customer reviews on Pyramid Air's website where I purchased it for $48.00.  It is mounted but was never sighted in.
You also get 750 Gamo ""Pro Magnum"" 7.8gr. Extreme Accuracy .177cal. pellets worth $15.00.
I'm only selling this because I found another air rifle that I want, and I can't return this one because I sold the scope that came with it.  Everything is BRAND NEW.  All paperwork included, and allen wrenches for scope.  Scope box also, I forgot to include it in the pictures.  There's over $300.00 worth of equipment here, depending on where you would purchase it.  I'm asking $210.00 FIRM. It's a very good deal.
You can contact me through Armslist, or call me at REDACTED BEFORE 10:00pm. and ask for Bill.

The device has two bright lamps that I have yet to figure out how to work though. The device is extremely bright. Let me know what you are willing  to trade; the light device is $1500 new.

Low ball offers will be ignored
M1 Gatling gun with two quality M1 carbines
Firing system format consists of
(1) Inland M1 Carbine receiver ser#4994XXX with bbl.
(1) Saginaw SG M1 Carbine receiver 4294XXX with bbl.
It has a hand-crank cam system which after the trigger is held, it pulls  the receiver triggers independently. Your rate of fire is determined by how fast you can turn the crank.  The fire control is just a trigger and a crank.
Once you start cranking...""Let the smiles begin!"" (;^)
This kit was available during the late 80's and very early 90's but you still had to supply your own M1 carbine rifles.
It has a rudimentary sighting system and each barrel has a flash hider and heat shield. 
It stands about 18"" tall, when set level, about 36"" long and 20""wide.
System comes with (9) 30 round magazines and maybe 20 rounds of .30 carbine ammo. 
A beat up system just sold for $1200 on GB and a nice one sold for $1800 at the Rock Island Gun Auction.  This one is nicer as it consists of two quality M1s. The recent sale at Rock Island had a Postal (a good one) and a Universal (which are generally unreliable).
I have priced this fairly with meat on the bone if you wish to resell.
I have had many offers come in for this firearm. A few have interested me but, none that have really piqued my interest.....yet.

Here, however, is one of their innovations and a fine one, the CW-9. Here is what our general managers former neighbors in Worcester, MA, say about their pistol: The Kahr CW9 has the combination of features that makes it the best concealed carry pistol in the market. It has the ideal combination of stopping power and shooting comfort, and is smaller, slimmer and lighter than competitive brands. The CW9's natural point of aim and low felt recoil make them the ideal guns to shoot and carry. With the introduction of new manufacturing processes in the production of the CW9, the Kahr pistol represents an unrivaled value. Other specs are as follows: semi-auto pistol, full time double action; 3 1/2 inch stainless barrel; stainless steel slide and internal parts mounted in a high impact black polymer frame; 7 + 1 round magazine capacity with a total of one stainless bodied magazine; white dot front and white bar rear black sights; weight only 15.8 ounces empty; maximum frame thickness .945 inches; overall maximum length 6 inches; maximum height 4 3/4 inches with magazine in battery; .400 satin stainless smooth combat trigger.

New production M855 green tip, brass case - price is $10 per box of 20.  Price on this will just keep going up.  Just got an email from Cope's distributing and they are selling 175 rounds for $90 plus shipping - that comes to 0.60 cents per round.  Minimum of 10 boxes

I just had a writer respond saying "" it's not banned, having a hearing"" -- My reply --You're right, just a hearing but you think a hearing is going to change anything- ATF says you can not have a pistol that shoots AP rounds and the M855 does have a steel core.  That is why AK74 ammo was stopped from coming in.  ATF can not ban a weapon do to the 2nd, but it can regulate ammunition - The M855 was given an exemption by ATF

Getting mail saying it is NOT AP - It is only not AP because how ATF is CURRENTLY classifying it.  It does have a steel penetrator.  READ the article - a couple of links on the article defining M855 ammunition - I also included the web address so you do not have to worry about clicking on a link

 - article states this -  - "" ATF has specifically stated that the SS109/M855 bullets are exempted from AP status.""  And that is because of the % of steel in the bullet . They can simple change the status.  Which is what the hearing is all about

My gun smith stripped it all and polished out most of the pitting the weather added.  Still very minor left on sides of receiver.

FN SCAR 17S 7.62Nato Battle Rifle, FDE, New in Box!


New in the Box from FNH USA, the SCAR 17 S in Dark Earth tan color!  The SCAR rifles in the brown finish all vary a little in hue, you are probably aware of this if you have been looking at these rifles. These always look better in person, I personally like that they don’t match exactly.  According to FN, the US military requested that the rifle be somewhat multi-colored to help break-up the profile of the rifle, which helps the weapon blend in with a soldier and his surroundings. 
Completely ambidextrous, the FN Scar has a fully free floating barrel. The receiver integrated MIL-STD 1913 optical rail plus three accessory rails enable mounting of a wide variety of tactical lights and lasers. The side folding polymer stock is fully adjustable for comb height and length of pull, and is colored authentic USSOCOM Flat Dark Earth.

I just never got adjusted to the side by side myself and prefer an over-under, which is reason I am selling this beauty.  Serious buyers only please, if you know about nicer shotguns you should be familiar with the reputation of these fine American made guns.

I'm asking $3,250.00 for it which is quite a good price, check out similar guns on Gunbroker or Armslist, they go for upward of $3,800.

-Bipod 
-Five position folding front grip
-A3 style carry handle with rear sight

Now let me tell you about Bear Creek Arsenal. 
They are a family owned company out of North Carolina and have been in the AR manufacturing field for a few years now, so they are new but believe me they have come a long way and in my opinion they are arguably one of the better options in the market today. Very high quality machining and products. 

I have invested almost $600 in this thing already and I enjoy it but I wouldn't mind funding the next project. 
Just built it last week and I have only taken it out once so far where I have sent maybe 200 rounds through it just to break it in, I'd like to get most of my money back so I'd like to see $600 for it.
I can throw in a tactical soft case, a 30 round aluminum magazine, and about 150 rounds of .223 for $650.

I am from the Canton area, I can travel to meet anyone about an hour and a half in each direction: Cambridge/Zainesville, Wooster, Akron/Snow Belt area, Youngstown, Alliance/Salem/Berlin, Carrolton, etc

It has a customized FDE stock with Wet-Grip Finish accents.  She's a beautiful gun for doves, pheasant, turkey or water fowl.  

I have only put maybe one box total shot through it for target practice.  The only reason I'm letting her go is that I now have an Ithaca 37 Pigeon Gun that is in perfect shape (and is just as sweet to shoot, even though it was built in the 40's).

I bought the Charles Daly recently and have cleaned it more often than I have fired it.  A bore inspection light will blind you!  It comes with a hard case for travel and an FDE leather trimmed case for show for which I paid a total of $114 extra for the two of them.  You'll get the 16 Shot Shell Pouch, action lock, chokes, original papers and booklets with it.  (I tossed the original box because you have to break the gun down to store it in it.)

**  I have had quite a few offers, some very good.  I met a guy for a an outstanding trade, almost too good to be true.....well it was!  He said he ""brought the wrong gun"" which was a POS 1911 that looked like it had been in the bottom of a toolbox for a couple years.  Other offers are asking for MORE than the original MSRP of the gun, and less for mine.  If you have a gun that the manufacturer has for an MSRP of $700, just because it is the ""only one like it on armslist"" doesn't make it worth $900 after you have fired 500 rounds through it.  I am pretty reasonable.  I will entertain lower cash offers than trade values, but I will not value the gun at higher than what it cost to buy a new one, even in a trade.

Buffalo Bore Ammo - 45 AUTO RIM STANDARD PRESSURE - 225 gr. Wadcutter @ 950 fps - 20 Round Box












This 225gr. full profile wad cutter, 45 auto rim, is the most deadly “standard pressure” load ever devised for the 45 auto rim cartridge. It utilizes the same bullet as our 45 colt ANTI-PERSONNEL ammunition (Item 3I) and because of popular request to have that bullet loaded into 45 auto rim ammo, here it is.

This bullet will penetrate around 28 inches in flesh and bone and makes a horrific permanent crush cavity because of its wad cutter profile. This load is the power/pressure level equivalent of  45 acp+P ammo and is safe to use in all modern 45 acp revolvers, including any/all (even pre war) 1917 model revolvers in normal operating condition.

Flash suppressed powders are used in this ammo so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire and this is a tactical advantage as roughly 95% of all civilian shootings in the U.S. happen in low light when the criminal element is at work.

The 225gr. wad cutter bullet is hard cast (not lead) and is properly lubed and will not substantially lead foul your barrel even after extensive shooting sessions, nor will the bullet fragment, smear or mushroom on impact with flesh and bone, thus insuring very straight and deep penetration with a consistent crush cavity throughout its path.

Note the velocities we obtained from stock factory revolvers:

983 fps -- S&W Mt. Gun, 4 inch barrel
909 fps -- S&W Mod. 325PD, 2.5 inch barrel


Field Proven pistol and handgun ammo. Maximum firepower ammo. Best ammunition for pistols and handguns for sale. Buffalo Bore. Strictly big bore. Strictly Business.

Attention!
You must be 18 or older to order ammunition. Ammunition must ship UPS ground. Due to Department of Transportation regulations, we cannot accept returns on Ammunition. Make sure to use the correct ammunition in your gun. Check local laws before ordering."

The NEW M7 Micro Dot, red dot sight delivers a bright and precise, fast target acquisition with all of the durability that LUCID has come to be known for.

With the available single slot rail riser, the M7 Micro Dot is elevated to the near perfect height for quality AR work and compatible with the lower 1/3 co-witness and use of our stand alone magnifiers, such as the 2x -5x Variable. The M7 Micro Dot will also allow use of the LUCID 2x ""screw in"" Magnifier adding to the operators confidence when the situation calls for a longer shot.

Please read all of this before contacting me.

I am selling/trading my G3 Glock 30s in 45 ACP. This was my main ""home defense"" handgun. It is upgraded with TRUGLO T.F.O. Green/Green night sights. Full polish to the trigger bar and connector, striker, safety plunger, and extractor rod. I replaced this with a Sig P320. It is a .357 Sig until my .45 kit arrives. Until last night, it has about 4 magazines throught it, or 40 rounds.  I was at the range last night, and fired 2 more magazines.  I forgot how much I like this gun, and how accurate it is for such a small weapon.  I also have a Blackhawk holser for this, but I haven't a clue where it vanished too. 

I also have a G3 Glock 27 (.40 S&W) that I am selling/trading. If you might want both for a trade, that is available too. 

** I have had quite a few offers, some very good - Mainly for the Glock 27. I met a guy for a an outstanding trade, almost too good to be true.....well it was! He said he ""brought the wrong gun"" which was a POS 1911 that looked like it had been in the bottom of a toolbox for a couple years. Other offers are asking for MORE than the original MSRP of the gun, and less for mine. If you have a gun that the manufacturer has for an MSRP of $700, just because it is the ""only one like it on armslist"" doesn't make it worth $900 after you have fired 500 rounds through it. I am pretty reasonable. I will entertain lower cash offers than trade values, but I will not value the gun at higher than what it cost to buy a new one (+ the sights), even in a trade.

 Make me offers, that is what I want."

1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS=The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN=The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR Conversion Kits for the GLOCK pistol.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY=Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH=All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION=Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.

Maybe you need a light, laser or vertical foregrip – there’s ample space for all of these. Co-witnessed night vision and low-magnification optics are commonly found on rifles in this class, and the extended rail option gives you plenty of room for this. The M1A™ SOCOM II has the same specially-engineered 16 inch barrel and proprietary muzzle brake as the M1A™ SOCOM 16, so you can expect the same excellent recoil reduction and low muzzle rise. The two-stage military trigger and fast acquisition sights – a ghost ring rear aperture and XS Tritium front sight – are more features that make the M1A™  SOCOM II a great choice for a tactical rifle.

Case has a wear spot where it rubbed on my deer cart wheel. Arrows have been shot and show signs of wear but are straight with good fletching. I will also throw in a 100.00 target. This is one of the fastest and hardest shooting bows on the market. I've shot this bow out to 100 yards. Does not shoot a crossbow bolt but a full 26.5"" arrow. The bow alone retails for 1499.00   I have over 1600.00 invested in this bow so 850.00 is pretty good deal.

Co-witnessed night vision and low-magnification optics are commonly found on rifles in this class, and the extended rail option gives you plenty of room for this. The M1A™ SOCOM II has the same specially-engineered 16 inch barrel and proprietary muzzle brake as the M1A™ SOCOM 16, so you can expect the same excellent recoil reduction and low muzzle rise. The two-stage military trigger and fast acquisition sights – a ghost ring rear aperture and XS Tritium front sight – are more features that make the M1A™ SOCOM II a great choice for a tactical rifle.
