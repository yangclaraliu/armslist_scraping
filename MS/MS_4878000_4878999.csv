Installation is simpler yet - just slide the barrel into the upper and twist until it locks. The takedown mechanism provides a repeatable point of impact. •MSR shooters that desire a larger cartridge will be excited to find that a replaceable barrel kit chambered in 300 AAC Blackout is available on ShopRuger.com. This range-ready barrel's headspace is set at the factory and comes complete with a metal flip-up elevation & windage adjustable front sight and two, 30-round metal magazines marked with ""300 AAC BLACKOUT"" to ensure easy differentiation. •Ruger® patented chrome-plated, two-stage piston with multi-stage regulator provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. The two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. •The Ruger® Elite 452™ AR trigger is a two-stage trigger that offers a smooth, crisp, 4.5 lb. trigger pull. The Ruger Elite 452™ features a full-strength hammer spring for consistent primer ignition and a lightweight hammer that enables a 30% faster lock time over standard MSR triggers. •With front and rear folding iron sights, the SR-556® Takedown is ready to go to the range right out the box. The front sight is both elevation & windage adjustable, meaning that when you swap barrels, the zero stays with the barrel. •The lower receiver is fitted with the Magpul® MOE grip and MOE SL collapsible buttstock on the mil-spec buffer tube. With a length of pull ranging between 11.1""-14.4"" the fit can be perfect for most any shooter. •Precision-rifled, chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel ensures accuracy and longevity. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided and the ½""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. •Supplied with three Magpul PMAG® 30-round magazines (a lightweight 556 NATO magazine). •Also includes a rugged, ballistic nylon case; three rail covers and lock.

On the lever someone engraved some numbers on it so I am not sure what that is about but does not affect shooting at all. The barrel has some bluing issues but aside from that this gun is in good shape if dare I say you were to re blue it it would be awesome ! Wood has a few marks but who wouldn't after being around 105 years ?

Brief history of the gun: It was once chambered in a Makarov round. But someone fired a 9mm through it and ruined the barrel. I bought it and ordered a new threaded barrel chambered for 380. The barrel was on back order for almost a year and I moved on to other projects. 

Anyways i do not have a magazine for it and I have never fired it. I have only cleaned it and replaced the barrel.

These are getting more and more expensive because they are no longer made, and one with a threaded barrel is even more rare. They seem to be running between 250 and 350 on gunbroker which you have to pay shipping and transfer fees if you buy one online. So I'd say 250 is a fair price to ask.

Used for competition shooting, this has been one of my favorite rifles to date. It's had about 120 rounds through it while it's been in my hands, and another 100 before me. The combo of the 6.5 Creedmoor and the Nightforce Glass is a force to be reckoned with.

Here's what it's got: 
- Ken Farrel Industries 30moa base 
- Nightforce Titanium Rings with Level and Angle Indicator 
- Nightforce 5.5-22x56 NXS Illuminated Scope with Zerostop 
- Pacific Tool & Gauge (PTG) Bottom Metal 
- AICS 10 Round Magazine 
- 5/8x24 Threaded Barrel 
- Witt Machine Compensator 
- PTG Twist Fluted Bolt Shank 
- PTG Bolt Face 
- PTG Tactical Bolt Lift Knob 
- Black Pelican M1760 Hard Case with Custom Foam 
- Tilt Harris Bipod with Lock Lever 
*Price includes 80 rounds of Hornady Match 140Gr A-Max. 

Price includes shipping of the rifle, transfer fee, and shipping for the ammunition. 

I'm selling this rifle to consolidate funds towards my Remington 700 Urban Tactical Rig. I will not entertain low ball offers, and I am fairly firm on the price. I'm not unreasonable, but a lot of time and money has gone into this setup. 

This thing is ready to fly.

Already running one of these on an SF-308, and decided to pick up a couple for two other builds that I'm having to cancel. So the kits are up for sale. This design of this piston system is just fantastic.....especially when shot suppressed. It has 5 different gas settings for instant fine tuning for changing applications and conditions.Best of all....these can fit under the vast majority of handguards!! (instead of having the block poking up in front of the handguard and disrupting the profile) It also is legitimately self-cleaning, and designed to shoot around 10,000 rounds before requiring to be cleaned. These kits are for a mid-length setup, but pistol, carbine and rifle length drive rods can be purchased separately from Adams Arms to fit whatever length is required. These kits run between $340-$372 + s/h + tax depending on where you buy them. Selling for $300. REDACTEDHere is the description from AA's website: This system will work with .223/5.56 x 45 mm NATO. Kit includes: Patented One-Piece Bolt Carrier XLP Multi-Adjustable Low Profile Gas Block Gas Plug Upper Receiver Bushing Bushing Installation Rod Bolt Spring Drive Rod with Bushing and Spring Installation DVD The Adams Arms Piston System: A short stroke free floating piston system. Is Self-Cleaning. Carbon and gases are expelled forward, away from operator. Corrosive resistant coating processes. Harmonics are not transferred into the barrel. Adjustable gas settings for various applications. Doesn't vent directly to atmospheric pressure; this eliminates flash signature and super sonic crack which is optimal for night vision and suppresses fire. This system requires a mid gas length (9.866"" from barrel extension to shoulder) and a .750"" gas seat."

Wood looks to have been refinished at some time in it’s life; there are several “honest” bruises, but all original wood with no major flaws.
Note: Marlin stamped 25-20 M, today we call it .25-20 Winchester; the late 1890s feud between Marlin and Winchester is legendary.
For a 100+ year old gun, this one is in surprisingly good shape. It was deadly on Milk River, Montana beavers in 2000. Why buy an Italian copy when you can have an ORIGINAL Old West cowboy gun?

I put night sights on it, but once we weren't keeping it, I put those on another gun. When installing the stock sights, they got dinged from the nylon punch. No finish damage on the slide, just dings on the rear sight. I can send detailed pictures of this, arm list just lets me submit one for the listing.

Gun has all the fixin's from the factory, hasn't been shot outside of the factory, still has factory 
grease in the slide rail channels. I paid 540 for this gun, and in spite of the rear sight being dinged, I'm asking $450 firm.

The Warlock™ II has an exceptional weight-to-strength ratio, and is one of the lightest .22LR suppressors on the market. Due to the notoriously harsh nature of rimfire ammunition, this product features CTA™ (Click Together Assembly) baffles to ensure the suppressor remains easy to clean – even after long days at the range. Thanks to its high-strength baffle design and lightweight aluminum construction, the Warlock 22 weighs only 3.0oz and reduces sound to 114.6 dB, proving that big results can come from small packages.

First the Gun : 2006 build out of the custom shop at Wilson Tactical. Wilson upper, and lower, 20 inch fluted bull barrel, smooth free floating handguard, tactical trigger.  This gun is in pristine shape. At the time of production, 2250 retail value.  This gun is perfect, in every way. Not your weekend range warrior piece, this is for the serious marksman who wants to stretch their 5.56 legs to the limit, with accuracy. Easily a 500+yd platform. 3 mags and case included. Wilson offers a LIFETIME WARRANTY for all moving parts, and components. Keep that in mind. If you want, the BSA reddot can be included, I'm not attached to it, and it is not an optic worthy of sitting atop this rig. 

Trades I would consider....
Remington 700 (upgraded), Alternative build AR 5.56 rifles (preferably 18 inch and up) , AR pistols in 5.56 or blackout (complete or parts) , compact 9mm and/or .45 caliber handguns in premium brand. NO shotguns, or 22's. Since value is high, most likely will take 3,4,or 5 guns to get there. 

I don't need to sell, and I do know values (trade and retail) so please, use discretion when offers are made. Worst I can say is no.  Clean out your safes folks, find the safe queen, one of a kinds and unique pieces will be given priority, volume will make a difference. No, two 400 dollar guns don't equal 1000. Trade value May vary between 2000 and 2200. Check GunBroker of you have any value questions. 

Pm any questions or Trade offers, it's nobody's business but yours and mine what's on the table. If you don't like the price, or the terms, please keep scrolling. 

Bill of sale or transfer will be completed. Valid FL DL required, CWP preferred. If you come across as a squirrel nugget, I will run a BG check through the State. 

Thank for your interest and your time.

Trades will need to be in like condition as the pistol being sold."

This pistol takes both 10-round flush-fit magazines as well as extended (full size) 13-round mags. It is in excellent condition. This pistol was evaluated by a local, high-profile firearm dealer as being in ""98%"" condition.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this pistol; I am only selling because I haven't put a single round through it since 2012. As such I personally have no further use for it and would rather sell it to roll the money into a different firearm purchase. 

Pistol comes with one ten-round mag and one 13 round mag (with grip extension), XD-gear holster, mag loader and magazine carrier.

I also have a pair of ban-compliant low cap (10-round, full size) mags (good for beater mags) available for $20 total for both. If nothing else the extra $20 gets you two more mag sleeves (grip extensions) which usually go for $5-ish each, so that puts spare range mags at about $5 each for you.

In vulnerable places this pistol can save your life, here is more than one place this pistol will save your life as well as other places especially at night when you are alone.

Like all North American Arms Mini-Revolvers they are covered by a lifetime warranty against defects in material, workmanship and repairs as long as you pay for the parts used or labor. 

I have had this pistol for for over 10 years and have only used it in my back yard shooting skunks and troublesome squirrels. It is still in excellent condition.

Safety feature: 
As with every North American Arms Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. 
Using the original half-way notch cylinder in between chambers, (See picture #two for the notches, you will also notice the firing pin which rests in the notch) the hammers firing pin may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge.

It also has a second safety feature with the hammer puled back to the first click, (see picture #one) this keeps the hammer away from the cartridge."

Better than Saiga.  Next to be banned?
From an online review:
	""The Molot Vepr 12 isn’t like previous AK platform blasters. It hasn’t been neutered. It isn’t bastardized. In my considered opinion, the Vepr is better than the best Saiga 12 or other AK platform shotguns.""
	""The Vepr 12 is very similar the standard Kalashnikov shotgun. It uses similar parts but works off of a stronger foundation. Built around an RPK receiver, these guns are more or less an AK on steroids. Beyond the thicker steel, these guns also sport other RPK inspirations–notable the handguard and rear sight; the rest is just classic AK design.""

Some background history:  The owner and founder of internationally recognized Scout Boats in Summerville, SC, Mr. Steve Potts, had his beginnings at The Outboard Shop helping to build these awesome skiffs, and was quite fond of the boat and the name. So much so, that later in the 80's when he founded the boat manufacturing company, he named it Scout Boats. 

 Always garage stored, she is now a refurbished 13' Fiberglass Duck/Fishing Skiff that is powered by a Mercury (Model 25E) 25hp Motor, and trailered on a Gator Galvanized Trailer. The Scout has superb fiberglass integrity, and has recently undergone a professional refinish in a palmetto camo pattern.  She has stick steering and throttle controls from the front seat position, which allows the boat to traverse over debris easier.  The vessel can also draft in 4-6 inches of water.  To the right and under the front seat is a large storage compartment, and on the left, a live-well with a system that allows fresh oxygenated water to constantly circulate in the well.  She has a newly installed electric starter and depth finder, two 6 gallon tanks, automatic/selective bilge pump, and a fully charged battery with cover. There are also numerous pieces of equipment included to insure compliance with federal and state laws.  Some of the items are: 3 life jackets, flares, air horn, fire extinguisher, etc.  There are also extra parts and accessories such as spark plugs, fuel/oil mixing bottle, anchor, light pole, lights, motor muffs, wheel chalks, etc.  

The 25hp Mercury Motor is also in superb condition, and has also been refinished in the same camo pattern.  It cranks on command, maintains great compression, has a strong impeller with 20hrs on it, and a new stainless steel prop. She'll run around 30mph fully loaded. 

The galvanized Gator trailer is in excellent condition, and has the following NEW parts:  2 tires, lights all the way around, straight tongue coupler, trailer wire connector, and safety chains with grab hooks.  It comes equipped with a loading crank/winch & tongue jack.  To top this package off, a custom folding grass duck blind is being included in the sale, as well as several sheets of camo burlap. 

Bottom line, you are getting an exceptional, and in immaculate condition, turn-key package that is a special part of Charleston & Boating History. She will be a smart investment, and offer many years of hunting/fishing/recreational pleasure. 

$2500 ALL IN CASH PRICE.  TRADE VALUE IS $3000.  OPEN TO NICE GOLF CART, ATV, OR GUNS PLUS CASH.

Here is your chance !! According to Wikipedia; In 2004, the SS192 hollow-point cartridge was introduced. After being met with controversy, the SS192 variety was discontinued in the same year. The SS192 was classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and in testing by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level IIIA vest when fired from the Five-seven pistol. The article does not mention anything about the penetrating effectiveness when fired from the FNH PS90. According to Wikipedia; In early 2005, the pistol was the subject of intense controversy in the United States after the Brady Campaign stated that commercially available SS192 ammunition penetrated a Level IIA Kevlar vest in testing. In additional tests conducted by FN Herstal USA, FN_Herstal USA would only say that SS192 ammunition was unable to penetrate Level IIIA vests, as opposed to the Level IIA vest that was reportedly penetrated in tests by the Brady Campaign. FN_Herstal USA discontinued import of the SS192 at this time. Does the SS192 ammo have armor piercing capabilities in the 5.7 pistol ? Does the SS192 ammo have piercing capabilities in the PS90 ? SS192 specifications: - 28 grain copper jacket hollow points. - muzzle velocity = 2350 (ft/s). - SS197 muzzle velocity = 1,950 (ft/s). - muzzle energy = 467 J (344 ft-lb). - SS197 muzzle energy = 461 J (340 ft-lb). - effective range = 660 ft. This ammo is very rare and there are very limited quantities available anywhere. I don't remember the last time I saw any available on this website.  I am selling each box of 50 for $55.00.  I have very limited quantities available.  Local face to face is prefered (20 minute drive time maximum on my part) - but I will ship after payment is received and cleared."
