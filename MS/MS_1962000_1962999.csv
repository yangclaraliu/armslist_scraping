This rifle is unbelievably accurate and will outshoot most any production rifles , Yes even most of those ""tacticool"" .308 rifles the gamer kids love so much. The 30-06 is a breeze to find ammo for but no worries, i have ALOT  of ammo and if you reload i also have a die set that comes with it. It is also fitted with a very nice scope. So if you are looking for a nice rifle for hunting, shooting or customization before you go looking for a ""tacticool"" 308 hell, be a man and step up to a 30-06 lol Value on the rifle with scope is 850, rifle alone is 600. ammo comes with it and die set would too for the right trade."

There is no longer a scope on it but it is drilled and tapped for one. It has a premium leather Field and Stream sling on it and a slip on Limbsaver recoil pad and stretchy ammo sleeve. This beauty was made in 1999 and is NOT a Remlin (made after Remington took over Marlin and quality control went wonky.) It is a fine example of craftsmanship.

I can throw in a little over three boxes of Remington 405 grain rounds for the right trade. Prefer large caliber revolvers (Ruger, Smith, etc.) or .45 ACP big name semiautos. No .40S&W and if it isn't made in America, I don't want it.  I am in no rush to sell it, and would be just as happy putting it back in the gun safe."

This carrier is a desert tan color condor MOPC vest, with side plates, adjustable M to XL with hard to get and hard to find Military mil-spec 10mm thick armor plates rated for .50cal armor piercing.

The last picture is showing the plate and side plates with my vest.

Special forces or private security uses these plates. Not available for export.

MOLLE webbing on the front and back of the vest for attaching pistol mag. pouches or rifle mag. pouches.
I worn one under my hoodie jack, it is completely concealable, but when I attached AK 47 - AR 15 mag. pouches to the carrier it was no longer concealable. These plates are curved Mil-A-46100 10in x 12in steel .393"" thick hi-impact brand.
I had ar500 plates but these are better in my opinion.
I shot at one of my old ar500 3/8"" NIJ level-4 plates and a .393 mil-spec side panel sample I got online, I used my .460 WM rifle and shot 3 times each plate from 50 feet (pricy test). Totally different stuff. ar500 flattened and dimpled up penetrated all 3 places but the mil-spec plate kept its curve and did not dimple, also zero penetration.When I shot my .300 win mag at the mil-spec sample 5 rounds same yardage still no penetration. This set is normally $450 so no low-balling please. Price is firm. Trades welcome.

The Holstarr Rack is not limited to just holding a pistol but can be used to hold many different types of accessories and multiple accessories such as a flashlight, pepper spray, knife, TV remote, cell phone, drink holder, handcuffs, clip, pistol holster and/or anything that might fit on your belt. Most bed holsters comes with an universal and generic type holster that may or may not fit your pistol, whereas the The Holstarr Rack allows you to use your own personal holster specifically designed for your pistol insuring a secure fit. Being that The Holstarr Rack is a one piece design there are not any movable or attached parts that could wear out or fall off. Ambidextrous in design, The Holstarr Rack can be placed on the left or right side of the bed and the head or foot board of the bed and upside down or right side up to allow for many applications. Specification: 10.5"" long x 12"" wide x 1.75"" high, 14 Gage steel, powder-coated black texture. It sales for $24.99, please contact your local Arms dealer. For Any questions CALL (209)-872-0026"

Kit was one of the ones Apex was selling a while back, receiver is a properly machined CNC Warrior. I did the building, I build AKs for fun and have professional grade tools including the right headspace gauges. 

Round count is below 500 on this barrel and receiver. The kit was well loved when I got it, but vey serviceable. 

13"" IMI chrome lined SAR length barrel with pinned 3"" extender. This could be removed and the original threads used if you wanted to go through the Form 1 process. This was a virgin barrel when I got it, which is very important for the way Galils are put together. 

Trigger guard rivets and bullet guide rivets are from AK-Builder. Head spacing was short (this is a good thing) and was adjusted to the proper length with stainless steel shim stock. Torque was set with a torque wrench and 22mm crow's foot. Headspacing was confirmed with 5.56 go and nogo gauges. Lugs are square and true, unlike with many Golanis. No headspacing, lug, or heat treating issues with this gun.

2 hand guards are included; the original wood one that came with the kit, and a plastic one from a Golani. 

10 mags included, not for sale separately unless the gun sells first. They are in varying condition from mint, never inserted, to well loved by peasants in 3rd-world countries. All of them function. Many have the Israeli cartouche or IMI stamp. One is painted to match the gun. I can paint more to match if you want. 

Paint is Krylon and gets complemented everywhere I go. Can be removed if you don't like it. Its very functional for this area.

Has day sites front and rear. Has night sight for rear and spring for front, but no tritium. This is available on the market if you want it.

Hit me up with an email for questions or detailed pics. 

FTF only for now. Email if you are interested in shipping, I'll consider it if I don't sell in a few weeks.

I will include original dealer invoice and receipt, and the FFL's receipt when transferred to me; originally paid 726.15 for gun plus 25.00 FFL transfer, so I believe my asking price is reasonable. Will meet face to face in public area (preferably around a bank) around the Conway or Little Rock area. If this does not sell this week, will post on Gunbroker. Please contact me for questions or additional details."

My loss is your gain, he also has a new 30 round magazine for it which will be included but it is not in any of the pictures if legal for you to own. I say like LNIB because I upgraded it by professionally finishing and staining the stock with a deep dark red stain as well as adding a Tapco SAW handgrip. For those who don't know these came with factory stripped and unfinished wood stocks. It's one of the best looking AK's I have ever seen. Some history on these and whats makes them stand out when compared to other AK's on the market. They are known as the tanks of AK'S. The M70 AB2 AKM rifle is a Yugoslavian varient of the Russian AK47 rifle. It has several features that distinguish it from other AK varients: It has a heavier barrel than most AK's, it has a 1.6mm thick receiver similar to the receiver used on the RPK type weapons, flip up night sights front and rear, a flip up grenade sight that acts as a gas cut-off for Rifle Grenade launching, and different shaped longer and heavy duty handguards up front. Zastava Arms in Yugoslavia makes two different versions of the M70, the AB2 underfolder stock version and the M70B1, the fixed stock version. They both fire the 7.62x39mm round from a (30) round box detachable magazine. The M70 is equipped with a gas cut-off feature that allows the use of 22mm rifle grenades with special grenade launching cartridges. Must ship to an FFL and will be shipping directly from my FFL dealer. Shipping is paid by the buyer."

See: https://shootersmagazine.com/cz-p-07-duty-the-best-pistol-nobody-knows-about/

Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty.  The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves -- the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change.

The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria.

Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability Summary: SAM7R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

Bought new from Bass Pro Shops in 2011 and paid ENTIRELY too much. Used often, but in excellent condition. Rifle stock and fore-end is gray synthetic material, breech and barrel stainless steel. Bushnell Banner series 4x32 standard scope (with dust covers) mounted, but hasn't been bore-sighted. Takes too much time and I don't have the fancy equipment. I'm an iron-sights kinda guy anyways. Three (3) ten (10) round factory magazines and approximately 150 (maybe more? don't have an exact count) rounds of Remington .22 bulk ammo. Plano Protector hard case included.
I know you're wondering -so I'll go ahead and answer your question before I get a thousand e-mails asking about it- The reason I'm selling is because I really no longer have use for this rifle, it sits in a gun rack on the wall collecting dust and I'd rather it be outdoors with someone who appreciates it more. I'll be honest, this is a GREAT little rifle to plink with or give to the younger ones to introduce and encourage firearm handling skills. Not to mention all the upgrade kits they make for this particular gun. Hell, with the right one you can take this from plastic BB gun to some kind of super tactical Seal Team 6-worthy weapon!
Asking $200 firm considering extra items included, however reasonable offers will be taken. Worst I can say is no, but low-ball offers will receive a few ""choice"" words.
Because this is a small-caliber long gun, I do not require any type of gun permit/license, but buyer must be 18+ and sign a bill of sale. This protects YOU and ME from the NSA spies and Obama's other gun-grabbers.
I live just outside Memphis and can meet any day after 5:30 PM. Mondays are best. I prefer to meet at a gun dealer or sporting goods store. E-mail thru posting for offers or text REDACTED.

Only one set left so if you are thinking about it, you need to act. I have these advertised on several sites and they go pretty quickly.

Buy Line:  If you are like me, my NAA's (all 3 various) came with a nice folding holster grips. I absolutely love them. However, the small screws that fasten the grip to the pistol are steel and have begun to show a little rust from being in my pocket. 

Solution:  I bought, and carry now, stainless screw sets (two screws each set) for the NAA Mini's belt clip folding holster grips. 

Fit:   The screws fit all three of my pistols with the folding holster grip; .22lr, .22mag, and my new Sidewinder. 

Shipping:  Send a self-addressed stamped envelope and $2.50 and I will send you a set. No additional charges. (The add states $3, it would not let me put $2.50).

Payment:  Better to just send the money in a security envelope like you pay your bills, however, If you must, I will take a postal money order (but you still need the self-addressed stamped envelope). I will take PayPal if you must.

Just Info for the do-it-yourselfer's:  If you want to try to find a set locally, they are stainless 8-32 3/16 cap screws with a 9/64 hex. If you cannot find any, send me some money! 

 NOTICE: Firearm and holster grip, are not included. It is in the picture to show what the pistols look like with a stainless cap screw.

My father is dieing and needed money to deal with some things. I decided to buy a boat he put up for sale and have been making payments all summer. Now that I have payed it off I really would rather put the money into my dodge challenger then have a boat.

Heres what I know- ask questions and I can get and give answears... Its a 18-20 foot reinell with a sweet running chevy 6cyl inboard outboard that gets great milage/hours on the water and is plenty fast. Never gone full throttle but it scoots very fast at 3/4 throttle. It has a brand new prop just two years old, and a new motor to control the pitch of the prop also 2 years old. It comes on a trailor and has another new prop and motor as well as plenty of other odds and ends for future upkeep. As of now its needs nothing except maybe new tires on the trailor here soon- the boat is tip top. Life jackets, flare gun, and all the other necessities are on board to keep it legal on the water. Ill have pictures up Thursday and ill get all the info from my father so Ill have better specs up.

Im asking $2,000 obo. Will consider trade, or partial cash/firearm trades. Interests are mostly in hand guns but let me know what you have I like all firearms. Lever actions, revolvers, pistols, hunting rifles, ar15, ak47, ptr 91, not big on shotguns but hey make me an offer worse I can say is no. Thanks for looking. Take care and check back on this add after Thursday for pictures and updated specs. Act fast Im looking to make a deal so don't let your chance to own a sweet boat at good price slip away. I just want something I can  get more use out of, I never even got my boaters safety card, that's how interested I am in taking the boat out. I can also deliver within reason if that helps make a deal."

10 feet of 550 cord. I ""gutted"" it for your convenience. The 7 strand inner core has already been removed for you. (7 cents per foot, .07 x 10 feet = $.70 cents)

Your total cost is $17.70 ...maybe you don't need a 12 gauge bore brush or the 550 cord.
No problem, just subtract what you don't want and buy only what you need.

All the bore brushes and the 550 cord are all brand new and are made here in the USA with ALL AMERICAN Parts....see youtube video listed below.

The length of your 550 cord may differ depending on how long/short your barrels are for your handguns/rifles/shotguns.

Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX™-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers."
