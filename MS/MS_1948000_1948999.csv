If you shoot a lightweight pellet so its velocity exceeds the speed of sound, it could result in your pellet breaking the sound barrier and the gun being louder than expected! The speed of sound depends on humidity, temperature and altitude. Generally speaking, it's between 1,060 fps and 1,115 fps.

Here are the benefits of the Nitro Piston:
•Smoother cocking
•Smoother shooting
•No spring torque
•No spring fatigue, even if you leave it cocked for hours
•Functions perfectly in cold weather
•Lasts longer than a metal spring"

So here is what I know about the gun, he bought it knew and is the original owner the serial is a K0 prefix which what I have read leads me to believe its a 1980, I am 30 and have rarely seen it taken out of the safe and have never seen it shot, that being said he told me he knows he shot it at one point but says he shot two full cylinders or less out of it and I believe that seeing as how he never has time to shoot and the condition of the firearm. When he first bought the gun he did carry it a short time  in a leather Bianchi shoulder rig and kept it stored in that hanging on his bed post for a little bit so it does have some light scratches on the barrel(it was very hard for me to get them to show up in the pictures)from removing it from the holster,you can see the type of scratches in the last photo. I am going to say we do not have the original box however there is a chance that it might be in a closet somewhere(looking for it now). I personally dont mess with safe queens so I honestly dont know how to rate the condition, the gun finish is extremely bright with the only flaw being the light scratches and a very low round count. Ive looked around various sites to try and get a solid price on what they are selling for and they are all over the board so Im going to list this one in the middle. Will entertain all reasonable offers,prefer FTF ,CASH ONLY, NO TRADES, thank you for looking. I do have several more pictures I can send via email for serious buyers.

The rifle itself is in great condition and shoots beautifully. It's been well kept and cleaned. 

 M48 Mauser Description:
 ""Some people may be getting the mistaken impression that these rifles were manufactured by Germans during the occupation. That is not the case. These rifles were manufactured with German technology in Serbia after the people had driven the Germans out of Yugoslavia. This is an important distinction, because that is one of the reasons why the Model 48 is recognized as an excellent example of the K98 type military rifle. The factory in Serbia was not bombed, like the German factories during the war. The factory in Serbia had a good supply of raw materials. And the Model 48 was produced by free people, instead of forced labor. All of which resulted in an excellent rifle in its own right, as well as an interesting piece of history."" -Mitchell's Mausers

Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System™. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System®, using Leupold’s® index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won’t be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When we combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.

Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2™, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we’ve ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast"

Due to a high number of people who are unfamiliar with Colt rifles, this is not a 6920 that is available at Walmart for $1099. This is a Colt LE6940 I have listed for sale. Similar, but significantly different rifle because it has a one piece upper that extends out over the barrel with a continuous rail for optics and accessory mounting and free floats the barrel. The Walmart 6920 is just a standard M4 carbine with a standard upper, a barrel nut and delta ring assembly and a set of plastic handguards.   

From Impact's website:
""Model LE6940 Advanced Monolithic Carbine M4 5.56mm 16.1 Inch Barrel Full Length Rail System Flip Up Rear Sight Collapsible Stock 20 Round Mag

Features include one-piece monolithic upper receiver with full length rail, Mil-Spec rails, removable lower rail. Free floated barrel is hard-chrome lined, 6 grooves with 1:7 inch right hand twist. Direct gas system; locking bolt. Flip-up adjustable front and rear sights. Bayonet lug and A2 flash suppressor. Collapsible stock. 20-round magazine capacity.

Semi-auto. Monolithic upper quad rail. Pop-up front & rear sights. 6-position collapsible stock. Wt.: Approximately 8 lbs. Includes: ONE 20-rnd. magazines, cleaning kit & sling.

 The Colt LE6940 Monolithic Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine. The most demanding situations call for the power, performance and innovation found in the LE6940 series. The top rail is continuous from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. Free floating barrel.""

Original owner shot 100 rounds through it. Comes with a Knights vert grip and everything from the factory except the 2x20 round magazines (original owner said he traded them). I'll include 2 NIW USGI 30 round mags. 

Asking $1350, no 10% sales tax, no waiting 3 months for a backorder .  
Add $35 shipping if you're not local, open to partial trades-see my list.

When I received it it already had the trigger group and guard moved forward, a rubberized grip attached, the rear tang cut and the ACE stock attached. Additionally the handguard had vents cut in it and a rail bolted underneath it. Internally the bolt group had been re-profiled and polished and the piston had been replaced with a Tom Cole Heavy Duty gas piston. The manual bolt hold open is indeed still there. Makes reloading MUCH MUCH easier! The reason for these upgrades was reliability, S12 stock pistons were soft and the bolt group was so rough it made the actions sluggish and you can feel just feel an off the rack one when charging. This one is much much smoother!

Now I don't know if the gas ports were enlarged for better functioning or if it is just Russian QC, but it runs very well, in fact too well. The shotgun was horribly overgassed when I first got it... horribly. And this produced a great deal of recoil. So I changed 4 things on the gun, 1) DPH 6 Position Gas Plug 2) MOLOT Style Muzzle Brake 3) 1'' Recoil Pad 4) GG&G Vertical Foregrip. Now this shotgun is the softest shooting shotgun out there, having put a good amount of rounds through the new Remington Versamax (heavily inspired by the Benelli M4), I can say this is slightly softer shooting.

The DPH gas plug gives you 4 more gas setting options than the factory one. On this shotgun it will run even the cheapest target loads, I have never needed to open the gas plug all the way for any ammo. And the brake DOES work! I tried it with the brake off, there was more recoil and it much more sharp. The foregrip and pad were surprisingly incredible effective. Before I changed the gas plug it was the pad that stopped the shoulder bruises.

In total you get the shotgun as seen in the picture plus:
- Original Box and Manual
- 4 x 10rd Magazines from AGP & SGM
- 1 x 5rd Izhmash Magazine
- 1/2'' Recoil Pad (1'' Is Installed)
- GG&G Vertical Foregrip OEM Bag & Instructions
- OEM Izhmash Gas Plug

If your local and going to meet me for a PPT I can throw in:
- 28rds of Federal #8 Target Loads
- 5rds of Winchester 00 Buckshot
- 5rds of Wolf Slugs"

Beautiful walnut stock. 4x15 scope.  Unlike the clip fed .22 rifles, the tubular magazine holds more ammunition and never jams. I owned clip fed .22's before and I know for a fact most of them jam. Hard to find a tubular magazine these days, but they're the best, no doubt in my mind. I hunted since I was old enough to walk and I'm 64 and have owned a lot of rifles in my time. I wouldn't be selling it if not for the fact that I quit hunting and I'm moving out of state soon and have to thin down my firearms collection. I have more pictures of it if you want to see more than the measly 2 pics that are allowed with my camera. So just ask and I'll email a few more. FOID required. No out of state sales. No trades."

The barrel on this firearm has been heat-treated (similar to Glock's tennifering process) with a black nitrating process to take the Rockwell hardness to over 80! In English - this barrel will NEVER wear out, rust, pit, or wear - we GUARANTEE IT.

Due to the hardening process, cleanup is virtually non-existent. This is the same process that Snap-On tools uses to harden their tools and make clean up after greasy automotive work a breeze. 

We're currently testing the process to verify, but have been told that a major airline is using this exact same process because lead won't stick to it (think about that the next time you shoot)!

This DPMS AR-15 Upper Receiver Assembly comes fully assembled and ready to install on any standard small pin, mil-spec lower receiver. Constructed of Extruded 7029 T6 Aircraft Grade Aluminum and is of the ""Slickside"" variety, with a sleek profile devoid of protrusions through the elimination of the conventional AR-15 forward assist, case deflector, and dust cover. The result is a clean, minimalist appearance that is both fully functional as well as lightweight. The Sportical provides an ideal foundation for later user customization, including all of the required attributes and components for solid, reliable performance, but without adding anything extraneous that would increase both the weight and price of the upper. 

Features a 16"" Light Contour ""Pencil"" Barrel for reduced weight, a true 5.56x45mm NATO chamber for use with either commercial or mil-spec ammunition, and employs the versatile 1 in 9"" rifling twist rate capable of stabilizing a wide selection of different bullet weights. The upper comes equipped with heat resistant 2 piece aluminum, single rail gas block, charging handle, complete bolt & carrier assembly, and an A2 flash hider. Aluminum parts are hard coat anodized to mil-spec, steel parts are manganese phosphate treated (parkerized) matte black.
