 M&P 15 Sport 

This rifle was built for the price conscious user who is looking for a good quality and inexpensive AR15 style rifle for range practice and/or home defense. They were able to do so by changing some features that should NOT upset the majority of target shooting users out there. The barrel used is made in house – 16″ without m203 cuts, melanite coated inside and out, 1:8 twist rate, and 5R rifled. The 5R rifled barrel designs have been in use by Thompson Center, a S&W owned company, for a long time in order to produce an inexpensive and very accurate product. Those looking for a milspec rifle, this isn’t the one for you, but melanite has proven itself a durable, corrosion resistant, uniform coating that can be considered more accurate than chrome lining. Other differences on the Sport models include: an upper receiver lacking a dusk cover and forward assist, a lower receiver with integral enhanced trigger guard, LMT style removable rear sight and A2 style front sight, chromed gas key and bolt carrier and other standard A2 styled parts. For those budget conscious shooters out there looking for a rifle that offers good quality with a low sticker price, the M&P15 Sport rifle may be just what you’re looking for.

The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments."

It has a Bell and Carson stock, I could go on and on. Bottom line it is a very special rifle. It retails for $1500. It was won at a gun bash and never fired by the winner or me, so you can shoot it in as you please. It is shown with a scope but the scope and rings are not included in the price. This rifle is the real thing, and it's a beauty. I would take $1085.00 cash or a partial trade for a .444 lever Winchester Black shadow or a .444 Marlin + cash. I also would take a partial trade for a .308 deer rifle (no junk). I would also trade for a 1895 Winchester high wall falling block rifle in 45-70, or a Ruger No 1 in a deer caliber.

I have a Walther P22 in excellent condition for sale or trade. It is the nickel slide model. The gun comes with 4 mags (one is not pictured) the orig case plus a concealment case that looks like a book or bible.
If you look this model up you will find it is a bit pricey compared to the all black version.

Gun has not been used much, purchased new around 1999 or so, can't quite remember.  Always shot pretty good and accurate for it's size.  I have not fired it for several years but last time I did cycled fine.  Single action, pretty decent trigger for a pocket pistol.  As stated in the title, full price includes 100 rounds of CCI Mini-Mags (unopened), given the current ammo shortage, these are hard to come by.  If you own a small frame 22lr that doesn't cycle very well, try CCI Mini-Mags, with the copper plated round nose they feed pretty good.  Mags hold 7 or 8 rounds, can't remember.

HPBT Match 
MatchKings are the pride of the Sierra bullet family, unmatched worldwide and truly world class in all respects. Competitive shooters have relied on the consistent accuracy of Sierra's MatchKings for decades, resulting in a history of state, national and world records that is the envy of our competitors. Sierra offers the widest selection of 30 caliber match bullets in the world today, producing bullets suited to nearly every form of long-range competition.

In 1995, Sierra worked with military ordnance experts to produce a superior long-range bullet for the M21, M24 and M40A1 sniper systems. The result was the new 175 grain #2275 MatchKing bullet. This bullet has also generated considerable interest among competitive Service Rifle match shooters. A higher ballistic coefficient compared to the 168 grain bullet allows it to remain supersonic at 1000 yards when fired from 308/7.62mm caliber Service Rifles.

Sierra MatchKing bullets have set the standards worldwide for consistent accuracy in handguns as well as rifles. Since the introduction of the high performance Remington XP-100 and similar handguns chambering larger rifle cartridges, all 30 caliber MatchKings have been used in handgun silhouettes and long-range target competitions. Sierra's famous MatchKing design assures superb accuracy, flat trajectory, and high momentum delivery with low sensitivity to crosswinds at all ranges. 

Although they are recognized around the world for record-setting accuracy, MatchKing bullets are not recommended for hunting.

Introducing the most consistent and reliable barrier ammo on the market.

I think I have some other small parts too and may have left something off, so whatever I have will go w/this package. If you go through and total everything up it'll total north of 2k and it's been upgraded to be a great dependable gun. These are on back order through ST and have been for a long time. I wanted forever, but just could really use the money right now. I have shot maybe 400 rounds out of it total in 2 separate sittings (the second time was just sighting in a scope, maybe 40 rounds then) and it's a good straight shooter. Again, it'll come w/both BCG’s and both triggers and both stocks. Don’t have a camera, other than a crappy one on a my flip cell that I can txt you. $1250 OBO PRICE DROP

Brand new in box; unfired, DPMS Panther Arms LR-308 Oracle. AR-10 variants have long held an important place on the battlefield as special-purpose rifles for designated marksmen. Now DPMS Panther Arms has been one of the manufacturers leading a new resurgence in the tactical use of the 7.62X51 NATO round with its Long Range 308 line. The .308 Oracle is one of DPMS’ most popular rifles due to its compact size, rugged military carbine features and .308 firepower. Side-by-side the LR-308 and the M4 look almost identical, but inside the LR-308 is a powerhouse. This AR-10 is fully equipped to take advantage of the power and precision for engaging long-range targets as well as the versatility of the 16” barrel to excel in the CQB role as well. Includes an uninterrupted quad-rail, recoil absorbing grips, adjustable bipod, and 3X magnifier for the sniping role; and a red dot sight, twist-off magnifier mount, battle-ready buttstock, and a folding foregrip, for the control and flexibility needed for sweep & clear mode. Compare the quality and accuracy of this rifle to a Colt, LWRC, Bushmaster, Sig Sauer, Smith & Wesson, Windham, Daniel Defense, Troy, Ruger, LMT, HK, CMMG, Rock River, Stag, Delton, POF, Core, Adams, Double Star, Knights, Spikes, Christensen, Olympic, Yankee Hill, or any other manufacturer’s AR – 15 and you will not be disappointed.

Up for your consideration is a very nice Custom Gatorade Drink Machine Gun Safe. Rest assured your guns and ammo sit in your man cave fully secured and hiding in plain sight. 

This safe is custom built, fully carpeted with grey carpet, and has barrel rests for 42 long guns. Pistol area holds 12 pistols.

Inside dimensions = 21.5"" Deep x 34"" Wide x 55"" Tall.  
Ammo compartment dimensions = 24"" Deep x 35.75"" Wide x 13"" Tall. 
Outside dimensions of machine = 35"" Sides x 36.75"" Wide (front & back) x 72.5"" Tall


The safe is very well built, incredibly sturdy with lock and key.  It is equipped with two - 5 LED light strips that really light up and show off the quality inside. The outside and inside has been cleaned. I installed a new light to light up the front of the machine. Machine has been lined with carpet. I have built and installed a custom rifle rack that has the capacity of holding 42 long longs. The labels have been replaced with new ones. The lower level can be used to store ammo. The lower level also can be filled with sand/concrete to add additional weight or the machine can be bolted down to your floor for security. This safe is strictly a theft deterrent. I did not install any fire, or flood proof protection. A lot of time, work and money went into this safe and it is very nice looking. I’m asking 800.00. Email with any questions. Thanks"

When I bought the gun It was cerakoted coyote tan, the finish was VERY spotty, light in some spots and heavy in others, and was clearly rushed and even had a partial finger print on it. I removed the cerakote with MEK and acetone and found that this gun has had ALOT of use prior to me; at one point the slide had even been painted zombie green? 97% of that is all gone now.   -->The gun itself is functional and to my surprise, actually very accurate. It just needs more love than I can give it, I got my CCW paper work back and Id like to have this sold and have my CC gun bought and worn around the house by the time my license gets to me. 
--> Comes with 2 magazines, and pelican case.

 XTP pistol bullets continue to set the standard as the bullet of choice for hunters and law enforcement officers who understand the value of a pistol bullet which will perform over a wide range of handgun velocities. Most pistol bullets are designed to work only at a factory specified velocity and a specific range. At these predetermined specifications, the bullets work just fine. But when bullet velocity begins to change, surprises can happen. Many factors cause velocities to change-gun type, barrel length, distance to target, barriers and more. That's why you need a bullet that you can depend on to perform over a wide range of velocities. You need the XTP. 

Unlike traditional pistol bullets, XTP bullets are designed to expand with control at a wide range of handgun velocities. They hold together, expand properly and provide the kind of deep, terminal penetration you need for any shooting situation. No other handgun bullet expands with so much control over so wide a range of velocities as the XTP. 

CONTROLLED EXPANSION AT ALL PRACTICAL HANDGUN VELOCITIES 1. On impact, the strategically designed jacket and hollow point begin to initiate expansion, even at velocities as low as 800 fps. 2. The copper jacket begins to fold back behind the leading edge of the expanding lead core. The leading edge does the work as the bullet penetrates its target. 3. The bullet holds its diameter as it continues to fold back on itself in the classic mushroom shape, and meets increasing resistance from the growing thickness of the copper jacket. 4. Expansion is finally arrested. The thick base prevents over-expansion and separation - even at velocities as high as 1800 fps.

It is a rebuild from Springfield. The serial number(38xxxxx) on the receiver dates it back to July 1945 so i dont think it saw any war. The Stock and the receiver are Original parts but everything else is new parts from Springfield when it was restored/rebuilt in the 50's. I put 2 parts in myself. One is called the Holbrook thumbsaver device(so you cant smash any fingers in the receiver). I also have a ported gas plug installed on it that needs no adjustments so the m1 can fire any kind of ammo. these parts are not permanent in any way so can be replaced with default parts, but they make the gun really fun to shoot. Bore is in great condition only about 50-75 rounds since the re-barrel. Stock is in great condition, but there are a few dings/marks. Ive got it to shoot 2-1/2 moa at 100. Overall its a really nice M1 chambered for an excellent cartridge. Im putting it up for what i paid for it since the parts i purchased were somewhat spendy.

I have a lot of time and money invested into this Springfield, all work done / installed by professionals. I'm not really in a hurry to sell this thing, just wanted to put it up and see if it was something people were looking to buy. It's the most tricked out XDm that I've seen and shoots like a dream. The threaded barrel and RMR are the latest additions and each have only about 150 rounds of use on them. There is over $2,000 total invested in this gun, plus the additional accessories and mags.

Some notable upgrades/features.
Powder River Trigger kit installed (factory trigger included)
slide milled for RMR + suppressor sights (L&M precision gunworks)
Trijicon RMR - RM07
Storm Lake threaded barrel (factory match barrel included)
Six (6) 19 round magazines
Talon grips + black stippled backstrap (all original green backstraps included)
One or several custom kydex holsters (fit to the XDm with Inforce APL or Streamlight TLR-1 weapon lights)

**Suppressor, Inforce APL and Streamlight TLR-1 not included**

Feel free to shoot me any questions. This will ship FFL -> FFL and abide by all local laws. This pistol cannot ship to areas where this gun / magazine count is restricted (sorry, can't sell to my fellow Coloradons), so please know your local laws before contacting me.

SU-16CA
The SU-16CA is a hybrid of the SU-16C and SU-16A rifles. It comes with the same 16-inch barrel with Chrome-lined bore and chamber and 1/2-28 threads as the C model. All features from the C model are retained and combined with the stock of the A model. The SU-16CA will come with 2 10 round magazines that store in the stock and all the same Parkerized parts as the C model. Like the A model, the SU-16CA can be folded for storage and it will not fire in the folded position. This allows for it to be purchased in most states that still have an ""Assault Weapons Ban""

 If you want it cleaned and polished it I will do it for .02 a round.
NICKEL is also .02 more, but its easy to clean and preferred by many.

 I'll ship it to your front door by USPS priority mail. I use the ""if fits it ships"" priority mail boxes: You can ship twice as much 9mm as .45 acp in the same box, but generally as a rule:
 100-300 pcs will cost 5.80 to ship.
 300-2000 pcs will cost 12.65 to ship.
 1500-4000 pcs will cost 16.50 to ship.

 Your welcome to mix and match any quantity of any size. Example:
 500 pcs each of, 9mm, .40 S&W and .45ACP = 1500 pcs and would ship for 12.65.

 If you reload several sizes, than you will do well here, You can mix your numbers any way you want.

 Payment: I prefer PAY-PAL, but I have a store front business and take credit card orders over the phone every day but Sunday and if need be will take a money order. If you prefer a personal check that is fine also, but it will delay your shipment till it clears the bank. 

 Swap: I love to swap. I am a gun enthusiast, re-loader, hunter, and all around outdoorsman. I will swap you for any gun you are not using, or ammo you have no gun to shoot it out of anymore, or about anything else. I like it all. I am a fair trader and will give you fair market value on whatever you might have to trade. All you can do is ask, and I’ll I can say is yes, or no, but it doesn’t hurt to ask.

After that I installed a Wolf hammer and trigger spring kit and let me tell you it is buttery smooth. I have personally polished this gun for 20+ hours and it shows! To top it off I found a beautiful Pau Ferro wood grip made by Hogue. I was going to get new front and rear sights but haven't yet. This is a gun that looks so good you don't want to shoot it.
