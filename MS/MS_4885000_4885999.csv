1 flush mag, 1 finger extension mag

This is a 2013 (After the recall) S&W built PPK/s. I got this as part of a trade from a friend a while back. The history of the pistol was unknown so I sent it off to Smith to have them check it over. They returned it to me with a clean bill of health. I have not fired the gun since it came back from S&W.

The gun is used but in very good shape overall. There are a few tiny nicks, and one large enough to feel on the front strap.(see pic) There is also a little scuffing on the end of the frame. I was a little bummed that S&W didn't buff those out while they had it, but there you go.

Sales:
CPL holder preferred but FFL transfer ok too. Buyer to pay any FFL fees if necessary.

Trades:
I am not a CPL holder so any trades will have to go through an FFL. I will pay the fee for the transfer.

Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the GLOCK 21SF delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 AUTO round with 10/13 round magazine capacity. Countless law enforcement units swear by the G21SF pistol, and that's why this powerful, lightweight, all climate workhorse is standard issue from the North to South Poles. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control—especially for shooters with smaller hands."

For those unfamiliar with it, this particular model is a clone of the Jericho 941/Baby Eagle compact, which itself is a mechanical clone of the CZ-75 compact. As such, it has a high level of parts interchangeability with the CZ-75, including grips, magazines, and sights. This piece was purchased new by me less than a month ago. It has been stripped and cleaned, loaded and carried a couple times but as of yet is unfired and is in like new condition. Will come with everything it came with new, the case, mag loader, and 2 Mec-Gar 15rd magazines.
I'm primarily looking for something that would be more practical for conceal carry. As the title says, I'm mainly interested in a Khar CM or CW preferably in 9mm but will also take a 40 or 45 version. Otheriwse would be interested in other single stacks pistols, and would also be interested in a S&W J-frame. I would also consider a trade down plus some cash for a Kel-Tec PF-9 or Taurus PT111 G2.
Will also sell for $350- considering condition, price is firm. FTF transaction in the Winfield/Wellington area preferred, but can meet in Wichita for the right deal. Have my CCL and can sign bill of sale if desired. Reach me by PM or text to REDACTED."

Nagant revolvers are some of the only revolvers in history that can be silenced due to their gas seal feature. this also gives them a boost in muzzle velocity and penetration/stopping power. this one is in very good condition.

First, is a SIG 227 bought in September 2015. Comes with 2 10 round magazines and a 14 round magazine. Awesome gun all the way around and I really hate to see it go. $800

Second is a SIG 220 compact. This is an exceptional carry pistol. Night sights, 6+1 of .45 ACP. Plenty of firepower to get you out of most bad situations. I hate to see this one go even more than the 227. Includes a couple of holsters. $600

I also have 100 rounds of FMJ and 50 of Gold Dots I will throw in for the right deal. I'll take $100 off if you buy both. That's $1300 including the ammo!!!

There is nothing wrong with these guns. Wife says I have too many toys and if I want more I have to clean house. You know how it goes.

With the Kershaw Knives Tanto Blur Folding Knife's angled shape, the tanto blade provides additional piercing power to penetrate tough materials. The unique shape puts more steel behind the point to support its piercing tasks. Kershaw also found that the short front edge is particularly handy for opening boxes. For razor sharpness, Kershaw hollow grinds the edge. Then for additional versatility, Kershaw added partial serration to the blade, giving you a great tool for cutting through materials such as webbing or rope. All this makes the Tanto Blur a good choice for situations in which you're going to need to make an impact on your environment. In an emergency, could be a real lifesaver. The Kershaw Tanto Blur Folding Knife's blade is built of high-performance Sandvik 14C28N stainless blade steel for corrosion resistance and hardness. The black DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) coating provides additional extra corrosion resistance and is non-reflective. Black anodized aluminum handles of durable 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum with sure-grip Trac-Tec inserts complete the Kershaw Knives Blur Knife w/ Tanto Blade's discrete, matte look.Specifications: - Blade length: 3 3/8 in. (8.6 cm) - Closed length: 4 1/2 in. (11.4 cm) - Overall length: 7 7/8 in. (20 cm) - Weight: 4.2 oz.Features: - Steel: Sandvik 14C28N, DLC coating - Handle: 6061-T6 anodized aluminum, Trac-Tec inserts - Serrations assist in cutting through particularly tough or fibrous material, such as rope or cord. The Kershaw 2-step serration is a more aggressive style of serration. - Locks the blade open during use one side of the knife's steel ""liner,"" the steel plate to which the handle scales are attached, moves into position behind the blade to securely lock it open. - When you see this on one of Kershaw's knives, it means the knife was made in Kershaw's Tualatin, Oregon manufacturing facility by skilled Kershaw knifemakers. - Assists you to open any SpeedSafe knife quickly and easily with a manual push on the thumbstud or pull back on the flipper built into many Kershaw best sellers. - Pre-drilled holes in the handle enable the user to change either the tip position or the side on which the knife carries.  Check it out Here"

Rare find! I have a beautiful Browning BAR II .30.06 Belgium made and manufactured in 1971. This rifle has the classy and very rare ""big game"" engraving on each side including an elk and an antelope. It's hard to find a classic like this these days. The semi-automatic shooting action is smooth and can't be beat. This gun was a safe queen for years and is in great shape with minimal wear. You can rarely find these rifles on GunBroker and other sites for 1,100-1,300 dollars. I'm asking $850. There is a place for a scope to be mounted with rings. There are loops for a sling.

In case you are wondering, the reason this style is much higher priced is because it is the rifles made from 1967-1974 are considered collectibles. This model of the BAR was made and manufactured in Belgium. In the following years, the parts were made in Japan, Portugal, and the U.S. and then shipped to the Belgium for manufacture. This is a RARE gun! Get it while you can!

Each model has standard Kimber features like rounded and blended edges, beveled magazine well, extended thumb safety and bumped beavertail grip safety. Magazine capacity is 7 rounds in .45 ACP.

With the Aimpoint Micro H-1, Aimpoint has introduced an aiming system that provides the performance of full-sized sights in the smallest package possible. Designed with the hunter in mind, these sights are the lightest red dot sights tough enough to bear the Aimpoint name. Small enough to be used anywhere that you could put iron sights, these sights can be used on any type of firearm or archery equipment. A lightweight rifle with Micro H-1 mounted on it remains a lightweight rifle. A hunting revolver with a Micro H-1 installed remains as easy to carry as with iron sights and is much quicker to aim. On a bow, the parallax-free Micro H-1 eliminates the need for a peep, allowing you to shoot accurately in lower light.Built to offer the same battle-proven ruggedness as other Aimpoint products, the Micro H-1 is able to perform under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon. Suitable for use on rifles, carbines, shotguns, and handguns, the Aimpoint Micro H-1 is ideal as a stand-alone sight, and because it weighs less than 4 ounces including the integrated Weaver mount, it can easily be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes optics.Aimpoint's unique band-pass coating on the front lens gives the highest possible dot brightness, while providing the clearest, brightest image possible.Features 13 brightness settings for use in daylight and low-light conditions, so the Micro H-1 is ready for use around the clock.Unique Features of the Micro H-1:- Ideal for rifles, carbines, shotguns, and handguns- 1x (non-magnifying) parallax-free optic- Integral Weaver-style mount allows easy attachment to any rail- Patent pending mount is keyed to the sight body to absorb recoil- New ACET technology allows 50,000 hours (over 5 years) of constant operation from one battery- 4 MOA dot- 13 brightness settings for use in daylight and low-light conditions- Matte Black finish- Submersible to 15 feet (5 meters)- Precision adjustments for windage and elevation. Top of protective caps fits into holes on adjustment screws no other tool required- Use as a stand alone sight or piggybacked on larger magnifying opticsCheck it out Here"

The first 200,000 7.62 Special Operations Science and Technology rounds are already downrange with Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan. SOCOM developed the new rounds for use with the Special Operations Force Combat Assault Rifle, or SCAR, which needed a more accurate bullet because its short barrel, at 13.8 inches, is less than an inch shorter than the M4 carbine’s. Using an open-tip match round design common with some sniper ammunition, SOST rounds are designed to be “barrier blind,” meaning they stay on target better than existing M855 rounds after penetrating windshields, car doors and other objects.""  FIRM ON PRICE AND NOT WILLING TO SPLIT UP."

Seen only on some of the very early Number Three rifles is the beautiful walnut found on this rifle.... Other features include the factory metal buttplate, nitre blued screws, and the Sharps-pattern genuine pewter forearm cap.The slenderizing of the stock allowed for the sculpting of graceful panels on the front of the wrist which gives the rifle a disctinctive and classic 19th Century look.  Mechanically, the rifle is like new, very tight and crisp and has seen little if any field use. The rifling is sharp and shiny as is the exterior bluing... All in all it's a very handsome rifle that is short and handy and handles like a dream. You have to feel it to appreciate the wonderful result of removing just a few millimeters of wood - in the right places.The price of $1,350 does not include the Renner No 1 Tang Sight. If you want the rifle with the tang sight the price is $1,550.Also available are my Ruger No. 1 Tang Sights.

Also, I'm not really interested in shipping, but if you insist that adds another $40.  Plus, you will have to wait while your money order or check clears my bank before I will ship - no ifs ands or buts.   There are simply too many scams and cons going on these days for me to take the risk so please don't bother to contact me if you cannot accept my terms for shipping.  LOOK IT UP FOR YOURSELF AT BOTH THE CABALAS OR DIXIE GUN WORKS WEB SITES TO SEE MY PRICE IS ALREADY VERY FAIR FOR THIS NIB PIECE.

A proprietary gas ported barrel and pressure tube reduce the exposure to high pressure gasses which could destroy relatively delicate projectiles. The Can Cannon is currently configured for launching full, un-opened 12oz soda cans. When used with standard mil spec blanks and fired at an optimum angle it can reach an average distance of 105 yards! Why launch soda cans instead of drinking them? Because you can! Projectile options are only limited by your creativity and local laws.Each unit is sold as an assembled upper with receiver, headspaced and mounted ported barrel, and pressure tube. The system is compatible with any AR-15 mil standard bolt and most piston bolts.Date: September 30, 2015FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASERE: Soda-Gate 2015Much has been discussed in the media as of late regarding the legality of the Can Cannon based on the recent BATF determination letter. These are the facts.Prior to releasing the Can Cannon for sale, X Products proactively requested a determination from the BATF. X Products proceeded with sale of the Can Cannon only after the BATF had determined that the Can Canon was;1) not a weapon and2) not a destructive device.Due to the popularity of the Can Cannon and the variety of Can Cannon accessories that are due to be released in the near future, X Products requested a second determination from the BATF. X Products wanted to make sure their customers don’t run into any legal issues when attaching the Can Cannon to an AR-15 lower receiver. A second determination request isn’t standard practice, but with a product such as the Can Cannon they felt it was the responsible thing to do. Based on the second determination from the BATF, X Products has submitted a modified design to the BATF to address any compliance issues. X Products respects the BATF and are working with them closely to ensure that cans (and other ridiculous objects of your choosing) may fly freely again in the near future. X Products appreciates the support they've received from the community and look forward to providing awesome accessories for the Can Cannon in the months ahead."

Whether you enjoy all three disciplines equally or haven't yet committed to one, the A400 Xcel Multitarget will always be the right choice. Thanks to the Beretta B-Fast logic, the comb is adjustable with 4-way drop and cast regulation; in addition, a shim system makes it reversible from right- to left-handed use and the safety may be easily switched from left to right. The same B-Fast system enables you to adjust the rib to modify the point of impact depending on discipine, while the balance cap can be tuned to obtain your ideal point of balance. The A400 action features Blink technology, which is measurably the fastest action on the market today. Capable of firing four shots in less than one second, it is 36% faster than any other semi-auto shotgun on the market. In spite of its lively feel in the hands, this gun is also low-recoiling thanks to a kick-absorbing Micro Core recoil pad. At the range, the A400 Xcel Multitarget will never fail to turn heads, thanks to its handsome walnut stock and trim receiver with an elegant and durable anodized silver finish. In short, this shotgun delivers features only found in high priced, specialized over/unders - in an elegant, affordable and incredibly versatile package that will give a lifetime of enjoyment."

I am the original owner. The computer has had a carbon fiber body protector and has been transported in a case its entire life so the aluminum body is like new. It has been used as a desktop most of its life. Ive just upgraded to a new Macbook Air so I no longer have a use for this machine.  Ive alway taken meticulous care of this machine and everything has been upgraded/maintained when needed. The RAM, Hard drive, and anti glare protector were all professionally installed. The charger is new within the last year. I will install a factory new El Capitan OS (latest version) before purchase and I can put pretty much any software you want on it for you if you ask. 

I will take the carbon fiber protector off before selling. There has never been a sticker on the actual body of the laptop, only on the protector.
