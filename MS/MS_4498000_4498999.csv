(i believe the new ones have an aluminum receiver and plastic internals)

it is in very good condition. it gets a full break-down and cleaning every time it is fired. wiped down with oil and stored in a climate controlled environment.

i originally built this with the intention of taking it into competition but due to development i cannot shoot on my own property anymore so i basically just used it to plink with friends over the years. it is extremely accurate and fun to shoot. with the bipod deployed on a table even an amateur can drive tacks. i have over $1000 invested in modifications.

mods.
competition Volquartsen trigger group:
 2 3/4lb trigger pull, auto bolt release, extended mag release and an aftermarket trigger with an adjustable creep screw.

competition Volquartsen speed bolt assembly:
 this has a thicker firing pin which contacts more of the rim. reducing the chance of a miss-fire, upgraded Extractor which grabs the rim and extracts a little better and a Billet aluminum charging handle which is a lot more comfortable when quickly charging. (and it looks cool...)

Green Mountain .920 Heavy fluted bull barrel. has a nice crown to it. i believe its 18"" but i cannot remember exactly its been a wile. the barrel has been custom drilled and tapped for the Sight rail that is on the gun. i believe it was made by Burris. in the pursuit of accuracy i had a lot of problems finding a sight rail that would hold its zero. this barrel mount was it. I never had another problem losing zero. (and again, i think it looks cool)

i dont remember the brand of the stock. it is a really nice thumbhole laminate stock. very ergonomic with a nice cheek-pice. i added a Sling-stud to the front and have a Harris spring loaded bipod attached to it.

includes Two all aluminum TI-25 banana magazines.
 these are the best 10/22 mags i have found. they have removable steel lips and can be fully disassembled and cleaned / serviced. they also have four adjustable cap screws to adjust how well they fit and function in the gun. the feed angle can be ""tuned"" to allow the bullet to feed into the chamber just right without shaving any of the round. both mags have been tuned to this rifle. they have each been disassembled and cleaned a few times. i have them labelled ""1"" and ""2"" with white-out pen so i could tell which one was which when i was tuning them.

this rifle was built for match and is fairly heavy. capable of placing quick follow up shots on target. however, it is fairly short and almost perfectly balanced at the forehand grip. so it still shoots really nicely firing freehand.

i hate to see it go but am interested in playing with something else.

Must be over the age of 18 and a Non-Felon. must be willing to sign a bill of sale and provide valid NCID. a concealed carry permit would be a plus.

happy to provide more pictures and my phone number VIA Email.

However, a misfired shell ended up bulging the barrel slightly so I bought a replacement gun last winter to get me through the season and now don't need the Stoeger. It still works great, but I would highly recommend buying a replacement barrel. Midwest Gun Works has three replacement options for sale: $50 for a 20 inch barrel with a cantilevered scope rail (ie, for deer hunting), $160 for 18.5 inch fixed choke (for self defense) or $229 for a 28 inch camo barrel (for waterfowl or upland game). 

The gun has a homemade rattle can paint job applied over the original camo, which was way too light. As you can see, the paint is flaking in places, but it still conceals the gun well in the woods. The gun functions flawlessly and will cycle 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells. It comes with improved modified and cylinder chokes.

I'm willing to drive anywhere in a 15 mile radius from Carrboro. I will need to see your valid North Carolina ID.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for looking."

This design makes machining your 80% lower easier, faster and safer. The Easy Jig has a built-in drill/end-mill depth gauge for the trigger and rear-shelf pockets. A quick verification of depth setting eliminates slippage issues that can ruin parts. It also eliminates constant measuring to determine depth while milling. The Easy Jig is designed to hold tolerances using a common hand-drill. A drill press is not required, the milling is done with a router. Pocket drilling requires 10 holes drilled once. A traditional jig requires 42 holes to be drilled once, precisely aligned and clamped, then re-drilled to a larger diameter. The trigger pocket can be cut in 6 to 11 passes versus 25 passes required with a drill press. Hand-drilling the trigger group/safety selector holes is faster to setup. The whole process can be completed in 1 hour instead of 3 hours with the old drill press method. The Easy Jig can be used to make dozens of lowers. All components are type III hard anodized for extra wear resistance. MADE IN THE U.S.A.NOTE: A router is NOT included."

I have put just 150 rounds through it. The trgger is not resetting correctly. Its as if the safety is on.  I can manually move the latch its caught on, then pull trigger and its fine.  I'm not an AK expert or a gunsmith by any means. My gun guy looked at it and said visually everything looks fine and it's any easy fix if you know what you're doing. I'm not ready to pay a gunsmith for a quick fix. Tapco trigger group costs $32. I'm just trying to sell it as is and get something else.  I'm asking $475. I'd like to see, not have, buyers ccw or pistol permit.  Just so I know you're allowed to own a gun.  Also must sign a simple bill of sale for my records.  Thanks for looking.  Have a great day."

It's been a while since I've played, but this gun really did it for me; it is a great semi-pro entry gun. I replaced the spring with another one designed for distance; when combined with Hop-Up tech that's built into the gun, it can easily reach distances of 75-100 yards. Hits about 350 fps, keeping it under a lot of the minimum fps requirements on courses. Accurate as heck, too. If you combine it with a 3000 or 4000 battery, you'll spit bullets with the sort of accuracy, distance, and power of a sniper rifle!

Ghillie wrap and camo is removable.

Based on the markings, it appears this one was refurbished sometime before 1950. Most of the parts have German waffenamts on them, but like typical Yugo refurbs, the receiver ring has been scrubbed and re-stamped with the Yugo crest and armory Preduzece 44.

Wood and metal finish are in good shape. The bore on this rifle is very good. The chamber headspaces properly and I have fired the rifle with no issues. I have a repro leather sling I can also throw in for $20 extra.

Yugo captured K98s provide the best opportunity to get a German made K98 without having to pay the ever increasing prices they are demanding.

I would prefer to meet FTF around Raleigh or northeastern Wake County. Please let me know if you have any questions or offers. I am willing to entertain trade offers for other Mausers, Enfields, Springfield, Marlin 45/70 rifles or possibly other iron sighted hunting rifles."

PRODUCT DETAILS
The patented Magpul ACS (Adaptable Carbine/Storage) – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. A streamlined, anti-snag profile shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. Similar to the Magpul CTR®, the ACS also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy*. Dual, rear accessible, water-resistant battery storage tubes and an integral storage compartment in the butt of the stock provides multiple storage options. The ACS comes standard with a 0.30"" thick rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear."

Beretta #1934, manufactured in 1937 and dual dated. This handgun is super clean for a WW2 relic and carries the Julian date and the Roman Numeral date. Lockup is very tight, safety works smooth as glass, and the barrel appears to be in excellent condition. Heck, there is very little wear on the outside of the barrel itself, where it would contact the slide. 

Proof marks (RE under a crown) indicates this was an Italian army issued pistol. No import marks found by me.

Issues I have found are, non original grips, unless these were ever issued with wood grips.
(I highly doubt that). Wear on the mag is about the same as the wear on the frame, so most likely they are matched. As in the picture, there are 2 mags that come with this, an original, and a well worn, used one that's NOT original.

If you're a collector looking for one of these for your collection, you may want to look this one over. I haven't seen a cleaner one for sale, even on gunbroker.

Asking $350, Price is negotiable, and I will consider trades for a Browning P35 (hi power)
I consider my asking price fair based on online research. That being said, prices seem to be high in the South Florida area and I don't want to discourage potential buyers.

I don't sell to criminals. If you have a police record, don't even bother asking about the Beretta."

It looks so good you might think it's a restoration, but it is all original and complete right down to the key and owners manual under the seat. Bike has always been stored inside and it shows! Clean title in my name and tagged until February 2016. Asking $2400 or reasonable offer. 
-3945 original miles.
-Not chopped or modified in any way, this is an all original bike: wiring, frame, paint, lights, chrome, etc.
-Comes with seldom seen original accessories: sissy bar, luggage rack, and case guards.
-Front and back brakes work perfectly.
-Plenty of tread on tires.
-Original key works all locks.
-No rust in tank, it's perfect inside and out.
-Converted to late model Kawasaki electronic ignition with all correct parts: coil, IC igniter, rotor, pickup, and wiring harness. Separate harness made from an original for conversion and factory wiring untouched in case you want to convert back to points, just unplug 1 wire. Will sell the original points system with the bike for an additional cost.
-Oil screen screws replaced with allen bolts for easy servicing. 
-Seat is in near perfect condition with one small repair.
-Still has original dealer and break in stickers.
-Needs a new battery.

I pulled the left and right side engine covers to polish them and replace the screws with bolts. Have not gotten around to getting it done yet, but all the screws are there and usable and the gasket mating surfaces have been cleaned and are ready for new gaskets. I also pulled the oil screen for inspection and to clean it out and it needs a gasket as well. All of this can be done with the engine in the frame. Cost is around $35 for complete gasket set and it can be done by a mechanical novice. Carbs were drained for storage and they should be good to go, maybe replace the fuel line. Other than that the bike is ready to go, add your own gas and oil. Don't pass up this deal, the only way you will be able to find another KZ400H LTD in any better condition is to jump in a time machine and buy one new off the lot."
