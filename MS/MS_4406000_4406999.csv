The Nate Squared Tactical Professional holster is the ultimate IWB (inside-the-waistband) holster. It has all the comfort of our Original design, but comes with the following additional features: adjustable cant, tuckable, excellent positive retention. The holster is made of polycarbonate, which is an extremely durable thermoplastic. Common uses range from cd's & dvd's to bullet resistant glass. We chose to use polycarbonate because it has 30% more tensile strength and almost double the impact strength of acrylic-polyvinyl chloride, which is the material used by many of the most popular IWB holsters on the market today. All of this simply means that the Professional holster is made of the highest quality materials available. Using polycarbonate also allowed us to develop a positive retention IWB holster with our Twist Release System™.  When the holster is worn, your body puts pressure against the backing, which presses the firearm against the polycarbonate.  The polycarbonate holds the firearm in place and provides additional security for the retention of your firearm.  Simply drive your thumb between the holster and the grip, then slightly twist the grip toward your body to release the trigger guard from the retention bump for a smooth draw!"

Information about these is a little sketchy, and I'm relating what I can learn about it off the internet, but I encourage you to do your own research and give it a good look if you intend to buy it. I personally have never fired this weapon, but it came to me from the collection of a man who had fired it several times a year for decades, so I believe it to be safe and complete -- and he said, quite accurate.

The 22"" barrel needs to be refinished to make it look its best, but it is serviceable and in good condition otherwise -- not pitted and I can find no rust. The rifling looks good and there is no apparent muzzle erosion.

The action is smooth and tight, and I would guess someone has worked on the trigger because the release is quite crisp.

The scope mounts on the receiver were obviously done by a professional: they are very solid, and the bolt handle has been bent and countoured to pass by the scope's eyepiece. The scope is a Simmons Aetec 2.8-10x44, in good condition with nice clear glass. Shock-corded transparent lens covers are included.

The custom wood stock is a real beauty — nice dark wood with lighter wood accents on the grip and the forearm. It has the Monte Carlo-style cheek rest, and a nice target swell at the end of the grip. It includes sling swivels and a recoil pad.

As it is, it's ready for the hunt — and with a little more work, it could be a real looker too.

I prefer a face-to-face deal for cash in the NW San Antonio / Helotes / Leon Springs area, but I would be willing to ship at your expense if you're willing to pay up front. Let me know if you have any questions, or would like to see other pictures, etc. Please be prepared to show a Texas state ID and sign a bill of sale.

The barrel is stamped 9391. I believe it is a 1881 Mark II originally chambered in caliber  577-450, and converted in 1899 to the current .303. Apparently many of these guns were converted, and I believe that is why there are different dates on each side. According to my LGS, the bore is in fireable condition and the rifle is original in length, stamps, markings, and everything else. It is missing the rear sight, the brass badge that goes on the right side of the stock, and the butt pad. Price is $500 or open to trades. Text me for fastest response 727-366-2 3 4 0"

The only ""issue"" with it is the small blemish in the intensifier tube (the black spot in the top section of the field of view in the shot above) but that's the reason you're getting gen 3 night vision (what the military currently uses) for $1200 and not $3000! The eye cup is also a bit misshapen but it doesn't affect function or make it uncomfortable to use at all.

These units use the slightly blemished tubes that don't make it into pvs-7s and pvs-14s, and are manufactured for use in military pilots' survival vests. They have amazing build quality, and feature a small signaling/close-up IR illuminator. They also only need 2 AA's which is great."

#1) Saiga IZ-132. Back on the market. Last ""buyer"" said he'd take it except for one small problem: he didn't actually have any money. Will sell for $625.00 cash or trade value of $750.00.

#2) WASR 10. May be willing to sell all three. Your pick of which one you want. All three are modern production rifles, not the older models that were hit-or-miss quality wise.
Will sell for $525.00 each.

Note #1) The ONLY trade I am interested in is a .308 bolt-action rifle. Please research and understand the value of your rifle before offering it in trade. If I can go to Cabelas or Sportsmans Warehouse or Gander Mountain and buy the same rifle brand new for $350 or $400, chances are pretty good that unless you're willing to add cash or ammo to make up the difference, I'm going to politely say ""No"" to your offer.

Note #2) Modern-built WASR 10s' are not the same as the old WASRs' were. Do a little research on some of the AK enthusiast forums, look through the ads on Gunwatcher.com and you'll see that the rifles I have listed are BELOW current retail, not being sold at a profit. NO tax, NO shipping plus you get to examine them before committing to buying. You'll see these are excellent quality firearms.

A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome.

Has had less than 20 rds down the chamber. One of the most powerful semi auto handguns made the Desert Eagle, IMI 50AE , its in Pristine condition. Satin Nickel brushed stainless finish is the rarest and hardest to find. 1 magazine has the same finish for its baseplate which Desert Eagle doesn't offer anymore. Made in Israel. Not the US models. Much more desirable.  Not to be mistaken for the chrome plated finish.  This finish will last if you decide to shoot it a lot and not just use as a coffee table piece. Will come with over $200 worth of Hornady XTP ammo. $1350 cash for package  firm on that, trade value to me would be 1650.00 easy with being made in Israel, the brushed Satin Nickel finish, excellent condition. $200 worth of ammo included custom grips, and the value of the older models from Israel rising. Very accurate. Have 2 of them so selling the nice one. Can customize it for hunting or just a BA shooter. 
Had some things come up so need to sell the gun. Pricedto sale fast. $200 in ammo with pistol. Shoot it and if you can wait to sell it make some money. Has custom hand grips $160. Different engraving each side Text or email if interested 719-237 one one one 6, can send more pics as well. 

Only traded I would even possibly consider are handguns. Higher end ones HK, Sig, rarer Glocks 2 for 1 or customized ones, plus cash. Full size only as I have gorilla mitts haha.

Serial number 5408 

The good - very rare likely only a few hundred guns produced in this configuration - RH monte carlo stock - beavertail forend, 30"" barrels 2 3/4"" chambers, Full choke over slightly less full choke, clean bores bright and shiny, super crisp triggers and safety, both ejectors work

The bad - Added recoil pad-it is likely pretty old itself it reads Red Head brand - Chicago
some light surface rust on barrels where it lay against a rack, some travel marks on the barrel by the fore end. Some pretty decent nicks in the stock, light orange peeling on fore end. While gun shoots and locks up like a vault still, the cocking lever is only slightly right of 90 degrees indicating the gun may need a tune-up soon. 

All in all a very cool and rare prewar browning. Please email with phone number and picture requests and I will do my best to meet them. I will only do in person sales

I purchased two of these units after buying standard and ported models of the new S&W M&P C.O.R.E. semi-autos in January.  The Docter Sight are compatible with most newer handguns that come pre-milled for RDS without the need for modification, and this unit allows you to co-witness with your iron sights (GLOCK, S/A, FNX-45, AR and other platforms). and almost any handgun that accepts this type of sight. I sold one of the M&Ps, the reason for this sale. 

The II-Plus Model is preferred by most American Shooters for it's durability and the high quality German Glass and sharper image. I opted to add a specialized feature called ""Bullet-Proofing"" or ""Waterproof and Ruggedization"", and DOCTOR USA extends the Warrantiy for  30 years.

General Info 
The Docter SightII-Plus | Welcome to the original
Whether in the classical sense or during sport hunting according to points — with a DOCTER®sight, success is virtually certain. DOCTER®sights embody the features ""small, light, precise and fast"". Mounted a thousand fold, they have guaranteed their users a taste of success in hunting and sports during the last 10 years. This success story will continue to be written with the next generation of the DOCTER®sight.

Automatic Brightness Adjustment
An integrated brightness sensor automatically adjusts the illumination of the aiming Dot to the environment. The sensor automatically adjusts the intensity of the sight's Dot so that the Dot does not flare in the darkness and, is at the perfect illumination level in darkness, in low light, in daylight and in bright sunshine.

Separate Windage and Elevation Sight Adjustments
Windage and elevation adjustments are made through the use of two unobtrusive screws located on the frame of the sight. The settings then are locked solidly in place with two set screws, assuring that they do not ""shoot loose"" during recoil of even the largest handgun calibers. This is further reinforced by the BF option included with this sight. 

The Ideal CQB Sight
Designed for Law Enforcement and Military applications as a primary CQB sight, and an excellent performer in competion shooting.

I paid $531 for the gun then immediately went completely through the gun and replaced all the factory metal injection molded parts with parts of known quality. Below is the list of parts replaced. All parts were installed and fitted my myself. All work was done the right way, no half assed work done as this was my carry gun.

The following parts have been installed:
Kart barrel bushing (this was not the drop in part and had to be fitted specifically to this barrel) $12
Ed Brown ""match"" extractor $28 (properly tuned and clocked)
Ed Brown firing pin $8 (highly polished so crud doesn't stick to it)
Wolff extra power firing pin spring $4 
EGW square firing pin stop $15
Nowlin Pro Match Sear $18 
Wolff 20 pound mainspring $5 (helps reduce trigger pull without affecting reliability)
Wolf 16 pound recoil spring $8
Pro Mag grips $10 (these feel really good in the hand yet provide plenty of grip)
Ed Brown stainless beavertail $31
Flat mainspring housing $35
Fusion Firearms adjustable trigger $20
Clark Custom 4 finger sear spring $7
Small thumb safety (this helps to keep the thumb safety from being accidentally disengaged) $10
Allen grip screws $8
Parts total: $219 (does not include shipping on all parts)

Custom touches:
Checkered slide stop pad
Shortened and checkered slide stop shaft on the right side (this provides a place to rest your finger)
Chamfered slide stop hole (prevents accidentally pushing the take down lever out of the frame while resting your finger)
Polished feed ramp (helps with chambering)
Polished chamber (helps with extraction)
Polished breech face (helps with chambering)

The total package will include:
G-Code kydex holster $25
Serpa holster with MOLLE back $50 (I do not have the holster back but they are cheap)
Fobus Kydex magazine dual pouch $26 (This is the most comfortable magazine pouch I have ever used)
Factory magazine
Government magazine $10
Total: $111

The gun has Novak style sights that work very well. The rear sight had the notch opened up slightly to allow fast sight acquisition. 

It has ALWAYS been run with grease and ALWAYS ran with a buffer to protect the frame. This gun is 100% reliable and has not had a single malfunction since the parts have been replaced. It even runs Speer Gold Dots (flying ashtrays) 100% of the time. I made sure it was 100% reliable before carrying it and this one is definitely one you can trust your life with because you will not find a more reliable 1911 for daily carry. I carried this pistol daily for ~3 years. 

The trigger breaks cleanly at 3 pounds 12 ounces with very little take up and very little over travel. If you would prefer I can add weight to the trigger if you do not feel comfortable carrying a gun with such a light trigger. 

All springs were recently replaced as part of routine maintenance. 
I am asking $650 for the entire package. I am selling because I no longer use it and it just sits in the safe.

I will trade the gun, with one magazine, for a Draco. I might add accessories, or cash, depending on what accessories you have with the Draco. 

I welcome any, and all, questions."

~Interarms Virginian Dragoon in .44 mag. Single action as well. It's blued, long barrel. Hell of a trigger, was a safe queen with 2 shots down the pipe when I got it and I've only put half a box through it. Does have writing on the butt strap and original box.

I'm offering these two guns for a Les Baer 1911 before I give up. 

The 1911 is a first-year(1998) Brazilian-made TRP, all original except for the sights and the Ed Brown barrel bushing. It was sent back to Srpingfield in 2001 for night sights and, I guess, the Ed Brown barrel bushing. I added the current TRP G10 grips. The checkered, wooden grips are included.

The revolver is an unconverted, 1958, Ruger 44 Magum Flattop Blackhawk.  Nice condition with a great set of original contoured walnut grips. I bought it last year from the original owner. I've since bought a cut-down 44 Flattop for a shooter.

I might have taken a screwing on these, but I've got $950 in the TRP  and $850 in the Flattop. I'll trade them both for a nice Baer. I prefer to sell them together, which probably won't happen, but selling only one does me no good in my Baer hunt.

The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you''ll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot. 

You can easily convert your Witness steel or polymer frame pistol to shoot .22 LR, 9x 19mm, 10 mm, .38 Super, .40 S&W, or .45 ACP. No matter what your need, one gun can do it all. No other platform gives you the choices, versatility, and value found in the Tanfoglio Witness. Whether you''re a competitive shooter, firearms enthusiast, or armed professional, the Witness product line can fill all your needs. Quality, value, comfort, accuracy and dependability. EAA Witness...No Limit ! European American Armory is proud to be the exclusive importer of Tanfoglio products"

It came on a 300 blk pistol upper that i bought. I already have a longer handguard that i want to use instead, so i dont need this one. I fired the upper about 20 times to make sure it functioned properly and then took this handguard off. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this handguard. It includes the barrel nut and all screws. This handguard sells all over the internet for $179-$189. I'm asking $150 but am open to all offers including trades. I will meet within a reasonible distance of Summerfield which is north of Greensboro. Please text me a REDACTED. Sorry if anyone tried to email me, I never received them, I guess they were blocked.

The receiver serial number indicates a September 1917 production, and the barrel is dated the previous month, so it could have even seen service with our boys at Belleau Wood.

The rifle is a post WW1 re-arsenal with Parkerized metal. I believe the stock was likely changed with another Winchester stock at that time, but however it happened, finding a ""W"" stock on a Winchester M1917 is really hard to find. The bore is pitted and was most likely used by a VFW group for parades and funerals where they shot corrosive blanks in gun salutes and didn't clean them afterward. I spent several days cleaning years of buildup and corrosion out of the bore, but finally found some rifling remaining. I've fired it and while I wouldn't shoot a match with it, it still shoots ""minute of Kraut"". Overall, it's a gorgeous sample US rifle from WW1, and even better for the niche collector, it's a true Winchester!

 A lot of the parts are ""W"" stamped, including the barrel, bolt, front and rear sights, bayonet lug and stock, but there are several ""non-W"" (non-Winchester) parts including:
 - the bolt sleeve (E)
 - cocking piece (R)
 - buttstock swivel and base (E)
 - buttplate (R)
 - follower (E)
 - lower band swivel (E)
 - extractor (E)

 I figure the next owner can replace them with ""W"" parts as a restoration project if so desired for not a lot of money. 

The price is $875 cash FTF in NE FL, or I'll ship to a C&R or 01 FFL within the continental US for extra $25. If shipping, payment must be via US Postal Money Order. Cross posted on other websites.  Feel free to contact me with any questions.  Additional pictures are available via email."

I have one of these and I love it.  Smokin' accurate and repeatable.  I believe this Tremor2 reticle was designed with input from Todd Hodnett (Accuracy 1st) to incorporate holdover and wind holds.  (If I remember right, he uses Bushnell scopes (and others) in the Art of the Precision Rifle, but this is Bushy's upper crust line.  Above HDMR, XRS, and DMR, at DMR Price!)  And to boot... it has phenomenal clear glass, a 6x magnification spread, sunshade, FDE color, and a lifetime warranty.

From Bushnell's site:
As one of the top riflescope innovators in the world, Bushnell has worked diligently with law enforcement and military experts nationwide to design, test and prove the finest family of tactical shooting instruments in the industry.

Each model in the Elite Tactical line uses the basic precepts of every riflescope built by Bushnell - unfailing reliability and optical precision - and takes them a step further with application-specific features, such as tactical turrets for rapid adjustment, blacked-out finish for optimum concealment and new reticles for CQB or long range shooting.
Bushnell has also equipped these scopes with Ultra Wide Band Coating to boost brightness at dusk and dawn, plus argon purging for absolute reliability whatever the conditions.

I have a lightly used Benchmade 275 Adamas for sale. It has some slight wear from being used but is built like a tank and you wont find a more solid folding knife for the money. It is all USA made and backed with Benchmade's lifetime warranty and LifeSharp service. Once the blade is deployed it is virtually a fixed blade. It takes an insane amount of force to make the locking mechanism fail. The knife is quite substantial in weight and size and is really for hard use. It is by far the toughest knife I have ever owned and hate to see it go but I could really use the extra cash. Feel free to call text or e-mail with any questions or offers.

They only reason I'm looking to get rid of it is I realized I really like the way 1911's look more than I like how they shoot. The package I'm selling includes them following.
- stock ruger 1911 commander with vz grips (original grips included)
- 3, 7 round mags, 1, 8 round flush fit mag, 1 compact mag that doesn't work in this gun. All have removable base plates.
- dual mag holster
- mitch rosen ruger marked leather holster ( this thing is super nice and very expensive). It does make wearing this gun very comfortable even for how heavy it is.
- 4 working mags loaded with hollow points.
- original box and associated paper work that came with it.

I am putting a value of $800 on the whole package. I primarily want to trade this gun but would sell it if my price is met. I do not want to break up the package.  More pictures available."
