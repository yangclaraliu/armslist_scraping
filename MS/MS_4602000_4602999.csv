The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC‚Äôs first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1‚Äù overall length and an 18.5‚Äù cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3‚Äù rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

The .357 SIG provides a self-defense cartridge close in performance to a 125 gr .357 Magnum, but from a semi-automatic pistol with greater ammunition capacity. The .357 SIG round has been tested and adopted by many Law Enforcement Agencies as their recommended duty round of choice for their officers to carry (including the US Secret Service and Texas Highway Patrol).
In my research prior to me buying my Semi-Auto Pistol, I read mixed reviews on the .357 SIG round. Most of the negatives reviews cited it was a very hot round that produced too much recoil or too much muzzle flip and also cited price and availability problems for the round. The Pro .357 SIG folks absolutely loved the .357 SIG, many of them saying it was now their round of choice after firing it."

Hey folks posting my zoraki 925 blank gun up for sell. Blank guns shoot only blank ammunition but have the same exact sound/ effect of a real firearm. Only difference is there isn't a projectile (bullet) exiting the barrel.

This specific model is highly sought after because it can fire in fully automatic mode or semi automatic mode with the turn of a dial! It's pretty fun has the same loud ""bang"" of a real gun and has the same muzzle flash as well.

Blank guns are primarily used for theatre/movie productions to give a more realistic experience but I have seen blanks guns used in other functions such as a non-lethal alternative to home protection. Once again, these blanks are as loud and function as a real firearm.

I'm selling this one for $250 firm. It's a neat little piece and you don't come across it often. Included is the original case, a bottle of lube, instruction pamphlet, 1 16-round magazine and 1 25-round magazine and a cleaning brush/rod. I'm firm on price, no trades please.

Back-story is I retired from the Army 6-years ago and 3 buddies and I planned to on an Elk Hunting trip.  Buddy #1 died before he retired.  Then Buddies 2 & 3 passed in the following two years, and the elk hunting trip never happened.  Never a round has been fired through the rifle.  I am now unable to hunt so I want someone who can to enjoy using this set-up before the Obama VA or SSA determines me unfit to own a weapon and confiscates it.  Also, my Tricare medical deductible costs are mounting up and the cash is needed.  God Bless the USA!"

A good friend gave me it a few years back to hang onto, and he's now asking that I sell it for him. Anyways, I looked up the serial, and it puts it at around October 1943 production date. It looks to be all original and unmolested. Stock has all the wartime proof marks and inspector's stamps. It's a four-groove barrel that's VERY bright and has super sharp rifling. I haven't seen a surplus rifle's barrel this nice in awhile!

I never got out to shoot it, but I'm sure it will shoot excellent. Function tests great (the trigger is sweet!) and it locks up nice and tight. Comes with a 1907 leather sling and a front sight protector. I really don't know too terribly much about these, but from what I've looked up it appears that all parts are Remington manufacture. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to look something up for you.

It cones with all of its accessories. Foregrip, 2 25rd. Mags (1 bearcreek and 1 archangel), a single point bungie sling, a foldable bipod, an Allen soft case and a 9x Barska scope with quick tightening scope mount. I also have almost all the original parts, except for the wood stock, if you wanted to take off the archangel kit and put on a classic stock.  I will also include all the .22 ammunition I have left (32 rounds). There is only one rough spot on the gun, (which I tried to show in the pictures), that needs just a simple cleaning every now and then to keep away the rust. The bolts that hold the top of the archangel kit on get a few rust spots every once and a while too, but again a simple cleaning   and oil keeps it away.  If you have any questions just let me know."

I also changed the free-floating firing pin to a Murray's spring loaded firing pin to prevent slam-fires.  SKS cleaning kit is located in the buttstock.  I attached a rubber pad to the buttstock for a little more comfort and ergonomics since I have long arms.

The AccuTrigger gives the shooter the flexibility to set the trigger pull to individual preference without have to pay a gunsmith to adjust it. Also, even when adjusted to its lowest setting, the AccuTrigger is completely safe and cannot accidentally discharge during normal use from being jarred or dropped when maintained and adjusted as intended. A newly designed teardrop safety is an additional feature on rifles with the AccuTrigger. It provides for better acquisition of the safety button and operates more smoothly and quietly. Enhanced accuracy is another benefit of the Savage AccuTrigger, is the crisp, clean light trigger pull allows the shooter to maximize the accuracy potential of the rifle.Specifications & Features:Savage 17 series 93R17 F bolt-action rimfire rifles.17 HMR caliber21"" barrel1:9"" twist5 round detachable box magazine2-position safetyAccuTrigger adjustable trigger pullBlued boltFree-floating, button-rifled barrelBlack synthetic stockSwivel stud & scope base39-1/2"" overall length5 lbs."

Most guns are new in box unless they say used.  If used, I'll send pics upon request, otherwise they look just like every other new model of the gun from a just opened box.  I'd prefer cash but will trade for pontoon or flats boat, but not any more guns.  This is a private sale, no tax and I only accept cash.  If you look like or act like a thug, druggie or commie I won't sell you anything.  I spent 15 years with people asking if this is the best I can do on a price, in this case the answer is yes so please don't ask.  Everything is paid for and I don't need the aggravation of being nickel and dimed anymore.  Factor in the tax savings and these are the best prices you'll find on new guns.  Here's the list:

No other .22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger¬Æ 22/45‚Ñ¢ pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 .45 caliber pistol.

In addition to the identical grip angles, the 22/45 features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making them perfect for .45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train. Also perfect for plinking, target shooting, and small game hunting, the 22/45 is available in a variety of configurations and barrel lengths, each with the same trusted reliability that Ruger has delivered since 1949."

This is an awesome safe for storing jewelry and other items like small hand guns. The model is BF1512, inside dimensions 15X12X13, outside dimensions 20.25 x 17.25 x 18.75, weight 288lbs. This thing is built like a tank with a four number dial combination, but its not huge like a gun safe so you can put this in your closet and your clothes can easily hang above it without touching. The safe can also be bolted to the floor for extra security, but at 288lbs empty its not going to get too far even if you don't bolt it down. You will need two to three strong people to move this. Don't get this confused with one of the cheap, light weight, plastic looking Sentry fire safes you can pick up at Home Depot or Lowes. If you are serious about protecting your items this is the safe you want! The cheapest you will find this safe anywhere is $1200.

In very condition for a pre/post ban import. Was actually in the states during the pre ban time but had not cleared customs until after it came into effect resulting in the change in name to M90 and also the solid pin in order to prevent the use of a muzzle brake. I have already converted it back to pre ban and a muzzle brake can be used and is included. The only ""issue"" is the orginal owner painted the wood front grip. I attempted to remove the paint but it is still darker in color than the pistol grip or stock. I could sand it all down and get it to match but I'm a little reluctant to do that to a 25+ year old firearm. It is in great condition. I had no issue driving the front sight pin out when switching out the muzzle brake detent. I have heard nightmares about having to drill it out but this one came right out. Have all those parts as well along with a few other parts that were orginally included with it when it was orginally imported. I honestly don't have a clue on cash value. I have seen them on gun broker for as high as 2500, I'm looking for 1,500. Make an offer and we can go from there. REDACTED"

I have alot of reloading items for sale. I simply do not have the time in life to reload as I have 4 kids. I took great care of my items. Most of them still have the boxes or cases with stickers they came in. The only item that is not in nice shape is the rcbs bullet puller. I had to cut the metal rod to fit into my co-ax press. It still works great, but someone may not like that it is cut. It could be welded back on as I kept the piece. Some items were never used. Some like the RCBS scale powder measure and the redding powder measure were used once or twice. Feel free to call or email with questions.
