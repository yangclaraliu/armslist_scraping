Sound Reduction: 33dB â 38dB across several platforms.Â â¢Â Â Â Â Provided with a Battlecloth pouch and a core removal toolÂ â¢Â Â Â Â Adaptable to a large variety of firearms with our mounting solutions.Â 
Â  Â  Â  Â The Mystic X was born from a need: the need for a âSwiss army knifeâ of silencers, so to speak, for first time suppressor buyers. The first time buyer is literally overwhelmed with the amount of intel that is currently available. Due to this problem, we feel that the first time buyer needs a choice that will allow them to âdipâ their toe into NFA and be able to have the most versatile suppressor available at the same time. Armed with this idea, we took one of our most popular suppressors, one that has already been adopted by many first time buyers, and improved on it. The Mystic X is the ultimate first time ownerâsÂ silencer!
Â  Â  Â Made entirely from Titanium and Stainless Steel and coated with type âCâ high temp Cerakoteâ¢ this suppressor weighs in at a paltry 10.5 ounces and only 13.9 ounces with a recoil booster installed in it. This suppressor can be âdippedâ, ultrasonically cleaned, sand blasted, or soaked in harsh solvents without fear of damage to the unit.Â  Â  Â Did I mention that it is also full auto rated? Well it is!!! It is rated for seven different calibers in full auto and 53 calibers in semi auto giving the T/C guys as well as hunters and target shooters a large host of options.Â  Â  Â  We have developed a series of mounting solutions for the Mystic X to include several booster options as well as many variations in fixed barrel mounting solutions as well. All of the mounts are available in black now as well.Â  Â  Â Designed with Dual Arc Baffle technology, the Mystic X is incredibly quiet for a centerfire monolithic core suppressor. Although the real treat is the Mystic X performs really well on so many centerfire rifle and handgun calibers. The 7.62 x 39 and the 300 BLK are prime examples of this. Not only in subsonic, but many rifle calibers are also rated for supersonic speeds as well. 38 Special, 357 Magnum, 357 Maximum or 9Ã25 Dillon? No problem! The Mystic X loves all these rounds and many more! Being takedown in design, this suppressor is a favorite of people using cast lead bullets. It is well known that lead buildup in the 9mm and 22LR suppressors is a reality and the Mystic X is perfectly suited for this application.Â  Â  Fixed barrel adaptors and recoil boosters are available at an additional cost."

	Hello Everyone, 
Ive decided of late that I would like to get another Lever gun. I am torn between a 357/38 or a 30/30, but heavily prefer the 357/38 models. I am open to either (or both) if the price is right and fair. I know what I can order them online for with FFL Fees and shipping, but being that it is tax season I would much rather buy local from someone who wants to sell rather than give the cash elsewhere! The main requirements I have for the gun are this:

-Must be in perfect functional shape
-Must be able to mount a scope on it
-Must be the rifle/carbine configuration (no mares leg models)

	Easiest bet is to shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Or shoot me a message on here if you prefer. The guns can be ugly as sin, so long as they function perfectly. But please donât price it at ferrari prices for your VW. I have cash and possibly trade items if you are interested in them. Im located in Norman and would need to meet around here if possible. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

This is a great self-defense weapon, very easy to use, no safety, powerful and reliable.  Its also a James Bond gun for those of you who care about that sort of thing.  It looks sharp and feels good in the hand.  As far as accessories, it comes with two magazines with the pinky grip, as well we night sights (new in package that cost me $80) and two small of the back holsters.  Beyond that I also have a lot of Ammo to go with it, a box of 100 rounds of cheap range ammo, three boxes of personal defense rounds that are powerful and have a special tip.  Several hundred rounds all together.  


I was going to trade it in at a gun show or at the local shop but they want to lowball you on everything.  All in all the gun alone is worth almost $700, plus the accessories and Ammo on top of that.  You won't find a deal like this anywhere else.  You are getting a lot for the buck in this sale.  This is a private sale, you are not dealing with a company or gun shop or FFL.  However I will follow all local gun laws and prefer to sell to someone safe and legal.  Cash sale is preferred but I would consdier cash plus trade, or cash plus partial paypal payment.  I'd like a small 380 like a Ruger LCP or a S&W Bodyguard.  Something small and easier to concealed carry.  I am a legal Florida CWL holder.

You have to hold one of these guns to true appreciate how balanced and nice they are in the hand. The Walther PPS provides a versatile carry package because it conceals so well and changes size based on the mission with 3 different size Italian high quality magazines. 


These guns are made with the finest German craftsmanship and perform flawlessly every time, James Bond always chose a Walther for a reason and rumor has it that Jason Bourne carries it as his real life EDC (I have not been able to confirm this)."

Can a pistol small enough to carry every day have all the features, performance and power you would find in a full size handgun? Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?

The XD-S from Springfield Armory has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the features and power youâre used to in the XD and XD(M) lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S â a pistol that packs so easily youâll forget itâs there.

I love this rifle, but I have decided to down-size.

Accurate, Hard Hitting, Versatile- from 45 Long Colt Light Loads to full-house 454 Casull.
Did I mention it is Beautiful?  Smooth Action, Fast Target Acquisition.
Effect on target is always a treat!  At 100 yards it effortlessly burned through my 1/4"" steel Gong, but was big fun.  At 140 yards I up-ended a 200# Hog.
The 20"" barrel gives opportunity for the 454 Casull cartage shine.

There is a mp5k bolt carrier group complete with a recoil rod that I bought off gunbroker that I had planned to use.  Seller said it was German and was from an hk89 but the carrier and bolt are flush when assembled which makes me believe it was from a mp5k.  It is in great shape and has very little wear also for a mp5k is the front sight with triple clamp.  The lower was one from my vulcan and has the ambi safety levers included with it the a2 stock was also from the vulcan.  Those two parts were upgraded to a3 collapsible stuff and a single sided lower.  There is also a trigger pin and a cocking tube hanger that are new most of these parts came from robertrtg parts and hk parts.  And if you don't want to SBR it there is a pistol end cap with sling attachment point. There is also a de milled cocking tube that is pretty much useless.  Just looking to recoup some cash or trade for pistols or ar parts.  Just let me know what you have.

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, so I will be pretty picky on trades, basically, the deal will have to make sense.  If offering a trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  Below are items I will consider.  I already have several firearms in the platforms and calibers listed below along with plenty of ammunition for all, but again, I may trade if the deal makes sense on my end, otherwise I will wait for cash.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants.  

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP, maybe .357 Sig or 10mm, but may consider others, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag., maybe others.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590 models & 930 SPX), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars, maybe gold in grams

Maybe quality optics like Vortex 4-16x(mid level models) or greater, maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.
