This weapon is intended for civilian and security use, and mimics the famous M16 rifle in its layout and placement of most controls. It is remarkably light for its caliber and size, because of extensive use of modern, high strength plastics.  Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight."

Other Features:	The subcompact Glock 29 Gen4 offers superior versatility with the high performance 10mm round and a 10-round magazine capacity. With reduced dimensions compared to the standard size Glock 20, the subcompact Glock 29 is also suitable for concealed carry. The Gen4 offers a more aggressive grip pattern to allow a more secure purchase on the pistol, even with gloved hands, and the modular backstrap design lets the user adapt the grip to hand size. This model features a dual-recoil spring assembly which noticeably reduces felt recoil while simultaneously increasing the life span of the assembly. The enlarged reversible magazine catch easily accommodates left- or right-handed operators. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment.

Featuring two levels of tactical illumination, ambidextrous switching, a slender ergonomic design, and legendary SureFire reliability and durability, the DSF-870 is the ultimate WeaponLight for Remington 870 combat shotguns. 

This compact, lightweight system replaces the weapon’s original factory forend and features a recoil-proof LED that generates 600 lumens of blinding white light at maximum output, or 200 lumens with twice the runtime on its high setting. The LED’s light is focused by a precision reflector to create a smooth, wide beam perfect for closer-range shotgun applications typical in law enforcement and home defense—with enough reach and surround light to properly identify threats and maintain situational awareness. 

The DSF-870 features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switches on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters. Selecting the LED’s output is achieved by activating the light in constant-on mode and then pressing the output-mode selector switch until the desired output level (600 or 200 lumens) is set. The selected output can then be left in constant-on mode or switched to momentary activation, and it stays at that output level until reset. Every DSF-Series WeaponLight also features an integrated system-disable switch to prevent accidental activation during transport, storage, or stealth operations. 

A lightweight but strong aluminum module protects the optics, LED, and sophisticated electronics, minimizing length with side-by-side placement of the two lithium batteries that power the system. The module has a Mil-Spec hard anodized finish to protect against scratches, abrasion, and corrosion, while O-ring and gasket seals keep out moisture, dust, and debris.

Gun is from 1920 and has a good bore and is mechanically sound. Comes with one original mag. It is in very high condition with only a small amount of wear on the high spots. The right grip is broken. I do not know how it broke given that I barely even took this gun out of the safe but it is broken. You can see the break in the pictures. The grip does not fall out and unless the pieces are pulled apart you can't even see the break. I think you could carry this everyday and the grip would never be a problem. I have thought about putting Ivory grips on it many times. This gun is worthy of Ivory.

The only other blemishes are two small dents on the slide just in front of the dust cover. You can see them in the pics. They are not bluing wear but actually small dents on the slide that I assume were caused by a holster. They are only visible in a certain light and are so shallow you can barely feel them when you run your finger over them. That probably sounds worse than it is. It is almost a non-issue.

(Worth 2,800 new)

The Steyr LP10E Compact is virtually new as I have fired less than 50 pellets through it. I purchased the gun in 2012 right before having back surgery. I still have far too much pain to continue competing. I never used the gun in competition or in training. The grip is a small but I used a dremil tool to make it fit my medium hand. I like the feel of a small grip rather than a giant block of puddy which also adds extra weight. I didn't take off too much. A+B puddy or quick steel can put it back if needed. The gun case is complete with two cylinders, a fill adapter, a complete tool kit with O rings, 4 barrel weights and a manual.

I purchased 5,000 pellets from RWS after they lot tested my gun in Munich while at a world cup. I am including the 5,000 lotted match pellets as well as 10,000 RWS R 10 Match pellets from two other lots for a total of 15,000. 

Note: 7 out of 20 pellet tins from the other two lots are dented so it is possible there are dented or mis-shaped pellets in those 7 tins but the other 13 tins look good. All pellet tins are unopened. 

Also included is a Sherwood Yoke and an Ernest Hill cylinder pump.

I will ship at buyers expense.  Actual shipping price, no handling charges."

IL Residents:
I am an FFL, so valid IL FOID, background check, 24 hour wait for long guns and 72 hour wait for handguns is required. I can not meet anywhere, as the BATF requires I only do business at the address on my FFL (or gun shows)
Please email a picture of your FOID card if you would like to purchase the firearm.
Once I get the FOID pic and we agree on price via email, the mandatory wait starts (since we have it on record at that point). After the mandatory waiting period, you can come and fill out the form 4473 and pay for the firearm.As long as the background check clears you can take the firearm with you that day.
Since I am home based, business hours are by appointment only.

Out of state/shipping:
I can only ship firearms to your local gun shop/FFL.

The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer.

Chambered for .380 ACP. 6+1 capacity.  Pink frame, black slide.The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.Calibers: .380 AUTOWeight unloaded: 8.3 oz.

Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.

This full-length piston-driven rifle is the perfect marriage between the reliability and simplicity of an AK-47 with the modularity and ergonomics of an AR-15. In addition, caliber interchangability allows for shooting the two most popular calibers reliably and accurately whenever you'd like! Changing the caliber is very easy, and can be done within about two minutes using a simple hex tool. On top of all that, the gas system is easily adjustable with no tools to reliably cycle any load or to work as a host for your suppressor! The left side charging handle is non-reciprocating, allowing the shooter to keep the sight picture as they perform reloads. The 3rd generation of this rifle has an improved gas system, an improved trigger, and the new FASTStock with adjustable length, cheek weld, and side folding capabilities. This rifle was purchased, tested, cleaned, and then left in the safe. I have been doing mostly handgun shooting lately, and don't shoot this rifle much anymore, so I can't justify keeping it. Included with the gun is the following: - Original case and paperwork - 1x 5.56 / .223 caliber kit (includes bolt, magazine, and threaded barrel with A2 birdcage flash hider installed) - 1x 7.62x39 caliber kit (includes bolt, magazine, and threaded barrel with AK-74 style muzzle brake installed) - Original black rail covers - Grippod forend (if you want it) - Black ladder rail covers - Upgraded magpul AR-15 grip - Barrel lug hex tool Browse additional photos here! http://imgur.com/8hAuJIo,ONsjGHu,mm6pGaY,kqpS00e,bI8nUwk,gJlCY38,sMRDQUj,o3APz1L,FqvfN2x (Note: all of these photos are taken with the 7.62 kit installed.

From Colts ad:
The advantage of the LE6940P is unmatched. The LE6940P features an innovative Gas Piston operation system. Conventional Direct Impringement systems allow hot gasses and particulate materials in to the interior of the receiver, decreasing reliability and necessitating frequent cleaning. Colt's articulating link piston system runs cleaner and cooler, providing significantly improved reliability and decreasing time spent cleaning, meaning more time at the range. The 16"" barrel on this rifle has a 1:7"" twist rate to stabilize the heaviest rounds and is free-floated from the quad rail handguard. The barrel is chrome-lined for exceptional longevity and Magnetic Particle Inspected to ensure flawlessness.

The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, an adjustable and removable backup sight and a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight and an A2 style pistol grip and adjustable Rogers Super Stock. Includes manual and original box. This is my own personal rifle and I am selling to fund another project.

This CZ is fantastic. Ive only shot about 40 rounds through it. Comes withTru Dot night sights! 

Has been upgraded with a SS guide rod (came with polymer), and a 13lb main spring (came with 18lb).

I will include 4 magazines, three of which are standard length and one fits flush with the butt of the gun. 

I will also throw in 36 rounds of target ammo (I shot off 4 from the box of 40) and 16 rounds of hollow-point carry ammo. 

The only reason I am selling it is because I want to get a subcompact for every day carry.

Feel free to contact me for more photos, I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have!
