The 41 is a classic target pistol and is one of the finest guns ever made in my opinion. This one was made in 1997 from what I can tell by the serial number (UBB8XXX). I bought it from the original owner about 12 years ago and I've only shot it a few times. The original box, two magazines, manual and warranty card are included. This Model 41 is in mint condition and has a very nice set of walnut grips with a great looking grain pattern. Of course, it shoots perfectly and is super accurate. I saw a few of these on the market online, I would say mine is cleaner and has been shot less than most. Mine looks about new even though it's around 17-18 years old. Buyers need to be Fl residents with a valid driver's license and no felony convictions.

The AR-10A family of Armalite rifles is functionally identical to our AR-10B family. Operation, controls, and maintenance are the same however, the AR-10A family is designed to accept early Armalite AR-10 “Waffle” magazines and other magazines copied from them. 
The new A10A carbine is both rugged and flexible. It is perfectly suited to both military and law enforcement duty. It is a gas operated, magazine fed, semi-automatic produced to provide a level of accuracy, dependability and durability that is not found in other rifles of similar design. The A10A provides a perfect platform for all sighting options with its forged flat-top receiver, MIL-STD 1913 rail and forward assist."

179,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4581179,For Sale:  SIG SAUER P250 9mm Sub Compact,"North West/Maize, Wichita, Kansas",$ 400,"Listed On: Thursday, August 6, 2015",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I'm selling a P250 Sub Compact chambered in 9mm, still ""wearing"" the SIG SAUER band, never been fired since factory. Selling because it was intentionally for my wife, but she prefers the clean break trigger of the M&P Shield over the double-action revolver style trigger of the P250.

The pistol comes New in box (only been dry-fired, never even gave it a new-gun bath in preparation to take to the range). It comes with two 12-round flush-fit magazines, gun lock, empty chamber indicator, hard case and sample gun oil. As an added bonus, I'll include one 50-round box of Freedom Munitions 9mm 115gr. REMAN ammunition for you to take it to the range without an extra stop at a store.

SIG SAUER has a long history of reliability and quality, and while I can't speak to its reliability, having never fired it, the gun feels good, and is very ergonomic. 

If you aren't familiar with the P250 line from SIG, it is a modular Polymer Pistol. The serialized component is the trigger mechanism, which can be taken out of the frame, and rather than purchase an entirely different firearm, you need only purchase the frame/barrel/slide assembly, and put the same trigger assembly in to have a completely new gun without the extra FFL paperwork. It's like having one lower assembly, and multiple upper assemblies for an AR. 

If you have any questions about this firearm, or are interested, please contact me:

Evan D. Cell: REDACTED. I will rarely answer phone calls during ""business hours"" as I do not have my phone on me from 0730-1630 most weekdays. I will return any calls or text messages after work.

I also have the factory chokes.The Browning Maxus is a gas operated shotgun. According to the Browning website it's one that has one of the lowest perceived recoil of autoloading shotguns. The gas system is a newer system than the SX3, which shares the same system as the Browning Silver and has been around a while. The Maxus comes with shims to raise or drop the comb and add cast right or left. 

I've shot 1 ounce loads with no issues. I was actually very impressed as most 3.5"" guns don't handle light loads as reliably as this did. I think my favorite part is how easy the handguard comes off. There is a lever up front that you pull on like you would on an over/under shotgun and the handguard just slides off. But when it's on, there's no wiggling. 

The Maxuses normally sell for around $1400-$1500 new depending on configuration. So if I were to sell mine I'd price it around $1300.

SA 1/55 barrel, so it likely was last rebuilt by the military arsenal sometime in the spring of 1955.  The rifle was obtained from CMP (service grade) and has a new CMP walnut stock with very nice grain.  Barrel readings are outstanding - TE1+, ME 0+, well within specs of a brand new barrel.   This rifle exhibits the dark shading of the receiver heel due to the lead annealing.

I did apply 3 coats of BLO to the stock, as the wood was extremely dry, but otherwise the rifle is as received. I have not shot the rifle, but based upon the barrel readings and the extremely tight fit and lockup in the new stock, it should be an excellent shooting rifle.

The Infrared Tactical Aimer/Pointer (GCP-2) combines the best features of the GCP-1 and adds the ability to mount to almost any weapon. The added zeroing functions significantly enhance operational utility.

I would like to trade for a 12 gauge, break open, single shot, shotgun. The REASON I would like to trade is because I bought shell adapters ( 12 to 20, 12 to 410, and 12 to 22lr ) and found out they wont work with a bolt action. They can Only to be used in break open guns. Their is nothing wrong with this gun, I just can not use my adapters in it. I would also consider a single shot or bolt shotgun in another gauge because I have several boxes of shotgun shells in 12, 16, 20, and 410. Please note, this gun functions perfect and yours must also, but I am not as interested in cosmetics as I am in fuctioning. Note, I am not interested in something with a cracked stock or loose action."

https://marshallamps.com/products/amplifiers/signature-series/sl5/

""Designed with and approved by the man himself, the 5 Watt SL5 combo is a more accessible way to Slash's tone, and has been devised primarily for studio or home use.
It has two channels, switchable between clean and overdrive. The clean channel takes you from Slash clean to raunchy crunch, and the overdrive channel nails that Slash-style dirty tone.
Switching down to 1 Watt means that you can have all that great Slash tone at a volume that won't wake the neighbours.
At the heart of the SL5 are three ECC83 preamp valves and a single EL34 in the power stage, with custom digital reverb.
The speaker is one of Slash's favourites, a 12"" Celestion Vintage 30.""

The Gas Piston on this rifle (like others) can be adjusted for different gr. bullets. This rifle is a cartridge slinger, it doesn't matter what type of .223 or 5.56 ammo you use, the Sig 556 will eat it all and spit the left overs 20 feet to your right in a nice pile for you to pick up after.
