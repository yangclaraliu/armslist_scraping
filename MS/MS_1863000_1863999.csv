It has a tang safety, a hinged floor plate & the bolt is serialized to the receiver. This rifle has been used on occasion but remains in excellent condition. The bluing is bright & shiny, deep & rich in color, very few handling marks, no rust issues with some minor pin head pitting only found upon up-close inspection. The stock is checkered walnut with a pistol grip with cap & has a red Ruger recoil pad. The grain & finish are nice, no cracks or repairs & has very few handling marks. Mechanically sound; functions flawlessly & the bore is bright & shiny with no frosting, excellent condition. The RSI Model was limited production run, very few were made & the 250 Savage chambering was only available for part of this run so they are very scarce. See the pics; we show it all so you know exactly what you are bidding on, nothing hidden & NO surprises. Check the feedback that we have earned (over 1500 – all A+) & bid with confidence. The only reason for a return is if not received as represented in this auction. The shipping includes insurance to your FFL.

Sell for 1,100. There is a large difference between the SPS and other models with shorter, or lighter barrels, this improves accuracy. The 300 ultra mag is one of the flattest shooting rounds there is, it has a lot of force at 500 yards. 
    Thank you. Tony."

This is a brand new in box Christensen Arms CA-15 Recon Gas Piston AR-15 rifle with silver finished receiver. Gas Piston operation ensures outstanding reliability and cleanliness. The barrel is Stainless Steel, Match Grade and hand lapped, turned to a proprietary contour and then wound in Carbon Fiber, resulting in a lightweight barrel with the accuracy of a target bull barrel. Christensen Carbon Fiber barrels are three times stiffer than steel barrel of equal weight. The Christensen Arms patented carbon layup process produces a barrel shell that has zero thermal expansion coefficient, which brings shot after shot consistency. There is a Titanium bird cage-style flash hider with defense point serrations. This rifle has a Timney trigger system Made in the USA with a pull weight of 3 pounds. 


The lower receiver is a precision milled 7075-T6 aluminum forging, and the upper receiver is an eye catching proprietary 7075-T6 aluminum billet design with heavy walls and top mounted Picatinny rail for easy and secure installation of optics. The bolt carrier group's nickel boron coating acts as a protective finish and polishes the receiver each time it cycles. Oversized takedown pins are installed for easy cleaning or receiver changes. A MagPul ACS stock is installed, as is a comfortable Hogue pistol grip. The Handguard is a proprietary Carbon Fiber design with top and bottom mounted rails.


This is a truly premium AR-15 rifle.

I only had it a year but probably shot 20-40 rounds through it sighting it in and killing a doe with it last season.  I'm asking $430 for the gun.  I can keep the scope or sell it.  The scope is a Leupold VX-2 3-9X 40mm that I would leave on for $350 that obviously includes the mount and rings which weren't cheap.  I have a Tasco I'll put on it if you don't want the Leupold. I also have a couple boxes of ammo I could throw in as well.  I like the gun I just decided if I'm going to buy an AR-15 I might as well use that for deer hunting.  I'm in St. Louis, Brentwood.

 If you want it cleaned and polished it I will do it for .02 a round.

 I'll ship it to your front door by USPS priority mail. I use the ""if fits it ships"" priority mail boxes: You can ship twice as much 9mm as .45 acp in the same box, but generally as a rule:
 100-200 pcs will cost 5.80 to ship.
 200-2000 pcs will cost 12.65 to ship.
 1500-4000 pcs will cost 16.50 to ship.

 Your welcome to mix and match any quantity of any size. Example:
 500 pcs each of, 9mm, .40 S&W and .45ACP = 1500 pcs and would ship for 12.65.

 If you reload several sizes, than you will do well here, You can mix your numbers any way you want.

 Payment: I prefer PAY-PAL, but I have a store front business and take credit card orders over the phone every day but Sunday and if need be will take a money order. If you prefer a personal check that is fine also, but it will delay your shipment till it clears the bank. 

 Swap: I love to swap. I am a gun enthusiast, re-loader, hunter, and all around outdoorsman. I will swap you for any gun you are not using, or ammo you have no gun to shoot it out of anymore, or about anything else. I like it all. I am a fair trader and will give you fair market value on whatever you might have to trade. All you can do is ask, and I’ll I can say is yes, or no, but it doesn’t hurt to ask.

1.  Savage 10P in .308 Heavy barrel 5R button rifled 1:10 twist.  Comes with extremely light and crisp accutrigger.  The stock is the plain savage stock.  Has a Millett TRS scope with lifetime warranty 4-16X50 mounted with Leupold rings.  Also has a bipod, but i forgot the brand.  Its a nice one though. Comes with a soft case.  Asking $1000 ( will also include about 100$ worth of ammo... high end hunting rounds, some target rounds, and some lower end winchester hunting rounds.)

2. Sig 556 swat edition 16"" barrel, quad tactical rail with magpul rail covers, fore grip/bipod combo.. but the bipod function sticks sometimes, collapsable 6 position sig stock, vortex strikefire red/green dot with 2x magnifier attachment (lifetime warranty as well.. that is also transferrable for the life of the scope) and a tactical case, 2 brand new in the packaging windowless pmags with dust covers, one windowed pmag with dust cover out of the bag, and one original sig magazine (all 30 rounders).  Plus Ill throw in some ammo,, about 150 to 175 rounds of a mix of federal 55gr and CBC M193
Asking $1350 total

3. Marlin 336W 30-30 lever action.  The wal mart kind. Not a ding or scratch on it. Fired it about 25 rounds.  Comes with about 60 or 70 rounds of federal and winchester deer loads.  Comes with the crappy camo sling (worthless) and a soft case. $450

4.  Beretta M9A1.  Comes with one magazine, a streamlight (mounts on the optics rail that only this beretta 92 series comes with) and has been meticulously taken care of. I love this pistol almost more than I do my motorcycle so The price is what I paid for it.  Not too concerned if it sells either. In fact im not even sure why Im putting it on here.
$800

So as I stated, would be willing to trade for reloading supplies such as tumblers, digital powder scales, Dillon XL650 or Hornady Lock N Load progressive press (not the classic), powders, primers, the entire setup.  I want to get in to reloading as a new hobby and I don't shoot the rifles too often.  Make me some offers.
I am stationed in Clovis, New Mexico and I'm leaving on Friday to go back to base.  Im trying to sell this quick, otherwise I wont be back in town until Mid August.  If you want to see how any of these guns shoot, find a god place to shoot and bring some ammo and youre welcome to try them out.

The lower is a Bushmaster carbon fiber in .223/5.56 to help keep the weight down, with a Magpul MOE handle with battery compartment.  The aluminum flat-top upper is a 16"" 1:9 M4 AR-15 Dragon's Head with a Dragon's Head Muzzle Brake (looks like a suppressor, but funnels noise downrange and reduces recoil and muzzle rise for quicker follow-up shots).  Top and bottom rails on the gas-block, T-marks on the upper and an engraved American Flag.  

Comes with 2 new Tapco 30-round magazines, a Blackhawk magazine pouch, and 40 rounds of American Eagle AR-223 ammo.  I can include up to 900 rounds of Federal 5.56 or 200 rounds more of AE AR-223 ammo, an ammo can, and a BSA red dot sight for an additional fee.

For less than the price most people are asking for their crappy used AK's, you can have a brand new American-made military-style rifle that's ready for action.

***Thanks to all the low-ballers, please note that there are about $900 worth of parts in this gun, not including the mags or ammo (or shipping fees, or taxes, or the background check fee).  You can price it out yourself online by googling the various componenets.  Yes, I'm LOSING money on this because my family suddenly needs the cash.  Please take that into consideration.***"

I am looking for the guy who has a car he doesn't drive much and would rather have a gun or two instead.  Let me know what you have and please have pics available.  Thanks

This Liberty Ultra Defense ammo offers a unique lead-free lighter-weight and lower-recoil handgun projectile that overcomes the historical range, accuracy and stopping power limitations of handgun ammo. It is the world’s fastest handgun round with near double the kinetic energy and significant improved dispersion at extended range. These USM4 handgun rounds achieve over 2000 feet per second velocity vs. the typical 1100 fps of other ammo, and they deliver up to 600 ft- lbs of kinetic energy on target. They will not penetrate the Level IIIA vest, but they create an unprecedented terminal effect in soft tissue - creating a fracture profile of up to 5 inches in width and 12 inches in depth! For every box of USM4 ammunition sold, a contribution is made to US Special Forces Charities – so SUPPORT OUR TROOPS while you enjoy shooting the most advanced personal defense ammunition in the world!"

It will come with original case, paperwork, lock, the two extra back straps and three 15rd glock factory mags. Also trigger guard has been professionally undercut to allow you to get a higher grip purchase. I am only looking to trade for a few things that I will list below all other offers will be ignored and I'm not interested in cash. The only reason I want to trade is that I carry this regularly and now that it is summer the gen4 grip is rubbing me the wrong way literally. The gen 4 is about $100 to $150 more that the gen 3 and its worth it for the reduced recoil due to the double recoil spring so I think anyone who trades with me will be getting a good deal.

The reason I am selling this rifle is because I own two SCAR 17’s and have no need for them both. This rifle has had 60 rounds fired though it only used to zero a scope that was attached (not included). If you’re looking at this listing you already know that these rifles are known for their reliability, accuracy, and above all their weight which is just under 8 lbs for a weapon system in 7.62x51 (FN SCAR 17=7.9 lbs, HK MR 762=9.94 lbs empty). As we all know ounces equal pounds and pounds equal pain! Recoil impulse is said to be equivalent to a .556 which also makes this rifle extremely sought after. This uses a short stroke piston driven system diverting gas and dirt away from the weapons bolt or chamber making this as reliable as it gets. Look up reviews on these weapon systems and you will see these are the best it gets which is why our military has designated the military version as the MK17. Of the weapon systems in this classification it is the only one that is fully ambidextrous, has a collapsible stock (making it 28 in overall), is the lightest, and has a reciprocating handle allowing a shooter to stay on target when reloading opposed to having to get off target to actuate the charging handle in a typical m4/ar15 style weapon. This rifle since its introduction to the civilian market has retained its value incredibly, and as you may know these weapon systems were going for well over 6-8k during the supposed weapons ban just a few months ago. I refused to sell during that time and now think it’s time to pass along the joy and privilege of owning one of these rifles to someone else who will appreciate its capabilities. Please feel free to ask any questions and happy biddings."

Mated to the highly refined, techno-polymer reinforced fiberglass frame, the Px4 Inox is optimized for use in the most challenging environments.Together they create a two-tone finish that is not only practical and functional, but distinctly attractive.These features make the Px4 Inox perfectly suited to humid climates or harsh environments.The Inox continues to maintain the proven features of the Px4 line of pistols.The three interchangeable backstraps make fitting most shooters with different sized hands quick and easy.The magazine release is easily changed to accommodate both right- or left-handed shooters, and the unparalleled reliability of the in-line feeding system keeps the Inox running shot after shot.The Px4 Inox epitomizes functional elegance for the most demanding shooter.

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.

The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.

2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

4. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

5. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.

6. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

7. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.

8. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.

9. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling."

Each shell casing has been hand sorted (all Berdan primed brass removed), hand counted, washed in a solution of Dawn and LemiShine, tumbled for 4-6hrs in a treated mixture of corncob and walnut, then hand counted again and put into bags of 100.

Below are the calibers/quantities I have and the prices I'm asking:

40cal- $4/100ct
[200 available]

.45acp- $8/100ct
[400 available- 300mixed, 100SP de-primed]

[500 available]

223- $9/100ct
[200 available]
(Full disclosure: these 223 casings have a bit of discoloration in them, mostly around the neck... However, I'm assuming this is mainly from annealing. That's what it looks like.)


I will be getting more of each caliber soon, and I'll be updating this post as the brass sells.. So if you see it here, it's still available!


If you're interested, I would prefer to meet up, to save time and shipping costs for both of us. I live in Garland, but can meet you pretty much anywhere in the Dallas area.
However, if meeting up simply isn't an option for you, just shoot me an email letting me know how much of what caliber you want, and I'll figure out the shipping details and get back to you asap.

Fair warning: They explained it to me that if you are selling a gun and the guy buying it does not pass their background check then YOU must pay for take and pass a background check before they can give you back YOUR gun. Other wise ol' Johny law gets it. You have to give THEM your gun BEFORE they will process the transfer. It's not just JAX thats how the BATF is running this. Welcome to free America!!

It is like new and in exceptional condition.  I do not have the original box for it but I do have the original owner manual.  It comes with the original 10 round magazine, (1) 15 round magazine and (2) 30 round magazines.  I have had this rifle apart and have completely cleaned it and polished the bolt and other small parts inside.  It all works like butter and is ready to shoot.  It's not just been sitting around getting all gummed up from lack of use because I keep it clean on a regular basis.  I have been getting into bolt action rifles and this one just sets, so it's time for it to find a new home.  This is your chance to own a really cool rifle that is quite unique, hard to find and surprisingly accurate to shoot.  I will consider interesting trades but prefer a cash deal as I will most likely just sell whatever is traded to me.  With that said I never say never so tell me what you have and lets talk.  The cash price is $550 and this price is firm because of the extra magazines that are included (they're hard to find and very expensive when you can find them).  The stock has no cracks and is in near perfect condition.  I am only posting the one picture because pictures just don't show how nice this rifle is...  Best to see it in person.  Send me your contact information and I'll get back with you.  If you do not include your contact information I may not get back with you.  This is a rare and collectable rifle that is not listed for sale just every day, especially one in this condition.  Thanks, for looking."

The shotgun is a phenomenal piece as they stopped making them around 2000 and haven't been shipped into the country since before 1994. This model is a fixed stock, that shows very little sign of wear. This shotgun is featured in so many movies like The Terminator, Jurassic Park, and Snatch, that many people look to models with the folding stock which is a huge mistake due to the recoil. The fixed stock is really the way to go. Also, As many know, this is a one of a kind shotgun as it is capable of firing in both semi-auto and pump action. I have to slim down my collection to help pay for school, and this is a must see gun perfect to add to anyones collection. Cash only, no trades and sorry I am not willing to ship the firearm.

The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

Military style trainer stock that has been beat to piss and half-ass put back together with nails and glue.

I know it doesn't sound like much of a rifle, but I'm just trying to be honest. It is a accurate and fun little rifle to practice or hunt with, or for a complete restoration project to keep you busy this winter.  I prefer face to face transactions, but will ship to your FFL holder for an additional cost if necessary.  I will need to have a current copy of their FFL license in hand before I ship.  

To save everyone some time, I'd like to recap some of the questions I've been receiving:

1.  I'm not going to drive 2 hours to deliver this to you for a purchase price of $75.
2.  You aren't helping me out by offering to ""take it off my hands for $40"". I really don't ""need"" to sell it.
3.  I don't care how many times you tell me that you are an upstanding citizen,  I won't ship this to your address without an FFL.  Period.   A felony is a felony. 

Any other questions, let me know."

The EOTech M553 Holo Sight incorporates many additional features required within the SOPMOD Block 2 program. The advantage of EOTech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sights is its holographic reticle patterns that are instantly visible in any light condition, instinctive to center regardless of shooting angle and always remain in view to achieve lightning quick reticle to target acquisition without covering or obscuring the point of aim. The magic of EOTech Holographic 553 Weapon Sights is the edge they provide to you in close quarter or urban combat zones. The EOTech Holographic M553 Weapon Sight will remain fully operational even when the laminated window is obstructed by mud, snow, rain, or even damaged/shattered, as long as you can see through any portion of the laminated window, the entire reticle pattern will be visible on target with point of aim/impact being maintained and fully functional, the operator can still engage with confidence.

Beautiful piece built and custom painted by members of the VT Mountain Infantry Sniper Unit.  It is a great gun and has 2 30 round capacity magazines -  a 308 w/ 2 30 round box mags means a great sniper rifle hand crafted for performance and accuracy plu high capacity magizines for a large caliber rifle.  Great for target shooting and hunting, although it is military spec and has the looks and performance to match anything else on the market comparible.  Essentially if you are not familiar with such a rifle it is a short barreled Dragonov, very rare and hard to obtain and I have not owned or seen one like this anywhere.  I want to find this a good home as it has a lot of sentimental value and also is an absolute beast of a firearm.  Hope someone can find this badboy a really good home, I am moving to the city and getting a job in a metropolitan area and can not bring this accross state lines so I unfortunately have to let go of a few of my 'babies'.  Also have an extra stock for it and a few other smaller clips. The spring loaded bi-pod allows for the 30 round mags to fit perfectly even in a full out laying down sniper position.  It pains me to say good bye to this but if it goes to a good home I will feel better after all the work that was put into building this custom piece over the past 6 years on and off tours.

Light, nimble, but ruggedly built, the M2 12-gauge shotgun and 20-gauge shotgun are built around the ultra-reliable Inertia Driven bolt mechanism. The Inertia Driven system allows the M2 to digest nearly any 12 gauge cartridge, from 2-3/4"" target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. Benelli engineers have also adapted the Comfor Tech recoil system for the M2. This revolutionary system reduces felt recoil by up to 48% and cuts muzzle climb by 15%. When combined, this puts the shooter back on target up to 69% faster than with any other comparable semi-automatic shotgun."
