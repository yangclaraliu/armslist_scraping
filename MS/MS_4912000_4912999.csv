This is a great all around ammo. It's re-manufactured ammo. It's quiet through a silencer because it doesn't break the sound barrier (subsonic). It's 131 power factor through a 4.25"" barrel so its legal to use in USPSA, IDPA, and three gun matches. This is not self defense ammo. This is for shooters who like to shoot. it's low recoil and is very accurate. Several years ago I was one of the scared ones who thought the ammo shortage was going to last forever so I purchased more than I needed. I would like to sell some off and get some of my investment back. I have very large quantity of this fantastic stuff. 
Here are the specs

I cleaned it but I've never fired it personally. It's ready to rock and roll. Finish is what you would expect from a Maadi. It has a charm that those Iraq contractor WASRs had. It comes with 2 yugo bolt hold open magazines and one other magazine that I'm unsure of the origin. It also has the standard soviet sling. I am willing to drive to meet you. Mostly looking to sell to fund this new project I have.

Why am I selling it. I am a small framed guy and with all the gizzmos it's a bit heavy for me to swing in the house ( home defence use ) A larger set guy or for general all use hunting it's good to go.
Only about maybe 50 rounds have gone through it.
weighs 9 1/2 lbs with 11 shells ( 5 in gun, 6 on clip )
Come with +/-200 rounds of mixed, slugs, buck and bird shot

This thing is seriously cool.
Perfect shape, better in person.
Many of the parts are custom machined to fit the best way.
Have all the origional stock parts if you want to go duck hunting.
Shoots perfect from the hip with the green laser beam sight.
I have many more pictures with good detail I can forward.
Nice piece of work that was fun to build.
Plan on doing the same thing to a kid's 20 Ga mossberg

I really like the rifle a lot, but unfortunately I have other financial obligations that must be handled right now. The rifle has had approx 250rds fired with zero issues. It will come in the factory box with the manual and factory 30rd IWI magazine. Unfortunately, I have misplaced the factory cleaning kit that comes with it but if I find it I'll include it as well. IWI says that their online store will be launching in two weeks and the kits will be available there. The rifle has the polymer picatinny rail under the fore end and I've added a Tango Down vertical grip. It also has a Galloway Precision extended case deflector and double sided, ambi 45 degree safety lever. The safety lever is not installed, I didn't care for it. I'm also including a Primary Arms MD-06 Micro Dot sight on the absolute co-witness AR riser.

The price is $1,250 shipped/insured to your FFL, (USPS Money Orders). If the rifle sells without the sight, I'm going to keep the sight. Please IM any questions you may have, I believe I've priced the rifle accordingly with the extras so the prices are firm.

What I have is an early model, 2/43 SC barrel, matching the SN 3637806 as production date, Smith Corona 1903a3 6 GROOVE BARREL, with bayonet and sheath dated 1942. ***CORRECTION TO PREVIOUS STATEMENT.*** Â After having it viewed by a much older, smarter gentleman than myself, theÂ stock has the open box SA stamp and it was lightly sanded and re-oiled. The circle P is still visible as well as the original stampings. Â We used a flashlight on an angle to view them. It is our opinion, and only an opinion as neither of us worked on this firearm when it was returned to SA, that the rifle is likely a complete original and that the stock was simply lightly sanded and refinished.

It runs on 9mm which is the cheapest centerfire ammo to shoot currently. First $750 cash takes it. We'll have to do the FFL transfer of course, but I'll split the cost. Thanks."

I have too many projects and not enough time.
My goal was to buld a real 1903A4, they only made 28000.
Starts with an real A4 that had been sporterized.  Original barrel was turned and polished.  Bolt was polished. 03A4 Receiver and mount have matching flat grey/black finish, no polishing,  I would expect a grey/green finish.  Serial jumber is properly rotated to be visible with mount.  Redfield rings are probably aftermarket as the are blued.  I have a new 1903 barrel with appropriate date to match receiver that needs ro be installed.  It has a milled triggerguard finished to match receiver.  It has an aftermarket adjustable trigger.
I also have a Weaver M73B1 scope with hand scribed serial number.  It is the correct scope for the 03A4.  Optics are very good, finish  is good with a a few small blemishes on the eye ring.
Stock appears to be a standard 03 stock that had been inlet for a bent bolt.  I'm using a fiberglasss handguard for filler.  No metal parts are included.

I had planned on completing the project by having barrel installed, refinishing metal to match, then completing or replacing the stock.

I would consider trades plus cash.  I will respond to reasonable offers."

Got good quality stuff from e-bay and started loading it. Did not like the way the parts fit so customized it in my machine shop.
The laser bright and the highest output I could find, it is pressure turned on when you grip the pistol stock and is in the rear area instead of the front.
The illuminated crosshair sight is tucked in nicely next to the laser and is a natural alaignment with your eye.
Metal cased flashlight on the nose that works well in the dark on targets.
6 clip side shell holder.
Leather hand grip on the slide feels real secure and steadies the aim when running slugs.
Mounted a delrin custom machined nose which extends past the barrel so you can store it muzzle down Rubber pads so when you lay it down , the sights do not touch the table.
Adjustable shoulder strap on swivels.
Adjustable stock with standard rubber shoulder pad.
Back - up flip sights front and rear.
Extra batteries for sights and allen keys store in grip handle base.

Why am I selling it. I am a small framed guy and with all the gizzmos it's a bit heavy for me to swing in the house ( home defence use ) A larger set guy or for general all use hunting it's good to go.
Only about maybe 50 rounds have gone through it.
weighs 9 1/2 lbs with 11 shells ( 5 in gun, 6 on clip )
Come with +/-200 rounds of mixed, slugs, buck and bird shot

This thing is seriously cool.
Perfect shape, better in person.
Many of the parts are custom machined to fit the best way.
Have all the origional stock parts if you want to go duck hunting.
Shoots perfect from the hip with the green laser beam sight.
I have many more pictures with good detail I can forward.
Nice piece of work that was fun to build.
Plan on doing the same thing to a kid's 20 Ga mossberg

There are 4 boxes of older Mauser 8x57 ammo. All of it was stored indoors and is in great condition for its age. Prices were set based on research of vintage ammo sites, catalogs and discussions, and yes i do know what a ""new"" box of 8x57 goes for. This is more on the collectable end rather than normal range fodder. Winchester 200g $50 IWI 197g $40 German brass $35 German steel $35 Will meet FTF along I95 in the Fredericksburg area or as far west as the Rt-17/Rt-29 intersection at Clark Bros and as this is ammo I will not ship due to the costs/restrictions. The first box is simple to identify, it is a complete red box of 60~70âs commercial Winchester Super Speed 8x57 Mauser 200g Stock #W8MM1. The box is in great shape for its age and has all 20 rounds. The second box is a about a 4x4x1 square cardboard box stamped 8x57 SP on one end and âfor 98k Mauser action onlyâ in red on the top, obviously this is a single box out of an over pack. The 18 rounds of ammo inside are dated 53 and the head stamp identifies them as IMI 8x57 Light Ball manufactured in Israel. Rumor in the blogosphere has it that this shoots well but is in the warm side. The last 2 are German war stock ball ammo dated 44; the labeling indicates that one in in brass case and the other in steel case. I believe there are 15 rounds per box. I opened to check for water damage and corrosion but that was it to avoid damaging the boxes (one already has a small tear from opening before I got them).
