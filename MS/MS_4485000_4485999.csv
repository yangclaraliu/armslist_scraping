It was made in Berlin in 1891 (124 years ago) because of its age the ATF considers it an antique instead of a firearm, which means that even in highly regulated states, like California, anyone can pick one up from the gun show and walk out the door paperwork free.  It's chambered in 7.65x53mm. I will throw in about 20 rounds. This thing is super accurate. You can put 3 holes in the size of a half dollar from a few hundred yards with only iron sights.

Both items are brand new in their original packaging and covered by the full manufacturer's warranty and guarantees.

The Ghost Edge Connector requires no gunsmithing and is a simple, drop-in replacement of the Glock factory connector. With this connector, you'll experience a smoother, lighter trigger pull with complete elimination of the famous ""hump"" in the original Glock trigger. This trigger connector is designed specifically for self-defense, and therefore the pre-travel is only slightly reduced while over-travel is nearly eliminated. You'll experience a clean, sharp break unlike the mushier experience the factory trigger provides. The lighter weight safety plunger spring will slightly reduce overall trigger weight and it does not at all impact the viability of the plunger. I run the Ghost Edge PRO connector and the same spring on both my G42 & G43, and this enhancement is a game-changer. 

Asking $25.00 cash or $26.00 if you want me to run a payment card through my PayPal card reader (their processing fee, not mine). Normally this setup would be $35 incl. shipping. I'm in the Lee's Summit area, but would be willing to meet at an agreeable location elsewhere in the KC metro area so long as it's commensurate with the item's value.

Don't know who made the rings? Comes with sling as shown. Also comes with 4 -20 round mags which I believe are mostly GI. Some of the makers marks are hard to see. They all appear to be quality magazines. Sorry, I see that I photographed 3-20s and 1-10. If you prefer that mix, I will do it, otherwise it will be with 4-20s. Let me know if you need any questions answered. The EBR stocks are known to take a standard or Scout M1a (M-14) and improve accuracy over the old wooden stocked version."

I paid $2,100 for the rifle (plus the additional parts) and have put maybe 100 rds through it. Holds a tight MOA group and has never had a single malfunction. Vortex optics are unmatched in their class and have the best warrantee I've ever seen. This rifle is a modern version of an classic American firearm. You will love it!"

 Emergency Mylar Blanket, also called a solar blanket - the Mylar blanket can prevent you from losing body heat. Perfect for emergency protection in all weather conditions Waterproof windproof and reusable. Will not crack mildew or shrink Reflects 90 percent of your body heat back to you. Generous size 84""X52. Can be used as ground cover or signaling device for air support and makes an excellent signaling device like a signal mirror with thousands of angles. Complete thermal protection from rain and snow. Provides compact emergency protection in all weather conditions. Can be used to prevent and counter hypothermia by reducing heat loss from a person's body. Can be used to cover injured victims in order to help reduce shock. Can be used in a hot environment to provide shade as a shelter barrier. Works well as a water collector and makes a good sun shade. Excellent for scaring away bears and other predators when unfolded and shaken vigorously. Can be cut into a bandana to protect the head from sun, prevent heat loss, and protect the eyes against snow blindness (see-through, works just like sunglasses and can be layered for desired darkening) When sitting between an emergency blanket and a fire it makes a great reflector to keep you warm on all sides."

Recently got my concealed carry permit and I'm finding my current pistol is a little larger than I'd like for warm weather carry. I'd prefer 9mm but would consider .40 too. 

Also open to smaller revolvers. Not interested in Bersa or Taurus.  Just wanted to see what was out there before I bought new. Thanks!

Please be aware of current market prices. Just because you overpaid, don't expect me to. If you're asking more for a used pistol than what I'd pay going online for a new one (FFL transfer included), I will not be interested.

I'm not interested in travelling more than an hour or so from Raleigh.

The pistol is equipped with a 5.5"" barrel just as its full auto variant.  This pistol shoots very smooth and because of the recoil reduction system built into the gun. The bolt actually travels down instead of back into shoulder with normal firearms.  The pistol also has a threaded barrel with thread protector and shoots great suppressed due to 45 ACP already being subsonic.

  The pistol has been upgraded with a Kriss Arms M4 stock adapter, KAK pistol buffer extension, Sig Brace, and Odin Works locking collar.  The Vector is also equipped with a Primary Arms reflex red dot as well as Kriss factory iron sights.  The red dot really makes the pistol that much easier to shoot accurately.  The pistol also is equipped with a Magpul AFG (angled fore-grip) which is legal unlike a vertical grip due to ATF regulations.  The AFG has been modified to keep the shooters hand bend the muzzle for safety.
The KAK pistol buffer tube is Sig Brace specific and allows the arm brace to fit very tightly in combination with the Odin Works locking collar which allows you to set the position of the Sig brace on the tube.  
The pistol will also come with five 30 round factory Kriss magazines, which are not cheap!

I am asking $1700 OBO which is a good deal considering the other Kriss Vectors available either new or used on Armslist.  I am willing to sell face to face or ship to your FFL (shipping can be negotiated). You can reach me at the reply email or text message at 724seven146020.  Thanks for viewing."

Perhaps the first thing you'll notice are the striking lines of the new stock design. The black synthetic stock contains a high nylon fiber content, which gives the stock superior strength and rigidity. Inside, the 783 is a true performance-enhancer, with a dual-pillar bedding platform that free-floats the barrel for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Also helping deliver those inherently tight groups is a precision button-rifled barrel. For shot control, it's equipped with the crisp CrossFire trigger system that's user adjustable to suit your preferences. Every 783 features a steel detachable magazine with a steel latch and the SuperCell recoil pad.
