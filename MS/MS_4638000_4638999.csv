That is why Wilson Combat® hammers are manufactured from the best quality steel to keep that clean crisp trigger pull shot after shot. Considerable attention has been paid to the geometry of our hammers, particularly to the location of the strut pin hole which has been re-located to aid in obtaining a light trigger pull. Experience has shown that our advanced hammer design enhances reliability and the ability to consistently produce a crisp, yet safe trigger pull. All Wilson hammers have been narrowed to provide adequate slide/hammer clearance and some are skeletonized to improve lock time. It is worth noting that skeletonizing a hammer improves the speed that it travels, which in turn reduces lock time. It does not effect the trigger pull. When you build as many custom pistols as we do, you learn the value of a quality hammer. You can count on Wilson Combat® hammers. Our Value Line Speed Hammer offers you a reliable performance at a very affordable price. With cosmetics basically identical to our deluxe fully machined #337B Ultralight hammer, it has a real custom look too. They're manufactured using the MIM (metal injection molding) process which produces a quality product at a much lower price than possible with conventional manufacturing methods. Note: For best results, we recommend using this Hammer in conjunction with #314C Value Line Sear.Value Line, Blued, #445B"

S&W cartridge. Different versions of the SUB-2000™ rifle will accept most double column handgun magazines (see list below). By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000™ rifle can instantly be reduced to a size of 16.25 x 7 inches for ease of storage. The polymer of the weapon is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel. Two integrated Picatinny rails come standard on the SUB-2000™ forend for mounting compatible accessories. The forend also includes five mounting slots per side, configured for various M-LOK™ accessories. The stock can be adjusted to three different positions for shooter's comfort. Each position adds approximately 5/8 of an inch to the overall length of the weapon, with a total extension of 1.25 inches in the further rearward position. The stock includes a single point sling loop attachment, a slot for adding a nylon sling loop (1.25"" wide is ideal), and a Picatinny rail on the bottom for adding small accessories. The SUB-2000™ features a push-bolt safety located behind the trigger on the grip assembly. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by cycling the bolt to the rear and rotating the operating handle up into the cutout on the receiver. The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The thread protector on the SUB-2000™ is removable, if the shooter desires to replace the thread protector with a compatible accessory for the 1/2""-28 threads (9mm model) or 9/16""-24 threads (.40 cal S&W). The SUB-2000™ can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools."

The SCAR is in FDE and comes with a few extra items, making this an outstanding deal (my loss is your gain)! The SCAR is almost like new, with only about 200-300 rounds through it. She runs flawlessly and has the following extras:

1) Geissele SUPER SCAR trigger ($325 value) - Stock trigger also provided
2) LE Version of FDE Grip Pod ($100 value)
3) Angled charging handle ($20 value, assist with use with optics) - Stock charging handle also provided
4) 5 FDE Factory Made (genuine) 20 round magazines (usually $40-$50 each)

This is a great rifle and I'm really sorry to see it go. Maybe you'll be able to use it more than I was able to. NOTE: Scope is not included. Also, if interested, I have a case (500 rounds) of Federal 7.62X61 ammo that I will throw in for $300. You do not have to purchase the ammo to purchase the rifle.

Please note that I will only sell via my choice of FFL to protect me. My FFL is in the Lynnhaven area of Virginia Beach. The transaction would take place at the FFL and if you agreed to purchase the rifle you would then pay the FFL their fee (only $20 I believe). Please do not contact me about selling outside of the FFL. I know the law, but am choosing to use an FFL to ensure a smooth transaction.

Payment methods are cash, money orders, or a certified bank check."

The Spike's Tactical LW BAR2 - 13.2” Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that’s machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The main benefit of the BAR rail is to those who wish to have a suppressor inside of the rail or for those shooters who have large bear paw hands and who feel that skinnier rails are just too small ( the BAR is about the same circumference as a DD rail with the popular Magpul XTM covers). 

Inside dimensions 1.80"" Outside dimensions Picatinny to picatinny 2.42"" 

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling. 

But wait, there’s more! The BAR has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it’s compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it’s made right here in the USA and backed by our LIFETIME WARRANTY!"

I'll try to list them all.. cerakote dark gray kryptek camo, ZEV trigger installed, ZEV disconector, trigger is probably somewhere around five pounds, maybe less. I'm really not sure.  There is a ZEV lightweight striker installed too.  The factory recoil spring and rod are installed, but i'll include a stainless recoil rod.  the sights are Trijicon night sights.  A dawson precision magwell is installed.  and now for the frame and slide mods..the slide has some extra milling done to make the slide lighter and faster.  on the frame, some stippling has been done on both side panels and a modification has been made at the top of the rear of the grip. these things don't really look terrible, don't look great, but definitely enhance the performance of the pistol. 
This thing is easy to shoot fast, load fast, and be accurate with. Included are the pistol, one 21 round magazine, three 17 round magazines, one 10 round magazine, an IWB holster, and a Streamlight TLR-1s.  If you don't want the light, I can subtract something like 50-75 from my price.

This is S&W's premier lightweight, high-power revolver, made for hunters and guides to carry all day.  The frame is Scandium with a steel barrel liner and the cylinder is Titanium.  It has black rubber grips that make it super-easy to hold with no slippage.  The front sight is an ""illuminated"" red sight, very easy to see in low light conditions.

This gun is VERY pleasant to shoot with 44 Special, I would save full-bore 44 Mags for hunting as recoil is stout.  The trigger is very nice and the gun is surprisingly accurate, even I can shoot under 3"" groups at 50 feet with it easily.

Saying this pistol is light is an understatement - it feels about as heavy as a plastic flare gun, but obviously isn't.  Smith claims the weight is 25 oz even with these grips, compared to 37 oz for an equivalent steel Model 29.  

Willing to consider 357 lever rifle in good shape for partial trade.  Trimming my pistol collection and would like a nice little lever rifle.  I've shot about 50 rounds through it and the prior owner claimed about 100, just not using it enough to keep it.

This would make a good concealed carry gun. It carries 8 in the magazine and has a slim profile. It is single action only and is similar in construction to a 1911. It has the barrel collar and can be carried cocked and locked. 

Excellent condition and I can't tell if it's ever been fired. No powder residue anywhere I can find. These pistols have a very heavy trigger from the factory, but this one is pretty good. I'd say it pulls at about 4 lbs. +/-. Bore looks like new, and bluing is about 95%.

This isn't a collector, it's a field gun made to use. For the money, it's hard to find an excellent condition pistol for $200.00.

Price is $200.00 picked up from Midtown, Houston, TX. I'll ship it to your FFL for $40.00. It has to go to an FFL and it has to go 2nd day delivery. Be sure they'll take a delivery from an individual. This is a personal firearm.

Description from Trijicon:
The Trijicon ACOG ECOS is the ultimate sight for both Close Quarter battle (CQB) situations and longer distance shooting where accuracy and pinpoint bullet placement are required. This dual-sighting system gives the shooter a distinct tactical advantage with the option of either the Trijicon ACOG or the RMR Sight. With the quick target acquisition of the RMR Sight or the precise aiming capabilities provided by the magnified 4 power Trijicon ACOG- the shooter has the ability to select the proper aiming solution for the situation at hand- truly the best of both worlds. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the ECOS also features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps.

The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Lightweight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The V9 Lightweight is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip and is finished with Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™."

I bought this for a build I was working on, but it all fell through. This is an amazing flash hider, and the tool is absolutely necessary for proper installation on your weapon. This fits barrels with the 1/2x28tpi thread pitch, and is for the 5.56 platform weapon. The BLACKOUT® flash suppressor is the most efficient design available. The proprietary features eliminate muzzle flash, even on CQB-length barrels. The BLACKOUT® is inherently stronger and more impact resistant than four prong designs, while not being subject to the rapid erosion of closed-ended units. A high strength corrosion-resistant aerospace alloy, and ultra-hard Nitride finish provide the highest level of durability. Military tested and selected. No trades please, and serious inquiries only.

The family of a Veteran brought this Beretta into a gun store a few months ago. The gun was in a cigar box that looked older than the pistol, the gun all broken down in individual pieces. The gun store owner said the Family said that the Vet had fought in North Africa during WWII against the Italians and Germans. The Vet had taken it away from one of the many surrendering German Soldiers of Rommel's Afrika Korps. It was not unusual for a German soldier to pick up one of the highly prized Berettas from a dead or dying  Italian soldier. After returning from the war, the Veteran broke down the pistol and put all the parts in the cigar box, afraid that a curious kid might hurt himself with it. It sat on a shelf in the garage  

The gun store purchased the gun, cleaned all the parts (which amazingly were all there in the cigarbox) and put the gun back together, and then test fired it. Everything worked, and the gun store put it up for sale. I purchased it and have fired it several times at the range. It works GREAT! 

Due to finacial hardships, I am listing a number of my guns up for sale! Don't miss this Vet Bringback with an incredible history from the conflict in North Africa! The gun looks to have a parkerized finish with about 60% remaining on the pistol. Look at the pictures! The gun also has an issue date of 1942 on its side, the date of the Germany's High Point of Conquest in North Africa! Barrel is clean with virtually no wear!!! (See Pic) All serial numbers match up and has the original .380 ACP clip. It is suggested that you fire rounded nose ammunition to guarantee smooth feeding from the clip to the chamber, as was used by the Italians/Germans.  :-)

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comThe Ambidextrous Battle Latch Assembly is Phase 5 Tactical’s™ charging handle designed to answer many problems that operators face with other charging handles and latches. We have truly made this component easy to use and extremely versatile. The ABL\CHA™ can be operated with one hand. The first problem we addressed was the old style 0.0625 diameter roll pin. We upgraded it to a .1875 diameter Stainless Coiled Spring Pin so that it would not fail under extreme situations and repeated abuse. Coiled Spring Pins are shock-absorbing fastening elements that provide flexibility, uniform strength, equal stress distribution and closer diameter tolerances. Coiled Spring Pins provide combinations of strength and flexibility to meet our specific engineering objective. Next we designed it to be truly ambidextrous. We enhanced the assembly by designing full broad contact points for both traditional and tactical weapon manipulation. Left handed or right handed, the ABL\CHA™ guarantees a sure grip no matter the situation. The Charging handle was machined with the left handed shooter in mind. Not just ambidextrous, it is capable of full time left handed operation. It has broad grip grooves for easy gloved hand operation on the right side of the handle and on the Battle Latch it self. We continued to improve the ABL\CHA™ even further by increasing the thickness of the walls along the slide and machining some sections with radius corners instead of sharp 90 degree angles. The Combination of the Phase 5 Tactical™ Battle Latch and the Phase 5 Tactical™ Charging handle made the ultimate combination ABL\CHA™ (Ambi-Battle Latch Charging Handle Assembly). *MADE IN USA*Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: PHASE 5-AMBI BATTLE LATCH \ CHARGING HANDLE ASSEMBLY"

Tuning your gas system decreases the amount of recoil felt. The less recoil you feel the faster you can get your sights back on target. Sights back on target faster equals faster follow up shots. The Spike's Tactical Enhanced Adjustable Gas Block is adjustable from the front of the block, the adjustment mechanism is made up of a set screw and detent locking mechanism. The set screw controls the volume of gas that is directed to the BCG. The adjustment mechanism allows for repeated adjustment while in the field. The operation of the Spike's Tactical Enhanced Adjustable Gas Block is simple, depress the locking detent and turn the set screw clock-wise (screw it in) to decrease the gas flow to the BCG, and turn the set screw counter clock-wise (un-screw it) to increase the gas flow to the BCG. To turn the gas flow adjustment set screw the locking detent must be pressed in, it will not turn without pressing it in manually.

All products are new and in original packaging unless otherwise indicated. We do not accept any trades. All listings are for SALE ONLY. All sales are online only and can not be picked up in person. This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comIntroduction The Spike’s Tactical billet upper receiver is not just another different cosmetic alternative to forged upper receivers but it’s actually designed with functional upgrades that aren’t available on other billet upper receivers! We machine this bad boy out of 7075 billet Aluminum and finish it in a durable Type III Hardcoat Anodized finish. Of course, we cut the M4 feed ramps before the Anodizing process to avoid reliability issues down the road. We also flared the side walls of the receiver to eliminate accidental bolt release problems and we also machined the upper receiver in a way that lets you use the popular Magpul BAD lever or other aftermarket bolt catch levers which most other billet upper receivers don’t let you do. Because of our beefier design, it allows for less flex than forged upper receivers. We also play nice here at Spike’s Tactical and because of that, we machined our billet upper receiver to accept most aftermarket rail systems as well as pre-install the forward assist and the ejection port door. Just like how our billet lower receiver utilizes set screws to retain everything in place, the forward assist is held in place with a set screw for easy disassembly if you ever need to in the life of this upper receiver. Our billet upper receiver matches our billet lower perfectly, but it also works great with standard forged lowers so it’s fully up to you on which receiver you want to use. Get one today and make your next build the envy of everyone at the range!

SPEC. RAILS, FITS SUREFIRE SWITCHWe are a retail stocking dealer. All products are new and in original packaging unless otherwise indicated. We do not accept any trades. All listings are for SALE ONLY. All sales are online only and can not be picked up in person. This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comAfter years of searching for the ultimate Quick Detach method for our vertical grips, TangoDown has teamed with American Defense to bring you the best vertical grip yet. Some weapon systems and mission profiles require a quick detach/attach method for vertical grips and other components. Ideally, this design would require a wide range of adjustment to fit MIL-STD spec and out-of-spec rails. It would also require no tools for rapid, accurate adjustment in the harshest field conditions. It would also be bombproof and light as possible. That grip is now available. The BGV-QD series vertical grip.. the latest evolution of our combat-tested and proven BGV-series of vertical grips. The BGV-QD series features an ADM U.S. Patent Pending throw lever system that is steps above anything else available to operators. First, the throw lever locks in place when installed, and cannot be inadvertently unlocked, if caught on web gear, slings, etc. A simple push button releases the throw lever from the locked position allowing lightning fast attachment or removal when you decide. Next, the adjustment system for fitting ANY type of rail, from authentic MIL-STD 1913 to commercial Weaver type is KISS compliant. Adjustment is accomplished in a flash, with no tools. It is simple, elegant, light and strong. No more fumbling for wrenches that may–or- may not be in your kit while you’re on a mountain top in Afghanistan. All hardware is TYPE III hard coat anodized, or given an anti-glare black Melonite coating for superior corrosion protection. The BGV-QD series grips still feature the best heat and impact modified polymers that money can buy. Our proprietary formulated resins take combat abuse in stride, and complete the mission every time without fracturing or shattering from impact, common with some other brands. All BGV series grips are injection molded from fiberglass-reinforced resin, not machined from un-reinforced brittle delrin, for the utmost in strength. Our grips are designed for use on M4S all the way to 7.62mm belt fed SAWs, and routinely pass 6’ drop tests on these weapon systems. The BGV-MK46 vertical grip is one of only two vertical grips in the US Military inventory, awarded NSN # 1010-01-536-4707. BGV-QD series grips also retain our O- ring protected internal storage cavity, good for depths of 66 feet. This cavity allows for easy access storage of weapon spares, batteries and other combat essential items. Our US Patented pressure switch pocket feature is also incorporated into the new QD series, allowing secure mounting of SureFire (BGV-QDSF) or Insight Technologies (BGV-QDITI) brand pressure switches without messy duct tape, inner tubes, etc. Simply unscrew the end cap, slide out the filler panel, and slide in your pressure switch. Reinstall the end cap, and you now have a secure, protected position for your pressure switch that stays in place. As always, every TangoDown product is proudly designed, tooled and produced here in the United States of America. Our mission still remains to provide the finest possible kit to the U.S. Warfighter.Available in colors: Flat Dark Earth and Foliage Green.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: TANGODOWN QD VERTICAL GRIP, FITS 1913 MIL.
