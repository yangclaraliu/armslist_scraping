Here are the details of the tablet/laptop: ($450-$550 Value)

Two essential devices. One perfect package.

With the performance of a laptop and versatility of a tablet, this 2-in-1 PC features Intel® processors, Windows 8.1 and an 11.6"" touch screen.

The Inspiron 11 3000 Series 2-in-1's components include a 2.16GHz Intel Pentium N3530 quad-core processor with Intel HD Graphics, built on the Bay Trail-M platform.

A convertible-hybrid laptop like the Dell Inspiron 11 3000 Series 2-in-1 bridges the gap between a traditional clamshell laptop and a slate tablet. The screen flips around to give you the functionality of both types of devices, but it doesn't detach from the keyboard.

Though the chassis is slim, it has a good selection of I/O ports, including an HDMI port, an SD card reader, two USB 2.0 ports, and a USB 3.0 port and a full-size HDMI port."

I'm selling it for what the gun cost me + aftermarket add-ons.

Here's a snap of a letter from the ATF's legal department about why this isn't a sawed off shotgun: http://i.imgur.com/pchVmp9.jpg

Short(ish) version is: this Rem. 870 was made with a pistol grip only and has never had a shoulder stock attached. Therefore by law it is a ""smoothbore handgun"". Legally, all shotguns are long guns and to be a long gun it must have a full length buttstock. If it NEVER has a buttstock, it can't be a long gun/shotgun, even if it fires shotshells. No shoulder stock = automatically a pistol no matter what, period.

Since pistol barrels can be as short as you want, the only restriction the ATF has on smoothbore handguns is that their overall length mustn't fall below 26"" overall. This gun is 26.5"" with the aftermarket chainsaw grip I've attached.

Never ever attach a shoulder stock because then this gun magically becomes a ~real~ shotgun so then it's an illegal sawed off, forever, even if you put the chainsaw grip back on! Someone got paid with your tax dollars to come up with these rules, btw. :)"

If you want to to see them bigger, just tap or click on them. Then use the arrows to scroll back and forth between pictures. Once finished, either X off or use your back arrow to go back to ad. We think the little box next to price means they will ship. We think the box with awning to the left of title means dealer and if that box has a green check in it, it means Premium Vendor.

They made the various modifications pictured here, provided a canvas roll bag. The set was then strapped to the ejection seat in their fighter aircraft. A few years ago less than 200 of them were imported into the U.S.

Pix #2, Among the Israeli modifications was to shorten the barrel to 13 inches. Before the importer could re-sell the guns he had to attach the 3 inch simulated muzzle break to bring it back out to a legal minimum 16"".

Pix #3, Nearly all the changes made to the gun were done with pre-existing parts. Note the grip is for an FAL. Forward sling swivel is for an L1A1. I'm not sure what the canvas sling was used on but it is original to the gun.

Pix #4, Close up of the barrel just ahead of the chamber. Note the serial numbered on the barrel not done on factory Armalites. Also the importer's stamp under The Armalite address.(not shown)

Pix #5, Barrel removed & stock collapsed. Package length would have been 13"" had the 3"" barrel extension not been added for legality. Note the front sight, it's for a K98 Mauser!(not shown)

ATF letter about why this isn't a NFA/Class III weapon: http://i.imgur.com/pchVmp9.jpg

TL;DR never had a buttstock = legally a pistol no matter what, period, even if it fires shotshells. Pistol barrels can be as short as you want. Shotguns are all legally a subset of long guns, and long guns must have full size buttstocks. NEVER attach a buttstock to this pistol and it can't be a sawed off shotgun because it's never been a shotgun.

The ATF calls this a ""smoothbore handgun"" and they just require it to have an overall length of 26+ inches. The gun is 26.5"" right now. Don't replace the chainsaw grip I put on with a normal pistol grip, that'll make it too short. It's a Shockwave Technologies Raptor grip.

The kit includes a blowback operated bolt carrier as well as 3-26 round Black Dog magazines which are some of the highest quality AR-22 mags in the industry.  I have ran this kit in 3 different AR15s with no problems, I am just selling because I shoot more .223/5.56 than 22LR. This is a cheap way to train with your AR-15 and you don't have to make any changes at all just remove the 5.56/.223 bolt carrier/magazine and replace with the ones from this kit. The kit functions flawlessly.

These sell for about $225 new. I am asking $140 OBO so make an offer, but this is seriously cheap considering it comes with 3 mags. I am willing to ship anywhere, probably in a flat rate USPS box. 
You can reach me via email or text at 724seven146020. Thanks for viewing."

Handcrafted shelf with a hidden compartment. Its made of distressed pine for a rustic look.  If your looking for a very clever sneaky place to hide your rifle, shot gun, jewelry, cash etc. Here it is.   It measures overall approximately 49 1/2"" side to side, 11 1/4"" front to back and 5 1/2"" tall.  The hidden compartment has a usable area measuring 43 1/2"" wide, 9"" front to back and 4"" top to bottom.  The bottom is covered with a soft automotive type carpet liner.  You have quick access to the compartment by pulling on either the right or left top corner of the compartment door.  The hidden door drops down.  When you close it the hinges snap into position holding it closed.  Very sneaky and hard to figure out if you don't know what it does.  A thief can't steel what they can't find is what I had in mind when I created it.  I use screws to assemble the primary supporting structure .  That along with the way it is affixed to the wall it is very strong.  See the pics.  Yes that's 60+ lbs of concrete block sitting on it with no problems.  Due to the weight of the shelf (about 19lbs) along with whatever you may put in and on it, it will need to be mounted to a solid surface.  I have pre-drilled it to mount up to both 16"" and 24"" o.c. wall studs.  I am including 4 Lag screws with washer for mounting.  To install it you will need to drill four 3/16"" pilot holes and install the screws using a ratchet with a 12"" extension. I custom build these in my Smoky Mountain Tennessee shop.   It comes completely assembled as pictured.  Also included is 4 mounting screws with washers. The gun and wagons pictured is for display purposes only and is not included with the shelf.  Credit Cards and Pay Pal accepted and shipping is available.   Or pick it up at my Sevierville location.  I will build custom sizes.  Contact me for a quote.  Call Text Email REDACTED  Vince"

The barrel has no pitting and is very bright. The wood stock set is in good shape except for a very small crack in the bottom portion of the foregrip which is almost unnoticable. The rifle was imported under Inter Ordnance and is labeled as an SSG-97 on the trunnion. The scope included is not the 4x that is normally seen on PSL's but a 6x illuminated POSP. The scope is missing the battery cap but can be purchased from Kalinka Optics or a similar site. The rifle is very clean and so are all of the rivets. The gas tube has some rattle but nothing out of the ordinary. I would like to stay away from trades and I will ship to legal states.

It also has a manual de-cocker so you can carry it in either configuration while chambered. It has a very smooth trigger reset as well.

Gun is in amazing condition and has seen very little use. The finish is still perfect and it functions flawlessly. It comes with factory box with lock and papers, (2) 15 round Walther 9mm magazines,  and (3) interchangeable back straps. I will also include (50) rounds of factory 9mm FMJ ammo.

Asking $475. This gun typically sells new for $575-600 and used for around $525. The only reason I am selling it is because I am looking to make some money for vacation.
