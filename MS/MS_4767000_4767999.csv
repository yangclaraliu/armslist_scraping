I simply don't have the time to bow-hunt this season. Space is also becoming an issue... we had a child on October 16th - I'll get no use out of this thing this season. 

That said, I'm selling it all. This package is impressive and comes with the crossbow, 5 bolts, 5 muzzy 3 blade broadheads (new), 3 rage broadhead bodies, a broadhead wrench, a pack of 100 and a pack of 125 gr field points, rope cocking device, the hardshell case and the Delta shooting block. It might have a dozen holes in it... Lots of life; purchased it last season.

The package, new, is worth about $650-700. I don't expect to get that much out of it, but please understand that I'd rather store it than be low-balled. Cash speaks the loudest, but firearm trades of similar value will also be considered."

don't let the oddball 9x18 ammo scare you it is available at most shop including Cabelas.
safety also acts as decock.
Bore is in perfect condition.
very minor holster wear on the safety and almost unnoticeable on the tip of the slide.
It has a decent weight to its slim short simple design that make it a great cc.  It can be torn down in less that 10 seconds and reassemble just as fast.

Folding wire stock, bakelite furniture, extended knurled charging handle, with polished rails, bipod(military issue), and currently has a krebs customs rear peep sight. I kind of want to keep the krebs sight($60ish) and would swap in a regular ak rear sight leaf. Very smooth and surprisingly accurate rifle. There is a lot of posts on internet forums regarding Tantal barrels keyholing. This gun has never ever keyholed on me or the previous owner. If keyholing, is a major concern for you we can do a quick range trip before making a deal. Or I could record a range session for you as proof.

Will come with 2 magazines. 30 round tapco sand color and a steel Tantal 30 rounder. I do have a few Russian plums and 1 45 round Russian bakelite if needed for barter.  

Will throw in 100 rounds of ammo to get you going. More ammo available for barter. 

I do have a Bulgarian bakelite bayonet that looks oh so sexy on this too.  Again, not part of this price but could be used to barter.

Would prefer to trade for a nice 9mm DA/SA metal framed pistol.  Or a Ruger .22 pistol (no SR22) or 10/22 plus cash.

To my surprised, when I pulled the gun out of the safe (yes, it is a safe queen) for inspection and pictures, I realized that I kept the two magazines loaded for God knows how long. I would recommend to anyone who buys this gun to replace the mag. springs with new ones.

The MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series.

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area.

The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components."

I am selling my Savage Model 93 heavy barrel rifle in 17 HMR. Rifle is in very good condition. It has a 21 inch barrel, black synthetic stock. Savage Accu-Trigger, and a Simmons 3x9x40 adjustable scope already mounted and dialed in (for my aging eyes anyway) at 100 ads. There is also an aftermarket bipod mounted under the front swivel. The rifle comes with one factory five rd magazine.

In addition the rifle comes with the following :

450 rds of Hornady Varmint Express ammunition. These have the 17 gr Hornady V-Max bullet which travels at 2,550 fps 

A 17 caliber cleaning kit from Hoppes-  if you've ever tried to find a 17 caliber rod and jags you'll be glad this is included!

After market padded hard case 

Thanks much for looking!"
