The original Colt medallion grips are in excellent shape with a few minor marks. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent as well. Mechanically, the King Cobra was essentially a stainless Trooper Mark V and was a heavy duty revolver made to take a steady diet of full power magnum cartridges. It appears this example has been fired but very little. It comes in the original plastic case with the outer sleeve which is serial numbered to the gun. The owner's manual and miscellaneous factory paperwork is included, According to Colt, this King Cobra was manufactured in 1996. A very nice example!
