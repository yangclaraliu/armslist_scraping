This gun was purchased from savage by the army to train the gunners in airships during ww2.  At the time the training was shooting stationary targets.  The guys flying in the flying fortresses didn't know how to lead a target.  So the military bought these from savage and would put the guys in the back of trucks, drive down the road and launch skeet for them to shoot at.  This gun has the correct serial number and more importantly the US stamping with the flaming bomb insignia.  Don't want to sell but will for asking price.  Chambered for 2 3/4 which I like better than the browning A5s because they were chambered for 3in mag.  There is less of these than browning A5s and even less that have a military history.

I use berger hybrid 115 grain .466 BC with 53.5 grains of H4831 and 2.690 measured at the ogive with HORNADY case comparitor 5-26. I had to drop velocity because I was shooting through the 1/2 aluminum gong had made for my .308 190 grain beger VLD  hybrid that does 2667 using 45.1 grains of cfe-223 same round I took too military shooter at LROC long range operators challenge in early March Washington state . Anyway I shot this rifle yesterday in a prs competition . It did well and had a lot of people impressed with my caliber choice and they were happy to see someone bringing the caliber back although I did have an off day of shooting I was shooting with some of the top shooters in the country . The rifle has 165 rounds put through the barrel I count every round meticulously because j won't shoot a rifle in a comp until about 300 rounds to get the barrel close to a break in . Therefor barrel is not broke in yet and recommend shooting about 200 rounds for better consistency and a smaller deviated spread in velocity . I load my own Ammo and this rifle comes with HORNADY dies that are already setup so all you have to do is screw into loader and go . it only deviated .001 up and down when I hadn't checked cases for all the same length but all shot .25 Moa and .25 Moa out to 433 meters on ar-500 gong minimal wind . Also send the de primer with head space already setup . Dies will be 100 percent screw in and starting punch rounds out .Barrel is 26"" 1:10 twist factory barrel in factory r-700 action with x-mark pro adjustable pro trigger that is also modded and is at 1 pound 12.7 oz which is close to the r-700 timney 517 triggers which are at 1lb 6oz . I will also send 100 once shot HORNADY brass with 60 once shot federal brass will send 25 rounds of my load to shoot with rifle . I've done all the work and proofed rifle so someone can Finnish what I've started and show people this round is back and that was the goal in mind . Also more specs rifle comes with bell and Carson stock aluminum bedding block then I needed it further to totally blue print stock to receiver . Stock is torqued to 45 in pounds added black hawk riser torqued to 25 in pounds and night force rings torqued to base at 65 in pounds and rings to leupold optic at 25 in pounds . Optic is leupold mk4 ER/T FFP 6.5x20 power and 50 mm objective lense with tactical mil reticle . Has M5 turrets 1/10 mil adjustment elevation and windage . All components on this rifle are brand spanking new condition no scratches or use marks because they are all two weeks old as of April 5th . Also made a cheek riser with it which has worked universally for 5 different people . But it is made of foam pad then wrapped in carbon fiber and hardened so their is no give and is a bit squared off to ensure proper eye and parallax alignment . Then for added comfort I camo wrapped it doesn't need the wrap the carbon fiber is smooth but It is still cold up here so wrap keeps cold off the face . Anyway thanks for reading this rifle is one of a kind and pretty amazing caliber that I would like to get out there for not only hunting but see more of in competition next rifle I will do is .257 Roberts and you will see it posted after next competition also."

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. 

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. 

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

We like to compare prices with the internet monster seller, Bud's.  They are out of stock on this gun but last sold it for $352 cash price.  On top of the $352 you would have to pay shipping and the typical $25 FFL fee to get it in your hands, plus of course having to wait for it.

We will beat their price by a few bucks but you won't have to pay for shipping or an FFL fee!!  

Included in the box is the Ruger LCP, one magazine, gun lock, Viridian special pocket/conceal holster that automatically turns off the laser, a Ruger soft case, the manual, and the defacto spent casing when Ruger shot the gun.

All new in the box available immediately here in Rio Rancho.

We can refer you to a wonderful YouTube video that shows just how lethal a .380 ACP round can be for those who don't think it is powerful enough.  We prefer the Fiocchi Extrema which has the 90gr Hornady XTP Jacketed Hollow Point bullet.  The round easily passes the FBI test by going through two layers of denim and then goes over 12"" through the ballistic gellatin.  

Get this awesome micro-compact conceal carry gun today!  We will even sell you a box of Extrema ammo for $10 to go with it!  We also have some regular .380 ammo for sale to use when learning to shoot the gun!"

It is extremely accurate but I do not shoot any more.  Comes with two magazines.   This a great hunting or bench setup.  

I will only sell these items locally.  

The 453 takes the time tested platform of the CZ 452 and adds a fully adjustable, single set trigger system.  In addition to the single set trigger, the new CZ 453 retains all of the quality and accuracy of the 452. The CZ bolt-action rimfire rifles are manufactured from steel billets, not tubing or plastic. The barrels are hammer forged for accuracy and long life. The safety is located above the rear of the bolt and provides a positive firing pin block.

More on the single-set trigger:
The single-set trigger provides both a standard hunting and a light, target style trigger pull on the same rifle depending on the demands of the situation. By operating the rifle in the same manner as any other bolt-action rifle, the rifle functions with a normal hunting rifle trigger pull (adjustable down to 2 lbs). If you are shooting from the bench, or have time to set up for the shot, push the trigger forward until you feel and hear a click. Now your normal hunting rifle has a target trigger pull (adjustable to less than ½ lb).

The Sightron is like new with a few marks from the mounts.  Has target dot."

Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?

The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.

The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.

Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

This stock is overmoulded with Hogue's proprietary rubber compound to provide a sure grip rain or shine.  The core of this stock is a full length aluminum bedding block, running from the grip to the front sling swivel.  The barreled action is free-floating, and looks nice.  I do have the original factory composite stock from Ruger too, but this one looks and performs much better.  On top is a Leupold VXII 3-9X40, a solid no nonsense scope designed for taking game.  This is a great rifle for someone looking for a solid game rifle.  Chambered in 270 Winchester, you can take anything from coyotes and deer to elk or moose.  
It's a great rifle, I am not going to give it away, but an open to reasonable offers and trades.  I don't need to sell, simply looking for some cash to fund a custom revolver project.
Before anyone starts screaming at me about my asking, if you can find a used Ruger for under $600, then BUY IT!  Then top it with a Leupold, and a quality stock.  If you were to go buy all of it new, you're looking at over $1200 EASY.  I am open to reasonable offers, and trades.  If you offer me a gun that we can agree is worth $500, and $350 cash, then we're good.  I won't add to my asking for a trade."

Price $1200
Location: Mokena
Other info: I have a pretty rare pistol for sale here. The CZ 75 P06 Cajun Copperhead. This is a run of pistols that David Milam (owner of Cajun Gun Works) puts out on a very limited run. When he is producing them minimum wait time from CGW is roughly 3 months.

The only thing that is still factory in this Copperhead is the slide and frame. The pistol has a full Pro Package in it that consists of a TriPlex trigger system which allows 4.0 mm's of total trigger travel in SA. The TriPlex moves the at the rest position of the trigger rearward only 5mm's. There simply is nothing that compares with a TriPlex on any CZ pistol. The trigger also has a 3 part system consisting proven reach reduction using an 85C trigger, CGW's Type 2 ""hybrid"" disconnector, and Short Reset System. This pistol has also has a race hammer, extended firing pin, new competition springs for reliability, and upgraded Metro Night sights. Last, the entire pistol has been Cerakoted in Midnight Copperhead (a custom Cerakote color) and Graphite Black. The slide has been stenciled off in snake skin pattern with ""Copperhead"" on the slide. Again, the only reason I am selling this is because I am just not a 40 person. If this were a 9, it would be in my collection forever. I personally have shot 300 perfectly cycled rounds through this pistol. Here is a chance to own an amazing pistol that most will never see on the retail market.

The fit and finish on the Charter Arms revolvers at Stratford were the best ones. The others (before and after) are not even close, and I have had several of them. The polishing rivals S&Ws of the day, and is far superior to what I see in most Smith & Wessons today. When you see it you will understand what I mean. This one is also collectible quality, having maybe a half box of mild .38s through it in its entire life. Lockup is tight as new, trigger is sweet in both single and double action. These are tough little guns with a solid frame and no sideplate. Charter beat Ruger to this by about 15 years. This one is all steel and will last you a lifetime. It weighs about 16 ounces even with a steel frame.

If you have read this far you probably are a collector, or else you have researched these and understand my ad. It isn't an exaggeration. The revolver is probably a little over 30 years old, and looks like new.

Contact me through Armslist via email, or text/call me at REDACTED to meet and see it here in Santa Fe. my price is firm on this. You can buy a cheaper .38 snub, but it would be hard to find one better at this price.

If you want her, again for this price come to Jacksonville and I will meet you at a local gun store or range. 

Thanks, and good luck

The Radical Firearms complete AR-Pistol is a fully Mil-Spec AR-15 pistol built using their law enforcement grade upper receivers and Anderson Manufacturing lowers. The 4150 Chromoly Vanadium Steel barrels are melonite QPQ treated for a harder-than chrome fiinish without chrome's accuracy robbing side effects! This same finish is applied to the bolt carrier groups, helping to reduce receiver wear and increase reliability. The bolt heads are MIL-STD phosphate and MPI for quality assurance. The full-length, free float handguard keeps your hands cool and provides plenty of room for accessories. As an added touch, Radical Firearms has included the Sig Sauer Stabilizing Arm Brace! 

Features
•◦Forged, Mil-Spec Upper Receiver features M4 feed ramps
◦10.5"" 1:7 4150 Chromoly Vanadium Steel barrel chambered for 5.56NATO and finished with Melonite QPQ
◦Carbine length gas-system for improved reliability

◦Free-float quad-rail handguard with T-marks

I just picked this up on Thursday April 2nd but honestly
I am only selling, because I don't care for this short of a gun.  I thought I'd try it, but I will stick with a normal rifle.

Pick up a set of your favorite sights, and you're ready for the range!
The sight and fore grip in the 1st picture are not included!  Yes I know I can't have the foregrip on a pistol, it is not being sold that way, so no need to tell me, I am aware of this.

I posted this last weekend and it seems no one knows how to read.  Many offers don't understand what FIRM means, it means I will not take a penny less than $525 for those that don't know.  That's my rock bottom, don't ask! Others are trying to trade a a xds or glock or other run-of-the-mill guns.  If it is such a common gun that I can easily go onto to most online stores, then I am not interested. The common guns that I want, I have and if I don't have it then I don't want it. 

I am really just looking to sell this for cash!!!!!!!!!!!
No sorry but I don't need your 1981 K-car either just cash.
Also, sorry but I shot this for 1 30 minutes 1 day and I marked it down over $150 from what I paid, I think that's fair.  When you add up shipping and FFL fees.  So trust me, this is as good as new, do yourself a favor and save some money and buy this one vs. new!!

I will erase this listing when sold.
Also, sorry but I will not hold this or drive more than a few miles to sell.  I have driven 45 minutes in the past and people have changed their minds, not shown up, etc.  I learned my lesson.

$530Firm and its yours!!!!

$150 cheaper and its only 2 weeks old!

Must have a CPL or Purchase permit for a Pistol.  THIS IS CONSIDERED A PISTOL and must be sold like one.  
You can actually carry this as a open or concealed carry gun.
Although I wouldn't recommend that but its your choice.   
I will delete the ad when its gone
I am available all day everyday.
