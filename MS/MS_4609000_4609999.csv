Barrel has a pinned and welded yhm muzzle brake to comply with federal/mass laws...The bayonet lug has been removed.

2)lower=anderson lower built with a PSA LPK+a factory polished/nickle boron mil-spec fire control group (also PSA)...Extended pivot pins have been added.

upper has 200 flawless rounds+the lower has 0 rounds fired...I will most likely test fire this before the sale because the BCG is brand new.

$675 without the red dot.
$775 with the Vortex red dot. (lifetime warranty)

Brand New Furniture=MOE fixed mil-spec stock, MOE pistol grip (not the k2 pictured) MOE SL hand guard. You will also receive a 10rd Mapgul magazine (not the 10round hex mag pictured)....The Mil-spec tube is used and already has a pinhole to pin a magpul crt stock discretely.

I am selling because I have several ARs

I bought this rifle because the advertisement said “70 percent quieter.”  It’s powerful as all get out but it makes the same noise as my older pellet rifle, at least to my ear.  I can’t part with the older one for sentimental reasons so I’m letting this one go.  This rifle retails for $165 to $230.  I’ve shot about 10 pellets through it.  Hard hitting and small group.  Will throw in three tins of pellets.

The only difference between the compact and mid size is the length of the grip. Mid size hold 10 round mags and compact holds 7/8 round mags. With the x grip extenders on the 10 round mags it gives you a full grip length just the same as a mid size. So you are getting the best of both worlds with this setup. 7/8 rounders for easier concealment or 10 rounders for range/house. Also anyone who has ever shot an apex trigger will never go back to a stock m&p. More pics available upon request."

It was made in 1990 and has been a safe queen for most of its life until I bought it a few months ago. I have taken it to the range a few times since I purchased it and love how it shoots. It gave me no issues and performs as well as my full size Beretta 92FS.

This is essentially a 92FS Compact without a rail, which are getting hard to find these days. As far as ergonomics go, it only differs from the 92FS in that the safety is on the frame instead of the slide, a feature than many prefer to the original design. Has the benefit of having a durable frame, but it's short enough to not poke out when holstered in a waistband like a full size 92FS.

The pistol comes with 1 aftermarket 13-round magazine, and the original 12 round magazine. Also included is the original owners manual, and a soft case.

I bought this handgun with the intent of getting a CCP and carrying it, but decided CC is just not for me at this point in my life, so now I'm looking to sell.

The COP 357 is a 4 shot Derringer type pistol chambered for the powerful .357 Magnum round. It was designed by Robert Hillberg, based on his earlier work on the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon. It was manufactured by the now defunct COP Inc. of 3040 West Lomita Blvd., Torrance, California (COP stood for Compact Off-Duty Police). The double action weapon is only slightly larger than the typical .25 automatic pistol, which made it a good choice for a defensive weapon or a police backup gun.

The COP 357 is quite robust in design and construction. It is made of solid stainless steel components. Cartridges are loaded into the four separate chambers by sliding a latch that ""pops-up"" the barrel for loading purposes, similar to top-break shotguns. Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time. Older ""pepperboxes"" also used multiple barrels, but the barrels were the part that rotated. The COP 357 operates similarly to the Sharps rimfire pepperbox of the 1850s, in that it uses the ratcheting/rotating striker, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence.

The weapon has appeared in numerous films, including Blade Runner, The Matrix Reloaded, and Bad Boys. It was also used by Carlton Lassiter in Psych in ""Heeeeere's Lassie"" (Season 6, Episode 11)."

The user may retract the slide single-highhandedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. The external hammer design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer, and provides immediate indication of cocked/uncorked status. Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.

I just purchased 2 mags ,grips and holster last weekend. Comes with 3 7 round magazines, 2 6 round colt mags, 3 sets of grips, and desantis cozy partner holster, totalling around $200 in accessories. Gun shoots fantastic and reliable. Only reason I'm considering getting rid of it is I want a larger one. Only trade for 1911s. Text REDACTED"

Every single part is made in the U.S.A. It features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, side ejection, an adjustable rear sight, hooded front sight and a grooved receiver for easy scope mounting. Blued steel barrel features state of the art multiple groove rifling.The Henry Lever Action is a classic Western-style lever action rifle, and one of the most popular .22's on the market today. The reason for its popularity is because it shoots great, looks great and is remarkably affordable - about half the price of the competition. The Henry Lever Action features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself. The Henry Lever Action also features side ejection, an adjustable rear sight, a hooded front sight, and a grooved receiver for mounting a scope. The blued steel barrel is machined with state of the art multiple groove rifling. The result is a highly accurate shooter. The barrel length is 18.25"", overall length is 36.25"", and it weighs in at a very comfortable 5.25 pounds. The easy to load tubular magazine can handle 15 rounds of .22 Long Rifle, 17 rounds of .22 Long, and 21 rounds of .22 Short, making it a viable alternative to a semi automatic, and a lot more fun to shoot."

I love this rifle and don't really need to sell it, but I do not have the time to enjoy it like I should.  I have only taken the rifle out a few times and have only completed a rough zero (I have not even set the zero stop), so it is time to let it go.  I would prefer to sell the rifle as a turn-key unit, but will part it out if need be.  Please let me know if you have any questions or would like some better, more detailed pictures."

Packed full of features, the AR-536 comes with 3 picatinny rail mounting points, integrated lens covers, fully multi-coated lenses, and a picatinny mount that can be removed for easy attachment to an AR carry handle."

 The AR-536 prism sight from Burris is bigger and badder and sets a new standard for prism sights. The 5x magnification makes it easier to find targets out to 600 yards and with a large 36mm objective you get crisper and brighter images. The Burris Ballistic CQ reticle is the ideal reticle for both close quarters engagement and extended range shooting and offers red, green and black illumination with 5 brightness settings. Packed full of features, the AR-536 comes with 3 picatinny rail mounting points, integrated lens covers, fully multi-coated lenses, and a picatinny mount that can be removed for easy attachment to an AR carry handle."

Manurhin was the French manufacturer of Walther's until Walther established their own plant (their previous factory being in East Germany).

The only thing ""wrong"" with it is that it comes with Hogue grips and I cut off the front finger grooves section because they did not fit my hand well, but new Hogue grips can be had for $15-20 on eBay and many other retailers.
I'm looking to trade for something a bit more compact since I can really only afford to have one handgun right now. I would be particularly interested in a Sig P938, might also consider the P238 or Mustang. would also be interested in a Walther PPS, and I also like CZ75 pattern stuff. Will entertain other reasonable offers though (NOT interested in Shields however).
Otherwise will sell for $550, pretty firm on price, the holsters alone are a $100 value. FTF Wichita area, have CCL and can sign bill of sale if desired. Pm me or send me a txt to REDACTED"

Barrel is an 18 inch Black Hole Weaponry stainless 308B barrel capable of shooting  7.62 NATO and 308 Winchester.  It uses polygonal rifling with a 1x11 twist rate and mid length gas system.  Barrel has been dimpled by Marvin Pitts of Nefarious Arms to shave some weight.  It's a work of art.  Flash hider is an AR Performance Slim Twisted model that's the same diameter as the barrel.  Again, a slight weight saver.  Gas block is an SLR Rifleworks Sentry 7 adjustable model.  It makes for a very smooth, light recoiling 308.  Bolt is a JP Enterprises Super Bolt and the carrier is a chromed DPMS standard carrier with staked chromed key.  Charging handle is a BCM Gunfighter with large latch for better leverage.  Lower parts is a standard DPMS 308 parts kit but the trigger was sent off to Bill Springfield of Colorado Springs for one of his fantastic trigger jobs.  Breaks neat and clean but not sure about the weight.  I paid for the 4.5lb trigger but don't have a way to measure it.  It's nice.  Receiver extension is Vltor with Vltor sling endplate and staked castle nut.  Stock is Magpul MOE SL again to save some weight.  It fits so snug and is so comfortable this will the be the stock I'll use on future builds.  Buffer is an H3 and the recoil spring is factory Armalite per Mega Arms' recommendation.  Extra spring included in sale.  Ejection port cover was engraved with caliber by Ident Marking Service.  The pistol grip contains a small parts repair kit and extra firing pin.  According to two scales in my house unloaded weight comes in right at 9 pounds.
   Round count is about 350 to 400 rounds and there have been no problems besides a bad magazine.  If you do your part this rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy.
  The Daniel Defense sights and sling are NOT included.  Does include one 20 and 25 round Magpul mags.

763,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4609763,Want To Buy:  Colt LE6902 New or lightly used or Bushmaster patrolman carbine,"Central SA, San Antonio, Texas",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, August 16, 2015",Rifles,Bushmaster,no type,no type,no type,"Pretty straight forward. I am looking to buy either of these two rifles.

Not looking to pay msrp(be real neither did you most likely) You can buy the colt from TSS outfitter for $850 + 30 ffl transfer fee. I just do not want to wait. So my offer is $890(+10 for saving me a 2-3 day wait) cash for new or lightly used on the colt.

You can buy the bushmaster for 650 from JJ gun supply so plus the ffl transfer fee so my offer is $690 for the bushmaster if it is lightly used or new.


Can meet monday at academy or bass pro shop after we square the details away. Also willing to travel as far north as Belton and in that general radius S, E, and W.

If my offers offend you I am very sorry that was not my intention but I am not a stupid impulse buyer. I research and find the best deals and while I would love to support my local privately owned gun store but paying upwards of 30% over msrp + tax is not something I am willing to do.

Background:
I am the original owner, and purchased this about a month ago. As soon as I got the gun I ordered an Apex Tactical forward set sear and aluminum flat face trigger. I had never shot an Apex trigger M&P before, but now I know what all the support is about. I've never felt a better trigger on a striker fired gun. It has the reliability of a striker fired M&P but with the smooth and light trigger pull of a 1911. I put 100 rounds through it and it shot great. Super easy follow up shots. I was originally going to shoot USPSA limited 10 with this but chose to continue shooting production with my Glock 34. This gun really needs to be seen, these triggers really are amazing. The gun itself goes for around $600 with the factory night sights. The Apex parts cost me $175. You could always buy this, install the factory trigger and sell the Apex parts and have yourself a great gun and some extra cash.

And, like all of Remington's shotguns, the new VERSA MAX Sportsman is built in the USA.
