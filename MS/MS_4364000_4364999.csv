  This rifle is built by RRA for the purpose of 200yd-300yd & the 600yd series of firing in the Service Rifle Competition @ Camp Perry as well as the Presidents 100 Rifle Match. 

  It has been fired 30 times, 20 for Break in while using a Bore Guide, and 10 for Grouping. In the Prone Supported Position it achieved a 3/4"" Group with Both Groups, one being a 1/2 MOA at 100 yards. If you like precision built iron sighted Rifles this is it. If you like putting ""tactical"" range ninja parts on your AR15 this is not your rifle. 

 Thanks

I ordered this barrel from barsto a fue months ago. Paid 225 before shipping and taxes. I bought it semi fit and very carefully finished it myself lock up is extremely tight on close. I have exactly 300 rounds through it 100% so far without a failure of any kind and honestly its more accurate than my factory 40 barrel. This is an extremely well machined barrel. I use my 40 mags extractor sights and recoil spring. Works exactly the way it should. The only reason I am selling is to buy a threaded barsto barrel for my new suppressor. This set up shouldnt be setting in my safe and not get used. Im easy to work with bring your 229 and see for yourself. I do have more picks it will only let me put one on.

This gun is not in the best shape externally but works like it's brand new. It has nicks and scratches and some of the bluing on the trigger guard is worn away. At some point in its life the adjustable rear sight was broken and was recut. The sights are usable, but no longer adjust. I was told that the original owner was a security guard, and that fits with the condition of the gun. Carried much more than it was used. Comes with a Blackhawk holster.

The only reason I want to get rid of this gun is that the grips are made for a right handed shooter and I shoot left handed.

This gun was imported by Excam from H. Weihrauch in Germany and branded as a Warrior. The same gun has been imported by several companies over the years and including Excam/ FIE/ Arminius and EAA. this gun is the forerunner of the current EAA windicator and many Windicator parts will fit it if ever needed. This gun has a steel frame, not the pot metal frame that the early Arminus revolvers used.

This was the ARM model that was built in Egypt , not USA. This is not a MISR-10 or MISR-90 made by CAI that was manufactured on crap receivers.  This is one of the last import 100% Maadi's that  that the Egyptians built.  They got it passed import restrictions by selling it in a sporter style with the thumb whole stock instead of a pistol grip.  This is also one of the rarer ones that came with the threaded barrel . the PARS imports had the threads removed  to get around import issues but the TENN imports came with all original ARM model threaded barrel with a cap tack welded on that was easily removed.  This is the 16"" barrel model. This is also in extremely good condition for a Maadi.  It has maybe 200 rounds down the pipe since new and it still has a clean, shiny, factory paint job looking surprisingly well.   It now has REAL Maadi preban furniture on it but comes with ALL original sporter configuration parts including original Maadi thumbhole.   The factory actually left the bayo lug pretty much intact, so it really is a nice,preban style rifle.   Again , this is not a rifle built on old Norinco kits using Maadi parts  ( MISR-90) or a SPUD receiver American built Maadi Demilled kits (MISR -10).  This rifle has been brought back to Maadi Preban configuration. Has 922r parts (g2 trigger etc). Comes with 2 mags.  Probably won't see one this nice , defanged, with all original parts again.  THIS model was built on Russian AK machinery and tooling    The Egyptians were trained by the Russians. The Russians also hung around and oversaw the production of the Maadi AK. The real Maadi AK's are the closest most people can get to owning a real tooled Russian AKM rifle because of the Maadi factory ties with the Russian Military."

The Mechanical Recoil Rod Reducer System is a direct replacement for the stock recoil rod and does not change the configuration of the gun. This system works due to the multi spring intricate rod (three springs) and controls the functionality of the gun. The third spring which is contained within the rod controls the movement of the slide so it never rams on the frame. Also accompanying this system are two separate springs so the owner can fine-tune the weapon for his/her personal standards.

It has a 24"" stainless bull barrel that is chrome lined and fluted with a target crown. It also has a fully chromed bolt carrier and bolt. The hand guard is an aluminum 12"" free float with a knurled grip. There are not rails on the hand guard but it does have a four rail gas block in case you need to mount lights, lasers, or other items.  

With the Leupold scope you can hit steel at 400 yards until you are bored. I had a Nikon M-223 3-12X42 600 BDC scope on it that would hit steel at 600 yards but put the Leupold on to keep the cost reasonable for someone wanting to get into precision shooting. $980 OBO

I am pricing this gun very reasonable so that someone can afford it and afford to go shooting after they purchase it. If you already have a scope and want to save money I would keep the Leupold and discount the gun $150.

I'm looking to trade this for something in .45 Colt. I've listed a few possibilities, but let me know what you have because I might be interested.

I would prefer a Ruger in stainless, but might be interested in something else in blued depending on the deal. I'm open to single or double action, but NO Taurus Judges, S&W Governors or Bond Arms. A .454 Casull would be okay also, since I can shoot .45 Colt in it.

I might also be interested in a Ruger SP101 in .357.

Comes with box, 2 mags, paperwork, lock, mag loader, etc, etc, everything that comes with the gun new is included.

Comes with Glockmeister trigger spring & Glockmeister Stainless Steel Recoil Spring installed. Also comes with the factory parts in a bag.

I purchased this rifle new back in January and have put just under 160 documented rounds through it. It essentially looks new with the addition of a few add-ons. I love this thing and it is an absolute tack driver, but the bug has bitten me and I'm looking to move up to a .338. The recoil lug has been bedded and the rifle has been cleaned after every range session. It is an absolute pleasure to shoot and has no problems reaching out to 1,000+ consistently.

The rifle will come with a few accessories:
- KMW Loggerhead adjustable cheek rest, installed by Joe Ducos of Sniper's Hide ($225)
- Ken Farrell Industries 20 MOA base ($130)
- Harris S-BRM Bipod w/ PodLoc ($120)
- Defensive Edge .975"" muzzle brake ($200 w/ install)
- Savage 110 BA heavy bolt handle; will include the original handle ($80)

I will also include:
- 100+ Winchester cases (once fired)
- RCBS full-length die set

The price is $1,500 for everything. Not really looking for any trades at this time unless you have a .338.  Local transaction would be preferred in upstate South Carolina (Greenville) but I will split shipping costs with the buyer to their FFL.  Note that the scope, rings, and GoPro will NOT be included.

Would be happy to answer any questions or send more pictures if you contact me. Thanks."

If you want the optional 2 extra mags, the Crimson Trace Laser and pocket Holster with the LC9 package, the price is $500.00 for the Entire package
If you want a deal and just want the LC9 with 2 mags it's $400 
Remember this is OFF ROSTER and it's not available new here in our Nanny state.
Don't bother with the famous old question ""DO YOU STILL HAVE IT?"" I will delete the ad from the FFL on transfer. You must have your Calif. Firearm safety card and pass a DOJ check and have 2 current IDs or a CDL and current utility bill.
Serious people only inquire or make your trade offer. Include your contact info with your inquiry.
Please, nothing smaller than 9mm. No Hi-Points or other junk please. I will add cash to the deal if it's something nice but under $800 on top of your trade. Gold plated Desert Eagles maybe too much for me but I will consider and DE trade."

I have installed a Bakelite pistol grip and NOS Polytec Chu wood buttstock to make this an exact clone of the rifle US soldiers fought against in Vietnam minus the folding bayonet. It looks like someone picked the rifle right off the battlefield. The rifle is 22 years old and has been used. Blueing is generally thin on mak's, and as this is patterned after a production military rifle, function is the priority over cleaned up tool marks. The handguard and bluing show wear, but are in good used condition with NO rust.

The rifle is 922r compliant.

This has a lot of features found on AK-47's that modern AKM's omit or change. The dust cover is smooth and there is no clunky scope mount on the receiver. The gas tube is vented like an original AK. The trigger is double hook Tapco's G2 and has a 4.5lb smooth pull. The wood is all original Chinese. The barrel is heavy and chrome lined. The muzzle is not threaded and has no muzzle brake like an original AK.  The receiver is thick stamped 1.5mm steel. This is no flimsy WASR. These were banned from import in 1994.
Included free of charge is the original Mak-90 thumbhole stock for use as firewood or paperweight. An original 1970's dated Type 56 sling is included.

The Polytec Legend is widely considered to be the finest stamped AK ever made available in the US. The difference between that gun and this one is that this one says Mak-90 Sporter on the side and was made four years later in the same factory with the same parts.

The rifle is $850 cash by itself with 1 magazine. I will pay the transfer fee here at Norpoint.
For an extra $50 I will include a new ATI folding and collapsable stock set with rails.
For an extra $50 I will include 5 used once Tapco slab side magazines.

I will also accept 43 US silver dollars in trade.

Communication through Email only. Phone numbers will be ignored. This is so everything is understood and in writing. Have pictures available of your item for trade. My version of 80% condition and yours are probably vastly different. I use the NRA grading scale. I don't want new friends, just new guns.

More pictures are available. I will ship to your FFL where legal."

The wood is an excellent white glue laminate. The code of this rifle is 147 which makes it a JP Saur & Sohn, Suhl. This particular rifle is a d block made in 1939. It still has the waffenamts and none have been scrubbed. The bore of this rifle is excellent +. You couldn't ask for a better bore. It cycles flawlessly and functions flawlessly. The import mark is very small below the muzzle near the bayonet lug. I recently put 30 rounds through it and it's extremely accurate. It does come with a reproduction sling dated 1940. It also has a cleaning rod as well. The wood stock is also marked with eagle and swastika and has the Heer h for Wehrmacht. I have done some research on the 147 code and I have read that all the rifles with this code in 1939 definitely went to the eastern front. Pretty cool to note.

Other info:
I do have about 60 or 70 rounds on stripper clips for it. If you come to me before I have a chance to shoot the rifle again, I can offer those in as well. More photos are available of course. 

So I will offer a few options with the rifle


Rifle and ammo: $500
Rifle,ammo,bayonet: $600


I can ship to an FFL 01 or 03. Ammo will be shipped separate if you choose that option. I can also do a FTF sale with a bill of sale. Please only send me a message if you are serious on buying. I post on here and I get so many folks talking to me for 2 messages and just stop. It's a waste of time. I understand if you need more info on the rifle, and that's 100% okay but if you want to message just to message, just move on. Thanks."

This gun is in excellent shape, and I only put 350 flawless rounds through it.  It's a beautiful pistol, but I have a couple things on my wish list, and I haven't fired this since 2011.  This pistol had Novak's Classic Custom package done to it, see link here:  http://www.novaksights.com/customguns/BHP/classicc ustom.html


As you can see, the package costs $1395 plus shipping, not including the price of the base gun.  The only deviation is this pistol has a 2 dot rear Novak night sight instead of the plain black rear.  I am asking $1500, which is basically what it cost for just the package and shipping.  I am pricing this pretty low only because I am not the original owner, and unfortunately the gun does not come with the build sheet from Novak.  It does come with the original box and owners manual.  Will also include two 13rd mags.  Not really looking for any trades right now.  Price is pretty firm.  Located in Palmetto / Manatee County.  Thanks for looking."
