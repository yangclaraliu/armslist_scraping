Funding a new project. 

The AR15 is a Frankenstein. Everything is mil spec. 

UPPER: Palmetto State MPI 16"" carbine barrel, A2 hider mounted (properly timed), Troy Alpha Battle Rail 13"" in FDE, Daniel Defense QD swivel attachment mounted. 3 rail sections already mounted on rail. 

Upper and lower receiver, buffer tube, BCG, and trigger group are cerakoted in FDE and Graphite black. Inside and out. 

Upper receiver is Palmetto, with MPI tested BCG in graphite black, in great shape. H1 buffer is in the buffer with a chrome silicon spring. Vltor stock in FDE included. Spikes mil spec trigger group in graphite black installed along with all pins and controls are also graphite black. BCM Mod 3 grip in FDE, and Bushnell TRS-25 optic on high rise mount with several extra batteries included. Also including 6 tan M2 Pmags. 4 of them are windowed. I'm also including a Schuster ATaC comp and a basic Miculek brake as well. 2 extra muzzle devices! 

Also has a BCM mod 5 charging handle and BCM short vertical grip included, and a Magpul enhanced trigger guard has been installed.  And a VTAC light mount. 

This rifle runs great and has a few little dings here and there. It's been shot maybe 600 rounds, but cleaned and cared for frequently. 

This kit is worth a LOT more than I'm asking, so I'm 100% unwilling to negotiate. I'm just trying to fund my next project. 

I am willing to meet at a 7/11 30 minutes from where I live. It's VERY public, with cameras, and a police substation 1 block away. Cash only, and must have a driver's license and CCW and be willing to complete a bill of sale. 

I'll email pictures because Arms list won't let me upload for some reason. There's more stuff included that I probably forgot. If I don't respond it's probably because emails go to junk sometimes. Try again. Thanks."

Story behind the sale....Ordered this gun a couple months ago from a dealer who didn't have it in stock but was supposed to get it soon.  He just called and said the gun was shipping to my ffl..  I have since went a different route and shoot 9mm only.  I will meet the buyer at my FFL dealer and the gun will be registered to the new owner.  I will cover the price of the FFl transfer.  If you don't want the gun registered in your name, I will register it in mine and fill out a bill of sale for you, but it will be 50 dollars extra to do it that way.  Price is 830 for the NIB Extreme.

Official RWC Group LLC Saiga AK Upgrade! Comes from RWC with all shown upgrades!

Kalashnikov Concern’s new tricked-out Saiga

This rifle comes complete with a full compliment of premium 922(r)-compliant upgrades for the U.S. market. These rifles have been “converted” and have standard controls and a standard trigger group.

The new IZ132SM takes the popular IZ132 base rifle and builds it into a totally modern tactical rifle that’s good to go with aftermarket and surplus magazines.

Partnering with Command Arms, the IZ132SM features a rubberized pistol grip, modular railed handguard and modular telescoping buttstocks.

The handguard has two fixed rails on top and underneath and can be fit with additional rails on the sides. The design allows the handguard to be removed in the traditional way for cleaning and doesn't require disassembly like some rail systems.

The 10-position buttstock has a compartment for batteries or other small parts and comes with an extended rubber buttpad for all-day shooting and has multiple loop and quick-detach mounting points for slings.

One final nice touch is the installation of a standard muzzle device. It comes with a modern AK flash hider/brake/compensator.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately."

Sticky Holsters allow you to deploy and adjust your firearm in seconds. No bulky clips or straps to get in the way. Our lightweight holsters weigh less than 3 oz. and the closed-end design keeps lint and dust out, while keeping gun oil off of you. Body heat and use conforms holster to your gun, so your holster fit will continue to improve with use. 

What is a Sticky Holster?

Our original holsters are IWB (In the waist band) holsters.The smaller sizes also work well for in the pocket use. The construction of the holster uses the pressure from your clothing waistband to secure both the holster and the gun. They don't come with clips or loops to secure it in place, as the outer ""sticky"" skin adheres to your waistband, undergarments and/or your skin. Since our inception, we have developed these holsters into a modular system, where you can use it IWB, in the pocket, on your ankle using our ankle rig and for police officers, on their tactical/armored vest, using our B.U.G. Pad.

How does a Sticky Holster work?

The outside skin is a super non-slip material that, with a little pressure, adheres to just about anything. That outer material combined with the inner closed-cell foam and the inner liner keep your pistol and the holster securely in place. In the pocket, it works like any other pocket holster. However, when you pull the gun, the outer layer grabs the inside of your pocket. Our modular products use the same ""Sticky"" material against itself to hold the holster and gun in place. In addition, with use and body heat, your Sticky Holster will conform to your particular gun, making a custom fit."

I have it listed locally at 3500 so whoever rogers up first gets it.  3500 will get it to your ffl's door with out the wait that comes with a custom rifle build.  I will consider trades for a good high end optic such as Kahles 6-24, S&B 5-25, Premier 5-25, etc.  I can be reached by pm and open to offers thank you for your time.  The gun is a 1/2 MOA gun everytime out with box Hornady Match 140 Amax ammo unless I drank to much beer the night before

Picture with group is shoot at 100 yards and was a seven shot group at a rapid rate with a silencerco harvester and box Hornady 140 Amax, I have shot many tighter groups just don't have any pictures."

Here is a fantastic less than 100 round fired Ruger GP100 with a really nice action smoothing job along with Wolff Springs. The original factory springs are included and I would install if you wished it returned to original. The double action pull is very smooth and comes in just under 8lb and the single action releases in the mid 2lb range cleanly with no creep.

The factory box, and owners manual is included as is the original test fired round. This gun fires reliably on CCI primers and shoots very accurately. There are no scuffs or damage to this gun at all. You will get a virtually like new Ruger GP100 with a 'free' trigger/action job and the  Wolff springs at a fair value and no sales tax! 

Any questions please ask. All responses will be responded too in a timely way, if the listing is up consider the gun still available."

If anybody knows anything about gun pricing/appraising, your input would be very valuable. 

I have an older model Ruger .44 Magnum Carbine rifle, not sure of the date of manufacture. 
My great-uncle was one of William Ruger's personal friends as well as his personal hunting guide back in the day. This rifle has a message to my great-uncle etched in the barrel ""Presented to....by William Ruger"". Rifle is in pristine condition. Has been passed down from my great-uncle, to my grandfather, to my father, and so on. It has great sentimental value. But nobody to date has been able to put a ""value"" on the firearm. Just wondering if anybody out there could tell me how much a firearm like this could go for. There is only ONE rifle in the world like it. Im sure William Ruger did not go around etching his signature into .44mag carbines and giving them to everyone he knew.

Comes with Beretta hard case, all chokes, papers, everything a brand new SP comes with, etc. Including tax, I paid over $2160.  But, I plan on making someone very happy, as I'm listing it for $1700.  I won't take less, so please don't ask and I don't really want to ship.  I'm discounting it by $460, so that's a pretty good price for only having 14 shells fired.  If you want pic's, I'm taking them Saturday.  Send me your email address.  If you want to know what it looks like, it looks just like the one on the Beretta website. If you've got a Benelli Montefeltro 20g in excellent condition, a S&W Model 60 pro/or just a 60 or a Browning BLR .243, one of these and some cash might work.  FFL transfer in the Sacramento area.  I work near Just Guns, Sportsman's Warehouse and Sac Black Guns for transfers.  I'm in no hurry to sell, so if it doesn't sell now I'll just wait until the end of next summer or early fall.  If you've ever wanted a top end O/U at a really good price, this might do the trick."

In case you don't know what the .22 TCM is good for, this hot little round will penetrate body armor pretty handily as a starter.  It also has almost no recoil so it is easy for any shooter to handle in a handgun.

I will be honest on this one.  I have gone shooting with this pistol twice now and both times I have had a few failures to extract.  I have done some reading and apparently it is an easy fix.  (Extractor or spring replacement?)  My problem is I am not a gunsmith nor do I trust myself to modify the gun in any way in attempts to get it to work.  The gun still operates like normal when it does extract.

I bought it new at $550 at tax.  I am willing to let it go at $400 Cash. 

No trades and my price is firm.  It needs some work, but I don't want to take a heavy loss on it.  Details on the pistol below.

It turned out to be a Diamond trap made in 1911 that has had the barrel replaced. I would rather not make it into a trench gun if there was someone out there who could appreciate it.

The wood has a real nice grain and could be refinished to look nice. The receiver has the normal scratches and minor pitting, but could be polished and reblued. The ODD thing is the raised rear sight. It's a trap receiver with a matte top, but I've never seen the raised rear sight and I can't find it in the internet. The stock and forend have the black diamonds and the forend has a silver diamond on the bottom. There are no cracks, just normal wear.

I want a 97, but I don't want to destroy this one if somebody will take the time to restore it. Let me know if you're interested or know anything about the receiver.

Selling it since I don't have the patience to sit in a stand and wait on Bambi to come to me as I'm more of the scout em out and scope em in kinda guy. 

I bought it halfway through deer season this past fall/winter and had it out a handful of times when it was warm and the weather was fair. It's a 24"" stainless barrel, synthetic stock with their CrushZone Recoil Pad. It is a very straightforward and easy to use design as black powder rifles have evolved in leaps and bounds over the past 5-10 years. No tools are required- just pull the large lever in front of the trigger guard to 'shotgun' the rifle open, place a 209 shotshell primer in the primer pocket and close it up, cock it and fire. It has a quick release breech plug that you can easily unscrew with your fingers and makes cleaning a breeze!

It comes with a Konus brand, 3-9x40 scope mounted with their 'DEAD-ON Scope Mount'. The optic is quite nice for a basic black powder scope and I never had any issues with it fogging up or any of that BS. It took me about 3 rounds to get it perfectly zeroed using the sling I've got attached and does great with either 100 or 150 grains of Pyrodex (2 or 3 50 grain pellets). I used some sabot slugs from T/C and it would hold nice 2"" groupings at 100 yards.

Comes with original box, stock ramrod with palmsaver, mounted scope, manual, etc.

I've also got about $75 worth of bullets, Pyrodex pellets, primers, cleaning shtuff, etc. Pretty much everything you'll need to tune it in to your liking at the range and at least one deer season."

My friend wants me to sell this safe queen that he's had for a couple of years and might have taken to the range twice. It's in excellent condition and I couldn't find a single imperfection in it at the range this past weekend. The only reason he wants to sell it is to get a VEPR 12. He's got plenty of guns and is kinda like me when it comes to liking unique guns, hence his wanting a VEPR since I showed him the one I had.
