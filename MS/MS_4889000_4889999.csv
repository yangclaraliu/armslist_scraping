Each one is custom modified, “one-at-a-time”, by skilled American craftsmen into a precision tactical rifle. The VEPR Rifle in 7.62x54R is the top of the line in Kalashnikov action semi-automatic rifles. The VEPR features: Hammer forged heavy barrel, (including a chrome lined barrel, chamber, gas block and gas piston), 1.5mm thick receiver, RPK front trunnion, three locking lug bolts, spring loaded firing pin, and side rail scope mount. The VEPR is simply the highest quality rifle based on the Kalashnikov AK47 design. The VEPR rifle is based on the famous Soviet designed RPK. VEPR rifles are manufactured at the historic Vyatskie Polyany Machine Building Plant (a.k.a. ""MOLOT""). Molot has been building excellence into their firearms for over 50 years. The 20 inch long barrel has a twist rate of 1 in 9.45"" and the rear sight is the RPK 1000 meter sight featuring both windage and elevation adjustments. We install the USA manufactured ATI Strikeforce VEPR elite stock adapter with Scorpion recoil absorbing pistol grip. This system features a machined aluminum stock adapter that is threaded for an aluminum buffer tube, and a six position aluminum buffer tube. The Scorpion recoil pistol grip has a sure-grip texture and recoil absorbing insert that helps protect your hand from harsh recoil. We add the Israeli GL-SHOCK™ system- the first functional recoil-reducing collapsible buttstock. The six position GL-SHOCK™ feature’s a patented internal spring that absorbs recoil. The auto-tensioner provides a no-rattle fit on the stock-tube. The cheek riser is fully adjustable to achieve optimal alignment with open sights or optical sights. The GL-SHOCK™ is manufactured by FAB defense in Israel with battle proven Performance! The SGM Tactical USA quad-rail forearm is manufactured of HTN/50 polymer, nearly indestructible even under rigorous use. It has four rails that allow for mounting any optic or accessory. The smooth hand-rest area provides for a comfortable grip. The original VEPR steel sights are usable with the top quad-rail in place. The muzzle has standard 14:1 metric LH threads that allow you to use all standard AK47 muzzle attachments. We include a US manufactured tactical spike muzzle break. It is ported on the top and has left and right side slots to help reduce muzzle blast and recoil. Package includes: UTG rail mount bipod with quick release lever and folding legs with telescopic adjustment, SGM Tactical US manufactured 10 round magazine, factory 5 round magazine, and factory manual. The 7.62x54R caliber is a powerhouse cartridge that can be used for long range target shooting and big game hunting. In addition to being highly reliable based on the AK47 design, this is an extremely accurate rifle."

The Classic Custom Enhanced has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. To enhance the beauty of this gun, our master engraver applies an elegant hand relief engraving to the flats of the slide. The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom Enhanced is elegantly finished with Skip-Line checkering.
In addition to the features on the main handguns page, the Classic Custom Enhanced features the following: 
5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy.

The ELCAN SpecterDR Tactical Rifle Scope represents a revolution in optical sight design. The world's first truly dual field of view combat optical sight that combines the best of close and precision fire ranged combat features. The SpecterDR switches instantly from 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight at the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes. Depending on the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the entire crosshair or just a 1.5 MOA dot in the center. In 1x mode, the SpecterDR has an extremely large field of view. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN's legendary crystal clear image. Situational awareness in both magnifications is improved with ultra-wide viewing angles and unmatched viewing in low light conditions. The SpecterDR has half the weight and twice the capability of carrying two scopes, without compromise to mission effectiveness or reliability. The SpecterDR from ELCAN offers the best single solution for both CQB and long range engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use.

I will meet you at your gun shop of choice to do the background check. Buyer pays transfer fees. Sorry, no magazines unless you are LE/MIL, thank your state government on Election Day!"

This is the new Inland Manufacturing M1A1 Paratrooper Carbine.   I purchased it new a few months ago and never fired it.  After purchasing it, I saw something I liked better, now I want to sell it.

Caliber: .30 carbine
Magazine capacity: 15
Barrel length: 18""
Total length: 25.75""/35.75""
Barrel groove: 4
Twist rate: 1 x 20""
Weight: 5lb 3oz
1x  15 Round Magazine
Original box and manuals
Condition:  Purchased New, Un-fired
Paid: $1100 before extras
Extras:  4x additional 15 round magazines, 2x mag pouches, 1x 30 round magazine.

The M1A1 carbines feature many of the same characteristics of the original Inland Carbines and are manufactured in the USA!

The M1A1 carbine is modeled after a late production 1944 M1A1 Paratrooper model with a folding ""low wood"" walnut stock, type two barrel band, and includes the same adjustable sights which were actually introduced in 1944.

The M1A1 includes a 15-round magazine and offers the same common features of the 1945 M1 model. Attention to detail has been carefully taken to produce a replica as close as possible to the original Inland production including cartouche marks and stampings in the wood specific features of the Inland Carbines.

In 1941, with the US being pulled into one of the greatest conflicts in world history, a division of General Motors was tasked to support the war effort.

The result was firearm history with Inland Manufacturing becoming one of the largest gun manufacturers in the US, producing nearly 3 million firearms in less than 5 years.

The most notable of Inland's firearm production was the .30 Caliber M1 carbine and the folding stock variant, the M1A1 Paratrooper model.

Dayton, Ohio was home for the original Inland company, and is now the home of the new Inland Manufacturing located just two miles from the original facility. Today's Inland Manufacturing is now producing a new line of .30 caliber M1 carbines and 1911 style pistols.

The Smith & Wesson Shield incorporates the design features of the highly successful M&P line of firearms. Extremely thin and lightweight design.  Single sided thumb safety and slide stop maximize slimness. M&P's patented take down lever and sear deactivation system allows for disassembly without pulling the trigger.

For sale is a really cool Century Arms Micro Draco AK47 pistol. This is the smallest AK pistol ever produced, and Century Arms has stopped manufacturing them, so it is a rare find. Super fun little gun, works flawlessly, and is a real ""head turner"" at the range. Price is FIRM at $650, anything less and I'd rather keep it. Comes with one steel 30rd  magazine. NO TRADES

It does have the German wrighting on it & 3 Chinese stamps, I seen 1 on internet & the guy wanted $22,000 it must have been an original 1800s version. I've been told this belongs in a museum, it looks like new. I've been asked about matching number, the only number I can find is 314. I need$1,600 for it. It books for $2500"

It has been fired exactly 28 times. The gun has been well kept in storage for about 3 years. As you can see in the pictures, there is no wear on the weapon. This rifle would have a lot more wear on it if I lived near a range where I could spend more time enjoying it.

 I mounted an old Bushnell Sportster scope on it and the rifle was very, very accurate. Currently sighted to 150 yards. I have very, very little experience with rifles of any type and I was able to easily shoot 2"" groups of 3 rounds with the rifle resting on a table. Because I live in the city, I really only have time for indoor pistol ranges. That brings me to why I am selling this very nice rifle. It is just sitting in my safe and I would rather use the money elsewhere. I have made absolutely no modifications to the weapon and I have to say, the trigger is very, very impressive. Crisp, light and fun to shoot.

 I bought the rifle because I wanted something that was accurate enough for long distance plinking, but reliable and light enough to hunt or defend my property with. I think this rifle fits well for those purposes and will make a like minded owner very happy.

 Cash offers are preferred but, if you have a legitimate trade for a modern, semi auto handgun, I will definitely consider it. I'm not looking for anything that has been customized or altered in any way. Again, cash is preferred. I have two factory magazines and a sling that are included in the price. 

My asking price is $200 less than I paid for the weapon and, includes the magazines, hard case, sling and scope. Serious offers from serious buyers only, please. Thank you for reading, and happy thanksgiving!"

Each has a top-loading five-round magazine. Rear sights are adjustable for elevation and outfitted with range marks in meters. Front sights are military post-and-globe style.

It is US PROPERTY marked as it was used in the lend/lease program with the British during WWII. It is not date stamped as many of these Savage Enfield's are, based off its serial I believe its a late 1943 or early 1944 .

The rifle is numbers matching (even the 10 round magazine!)  besides the stock forend. I believe it was replaced at arsenal refinish before being dunked in cosmoline. It is savage stamped along with all the little parts on the rifle. The bore and muzzle are in good shape. 

When I received the rife it was absolutely saturated in cosmoline (storage grease). I removed the cosmoline from the rifle and treated the stock in gunstock oil and the metal in Barricade oil to preserve it, that's it. I've never fired it, never found the time to do so. 

Great rifle for the money and cool to own such a piece of history. I am selling because I have too many C&R rifles to be able to enjoy them all, it's time to thin the collection...  I have a 20 round box of .303 British that I will throw in. 

I will ship the rifle to a C&R holder for $35. Local pickup you will provide a copy of your drivers license for my records. Cash or USPS money order only.

Open to reasonable offers (these go for near $500 on Gunbroker, I don't like the hassle of GB). No trades."

Asking 390.00 firm it is well worth it.
