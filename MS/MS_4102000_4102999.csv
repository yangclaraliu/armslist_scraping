You must be 21 or older, produce a CHL or TDL, be a legal owner, non-felon, and sign a Bill of Sale that I will provide.

Price is firm. If I receive no ‘I want it’ responses, then clearly I will need to lower the price if I want to sell it. I will do so if necessary. And if you see this listing, the gun is still available.

Folks, if you don't have the money and or need to ask your spouse, for the love of all that is holy, be adult enough to repress the urge to say ""I'll take it""; you'll save us both a lot of time as you dance out of your commitment for the next week.

I am really easy to deal with if you honor your commitment. But over the last month, far too many of you guys have said ""I want it - please hold it for me until Saturday""...and I've done that, only to be told Saturday that a) your wife is unhappy, b) your daughter is in the Emergency room, c) your car engine blew up, d) well ""something came up"".

So here's the deal: If you commit, then call me Saturday morning with some weasley excuse because you don't want to drive from Katy, then I'm going to add your phone number, email and name to the top of this listing.

Do we understand?"

I bought this pistol brand new from a local gun shop and have never fired it. It is in the new blue anodized finish that is really hard to find. It includes the original box, spare magazine, manual, soft case and lock as it came from the factory. I'll also throw in 400 rounds of .22 LR hollow point ammo for the lucky buyer who comes through at the asking price. I paid $429 for it and am asking $350.00 for it. I don't really have to sell it, but I am looking at another gun and looking to sell a couple I have now.

Invented in the late 1850s by Benjamin Tyler Henry, this revolutionary lever action repeating rifle was the most important firearm of its time and went on to become the most legendary American firearm of all time. Patented in 1860 and first used during the Civil War, the rifle’s rapid fire capability and high-capacity tubular magazine stood in amazing contrast to its single-shot musket counterpart. It became known as the rifle you could “load on Sunday and shoot all week long.” After the war, the Henry rifle headed west and went on to play a significant role in the homesteading of that great frontier.
Now, the Original Henry Rifle is back in all its American-made glory.
The Original Henry Rifle is virtually identical to its history-making forerunner in all aspects. The only exception: it is a .44-40 caliber. The 1860 version was made in caliber .44 Rimfire, also invented by Benjamin Tyler Henry, but long an obsolete cartridge. Every other facet remains true to its inventor, and each gun’s serial number begins with the initials BTH in his honor.
Made with the same American pride and attention to detail as all Henry Repeating Arms rifles, the Original Henry Rifle features a hardened brass receiver with the same tensile and yield strength as steel; a one piece, 24 1/2 inch octagonal barrel/tubular feed; a genuine American fancy walnut buttstock and a classic folding ladder rear sight paired with a traditional blade front sight.

I had assumed it was a stainless model, however, after speaking to the Custom Shop Director and Senior Gunsmith at SIG SAUER learned it is in fact a low-glare nickel variant of which very few were ever produced. As you can see it does not have the contrasting controls as the models produced today, instead it is all nickel.

It is super clean, functionally flawless, and remarkably accurate. No stains, scratches, or blemishes of any kind. If it is not a rare piece, it is certainly hard to find. Zero defects. Comes with hard plastic carry case and three factory mags."

	Hey everyone, 
	I recently got a great deal on some really awesome 45 defense/carry ammo. These usually run $45-50 per box of 50 so when i saw them at this price i bought a bunch for myself, friends, and to list on the group. Check out the reviews and videos online to see how awesome this stuff really is. Here is what I have on hand:
-7X 50rd boxes of Winchester Ranger T-Series 230gr +P $45 ACP-$35 each

	When you check these out look at the comparison of these to the black talon rounds. The consensus that i could find is that these are the “new and improved” “talon” round marketed as a “T-Series” instead of a talon. The physical characteristics and multiple tests seem to support this as well, so take it as you will! haha. 

	In terms of trades, the only thing I would really consider would be for HP 7.62x39 ammo (at what i can find it for price wise online) or towards certain pistol (tokarev chambered pistols, 38 +P revolvers, etc) or possibly other rifles or shotguns. No blackpowder or 22LR please. Need to meet up in Norman on these if possible due to my schedule. To pick some up shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here and we can go from there.
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

Comes with lock , box , a box or hornady critical defense , a box of buffalo bore +p jhp locking key and snap caps . No hurry to trade . I love the gun, I'm just wanting a new rifle 


Next Up for trade / sell is my lightly used glock 27 . It says Od but it looks more tan to me . Looks good with hardly any holster wear .
Great gun . I was thinking about using it for conceal carry but I think I'm just going to stick with my 23.
Shoots like a dream , this was my first sub compact so I didn't really know what to expect but it shoots very well .
I'm in no hurry at all to sell or trade, I'm just seeing what offers I get . It uses the same magazines as the 22 or 23 making it a decent back up gun if you're in that caliber .

Comes with 3 nine round mags (  with finger extension ) , different grips , a kydex holster and the manuals . Can add a black hawk paddle button retention holster .

Back in the day, before the Feds screwed things up, firearms manufacturers were commissioned by departments stores to make firearms for them under their brand name to sell to their customers (ie. Sears, JC Penney, Wards, etc.). Some of these were high quality rifles produced from world renowned companies such as FN of Belgium, Husqvarna of Sweden, Heym of Germany, and Voere of Austria just to name a few. This particular rifle is in very good condition and does not appear to have been used very much. These receivers stay more true to the original Mauser design in that they are of the ""C"" cut and not the ""H"" cut as seen by other companies in an attempt to ease manufacturing. To the best of my knowledge, the only thing not original to this rifle is the recoil pad. The stock does not appear to have been shortened, so if one chose to do so, they could replace it with an original pad. $460. Located in Enterprise."

The upper is a PSA mid length chambered in 5.56 with 1/7 twist and a YHM Phantom muzzle brake. It has FDE Magpul MOE stock and grips w/ Magpul flashlight mount holding a 600 lumen Streamlight Protac HL flash light, FDE Magpul rear flip up sight and a FDE knockoff Aimpoint Micro T-1 with red/green dot which surprisingly holds up just as good as the real one as you can see in the photo below, only without the price tag. It worked so well I actually ordered another in black. I've only put exactly 90rds through it since completion. Included with the rifle will be 7 FDE Magpul 30rd mags, a Plano all weather locking case cut to hold the rifle, 3 rifle mags, a pistol and 2 pistol mags, and 150rds of 5.56 FMJ. All together I have about $1200 invested in this build. I love this rifle, it runs flawless and shoots really tight groups, but I love my AK's more. That is the only reason for selling. My asking price is FIRM at $950 so please serious buyers/traders with cash in hand only."

I just registered and I am not sure I am doing any of this correctly. If I'm not Please feel free to let me know, Thanks! 
 I just saw a post from a guy looking for a stock for his short Turkish rifle. Maybe y'all can help me out and I can help him out as well. I just purchased six of the models that I listed in the ""subject line"" of this post. I also purchased one barrel only, no stock/wood. 
 Here's what I have: these rifles have been rendered inoperable, a bead has been welded on part of the bolt so that none of them function. They are in nice shape, and I say this only based on many pictures that I have viewed on the internet, wood is very solid and the sights are all nice and function well. 
 I own several guns yet none of them are old with any history like these Turkish rifles. I am wondering if these rifles might help someone that collects, restores, shoots, or otherwise has interest in them. I bought these from a guy clearing out a storage facility. They have been on display in a Famous bar here in Colorado Springs for many many years. Meadow Muffins was the name of the bar in what used to be called Old Colorado City. 
 As I tried to learn about them I found your site, read many of the posts about these and similar Turkish/Mauser style rifles and decided this was the place to ask for help and maybe help someone looking for parts. Y'all sound very knowledgeable. 
 I will try to post pictures, hopefully I can make that work! I'd sure like for y'all to see these so that maybe they might help someone out. They would make cool fireplace mantle hangers, man cave decorations yet I don't want to start cleaning them up until I try to find folks that could use them. 
 I also ended up with a French 44 cal/8mm revolver and another bolt action MAS? If these would help anyone let me know. Be glad to send additional photos. Just let me know what you'd like to see. I'm not trying to get people to bid against each other with my email to the people that contacted me. I just do not know what I have, make an offer and I will take the first and best offer, that's all. I want someone to make good use of these.
 Thanks to all of you in advance and if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions Please feel free to let me know!

The Diamondback—loaded with features! First, the solid one-piece aircraft-grade aluminum alloy construction makes the Diamondback riflescope virtually indestructible and highly resistant to magnum recoil. Argon purging puts waterproof and fogproof performance on the agenda, and advanced fully multi-coated optics raise an eyebrow when crystal clear, tack-sharp images appear in the crosshairs. Look for all this and more in a riflescope you'd expect to cost quite a bit more-but doesn't. We can live with that.

Williams Fire Sights with Click Adjustable rear sight.

The Trigger is NICE! Hardly any creep and a smooth crisp break, the guide rod adds a little weight in the front to keep muzzle flip during recoil down, the extended slide stop provides a ledge to drop the slide. Comes with 2 15 round mags.

Yes I'm aware the front light pipe is broke, I just installed them today, knocked the slide over and broke it. Replacement pipes can be ordered. I did heat up the spot it broke with a lighter to hold it in place.

I'm looking for an SKS only! If it isn't around my trade value I'll take ammo in difference if it isnt the same!

Also have 20 rounds of Hornady 180gr JHP I can include for $20 worth of 7.62x39mm, which should be around 4 boxes of Tula.

This piece was built using extremely high quality components.

Operationally, it has a much higher cycling rate than a normal AR15, due to a light-weight Adams Arms bolt carrier group, and a buffer spring that retains mil-spec resistance.  The lower mass BCG is driven back faster than a heavy one is when the same force is applied (from the gas piston).  Similarly, the strong spring pushes a lighter weight group back faster than it would a heavy one.  

In order to take full advantage of this arrangement, you will need high quality magazines that can feed at that high cycling rate (Magpul PMAGs work extremely well) and a trigger that will allow you to perform successive shots rapidly.  This rifle has a Timney drop-in 3lb skeletonized competition trigger.  Highest quality trigger I've ever fired in my life.  Extremely fast and precise return.

Other components:
- BHW polygonal rifled stainless steel coated black 1:8 16"" barrel with Saker muzzle brake/mount.  Produces higher muzzle velocity and accuracy due to less bullet deformation and sustains less wear than traditional rifling.
- Adams Arms gas block with settings for normal or suppressed fire.  Also has off mode single shot shooting.
- Fortis free-float handguard with dovetail barrel nut mount.  Fantastic mounting design.
- Magpul Stock with LaRue RISR cheek rest that slides back automatically when you pull the charging handle.
- Hogue Grip

Finally, Vortex Spitfire 3X Illuminated Optic.  Unbelievably clear glass, can illuminate in green and red.  Bright enough, even when looking directly at snow.  True combat optic as it will work without batteries as well, and then the reticle is simply black, like a traditional scope.  Excellent design.

I spent a ton of cash on this one and it's an outstanding rifle.  Has about 80 rounds through it, flawless.

Comes with 4 Magpul Gen3 Windowed 30Rd Magazines."

Say you want a pistol for self defense, home defense or lawful concealed carry. There are so many choices out there. You want a pistol that could be a carry gun as well as enjoyable to shoot and chambered in a caliber that can knock down an assailant. Get a Witness in polymer. Compact or full size or even better yet, get a Witness P Carry to give you that added advantage in a carry/defense pistol while keeping the fun of shooting a Witness pistol. Witness Polymer Pistols can be converted to 22LR, 9mm, .40SW, .45ACP & 10mm      Description:   Featuring a completely adjustable rear sight, the finish is mat blue with polished sides of the slide. The Chiappa Model 911 is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The original M1911 was a single-action, semiautomaticpistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs."
