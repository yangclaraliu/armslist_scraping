Nice clean bore, Full Choke, 2 3/4 Chamber, un-altered 30 inch barrel, it has really good looking vintage wood. Great for the Cowboy action shooter or Wild Bunch shooter, but it would also make a neat and unique field gun or trap shooting shotgun as well.

The most powerful semi-automatic handgun in existence. This is a unique and iconic design that has demanded respect through the decades and now, for 2015, this amazing firearm has an all stainless steel design with a integrated muzzle brake for excellent handling and durability.

This gun is barely used and only has forty (40) rounds (two boxes) fired through it not counting the factory shot. My only shooting session with it was back in March 2015 and it has remained in the case since then. I have cleaned it up better than it came brand new from the factory and have maintained its quality since I first bought it brand new back in March.

This is a package deal meaning you get one-hundred (100) rounds of premium Hornady .50AE XTP FP rounds for this amazing gun. You also get the original Magnum Research carrying case with all the original factory accessories and documentation. To sweeten the deal, you also get two (2) official Magnum Research factory magazines (7-round) brand new, never been opened out of its packages.

Do not pass up on this rare deal for one of the most iconic firearms in modern history. This is the real deal, and I hate parting with this precious piece.

Shoots very smooth and tame for a 12ga even with 3"" turkey loads. The gas booster bushing must be replaced with the factory bushing to shoot heavy 2 3/4"" and 3"" loads but it's very easy. It's based on the Rem 1100 action. Runs like a champ even with the cheapest ammo as long as you run the right bushing. The factory bushing will operate most lighter loads but can get finicky until you swap bushings. I have 250 rounds through it so with some more ""breaking in"" the factory bushing may wear in to suit all the needs. They sell an aftermarket 2 rd magazine block for hunting as well.

Comes with Fobus OWB holster, a brand new opened only to test fit and for pics, Alien Gear IWB Holster, and factory plastic case. It has been carried more than it has been shot, and internally it is superb, especially since I just got it back from the factory from a refurbish and parts replacement. It didn't need it, but I wanted to ensure it would be good to go before I sold it. It cost me about 150 bucks, but it was worth it, as I know people are hesitant about picking up Taurus firearms. They also test fired it to ensure function. I didn't live fire it when I got I back, but I did dry fire and check for function. It seems fine to me. It'll come with the gunsmith signed card from the factory as proof of the trip back to Taurus. That being said, it does have external finish wear, but it isn't outrageous. Should you have an issue with the weapon, which I doubt, Taurus covers all owners under their excellent warranty. It locks up tight, timing is on, trigger is decent, crane is straight, and rifling is deep. I also painted the front blade with Engine Red Enamel paint for a better sight picture. If you don't like it, it's easily removed. I quite like this gun, but I have too many J frame .38s as is. While I love my revolvers, logic dictates I should thin the herd.
I'll sell it for $325 cash, OR trade. See trade section for the details.

Finally, the SUPER HEAVY Tungsten Guide Rod for your Gen4 Glock are in stock and shipping. This SUPER HEAVY Tungsten Guide Rod is guaranteed to reduce felt recoil and significantly reduce muzzle jump. You will be able to shoot faster and more accurately shot to shot and target to target! Uses the same factory weight springs except on a tungsten body which is significantly stronger and heavier. Replaces factory plastic guide rod in seconds. Springs are captured on Guide Rod Assembly, completely assembled, ready to drop in and shoot. PLEASE NOTE: The new G42 Tungsten Guide Rod is designed with a slightly lighter spring to allow it to function with a wider range of ammo. This also makes it much easier to pull back the slide which has been a problem for many of our G42 shooters. Of course, the main advantage of the Tungsten Guide Rod is that the added weight helps reduce much of the felt recoil and also makes the gun function better, returning the slide more consistently and thereby improving overall accuracy!"

Great find for a Smith collector.  Unique and rare.  

Though marked as a model 645, this was shipped as a model 6450 (Box label only.  See below for links to the interesting history of this transition model).  One of about 475 manufactured in 1988.  It is unique as it has a Gen 3 frame but a Gen 2 slide, yet is marked as a Gen 2 model 645.  From my research, even then there are several variations of this model.

This was an agency gun.  The finish has been refreshed and should rate NRA “Excellent”.  Very small, lightly engraved agency markings have been left to allow the history of this gun to live on (left front fluted area of the slide, curved transition between front-strap and trigger guard and the bottom edges on the rear of the slide).  When you look at the gun, you wouldn't know they are there unless you point them out.  Did my best to show them in the photos.

Restoration includes complete detail strip (disassembled), cleaned and new Wolff springs installed.  New OEM rear sight.  New OEM Delron grip.  Two magazines, one OEM and one aftermarket.  New MTM pistol case.  Other parts were replaced and I will include the old parts, except the beat up Hogue grips it had.  It's now as near new as possible and a handsome example of a rare Smith 45.

My slant on this hobby is restoring S&W stainless semi-autos to new or near new condition. 
I take pride in my work.  This is offered with a 3 day “no fire” examination period.

Payment via USPS Money Order, Certified check or Chase Bank “QuickPay”.  I'll accept credit cards if you'll cover the 3.9% fee I'm charged.  Shipping is $25.00 USPS to your FFL.  Add for insurance over the standard $50.

Now for my rather breathy, collector kind of guy description:

This is one of those scarce/rare S&W variants that S&W collectors enjoy adding to their collection.  Makes for a good conversation piece regarding the Smith “Model Numbering” system, which was a bit screwy back in the day, as well as the Gen 2 – Gen 3 transition period.  This was manufactured during the 1988 transition period and is a Gen 3 Model 645.

Huh?....

Yup. 

Well, not quite a Gen 2... or a Gen 3.

This is a ""transition"" model S&W from 1988 when they were transitioning from the Model 645 to the 4506.  These were shipped as a Model 6450 (box label only).  According to the Blue Book of Gun Values and other sources, only around 475 were made, some shipped to and supplied to RSR, some went to the S&W Performance Center and others, like this, made their way onto the market as a Model 645 with unusual configurations.  A confusing time but not unusual in the manufacturing world during a tooling changeover.

The frame is stamped as a ""Model 645"" but it's really a Gen 3 “4506” frame.  It has Delron wrap around grips (no metal back-strap like the 645 or threaded holes for the 645 screw on grips) and is machined for the ""Left Hand"" magazine release option.  Also, the safety/decocker ""dots"" are not on the frame like a 4506 but instead, are on the slide, as on the Gen 2.

Are you confused yet?  Ya... that's the way it was then too.  But that's the fun of this one.

As for the slide, the front integrated ramp site with a red plastic insert is replaced by a removable dovetailed white dot blade style site.  And as I already mentioned, the safety/decocker dots are on the slide instead of the frame as on a 4506.  You'll also notice the top of the slide has a sharp cut top strap.

One more thing I noticed when researching this on the Net:  I found a photo of this same configuration but... looking on the “right” side of the frame... the photo I viewed showed the magazine release as only round shape, so... a left hand mag release wouldn't have worked.  The one I'm offering here has a Gen 3 frame cut for the left hand mag release option!

Superb hunting shotgun. Cannot beat an Browning A5.

Barrel is 27.5"" with a full choke. Vintage shotgun made in 1924! It does not look it - and the bluing appears to be original too. Reliable automatic shotgun. Clean inside and out. A5's are my favorite shotgun - not ever selling my Sweet Sixteen!

Chamber is 2-9/16"". It will shoot the 2-3/4"" shells you find on the shelf, and many people do just that. Myself, I get the specified shells. They are just a tad more, but you do have to order them. I get them from RST. Four boxes of these shells are included.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward. Not exactly the item you are looking for?

If you like the feel of A5's, you will like this shotgun. Same feel only in a very light gun. Recoil is quite tame too. This one functions perfectly. It does have some wear but the wood is crack free, and there is no rust or pitting. Aluminum receiver. Made in Belgium, approximately 1957. 

Faith Armory in Temecula might still have one on their shelf. This one is in better condition and quite a bit less expensive too.

Very different, very awesome shotgun."

NO TRADES

What we have here is a nearly new Zastava OPAP.  I only shot it enough to zero the front sight at 25 yards.  About 120 rounds total.

I did all of the cleanup, got the oil out of the military surplus wood furniture and restained it myself.  I polished the bolt carrier to a nice shine and I've had no problems with it functioning.

It has the Tapco G2 trigger, a double stack bolt, and the reinforced 1.5mm RPK bulged style receiver.  It is built like a tank.  All of the rivets are good, no mushrooming or bulging.

I installed a custom muzzle brake (it was $100) similar to the SCAR-17S brake, and it really tames the recoil, as well as changing the grip with a FDE magpul AK grip.  It fit my hand better, but I still have the stock one which will also be included.

It comes with the Romanian surplus magazine and Tapco 30 round that it came with, and both of those functioned.  I'm also including five newly manufactured Serbian military bolt hold open metal 30 round magazines.  These were hard to come by, especially brand new.

Last, since this is the only 7.62x39 rifle I own, I'm including the ammo with it.  About 1000 rounds of Wolf Military Classic/Black Box.  Its all 124gr FMJ, but it shoots good, and its an AK.  Its the stuff these things were made to shoot.

Serious offers only, felons need not apply ;D

Asking $800 for the whole package, that is rifle, magazines, and ammo.  Still have the box it came in as well."

Function tested and works flawlessly either single shot or magazine dumping flame throwing fun with all ammo types from 5.56 to steel.  I've put 150 rounds through it to make sure.

The handguard is part of the quick detach barrel system and it will heat up if you do dump after dump so wear gloves.  You can also get a second nut and a .300 Blackout barrel and swap between them very quickly with no extra mods.

I have no front sight as I was debating putting on irons or getting a small red dot, but can't do either.  I'm including an A3 flat top carry handle aperture sight.

This is built as a pistol and configured as a pistol according to ATF rules.  It is ready for a Form 1 if you want to turn it into an SBR, I'm just not going to go through that hastle.

All of the components are very high quality, and like I said it functions perfectly.

Ask any questions you like, but serious offers only.  This wasn't cheap to put together.
