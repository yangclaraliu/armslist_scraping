This shotgun, developed in the late 1980s or early 1990s by the famous Italian arms manufacturing company Pietro Beretta, is, basically, an upgrade over the preceding model, Beretta 1200. The 1201 was manufactured in two versions, 1201F,intended for hunting and sporting, and the 1201FP, intended for police and other such duties. Interestingly enough, the 1201 is extremely similar to the BenelliM1 Super 90 shotgun, and had the same recoil-operated semiautomatic action,developed and patented by Benelli. The production of the Beretta 1201 shotguns had been completed. Since the basic action of the 1201 is similar to such of the Benelli M1 shotgun,for the technical description please refer to the appropriate article at this site. The 1201FP was available with polymer furniture and stock, either with classic or pistol grip. Since the recoil spring is located in the buttstock,this shotgun cannot be fitted with the folding buttstock. The 1201FP can be found with either ghost-ring (large aperture diopter) or open rifle-type rearsights, and with the blade front sight We are willing look at trade offers.

With their legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged, and superbly accurate. The 10/22 Takedown model is designed to enable quick separation of the barrel from the action for ease of transportation and storage. Takedown is as simple as locking the bolt back and verifying the the rifle is unloaded, pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. The simple reassembly system allows for a secure connection of the barrel and action and returns the firearm to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used, ensuring consistent accuracy, shot after shot. The Takedown comes standard with a rugged, weather-resistant steel barrel and composite stock. The heat-stabilized, glass-filled trigger housing assembly is precision-made of high-tech materials for impact and abrasion-resistance.

Ideally suited for informal target shooting, plinking, small game hunting, and action-shooting events, Ruger's 10/22 has been purchased by millions of shooters since their introduction in 1964. With their legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged, and superbly accurate. The 10/22 Takedown model is designed to enable quick separation of the barrel from the action for ease of transportation and storage. Takedown is as simple as locking the bolt back and verifying the the rifle is unloaded, pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. The simple reassembly system allows for a secure connection of the barrel and action and returns the firearm to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used, ensuring consistent accuracy, shot after shot. The Takedown comes standard with a rugged, weather-resistant steel barrel and composite stock. The heat-stabilized, glass-filled trigger housing assembly is precision-made of high-tech materials for impact and abrasion-resistance. A combination scope base adapter for Weaver-style scope-mounts is provided with every rifle. We also have a huge selection of handguns and home defense shotguns and AR-15s AK 47s and hunting rifles, Great prices.

These special ops soldiers were asking for a better ""knock down, one shot, one kill"" ability because their M4's, calibred in 5.56, were not effective as a CQB take down round (they needed multiple shots to knock down and/or kill the Somali's). The requirement also required the upgraded caliber to be compatible with the current M4 platform. The end result was... (1) a .458 caliber bullet fired from a different barrel that was used in the current M4 upper receiver,...(2) development of a different bolt because of the size of the .458 round, but, maintain the same bolt carrier, and...(3) the ejection port on the current M4 upper receiver would have to be enlarged for the ejection of the larger piece of brass. These three items are the only difference between a standard AR 15 and the .458 SOCOM. The standard M16 / AR15 lower receiver is to be used with this upper, and was not changed at all. 

Place this upper receiver next to a 5.56 upper receiver and visually there is no difference. The difference becomes apparent only when you squeeze the trigger. At that time all hell breaks loose as you unleash a 300gr bullet, with a muzzle velocity of 1840 fps and 2100 ft lbs of energy towards that feral pig that has been bothering your farm animals. This round, with that much energy, will stop a 300lb feral pig in its tracks. One of the pictures shows three .458 SOCOM 300gr bullets next to a 5.56 SS109 62gr bullet.

***If you are interested in purchasing this upper please email to receive more pictures as ArmsList only allows me 3 pictures***

***This sale is for the complete upper assembly in the picture(s) only***

Your AR 15 lower receiver will attach to, and fire, this 458 SOCOM upper. With the addition of this upper to your collection, you will now have two different calibers (.458 and 5.56/.223) that you can shoot. Just move your lower receiver back and forth........

The upper receiver, barrel, gas block, gas tube, compensator and BCG is from Tromix. The hand guard is T-6061 anodized aluminum, 15"" quad rail which allows a full floating barrel. This is a very quality build and has been test fired to ensure all areas of functionality work as required.

The .458 SOCOM bullets will feed into regular AR magazines. A 30 round AR magazine will hold 10 .458 SOCOM rounds as a single stack. Please note that the blue tip round that is pictured can be used ""only"" in a metal magazine because of the guide edge inside the polymer magpul magazines. The flat nose bullets can be used in all AR magazines.......This is important to know. 

Be advised that the ammo is expensive, and, this is not for ""plinkers"" (unless you have a lot of money for ammo). I urge you to look up all aspects of this very capable, but very manly, self defense tool. I have built two 16"" barreled SOCOM's and one 10.5"" pistol. 

Please no trades or low ball offers as the price is very reasonable. Please be respectful.

Thank you for looking at my build."

I am selling my Glock 26, 3rd generation. The gun itself has no cosmetic flaws, and I have not upgraded or customized it at all. I’ve owned this gun for CC for almost two years and I have not even shot 100 rounds through it, but I can tell you it works perfectly! I don’t like to part with it, but I have trouble concealing it and have carried it often in my purse, which is not a good idea! I plan to buy something slimmer in the very near future. 

Other things I am including are an IWB leather holster. Again, it hasn’t been used very much, and it is in excellent condition. This is a Flashbang holster designed for women, but a man could wear this comfortably as well. The stitching is red, which gives it a nice look. Here is the item description from the web site: “Public Enemy No. 1…The most notorious holster in the Prohibition Series. Capone is the ultimate in concealment and comfort. It features a soft leather back piece that tucks smoothly inside the waistband and a thermoplastic fitted front to conform perfectly to your firearm. The thing that makes Capone so keen is the cut-down back piece. It's not only that the black suede liner feels great against your skin and helps keep the holster in place, but the size of the back piece allows the holster to be worn in the popular appendix carry position. The heavy duty clips allow the holster to stay in place with or without a belt and are adjustable for up to NINE different cant/depth combinations. Our signature pinstripe stitch gives this holster a serious touch of class.”

Other goodies include a Glock hard case with an extra magazine, speed loader and lock for the gun.

Feel free to contact me with any questions at all! And yes, I do know an FFL! He charges about $30 for the transfer."

I decided to test this out at 20 and 30 yards. Using a 5.56 rounds at it and this was the result. Then had used a 7.62x51 rounds both times at the other plate and penetrated the holes through it.
One bullet shot from both distances. This is absolutely ridiculous and should not have bought this I regret it now and now decided to warn others before buying from them. It is not worth it. I would not trust my life behind this product. This was not intended to downgrade them or anything just warning others through my negative experiences with this. They fraud the public and their clients by saying they are Military however Military has never used or approved of them. If anything I remembered we used them for target practices out on the range than anything else.
Do not waste you're time, resources or money on this product. I've regret doing spending my money on this. Their company deserves to be shut down, I've heard from other sources how they had a negative experience with AR500 armor as well!

Keep in mind that Level III plates ARE NOT rated for 5.56, they are only rated for 7.62 NATO @ 2800 fps. Since the 5.56 round is much faster than that it can defeat the plate.

Sear geometry has not been changed from standard so the high reliability that the stock trigger is known for is unchanged. The trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy steel military specification castings, correctly carburized, quenched and tempered for high surface hardness. The disconnector is 1070 high carbon steel properly Austempered into the spring range of hardness. Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications. A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all type of ammunition. Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 chrome-moly steel that has been quenched and tempered. Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the weapon lower receiver (both pins are Nickel-Teflon coated). Pull weight is above the U.S. Military minimum pull weight of 5.5 pounds but does not reach near the upper limit of 9.5 pounds (generally, the pull weight is about 6.0 pounds). The trigger can be substituted for lower performing stock triggers while still staying in compliance with Unit or Departmental requirements. MADE IN THE USA"

CMMG 5.56 NATO .223 Rem. Complete M4 Barreled Upper Assembly 16"" Chrome Lined Barrel WASP Finish

This complete CMMG Upper features a M4 Mil Spec Picatinny Flat top upper receiver that allows rapid and repeatable change between removeable iron or optical sights. F-Marked front sight base and an M16 Bolt Group. M4 Profile 16"" 4140 Chrome-Molly Steel Barrel with 1:9"" Twist

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel (Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 
Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

Each CMMG Complete Upper Assembly includes a forged upper receiver assembly, barrel assembly, bolt carrier group and charging handle assembly.

The Phantom takes into account all the requirements for modern night hunting. Utilising a military-style design and offering maximum functionality, the Phantom is an obvious choice for anyone who demands the highest quality and impeccable reliability. It is fully weatherproofed, thanks to a nitrogen filled optical channel and waterproofing to IPX6, and can be used anywhere. Arctic ice fields or desert sands, humid tropical forests or harsh Siberian taiga – the Phantom is ready to do its job regardless of weather conditions. The body of the Phantom is made of highly durable glass-filled plastic. The bodyshell design and high grade intensifier tubes ensure shockproofing to heavy calibres, including 9.3x62, 9.3x74 and 375H&H. The Gen 2+ tube has Automatic Brightness Control (ABC) and, coupled with the high quality, wide-aperture lens, provides a sharp and clear picture. The high light gain, combined with the built-in IR - Illuminator, allows hunting even in situations of critically low night illumination (down to 10-4 lx – overcast starlight). The fast start-up function (the sight is “On” only while pressing a button) is very useful for making quick assessments. The problem of choosing a reticle has also been solved effectively. With the Phantom, you can choose the most suitable reticle configuration and change it by simply pressing a button (the Phantom with the Mil-Dot reticle is also available). The voltage stabilization system eliminates reticle shift even with an almost discharged battery. All main controls are on top of the body simplifying accessibility.
