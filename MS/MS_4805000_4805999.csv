 This LT706 combo combines the excellent Harris LM-S 9""-13"" bipod with an integral, low-profile LaRue QD lever mount. We have replaced the Harris OEM stud attachment base with a custom chassis... ruling-out the risk of the stud screw and grabber becoming loose. By doing so, we were able to lower the profile by roughly .25"". A large knob on the rear provides easy leverage when adjusting swivel tension, especially when in the prone position. The bipod has 9-13"" Legs (with leg notches). The notched legs provide a more positive lockup, keeping legs from collapsing unintentionally.

These are used, and have seen time overseas. Fully Functional, They do have scratches (if you care about that stuff) Nothing spray paint won't fix IMO .Contact if interested or have questions. Will accept PayPal or cash FTF.

This will make a great gift for your wife or girlfriend this Christmas! This is a limited edition Pink and Black model, which was made special for Gander mountain (and from what they told me they weren't making them anymore).
It comes with the hard case, cleaning brush, lock keys and (1) 15-round magazine and a SOFT ARMOR nylon hip holster (reversible). This gun has not been out of the box since it was purchased and the holster is brand new condition as well."

Rated for Plus P ammo. I purchased this brand new earlier this month and think it's a great gun - it shoots soft due to its all-steel construction (weighs 21 ounces). The grip is just about a perfect combo of concealment and recoil control, allowing three fingers to wrap around it, but still compact for carry. Heck, I think it's a good looker, too, if that matters!  Really smooth action on this one. I've fired at most 100 rounds through it. Fully cleaned and oiled. Great gun, perfect for a new shooter due to its soft recoil and easy operation. Or if you're a revolver nut like me :)

My carry needs have changed now, however, so I'm making a move. Factory box, keys, manual, etc., included.  Also including a nice Bianchi leather pocket holster (RH).

Priced at $300, or trade for Ruger LCP, Taurus TCP (newer production), Smith Bodyguard 380 or the like. Depending on gun and condition extras or cash may be needed to equate value(s). 

I'm from Argos and can travel as far south as Peru, north to US 6, east to Etna Green and west to Grovertown.

I'll need to see the interested party's Indiana drivers license and License To Carry Handgun, and will show you mine. No exceptions. If this offends you or limits my buyer base, I apologize, but this is my way of doing my due diligence to ensure I'm selling to a ""proper person"" - one the State Police have cleared. Or we can meet at a gun shop close by and go through the NCIS check and transfer - but any and all fees incurred will be the buyer's responsibility. 

Thanks for the look!"

This is the all around BEST  rifle i've ever shot, and it's my baby.  I purchased her from a PX in Ft. Polk less than a year ago, I shot it without glass for about 5 months, and recently picked up the Vortex Viper PST. I have more pictures upon request.

It's had about 800 rounds. I've added a geissele super scar trigger ($350), muzzle brake ($110), hk spring sling hooks, vtac sling and 4 mags. I also have a vortex pst 2.5-10x32 ($800 MOA Reticle) and a primary arms micro that can be added. Without the glass I am looking for $2400. I am located in Seattle. Pictures are from 10/24/15, silhouette didn't have any real good points of aim, but it shoots good unsupported with not so great 147 gr. PMC. If you find the right load for this (probably around 168 gr.), I don't see why you shouldn't be shooting MOA.

Have a good day.
