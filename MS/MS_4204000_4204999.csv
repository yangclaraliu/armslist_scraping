The MKII in Patriot Brown seems to be all dried out of the market at the moment (UPC: REDACTED29). But if you want one, here it is! Parts and magazines are readily available on the Lionheart Industries website. I've only cycled one magazine of factory brass cased ammunition through this weapon before thoroughly cleaning it. Comes with soft case, sealed cleaning kit, gun lock, manual, and three 15 round magazines (only ships with one). The fit and finish of this pistol is excellent and comes Cerekoted from the factory. Please read the description below.

These are combat proven for over 20 years and imported to the U.S. market by Lionheart Industries. It's essentially the new production South Korean K5. The MKII is a full-sized pistol with a Picatinny rail. Lionheart uses hammer forged 4140 heat treated steel slides and hammer forged 7075-T6 aluminum frames. The proprietary Double Action Plus+ (DA+) provides all the benefits of single action with the safety of double action. By combining the length of double action with the trigger weight of single action, DA+ effortlessly increases accuracy and provides the ideal trigger weight. This pistol features a reversible magazine catch, an ambidextrous manual safety, heat-resistant polymer diamond grips, a cerakoted metal finish, and Novak Lomount sights. It comes with a 15-round magazine, cleaning supplies, and a soft case.

I love this rifle, great balance and more accurate than most give them credit. Iron sights, I have no problem banging the 450 yard silhouette all day long. 

About the rifle - it's an older PTR-91 with the 18"" cold hammer forged match barrel and metal lower. Bolt gap measured at .016. The railed aluminum forearm was added after purchase. Trigger pack was sent to Bill Springfield and now breaks clean/crisp at 4 pounds, original trigger was heavy and rough, now it feels about like an ALG ACT trigger with JP springs ... huge improvement. Included are 10 magazines, 5 mags are camo'd to match the gun, another 5 covered in OD green to match. When I did the paint, the gun was first completely stripped, blasted, and re-parked. I then soaked in Acetone and applied the Duracoat, which was then baked. The paint is 6 years old and still looks new. 

Round count is 5-600 
Also included is the real-deal grip pod, a Primary Weapon Systems muzzle break threaded in 15x1 for the gun, and a HK leather sling. It will ship in the pictured hard case. 


Trades - high end optics or guns, especially a Tavor would be great, but honestly I'll consider just about anything interesting. I have ammo and other Accessories to even things out"

Our Urban Go package includes (2) AR500 Armor® Level III patent pending Advanced Shooters Cut 10” x 12” body armor plates. We put our survivalist mentality to work and came up with the essentials required for scenarios that require quick rifle threat protection, creating an armor system that is ready to go at a moment's notice. The Urban Go Carrier Package is ideal for home protection and emergency situations where rifle threat protection may be necessary. The open side design with a quick release buckles unfastened allows the Urban Go Plate Carrier to be quickly tossed over a single shoulder and worn over any existing gear or body armor. Front access shoulder mounted quick release buckles allow rapid removal compared to plate carriers that utilize a cummerbund. Fast into action, fast out of action. Due to a cummerbund-less design the Urban Go Carrier is not intended to be used with side body armor plates. We think everyone should be able to afford body armor and took that into consideration when building this package. In addition to being functional and effective, we aimed for high value and our Urban Go Plate Carrier package delivers.

BDC Predator Reticle 
One defining quality that distinguishes the Coyote Special from all other Nikon riflescopes is the use of the BDC Predator Reticle.  Designed around the needs of predator hunters, its unique open circle design doesn’t obscure the sight picture and makes shots at moving targets easier. The Coyote Special is optimized for use with Nikon’s Spot On Ballistic Match Technology to provide shooters with exact aiming points on the BDC Predator Reticle at different yardages and different ammunition.
Spring-Loaded Zero-Reset Turrets 
To simplify field adjustments, Nikon has integrated this feature into all new Coyote Special riflescopes. Just sight-in as usual, then lift the spring-loaded adjustment knob, rotate to your “zero”, and re-engage. Field adjustments are now as simple as dialing-in your subsequent ranges.
ARD Technology 
Coyote Special riflescopes feature a removable ARD (Anti-Reflective Device) designed to eliminate game-spooking objective lens reflection.  Hand-turn 1/4 MOA Adjustments 
Reticle adjustments are made in 1/4 MOA click-stop moves you can both feel and hear, and with no backlash to make your shot creep off target. Positive click reticle adjustments get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting—even with repeated recoil and under rugged conditions.
Spot On Ballistic Match Technology 
The Coyote Special series, like all of Nikon’s riflescopes, are optimized for use with Nikon Spot On Ballistic Match Technology. Spot On allows you to discover all of the exact aiming points on your scope’s reticle at various yardages for your specific ammunition and load.

Is it possible for a pistol small enough to carry every day to have all the features and capacity that you’d expect in a larger pistol? If that pistol is the XD-S from Springfield Armory, the answer is yes. The XD-S 3.3"" Single Stack 9mm offers so much that you’ll be astonished that it all fits in the small, concealable profile. 

The XD-S Single Stack from Springfield Armory has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Use your XD-S Single Stack with an X-Tension magazine and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there. 

If you’re looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S 3.3"" Single Stack in 9mm. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S 3.3"" Single Stack today, and you’ll want to shoot it.

311,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4204311,For Sale:  Don Hume JIT (Just In Time) holster for Glock,"Karns, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 20,"Listed On: Thursday, April 2, 2015",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Product Description
Over the last 10 years, the Don Hume JIT slide has been their top selling holster model. The JIT (which stands for Just In Time) Slide is designed to carry medium sized to small revolvers and autos in a highly concealed manner. This holster has an open bottom so it can fit handguns from the same family regardless of the barrel length. For example, the model for the Glock 19 also fits the Glock 26.

One of the reasons for its popularity is the belt slot design. Instead of having belt slots in the front and rear of the holster, the JIT Slide has a belt slot directly behind the holster and then a second trailing belt slot on the back of the holster. The combination of the center belt loop and trailing belt slot pulls the weapon close to the body, while still allowing for a full firing grip. The design makes for a stable carrying platform that takes up much less space on the belt as compared to similar pancake style designs.

Top of the Sight says TG-H3
bottom says ""B"" with an ""ST2"" under that. 
as stated i have no idea what the age of the sight is.
i have listed everything that i know about the sight.
selling for cheap figured someone could use a nice sight at a cheap cost
make an offer 
thanks"

Chambered in the powerful 7.62x51/308win, this is a legitimate CQB (close quarter battle rifle). This particular variant of the M1A line is the more tactical with a 16"" barrel and rails for mounting accessories. Many would agree that the M14 platform is superior to the now very popular AR15, respectively. As long as I've owned this rifle, I've never had a problem whatsoever, it functions flawlessly. Keep in mind, I've only fired American brass not steel cased ammunition and have always kept it well lubricated. This rifle is a beast with a considerable amount of firepower from such a small package and has always turned heads wherever I shot it.
Rifle will come with a front/rear Magpul MBUS sights and two 20 rd mags. 
Honestly I hate to sell it but unfortunately I need the extra funds at the moment. I originally paid over $2000 for this about two years ago. I'm looking to get $1600 or best offer.

This gun is basically like new.  I bought it as a daily carry as I had a P229 and wanted the interchangeable mags with the other gun.  Truth is, I hardly ever carried it, as I got a smoking deal on a XDS 9mm and started carrying that full time, and I traded my P229 for revolver in November, so this is kind of an orphan in my collection.

Bottom line, as much as I like collecting a gun for every purpose, I can't justify it, my wife said I have to go on a gun diet.  My loss, your gain. 

This is the SAS (Sig Anti Snag) version, perfect for concealed carry.  It is a DAK trigger (Dual Action Kellerman).

I have owned it for the past year and a half, and as said above, barely put 300 rounds through it.  All clean ammo, no reloads.

If you want to know anything about this gun, read the reviews, it's a superb compact gun, and it's a Sig.  Enough said.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

A full US wood stock and full Czech Small Arms Polymer stock are included. This is a recent purchase from Czechpoint. Taking from their website their description is below - but I have the following upgrades:

1. US made Cherry wood stock. This allows use of surplus mags since the set is 922r Compliant. The rifle currently has the US wood butt stock and pistol grip on it with polymer CSA hand guards. The wood hand guards, CSA polymer butt stock, pistol grip are included. There is no wood impregnated plastic stock. The wood handguards are slightly loose when on here but I have instructions on how to tighten them if you want.

2. Bayonet with US cherry wood handle to match the set of US wood

3. Czech Army Bipod

Note: Czechpoint built these on previously imported Waffen Works receivers so it is marked to Czechpoint and WW. I will send this in the original CP box...

Following from Czechpoint site regarding this model:

CzechPoint is excited to offer the Sa vz.58 Military 762CP rifle model that has been built in-house using presses, jigs, and fixtures imported from the Czech Small Arms factory!

Now $750 for entire set
Or I'll part it out:
$250 for all competition gear listed (trigger, striker, magwell, sights, bases, tape)
$550 for bone stock Glock 35 Gen4 (all factory materials)

I'm switching over to Production and don't need to keep this one. It is a perfect setup for USPSA Limited. I shot it at about 10 matches and a few range sessions, so maybe 2000 rounds.

The prices listed are the prices I paid:

Glock 35 Gen4 $640 (3 mags, case, backstraps)
Zev Tech adjustable Fulcrum trigger $180
Zev Tech skeletonized striker $80 (These parts combine to create a sub-2lb. trigger pull)
Zev Tech aluminum magwell with large brass weighted plug $100 (Quickens reloads and lightens recoil)
Sevigny black rear sights, Dawson .215"" black front sight $80 (Dead-on point of aim)
Dawson extended magazine bases, quick release $30 x 2 (Adds 4 rounds for a 19+1 load out. Includes extended springs. Original springs and floor plates are included.)
Dawson grip tape $20

Comes with all factory items, including the case that isn't in the photos. The medium backstrap with the beavertail has been customized so it fits with the magwell installed. Three magazines are included, two with extended baseplates, all three have numbers on them. I found that shooters should have at least 4 mags for Limited, but really only two need to be extended. I'd be willing to part with one more magazine for $20 if you need it. You may notice this one has only the standard slide stop. There is some holster wear on the front edge of the slide.

If there are any particular parts you don't want or don't need, we could negotiate something, but I pretty much priced all the accessories at rock-bottom prices.

I have another handful of photos, if you're interested."
