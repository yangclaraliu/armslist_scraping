  I am selling my CMMG AR15 .22lr conversion kit with two 25rd magazines. The device itself is in a matte black parkarized finish. The magazines are original CMMG BlackDog-style mags that have been refinished in Duracoat matte black. The kit is low-mileage, and hasn't seen use in a few years since I started reloading like crazy for .223 otherwise. This device runs surprisingly well, but like all .22lr automatics - prefers copper-plated high-velocity ammo. MSRP for the kit and extra mag is about $225 when new. This unit is in 97% condition overall.

Kel-Tec's KSG is a simple and reliable pump action shotgun able to feed
from either the left or right tube, with a manual feed side selector lever
located behind the trigger guard. Each tube holds up to 6 shells for a
total 12+1 capacity. The pump includes top and bottom Picatinny rails to
mount accessories and optics. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame
recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and the magazine tubes
have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass
reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out two
pins, which store in two holes in the grip when removed. It has built-in
forward and rear sling loops, and includes a basic sling.

	Hello Everyone, 
As you’ve seen, Ive got a 458 SOCOM build in the mix. I am now in the market for an optic. I know the recall can be somewhat rough on many scope setups. So i am mainly looking into what you are using on your setups with similar recoil. I am mainly looking for a low power range (1-4, 2-7, 3-9) with a moderate to medium objective. I usually would just go with a Leupold VX1 3-9, but wanted input from those who have them already. Also, if you have an optic for sale (mainly a Leupold) let me know, I may be interested in taking it off of your hands if you are interested. 

Have a good one and happy hunting!

At that time, he could not afford to purchase a custom knife, so he decided to make his own. That's when it all began. Initially, Mark made knives for his friends and eventually, his creative talent was sought after by customers throughout the USA. After 30 years as a renowned knife maker, Mark decided to retire in 2007. On September 23, 2013, he received a call from Colonel Jack Tobin, president of The Special Forces Association at Fort Bragg, NC. While at an estate auction preview, Colonel Tobin saw a knife which he felt would be perfect for Special Forces active duty personnel, as well as the members of the association. Mark came out of retirement and began his journey by making a knife in honor of his fallen friend, MSG Robert Horrigan, a Special Forces Operator stationed at Fort Bragg, NC.Mark Hazen, who mastered the art of knife making over the past 30 years, is reintroducing classic old world craftsmanship in new and innovative designs. Each knife is hand made without the use of jigs. The blade and edge geometry has been engineered into each model to ensure optimum performance for its intended use. The ergonomically designed handles are specifically contoured to give a comfortable and confident grip. Each Hazen knife is uniquely crafted and well suited for all military and law enforcement personnel, sportsmen and the discriminating collector.All the knives produced at Hazen Knives go through a 3-phase testing process to ensure that each knife meets uncompromising quality standards. Each batch of steel is tested since all are not exactly the same. One knife is made from each new batch and is rigorously tested by chopping through a 2X4 piece of lumber and cleanly slicing through a piece of 20 lb. paper. If the hardness and edge retention meet the standards of phase one, the cutting test, then the testing continues to phase two, the comfort test and phase three, the fit and finish test.Come check this knife out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte.

At that time, he could not afford to purchase a custom knife, so he decided to make his own. That's when it all began. Initially, Mark made knives for his friends and eventually, his creative talent was sought after by customers throughout the USA. After 30 years as a renowned knife maker, Mark decided to retire in 2007. On September 23, 2013, he received a call from Colonel Jack Tobin, president of The Special Forces Association at Fort Bragg, NC. While at an estate auction preview, Colonel Tobin saw a knife which he felt would be perfect for Special Forces active duty personnel, as well as the members of the association. Mark came out of retirement and began his journey by making a knife in honor of his fallen friend, MSG Robert Horrigan, a Special Forces Operator stationed at Fort Bragg, NC.Mark Hazen, who mastered the art of knife making over the past 30 years, is reintroducing classic old world craftsmanship in new and innovative designs. Each knife is hand made without the use of jigs. The blade and edge geometry has been engineered into each model to ensure optimum performance for its intended use. The ergonomically designed handles are specifically contoured to give a comfortable and confident grip. Each Hazen knife is uniquely crafted and well suited for all military and law enforcement personnel, sportsmen and the discriminating collector.All the knives produced at Hazen Knives go through a 3-phase testing process to ensure that each knife meets uncompromising quality standards. Each batch of steel is tested since all are not exactly the same. One knife is made from each new batch and is rigorously tested by chopping through a 2X4 piece of lumber and cleanly slicing through a piece of 20 lb. paper. If the hardness and edge retention meet the standards of phase one, the cutting test, then the testing continues to phase two, the comfort test and phase three, the fit and finish test.Come check this knife out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte. Give me a call @ 980-237-eight9eight1 if you have any questions. Shipping can be arranged for $10.

I have a strong regard for a Stainless Steel construction (I believe this to be the 1st time Desert Eagle available in Stainless Steel construction) and I naively purchased this weapon sight unseen.  This particular model features a Muzzle Brake as an integrated feature, designed and built into the pistol at the time of  manufacture.

I believe that the Integrated Muzzle Brake promises to offer substantially enhanced weapon control to a gimpy old fart with lose of strength and muscle mass.  However I was not prepared for the “shock and awe” when this little hummer arrived and the gun case was opened for the first time.  This was a couple of clicks from a cardiac-arrest moment for me!  This is a large weapon in my view…

This pistol remains unfired and in the manufacturers shipping packaging and has only been mauled and groped once or twice by an unbelieving buyer.  Instead, I have decided to purchase some hot loads for my old faithful and trusty Left Handed Randall 45 Caliber 1911A1 and to sell the Desert Eagle, .50 AE Caliber Hand Cannon with all of the extras I purchased prior to taking delivery thrown in!

As I reside in Texas, I can deliver face to face to a buyer with valid DL, Texas or other.  If your state does not have standing law prohibiting anyone from delivering a handgun to any person that I have reasonable cause to believe has not been convicted of a crime of violence, is a drug addict, a habitual drunkard, or of unsound mind, I will ship to your location at your expense.

Shipping expenses paid by the buyer will be at my cost.   I can also ship to an FFL agent of your choosing.

In consummating this transaction, I am not anxious to meet up with a shady character in a dark alley on a cold rainy night.  I plan to avoid a dark alley scenario like the plague!

All profits go to support the Forever the Fight Foundation charity to aid veterans with PTS. Description  Springfield Armory the same company that brought Point Shoot Ergonomics to the market in 2001 is proud to announce the latest evolution of the polymer pistol - The XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact in 9mm and .40SW.Put an XD Mod.2 in your hand, and you'll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.Enter the GripZone: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.The GripZone doesn't stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand grip relief and High-Hand beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol's felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you'll want to pick up the new XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact.

I work at ZEV and this is a one of a kind custom built pistol, but I have not had the time to compete lately and have decided to sell it. It has never been used other than test firing to ensure proper function. It is a great shooting pistol with negligible felt recoil.

It is a G35 with a 9mm conversion barrel so you can shoot either 9mm or .40 S&W. The slide is cut to accept a Leupold Deltapoint PRO red dot sight (when it releases to the public) which is an excellent sight that is far superior to anything currently on the market. Will come with a dovetailed adapter plate so that you may shoot it with fiber optic iron sights until you can get the red dot. 

Specs as follows:
Glock G35, Gen 3
ZEV Longshot slide cut, Deltapoint PRO cut, slide graining, and burnt bronze PVD slide coating
KKM Precision 9mm match grade conversion barrel that is coated black (comes with factory .40 cal barrel too)
ZEV Stainless steel guide rod and ISMI lightened 13lb recoil spring (less muzzle flip)
ZEV Fulcrum Ultimate trigger kit (2lb trigger pull with short reset)
ZEV Extended magazine release (quicker reloads)
ZEV Brass magwell with heavy insert (quicker reloads, less felt recoil)
ZEV Fiber optic combat sight set with adapter plate
Silicon carbide grip job (better grip, more comfortable)
Comes with ZEV pistol case and Glock tool

This pistol is a $2,500 value! 

NOTE - This pistol does NOT come with the Deltapoint PRO optic, only the slide cut and mounting hardware for it."

Used by oﬃcers as well as tankers, drivers, artillery crews, mortar crews and other personnel in lieu of the larger, heavier M1 Garand riﬂe, the M-1 carbine weighed only 4.5 to 4.75 pounds. The Citadel M-1, made by Chiappa in Italy, weighs in at 4.8 lbs. – nearly the exact weight of the original. Barrel length and OAL are also the same as the “United States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1”, its oﬃcial military designation.

Copying from the mfg info:

RUGER LCP, KelTec P3AT,P32

 The Pocket Protector holster is designed for front pocket carry in pants or a jacket. The Pocket Protector keeps the firearm in the same general position so you can quickly locate the grip when you need to draw, conceals the shape of the gun so that its outline is not printed through the pants, and allows one-handed release of gun from both pocket and holster. Reinforcements at the holster mouth and beneath the trigger guard keep the holster stiff enough to allow a smooth draw and easy return to the holster, while also maintaining enough rigidity to prevent “printing” and shifting of the handgun. The holster’s hooked shape – at the base of the handgun’s trigger guard – is designed to catch on the pocket so that, with practice (using an unloaded firearm) and while using the proper pants, you can draw the firearm while the holster remains in your pocket or falls away. The Pocket Protector is ambidextrous and constructed of premium Center Cut Steerhide."

I completely forgot about them until the county issued a tax lien on one of them last month. Needless to say, I don't want them (I forgot I even owned them) and I certainly don't want to pay taxes on them every year (about $300 total). 

Make me an offer. I am open to any reasonable trade. I especially like guns but I'm open to any trade (especially if it is something fun). There are back taxes attached to these properties so you will immediately owe the city about $2,900 so factor that into the value of what you are trading. Tax assessed value of these properties is about $20k but I think a realistic value is more like $10k. I don't want the back taxes in my name anymore and will get rid of them for almost anything of value. This is a great deal if you want to start investing in property. Make any offer!

The 2 properties are :

1115 E GWINNETT ST - This is a condemned house downtown

I have for sale a serious upper today. I do not want to sell it, but I am in need of some cash. This is an AR complete upper receiver chambered in 6.8 SPC II. This caliber is quite possibly the best deer/hog hunting caliber out of the AR platform today. 300 Blackout doesn't even come close to the terminal performance and effective range of the 6.8. With proper ammunition, this cartridge is a 400 yard deer gun in a handy AR sized package.
     I built this upper with all top quality, tier one parts. The barrel is a Bison Armory stainless steel, 1:11 twist, 16 inch, with black Cerakote applied for maximum durability. This barrel is ridiculously accurate. Easily 3/4-1/2 MOA. it has a midlength gas system and M4 feed ramps. The upper is also a Bison forged. 
     The bolt carrier is  White Oak Armory, and is very clean. Chromed internals, like it should be. The bolt is Daniel Defense; MP/Shot Peened 6.8, so you know it's quality. 
The standard extractor spring has been replaced with a BCM 4-coil enhanced chrome-silicon spring. No FTE's here. It also has a standard mil-spec charging handle. 
     The handguard is a Yankee Hill; Todd Jarret edition, 12 inch version. It has been coated in Magpul OD Green Cerakote for durability and aesthetics. 
     On the muzzle is a Troy Claymore muzzle brake, that does a nice job of reducing recoil and directing the blast forward, away from the shooter. 
     In addition, the upper is outfitted with a set of the rugged Magpul BUIS. The front sight post has been replaced with a more narrow version from KNS for unequaled iron sight accuracy. 
With the upper the buyer will receive one C-Products stainless steel 25-round magazine and a 20 round box of Hornady 6.8 120 Grain SST ammunition. This round packs a serious punch.

I believe the price is fair for what this upper is capable of. I have put around 120 rounds through it to see how it shot and I was very impressed. Everything has been cleaned and oiled with Slip 2000 EWL. Don't be outgunned in the woods on your next deer/hog/coyote hunt. Step up to the 6.8 SPC. 
     I would be open to trades, with the exception that I would like a minimum of $700 cash along with a trade offer. 

Thanks for looking!"
