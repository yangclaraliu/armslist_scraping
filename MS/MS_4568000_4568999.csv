No trade interests. Excellent condition Smith and Wesson 642 38 special snub nose revolver. You'll note this is the more desirable no-lock model. I purchased this last weekend as a backup for my regular carry gun while I was waiting on parts to arrive. I am not the original owner, however, the gun is dated from 2014, and, given the appearance of the gun when I bought it, I'd say at most two cylinder fulls of ammo have been through it - including the cylinder I fired. Clean little gun. Factory box and all packaging included. 

Priced at $350. Reasonable offers considered, though I think I've priced this pretty fairly. If you know Smith revolvers or carry guns at all, you'll appreciate what this is. Low ball offers cheerfully ignored!

I'm from Argos and can travel as far south as Peru, north to US 6, east to Bourbon, and west to Grovertown.

I'll need to see the interested party's Indiana drivers license and License To Carry Handgun, and will show you mine. No exceptions. If this offends you or limits my buyer base, I apologize, but this is my way of doing my due diligence to ensure I'm selling to a ""proper person"" - one the State Police have cleared. Or we can meet at a gun shop close by and go through the NCIS check and transfer - but any and all fees incurred will be the buyer's responsibility.

So, up for sale is my Polish AKM. Made in 1969 at Polish Radom factory, then imported and built by Atlantic Firearms. This is NOT a Century/Tantal/WASR/IO/etc. It's properly assembled and well-put together, as expected from Atlantic Firearms. The rifle is 922r compliant, including a US-made, chrome lined barrel and Tapco G2 trigger. The bolt, carrier, and piston are nickel-plated as well. 

The rifle has less than 1,000 rounds through it and has been meticulously cared for. Furniture is original Polish surplus wood in excellent condition, with an original Bakelite pistol grip, also in great condition. I will include three magazines: one Polish surplus steel 30 rounder, one black Magpul 30 rounder, and one Tula Bakelite 30 rounder. All mags are in good condition. Also included will be an original Polish surplus cleaning kit, oil can, sling, and 3-cell mag pouch (pouch not pictured). Additionally, I'll include an original Polish Bakelite-handled AKM bayonet (with wire-cutter sheath) that fits the rifle. 

All of this will be shipped in a padded rifle case, which will be included at no extra charge. I really hate to see this gun go - it's been my favorite for a long time - but I'll be entering a training program which (unfortunately) requires I own an AR-type rifle and I can't afford to own both right now. I can provide extra pictures of the rifle (inside and out) and more information upon request.

The rifle (with one steel magazine and case) retails new from Atlantic Firearms at $839. Considering that this one is barely used and includes quite a few extra goodies, I'm looking to get $700 plus shipping for it. I am mildly flexible on price, however, so shoot me an offer and we can probably work something out."

 I just had the 1k tune up performed at Bloomington Harley ($350) with all Harley synthetic fluids. I have added a few touches of Harley Chrome including a Willie G skull derby cover and a matching Willie G skull themed clutch linkage. I have all original hardware and a new owner can return it back to complete stock if you wish, the V&H tuner keeps the stock tune saved in case. I'm asking $18,500 at this time, no joy rides, no low ballers, I have a standing trade offer from Harley, have the funds if you make an offer and please don't waste my time.    I would take 1k-2k off the price for firearms"

This receiver gives you the strength of a milled receiver without all the extra weight. 
Great care was taken, putting this AK pistol together. Would consider it a 98+% gun, and it comes with mag as shown, soft assault case, and a swiveled shoulder strap.

AK mags fit snug with no wobble and release cleanly.

Upper and lower hand guards are also 98+% condition, and as you can see, it is the very nice mahogany darker reddish color, instead of the blondish color you see on most other newer built AK pistols.

This AK47 Draco also has the standard AK style of forward raking gas tube, with a separate attached sight and threaded slant cut muzzle brake on the end. (Also have a different muzzle brake and flash suppressor that will go with the gun.) Again, most other builds incorporate a squared off sight and gas tube combination, and IMO just doesn't look as clean as this style, which you will not see too many of in the AK47 Pistols.

I was going to put a Tapco 2 trigger group in it, but just decided that a double spring and a fluff & buff on the contact areas was all that was needed. Will include the Tapco 2 trigger with it's other items with purchase. 

If you are looking for a quality AK47 Draco pistol, that will give even the best Arsenal AK pistols a run for their money at half the cost, then you better grab this one fast.

Fun gun to shoot & own.

Require a FTF transaction with a signed Bill Of Sale for both parties.

Must have an Alabama DL & be of legal age.

The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

It is chambered in 12 gauge for 2-3/4 inch shells.  This one has a 30 inch barrel stamped as a full choke, but is also threaded in the tru-choke pattern, so I think it may have been reamed out or just threaded for a mussel-break, I'm really not sure.  It has some surface rust on the barrel from sitting in someone's closet for too long and some wear on the finish.  It cycles just fine and I have the inside of the barrel back to a mirror finish. No abnormal wear, a really decent shotgun, just not what I need.
A little history on these because they're a little uncommon:  They 11-48 was made from around WWII to the 60's when the 11-87 and 1100 took over.  In the 70's they made the Mohawk-48 from the old 11-48 parts, the only difference is the model year.  They are a long recoil design, so the barrel actually recesses into the chamber when it cycles.  The benefit of this is that it eats any kind of ammo without gas adjustment and is reliable in any weather, even dirty.  You can still find the barrels online for around $200, but this barrel is actually in good working condition.  

I picked up this shotgun a few weeks ago on a whim because I wanted a beater for duck hunting from my kayak.  I couldn't forgive myself if I dumped my old Ithica overboard, so I figured I would buy this shotgun.  Anyway, I didn't realized that it wouldn't be able to handle steel shot (stupid me) so now I need to get rid of it and buy something a little newer.  I would like to get my money back on it, so $275 takes it.

You know the drill, residents only, must be legal to buy/own a firearm, have an ID for me at the time of purchase and I would like you to sell a bill of sale because this gun is registered to me.

Background:
I am the original owner, and purchased this about a month ago. As soon as I got the gun I ordered an Apex Tactical forward set sear and aluminum flat face trigger. I had never shot an Apex trigger M&P before, but now I know what all the support is about. I've never felt a better trigger on a striker fired gun. It has the reliability of a striker fired M&P but with the smooth and light trigger pull of a 1911. I put 100 rounds through it and it shot great. Super easy follow up shots. I was originally going to shoot USPSA limited 10 with this but chose to continue shooting production with my Glock 34. This gun really needs to be seen, these triggers really are amazing. The gun itself goes for around $600 with the factory night sights. The Apex parts cost me $175. You could always buy this, install the factory trigger and sell the Apex parts and have yourself a great gun and some extra cash.

Price:
I am asking $585 firm. No trades.

Buyer must have valid Ohio driver's license. Buyer must be able to legally own a handgun. I prefer buyer to have valid CCW license.

Not totally convinced I want to sell, listing to see what kind of interest I get.

This is the Taurus Raging Bull 44 Mag. Great shooter, great condition although I didn't clean it up at all before taking photos. It has been sitting in my safe going un-used for a long time now, thinking it may be time to try something different. Everything works as it should, good lock-up, very accurate.

Included with the gun is 197 rounds of hollow-point ammo (no target loads). 147 rounds of full house hand loads, mostly with Hornady XTP bullets, and a box of factory loads. Also, 12 rounds of ""bear loads"", 300+ grain projectiles. Two speed loaders, a soft holster and a shoulder holster (not pictured) also come with it. No original box or paperwork.

Everything is in great shape and works like it should. Get it before the new private gun sale law goes into effect on the 9th.
Not looking for any trades, unless someone has a Glock 41 MOS.

Please note they are not Trijicon, otherwise the gun is stock.  It comes with five 13 round magazines and two 10 round magazines.

I have been an occasional customer of this place since the late 80's. This time I walked in with another gun collector and inquired about a transfer. I was told they will not do a private transfer. I then asked to speak to a manager. When I spoke to the manager I informed him I was a repeat customer and I wished to have a private transfer done. He refused. He said the only transfers they would do are for guns they sell. I told him I had bought 3 handguns this year and doing right by me would be in there best interests. He simply said thanks for that and he could not and would not do a private transfer because the owners had decided not to allow them. When I asked about the owners he simply said good day and please leave. This leaves me to believe this ""gun shop"" is putting their sales or profits above the needs of the common law-abiding gun owners who were not buying their guns.

I traded my AR15 for this shotgun a few months ago when I got hooked on sporting clays. The reason I do not wish to keep this shotgun is because I have not used it a single time in the 3-4 months I've had it. It is in very good condition with minor signs of use. I do think that the stock was shortened a little by the previous owner but it feels good to me and I am 6'3. The stock is adjustable and the shotgun comes with 4 chokes and choke tool (not pictured) along with the original box and instruction manual.

For sale today is an I.O. Inc AK47 Sporter.  This rifle is made in the USA and carries a lifetime warranty.  Unlike most AK47's, I.O. boasts a 2 MOA accuracy.

Three of the magazines are 30-round Tapco's and three are 30-round I.O.'s, but the I.O.'s tend to bind up past 20 rounds.  I believe the flash hider is also a Tapco.  The slant muzzle brake does a great job of defeating muzzle rise.  I've never had any feeding issues, and the sights appear to be spot on.  This model has a rail section on the left, allowing you to add an over-the-cover scope rail, but I would probably just recommend using a light and a laser on the left side, in my opinion.

Background: This gun is almost new.  The firing pin broke, and the rear sight was loose.  I returned it to I.O. for service, and it returned in about a week.  There is a blemish on the wood as can be seen in the second picture.  The blemish appears to be only the varnish, so it should be very easy to refinish.

Asking $700 for rifle, mags, cleaning kit, and flash hider.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask."

The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers."

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip."

Reduces muzzle rise.  $50 obo.  No trades please

This brake keeps muzzle rise at an absolute minimum, and eliminates substantial muzzle blast associated with other brakes.

The .223 SJC Titan was designed and developed with USPSA Grand Master Eric Lund to provide a competitive advantage in 3-gun competition. It is legal for Limited, Tactical and Open Division rifles. 

This compensator will reduce your muzzle rise, giving you better control of your rifle. Gas vectoring technology maximizes recoil reduction and minimizes torque and shot to shot recovery time. The design traps expanding gasses in the baffles and increases dwell time for maximum efficiency possible, allowing faster follow up shots and transitions between targets.

- Can be used on any .223, ½ x 28 threaded barrel. - Blends smoothly into any .750"" barrel 
- Comes with instructions and crush washer"

It has the A2 style upper receiver with fixed carry handle and adjustable rear sight. This is a ""Blue Label"" variation and while it does not have the dreaded bayonet lug, it does still retain the flash hider. Overall condition is excellent with some minor normal handling marks. I'd grade the rifle at 95% overall with no rust or any issues. The mechanics are in good working order and the bore is excellent. It comes with the original box (box shows wear and taped repairs), the 1990 dated owner's manual, original (unused) black nylon sling, and the original factory magazine pinned to hold 5-shots. Also included is a very good condition factory Colt 4x20 scope which mounts without tools to the carry handle. The scope features a built in bullet-drop compensator and comes with lens cover.
