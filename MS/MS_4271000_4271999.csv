Has light use. This is the full kit no the cheaper minimalist version. Cost's over $500 new.
Selling for $400 or trade. 

The COP C4 (Continuous Optics Platform) is a custom configured integrated upper receiver and hand guard system.

This extremely rigid design allows for symmetrical or asymmetrical rail platforms to accommodate a multitude of optic requirements. The hand guard system allows for a free-floated barrel giving the operator superior performance and accuracy. 

This system uses any standard AR-15 barrel, not a proprietary barrel system. Barrel nut and wrench are included with the kit. The receiver design also has a fully enclosed dust cover pin which can be removed with the barrel in place. The forward assist and dust cover are already installed.

HIPERTOUCH® FCGs have uniquely solved two problems with stock AR triggers and AR trigger upgrades in general: 1) High Trigger Weight, and 2) Low Hammer Fall Energy.
Trigger Weight: The real culprit behind high trigger pull weight is high sear impingement force that produces high friction. To get around that, the stock “AR” trigger and hammer mechanical advantage was changed and the sear optimized.
Hammer Fall Energy: Even with trigger weight, high energy MIL-spec hammer fall is maintained. The best of two worlds.
HIPERTOUCH® FCGs retain Eugene Stoner's design of simple elegance while remaining very robust, without the gritty feel. Shooting for high accuracy is no longer an almost impossible chore. It's no longer necessary to improve the stock performance by manually polishing the high-friction trigger and hammer sear surfaces, where the end result was only marginally better anyway.
The EDT was designed for the broader high performance shooting market typified by three segments that taken together, demand a unique suite of features at more pedestrian pricing. Those segments are: Law Enforcement, NRA type long range competition shooting, and the multi purpose sport, hunting, and home defense rifle. All these segments have one trigger specification in common: a minimum pull weight of 4½ lbs. The EDT meets that specification and more.
First, the triggers are user-adjustable to 4½ plus and 5½ plus lbs by simply interchanging two hammer springs. “Plus” means that even after a period of break-in and/or heavy use, the trigger weight will always stay above the two thresholds.
Second, the sear design paradigm used in the 24s has been included making for a very smooth and flat pull with only a hint of creep, a clean break with little over travel, and a fast positive reset. If you have put your finger on a 24E, 24C, or 243G, and can imagine the higher EDT pull weights, you’re very close to appreciating what the EDT will feel like.
Third, the EDT sports MIL-spec hammer fall even though the pull weights are less than MIL-spec’s 7-9 lbs. The two hammer springs that give the 4½ and 5½ lb pull weights are even heavier than the stock MIL-spec hammer spring. This is possible because the EDT’s hammer and trigger mechanical advantage pioneered by HIPERFIRE in its design of the 24 product family has been included. So, the EDT hammer still strikes well within MIL-spec’s hammer energy range with lowered trigger weight.
Fourth, the EDT lock time is faster than MIL-spec, like that of the 24 family, due to the use of the heavier springs and by locating the center of hammer mass closer to the pivot axis, which causes it to spin up to speed faster.
But, there’s more ... an entirely new feature found in the EDT and no where else. Remember, ED stands for Enhanced Duty. When thinking about the needs of Law Enforcement, the Military, the home defender, and the ultimate reliability demands placed on the AR rifle, do you think of very adverse and dirty conditions? Now, imagine when and how you really want that rifle to work? The EDT trigger was designed for that scenario.
First, fine particulate debris and carbon fouling can accumulate in the bottom of the disconnector slot of stock triggers causing the disconnector to jam. If that should happen, semi auto function may be compromised. In contrast, that the EDT trigger slot has holes running the length of its bottom so that the disconnector actually becomes a self-cleaning device, pushing out any debris by that same disconnector toggler action.
Second, notice that the rear underside of the trigger has been raised and the end ramped up and away, increasing the gap clearance between it and the floor of the lower’s fire control cavity. What does that do? Well, if a blown primer cup or bits of gravel should be blown into the lower through the ejection port when shooting prone, they could end up under the trigger preventing it from letting off completely thus preventing hammer reset. Many, especially 3 gunners, have had this very thing happen to them. This new EDT trigger feature can minimize this occurrence .
The best feature? The EDT is only $89 at MSRP."

Most were all .380's, some other calibers and a very few were the 9x18 ""Ultra"" or ""Ultra9mm"" or some called them ""Police 9mm"". Anyhow, I have read and they will fire a 380 safely (kinda like 556/223) if one couldn't find the ultra shells. Google ""Will a 380 fire safely in a 9x18 ultra chambered pistol"" and it comes up on several reputable sources. Or just order the ultra's. They aren't much more than 380's and one places were the same or a little less.

Functions really neat, you rack it, and as a safety, have to insert the mag to close the rack. Hammer is made bobbed and is flush with the back of the firearm.

I could only find one Ultra9mm and here's a link to it where it sold for 400 and wasn't NIB or unfired.

Two mags and the cleaning rod included. Has original phosphate finish showing some handling marks, but still looks great. Internall in excellent condition. All the numbers match. Has original plastic grips in very good condition with no cracks. Gun has a decocker. This thing sounds like a 357 when you fire it. The rounds are going around 1600 fps muzzle velocity. It makes a great fireball too.

I researched all the markings and came up with the following: the phosphate instead of blued finish indicates it wasn't a refurbished pistol. The crossed swords and number 53 indicate it is Czech Army and made in 53, the ""rid"" also incidates it was army production, not civilian. The circled T on the barrel inside the chamber indicates it passed military inspection for safety and the de-cocker passed. The various other marks are for the workers who might have assembled it and the circled vot or vor is probably the plant that did any refinishing or work on it before it was sent back out into the world.

There are no import marks that I can find. They should be on the bottom of the frame between the trigger guard and the end of the barrel. Oh well, it is simply a very nice looking and shooting pistol. Kinda looks like what the desert eagle might have been imagined to look like in the 50's for some sci-fi movie.

$275 and I'll throw in 100 rounds of ammo.

I really everyone is usually in the market for one of those East German Maks, but this one is such a nice gun, too.  It is steady, sturdy, well-built, reliable, and a very fun shooter.  I currently use it as my home defense, but I'm looking for a revolver.  I'd be willing to sell this one for the right price, but I'd almost rather have a trade.  Old, new, used, worn - doesn't matter.  I look at the character and reliability of a gun.  On that note, don't try to low ball, either.

I also have a Hi-Point .380 I'd like to sell/trade.  I know those aren't the most looked at guns, but it's probably the most reliable one I've ever shot in my life.  It's a fun shooter and not very expensive of a gun to keep around as a good home defense weapon."

407,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4271407,For Sale:  7.62x54R Russian Military Surplus 147 gr FMJ-BT,"Alabaster, Alabama, United States",$ 100,"Listed On: Thursday, May 21, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Looking to sell 270 loose rounds of post-WWII Russian 7.62x54R military surplus ammunition. This is LPS steel core light ball ammo in copper washed steel cases loaded with 147gr tombac jacketed Spitzer boat tail bullets. Tips are not painted but a magnet is attracted to both bullet and case. They were removed from Izhevsk stripper clips that came in 15 round paperboard boxes. They are Berdan primed and highly corrosive.

Pretty much all surplus ammunition on the market with Berdan primers is corrosive but it's perfectly fine to use as long as you properly clean your rifle afterwards. The headstamp (188 over E) indicates the ammunition was manufactured in 1954 at Plant No. 188 in Novosibirsk, Russia.

I purchased this post-WWII Russian surplus ammunition about 16-18 years ago in preparation of Y2K. It went straight from sealed storage to a USGI ammo where it's been kept ever since. It is in very good condition with no sign of rust or corrosion.

I'm asking $100 for the lot and will include four (4) original Izhevsk stripper clips. CASH only please. Will meet for Local Pick-up in Alabaster and surrounding area.

Thanks for looking."

This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum.

Initially, small quantities HK-91 “clone” rifles were produced, mostly from surplus parts acquired around the world. From 2002-2006, the reputation of the PTR-91 rifle grew considerably along with the market for it. PTR was organized in 2006 to meet that demand. Over the next few years, the company consistently grew its capabilities. Expanding beyond the original 91 “clone”, PTR began to introduce many other models and variants to suit different shooting applications. Today the company is known affectionately as just “PTR”, due to the fact that the product offerings have expanded well beyond the original PTR-91 rifle. In 2011 PTR stands light-years away from its humble beginnings. The company was re-organized in 2010 with new management, new capital, new focus, and higher expectations. Today, PTR is a full-fledged 21st century firearms manufactur- ing firm, capable of much more than just “clone” rifles. Rather than just assembly personnel and work-benches in the early years, PTR now employs gunsmiths, engineers, toolmakers, and machinists who work with state of the art technology to bring our customers a truly modern firearm. PTR is also no longer dependent on foreign surplus markets – it has the capability to produce every part for PTR rifles right here in the United States. The company has also drastically improved its resources in customer service and support. PTR today produces fine quality firearms in multiple calibers for a variety of applications across the shooting disciplines. The new PTR is committed to providing top-quality firearms to the most discerning shooters be they military, law-enforcement, or civilian. Along with this commitment comes the obligation to stand by every part and firearm that leaves the factory, and provide the customer an excellent experience long after his purchase comes out of the box.

I want to see if I can get some decent accuracy out of this incoming rifle.

By the way I just had a baby girl and haven't broached this subject with the Mrs. so I may end up having to part with this unicorn. I just couldn't pass up the price.

I know we've all heard the stories of ""little old lady, only fired once.""  
Really, my father purchased this for my monther for her safety. She carried it in
her purse for a while.  There are no nicks or scuffs.  See the photos.
Between us, we've probably fired 100 rounds through it.  It has too much 
kick for her now, so gave her something more appropriate.

I'm broke, and need to sell some of my collection, so I can't hold onto it any longer. 

This isn't a pocket gun, but it would be a good concealed carry weapon. 
It's a small frame 5 round revolver.  See the photo where I'm holding it.  I have an average size hand.

I will include a bag of loose range ammo.  I do not have any speed loaders for it.
