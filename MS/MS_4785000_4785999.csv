The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.

Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.

The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.

First on the list is a near-pristine condition Beretta 92G, chambered in 9x19. This is the same model as the 92FS, however has the tactical advantage of no safety. The 92G is a decocker-only model. I have taken her to the range twice and put less than 100 rounds down the barrel. Comes with original box & extra mag. 

Second up for sale is a Zastava M57. The M57 is a Serbian copy of the famous Tokarev, chambered in 7.62x25. Near mint condition with only 25 rounds down the barrel. I bought it new less than a month ago. It is a fantastic shooter in a fun caliber. Comes with half a box of 7.62 Tokarev.

Ideally, I am looking to sell both, but I am open to selling them separately. Not really interested in trades unless it is an HK or Sig P226 or P229 in 9mm.

I just had the gun smith check it out with a bore scope. Thel lands and grooves are in pristine contition.  About 91/30s: nearly all were counter bored to maintain field accuracy despite battlefield conditions.  The projectile does not touch the barrel the last inch or so where the rifling was bored out to about 7.80 mm.  So you could actually drill holes there for a ported barrel.  If you know firearms then you know you can inspect  the rifling by removing the bolt and peering through the breach end towards light. The counter bore as well as the rifling is readily verifiable even by simple field inspection. Before counter boring, these rifles had severe bore and button damage from battle field abuse that drastically reduced accuracy.  Counter boring was the simple and effective solution.This rifle is vVery accurate: I consistently hit hand sized 6 shot groups at 110 meters without wearing my glasses with stock iron sights. This rifle also comes with original bayonet and twin ammo pouches. I will throw in a new rifle soft case as well. Also, for an extra $320, you get  about 800 rounds of steel core ammo : half is FMJ and half Silver tip. Prices are firm and fair. I am asking fair price and will sell for fair price.  Do not waste my time with low ball offers : this  gun and ammo is cheap and if you do not have money to play with the Big Boys then go buy a BB gun.I cannot deliver--too many idiots are ignorant about these rifles and firearms ,generally, and merchandise, generally. Do not waste my time asking.  Please do your homework and be an informed buyer. It will work to both our advantages. You get what you pay for.

231,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4785231,For Sale:  RARE Portuguese Armalite AR-10 top charging handle,"Henderson, Las Vegas, Nevada","$ 3,000","Listed On: Monday, November 9, 2015",Rifles,Armalite                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Portuguese Armalite Ar10 in decent shape. It is a serial number 007XXX with the Porto reinforced lower.
First let's talk about the good. The rifle will be sold with two original magazines, has a potentially hand made wood grip. The entire rifle was painted and the paint on the grip is coming off pretty rapidly, which is good. I haven't used any chemicals on it yet, figured the next owner might want the hobby of cleaning it up. The rifle is tight for it's age. There is some movement between the upper and the lower but not much. It does fire and cycle like a new gun. No issues whatsoever. You are buying a pre ban weapon that actually works.
Now the not so good. As mentioned it was painted, it wasn't what I'd consider a professional job. If it's going to be a show piece then it could use a refinish. It is missing the original buttstock and handguard. For the handguard it has a modern tactical rail (original front sight though). The buttstock pad came with it however it fits poorly/almost not at all. The buffer tube (original) is larger in diameter than modern buffer tubes so finding a buttstock isn't easy. I'm including the buttstock pad that came with it and you're welcome to modify it to fit better or source original parts.
The rifle shows that it was in battle in some spots. Has marks but is an awesome weapon. Has Armalite markings on the barrel and BCG so overall a lot of original parts are there.
Looking for a buyer who knows what it is and I'm willing to meet within reason for local buyers.
I will entertain trades plus cash.
I will ship at buyer's expense to an FFL ONLY. 
I will also entertain offers within reason.
Thanks for reading my mini novel :D"

The Redding Competition Bushing Neck Sizer Die Set includes a Competition Bushing Neck Sizing Die, Body Die and Competition Seating Die. Both the Bushing Neck Sizing Die and the Competition Seating Die feature micrometer adjustments for precision. Bushings and Shellholder sold separately.
Competition Bushing Sizing Die -- With this die, the cartridge case is completely supported and aligned with the sizing bushing before the sizing process begins. As the sizing process starts, the cartridge case remains supported in the tightly chambered sliding sleeve as it moves upward while the resizing bushing self centers on the case neck. The decapping rod is maintained in precise alignment by using the internal parts of the die as a linear support much like a firing pin. While the micrometer adjustment of the bushing position delivers precise control to the desired amount of the neck length to be sized. (Bushings are sold separately)
The Body Die -- is designed to full length resize the case body only and bump the shoulder position for proper chambering without disturbing the case neck. It is intended for use only to resize cases which have become increasingly difficult to chamber after repeated firing and neck sizing.
Competition Seating Die -- The bullet guide to seating stem fit is so precise that the seating stem can actually be demonstrated to float on a column of air. The micrometer is calibrated in .001"" increments. It also has a zero set feature that allows you to zero the micrometer to your rifle or favorite seating depth.

I won this top of the line fire arm in a club raffle, but I already own a Wilson Combat, so this ones up for grabs. It wont last long at this price, I'm only letting it go because I'm going into the AR way. It comes with everything from the Ed Brown shop. The Classic Custom includes all the classic modifications. Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest! In addition to the features on the main handguns page, the Classic Custom features the following: 5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy. Weight: approximately 40 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted. 25 LPI checkering on forestrap and mainspring housing. Special mirror finished slide, with 50 LPI serrations on back of slide to match serrated adjustable sight, top of slide is flattened and finely grooved at 40 LPI. Traditional ""square cut"" cocking serrations on rear of slide only. Adjustable rear sight buried deep into slide, cross dovetail front sight. Two-piece guide rod for smoother cycling and easier disassembly. Mag catch with Oversize 40 LPI checkered button"

Century Arms is the major importer, but the pistol is made in Bulgaria.  Please read the review included in this post.

From a review in Guns&Ammo by Doug Larson:

“The Arcus 98DA is a full-size, short-recoil, locked-breech pistol chambered in 9×19 Parabellum with a frame, slide and barrel CNC machined from steel forgings. The sample gun featured stippled rubber grips that provide a very slip-resistant surface that will help prevent this solid piece from squirming out of your hand. The matte blue finish, while not fine, is evenly applied, and there were no sharp edges on the gun.”
Doug also relates the general rule that the cheaper the gun, the less reliability.  However, in reference to this, he continues “if the Arcus 98DA I tested is indicative of all Arcus 98 pistols, then the company’s expertise has resulted in a rarity—a reliable and inexpensive double-action semiauto.”

It comes with factory case, and 2 - 12 round mags. The pistol is in like new condition.
Specifications: Taurus Millenium G2

Model: 111G2
Finish: Blue
Caliber: 9 mm (.40 coming soon!)
Capacity: 12+1
Weight: 22 oz
Barrel Length: 3.2 inches
Length: 6.24 inches


Fit and Finish * * * * *
The level of quality evident in the G2 is in line with $600 – $900 polymer pistols. No rattles, squeaks, or clumsy machining.

Reliability * * * * *
Zero FTF/FTEs during testing, but due to current ammo shortages, this wasn’t really a complete test.

Accuracy * * * *
For a carry gun, it was accurate enough. This is definitely not a 50 yard pistol, but can definitely be considered combat accurate.

Carry * * * *
From a form perspective, this is a very concealable gun capable of holding a decent amount of 9 mm. However, it has a manual safety that’s hard to (de)actuate in a hurry.

Trigger * * * * *
Crisp and breaks like glass at 6 lbs. exactly. The reset point is a short throw away, and has an audible click. The second strike capability is nice, but in my opinion doesn’t add a lot of value.

Cleaning * * * * *
Super easy.

Overall * * * *
As a standalone product, this is an awesome gun. I was thoroughly impressed and I would have expected something like this to cost $500-$600. For a $349 price tag, this may be the best “bang for the buck” pistol I have had the opportunity to test."

Just as a reference, they sell civvie HST for $30 for a 20 box...50 rd. for $35, or 20 rd. for $30? Feel free to research and check out googling ""Dr Roberts Ballistics"". 180 grain HST is nearly as perfect through all mediums and barriers both penetration and expansion (.70's and .80's...ouch!) Really, Gold Dot is great, easily does the job if YOU DO (cannot overstate), but HST is it for the most conditions. +P is unnecessary (short barrel such as 3.5"" excluded), and adds recoil, requires target reacquisition, adds wear to your firearm, over expands early (hard to pass bone that way) and penetrates too little due to this. Full size 9 is 147 grain territory (few exceptions are more accurate at 124 standard). Okay, lecture over...Dr. Roberts Ballistics tell the story (on Ar15.com I think, see chart at bottom). ALso have 124 and 147 HST 50 rnd. boxes. Just ask. REDACTED."
