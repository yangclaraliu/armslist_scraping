In Sept 1988 a handgun collector in Port Arthur, Texas received a call from Sile Distributers in NYC. The sales agent at Sile said that the Israeli Mossad had ordered a suppressed Beretta 87BB with factory threaded barrel and AWC suppressor but had, at the last minute, canceled the order. Sile sold the package to the TX collector. Sometime during the next year the Texas guy was curious as to how quiet the suppressed gun might be so he fired 24 rounds with suppressor installed. He cleaned the gun and suppressor and put it into his safe where it remained until I bought it about two years ago. By the time I secured my tax stamp and took possession I had lost interest. I have not fired it. If you have any questions or would like additional photos please let me know."

Introduced in 1967, this was the first pistol ever introduced by H&K, and definitely unlike any of its later, far more popular offerings. It most closely resembles a Walther PP/PPK style pistol with a double action / single action trigger, seven round magazine, and slide mounted safety, as well as a recoil spring which coils around the barrel and a straight blowback cycling mechanism.

It differs from the PP style in that it uses a European style heel magazine release and its barrel is not integral to its frame, and in fact the primary selling point of this model was that it is able to fire .22, .25, .32, and .380 calibers needing only a quick change of its barrel and magazine. It was popularly sold as a set with all four of these barrels included, and these sets are extremely collectible and worth thousands. Sadly, this one only has one barrel, in .32, and it's not worth very much.

It is, however, quite well built as you'd expect of an H&K and in good used condition, with only minor scratches and blemishes marring its original finish. It comes with THREE factory .32 8-round magazines -- each one s $50 value if purchased from Numrich parts supplier. Does NOT come with the original box. I expect most of the interest, if any, to come from H&K collectors and completionists.

Will include this as a bonus to go with my other offering currently for sale for the right trade:

This is a custom made Titanium muzzle brake for any rifle that has
1/2x28 threads and fires the .223/5.56 round. The ST-23's Ti construction
 is superior to all other muzzle brakes because it is 50% stronger than 
 steel but only weighs a little more than aluminum. That means it will take
all the abuse you can throw at it, including full auto and sustained fire. It
will not corrode in almost any environment and wont weigh you down
when your on the move.We wont use flashy listings and give you promises
of made up recoil reduction percentages. Our products speak for themselves
through their effectiveness and quality. This proprietary port design does however
reduce recoil and muzzle lift exceptionally well. You have to try it to believe it.
When only the best will do, chose Tactical Advantage Armory.
 All of my parts come with a lifetime warranty
for fit, function, and finish. I even cover stupid once. So if over
time the finish wears or you ding it up, just contact me and ship it back
and I'll repair, refinish, or replace it.

This parts finish is satin titanium, but can be refinished upon request
in TiCamo, Matt Black, F.D.E. or O.D. Green at no additional charge.

303,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4488303,For Sale:  Nighthawk Custom T3 Carry,"Wichita, Wichita, Kansas",FREE,"Listed On: Monday, July 6, 2015",Handguns,Nighthawk Custom                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,no type,Pistol,"The Ultimate Concealed Carry Pistol: They designed this little pistol to allow users to pack the powerful 45acp in a small package, but due to its popularity we now offer it in 9mm. A 4.25"" bushing barrel allows field strip anywhere, and keeps the weight down when compared to pistols of comparable size with tapered cone barrels. Already loaded with options, we find that most customers want it just the way it is.
When it comes time to choose your everyday carry gun there is a lot to consider. You need something that is reliable, accurate, and easy to wear all day. You need something that you can enjoy shooting a lot, because there is no substitute for practice. That's where the T3 comes in. We designed this pistol to be pleasing to the eye, but also to be a workhorse that can stand up to thousands and thousands of rounds.
The T3 has the best features for any gun its size. The frame is based on the Officer model, but for those with large hands, it features an extended magazine well that gives you the length you need to get all your fingers on the grip. The extension also serves another function. The hand-cut geometric angles really add to the looks as well. The slide is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a better sight radius.
Another consideration is weight. The T3 actually weighs one ounce lighter than most officer size 1911s. This makes the T3 the first choice for an all-day carry pistol.
Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eights Night Sights are standard. The mainspring housing, as well as the rear of the slide, are horizontally serrated to match. This feature also helps prevent snags on silk lined jackets and coats that checkering often causes. The top of the slide is also serrated to reduce glare. A Nighthawk Custom© lightweight aluminum trigger that has been blacked-out using Cerakote™ breaks between 3.5 and 4 lbs with no creep. When you put all of these features in one package, you come up with the finest carry gun you can own. 
This gun has been wonderful to own but I now have a newer model and will no longer be needing this one. Anyone that knows 1911s knows that not only is this pistol a weapon but is also a handcrafted piece of art. Here's a chance to own a sidearm that would take you months and months to get from Nighthawk and would cost a damn sight more. MSRP is $3350 and I'm only asking $2700 obo.

The stock does not appear to have been sanded. There is a nice cartouche on the right side however there is only a partial W in the sling well. To the best of my knowledge the flip sight and barrel band (2 rivets) are legit WW2 and not repos. I did not take a picture of the bolt components but the extractor and firing pin (type 1) are Win. The sear and trigger are Win. The bore is bright with good rifling. The ME appears to be about a 3, using a 30-06 round there is about 1/16th. in. of the bullet showing before the case mouth, see picture. I shot a group at 50 yards with it that measures 2in., see picture. The finish is excellent with no rust but has been re-parked sometime in the past. As always with any firearm one should have it looked at by a competent gunsmith. Make sure your FFL or C&R will accept this from me, I do have a C&R. Will also ship to Calif. This would make a nice addition to anyone's collection. Payment by postal MO. Any questions please ask."

This awesome Wilson Recon Tactical SR (suppressor ready) upper is in perfect condition. It has a 14.7” barrel with a permanently attached muzzle device that brings it to a legal length of 16.1”. The barrel was properly broken in and is a tack driver. The hand guard was sent to SanTan Tactical and was cerekoted to match the lower receiver. The lower receiver was built by SanTan Tactical and is one of the toughest, lightest, easiest to use ambidextrous lowers on the market today. The prices given in this build are “real world” (not retail). Most of pricing comes from JoeBobs outfitters, or Midway USA. Here is the pricing breakdown on the weapon……………… Wilson Combat Recon Tactical SR upper = $1,295……….Wilson Combat BUIS = $210…………Ranier Arms Raptor charging handle= $109………… Cerekote lower and hand guard = $140…………SanTan Tactical lower receiver = $289………..Battle Arms Development take down pins=$30…….Battle Arms Development ambi safety=$60………PWS fluted buffer tube=$140………JP silent capture buffer=$140……..CMC 3.5# tactical flat trigger=$168…….KNS gen II trigger pins=$33……Daniel Defense 6 position stock=$67……..Troy Battle Ax grip=$19. Add it all up with absolutely no labor for the build and you come up with $2,700. If you started adding shipping on the parts, labor etc, you can see that this is a smokin deal. The weapon has been completely function tested after the build was complete. Lower and upper lock up tight. The build has less than 100 rounds through it. I welcome any questions.

It is based on the M4 carbine, with which it shares 80% of its parts.
It features a proprietary short-stroke self-regulating gas piston system and bolt carrier/carrier key design, which prevents trapped gases from contacting the bolt carrier or receiver of the weapon, which reduces the heating and carbon fouling of the internals, simplifies field maintenance, and improves reliability.
All M6A2 Rifles Feature a Match Grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown.
The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon.
The bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.
This M6A2 has a low- profile gas block and there is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device.
it also features a longer mid-length free float rail system with rail covers and a removable return-to-zero top so that any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail.
The rail has a monolithic profile so you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly and the longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.
This High-End Rig is Topped with a High-End Nikon M-223 4-16x40 Sniper Scope with BDC.
It also has MOE Magpul Stock and a Magpul MIAD Pistol Grip."

The lightweight, compact design of the Ruger® LCP® Semi-Auto Pistol make it an ideal concealed carry gun, that's comfortable to carry all day, and quick to deploy. The LCP utilizes a double-action only, hammer-fired mechanism, with the hammer recessed into the rear of the slide to prevent snagging. The double-action only firing mode makes it simple to use in stressed situations—no levers or switches to remember—just point and shoot. The LCP features low profile front and rear sights integrated onto the slide that do not snag on clothing when pistol is drawn from a concealed position, and all sharp edges have been eliminated on the LCP to aid in concealment and to reduce wear on clothing. This LCP model features an alloy steel slide with a blued finish. Right-handed shooters can comfortably reach the magazine release on the LCP with their thumb, while left-handed shooters have no problem using their trigger finger. The mag release pushes in easily, but not so easily that the magazine pops out unexpectedly. Unlike many small semi-automatic pistols that operate with a blowback action, the Ruger LCP operates on a locked-breech system, which mitigates recoil and does not necessitate the user to pull the slide back against an excessively heavy recoil spring during loading. The LCP also has a manual slide hold-open latch for inspection and cleaning. The Ruger LCP is a well-designed, reliable Semi-Auto Pistol that one can count on in an emergency. Incudes 1 magazine extension and a soft case"

I don't mind a rifle built by Century, as long as it doesn't have a canted front sight post, excessive mag wobble, or any other issues like that. 

I'm not looking to spend a ton on what will be a project rifle, if I can't buy one privately for less than what I can buy from Buds new, I will just go that route. The only thing I'm willing to pay more for is if you have ammo at a reasonable price per round, or if you have European steel magazines or Pmags. Korean steel mags do not count.

This is for the upper only ****edit To add ran about mag through it to test it an it ran like a clock. Rapid fire with no problems. If someone wants to shoot it before a trade or sale just bring some ammo an we can meet in taylors at my buddy's land*** this little upper runs great and even with the standard birdcage it's very soft shooting. 

This is a unfired upper from andro corp. if you check the reviews on these they are awesome uppers. He has around 500 positive feedback score on ar15.com. Uppers comes with gen 2 magpul sights, quad rail, mil spec bcg and barrel. It's a very nice upper. I can add ammo or pmags to even out trades. Trade value is $425 with the sights or sell for $415. This is an excellent choice for a budget pistol or sbr build. Foregrip, sure fire an mount not included.

In addition to the box and paperwork, it also includes an HK extended magazine release (original also included), and it has Talon grip tape on the frame (which just peels off, should you so desire). 

I received this as part of a trade not too long ago. I ran two magazines through it, and put it in the safe. I'd estimate total round count at a few hundred, but don't know for sure. I can't find any flaws on it.

It runs great, but it's just not my cup of tea. I've done some digging, and a fair price for the package i'm told is around $650--but let me know if i'm off. I'll entertain cash and trade offers.

I'd sell the pistol and accessories with just two magazines for $600. Won't split up the mags (HK USPc compatible) unless the pistol sells first.

I'm open to all sorts of trades, so offer away. Cash/ammo/gear on either end to make the trade fair."
