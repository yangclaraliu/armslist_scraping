The grip is by Nill in size L to XL, with added putty for very long fingers.  The potty can be removed leaving a large Nill trip with no adjustable shelf, or other grips can be used instead (I have a number available that can interchange, or these are available from Nill or Rink, or Earl Sheehan).

The gun comes with a 1 stage match trigger, adjustable for pull and shoe position, but the 2 stage trigger can be used with this gun.  I have that available, at extra cost either instead or in addition to the current trigger.

Outrigger cantilevered weights, and the 10"" barrel can be used with this gun (also available at extra cost).  The OSP form-fitting grips such as the Hofmann grip can be used with this gun.

Price is with 1 magazine, but additional are available.  Offers considered, if they are close.

This gun has been tested mechanically and for accuracy.  Overall accuracy and function are about equal to the current GSP expert, but the recoil buffer is not present, and it can not be converted easily to .32.  

This is one of only severeal GSP and OSP available.  

Discounts on multiple gun purchases.

You can find cheaper GSP guns, but are the tested for function and accuracy, and can they be returned for any reason without a return fee?  Are discounted 2 stage triggers or extra magazines avaiable, or can you get the perfect grip for your use?

Remember, the GSP is an assault weapon both by lineage, and definition in some states or cities.  Be sure it can be transfered to you, if using FFL transfer.  Shipping generally is $40-80 for one or several guns.  No shipping charge for total purchases over $2000.

There's a few scratches near the rear sight from removing it for cleaning and a spot on the wood hand guard near the receiver which is the most noticeable wear.  Some people have said this is Romanian, others that it's a Bulgarian parts kit, but I don't know enough about the differences to say for sure.  It says ""M74 Sporter"" on the recidver.  All I know is the sights are straight and the rifle just works.  Around a few hundred rounds through it.

I lightly polished with dremel and metal polish & it came out 50%. Would come out all the way if you took the time to work it, if it bothered you. I have owned this for 15 to 20 years. Only a couple clips have been shot through it. Been sitting in a gun safe for home protection. No damage or wear anywhere. It is the perfect size to be a conceal/carry gun. Full Stainless Steel, no plastic, so quite strong. Comes with 3 magazines. Very little recoil felt when shooting it. Some reviews on it state that it bucked a little, but must have been the rounds they were using. I felt it shot like a .22, personally.  Lowered the price to $350.  If not sold soon, I will trade it in."

This figure was presented in 1940, The figure is white metal with a silver plate. It measures 12 1/2"" tall and is in excellent, undamaged condition still complete with his walking stick and sword. The base is hand-engraved in script. It reads: Zum 40 jährigen Dienstjubiläum ~ Gewidmet v.d. Gefolgschaft b. Finanzamt Dresden-Annenstrasse ~ 19.4.1940 Frederick is often remembered as the father of Prussian militarism, but Prussia’s location as a border state between larger empires meant that frequent wars were hardly a new phenomenon. Still, Frederick’s long reign unified Enlightenment rationalism and military tradition, yielding a highly trained army and a militaristic system of public education. Frederick’s greatest admirers tended to be those with large continental ambitions. Napoleon made a special visit to Frederick’s tomb in 1806 after defeating Prussia’s army, and Hitler hid the king’s body in a salt mine during the allied bombings of World War II.

I have a link at the bottom of the page with all of the information you might need on it.  

It has been bumped on the front bell where it marred the finish.  No metal damage but finish damage.  I tried to take pictures of the damage and it would not show up on camera.  It is minor but I want to me completely upfront with it.  It also has been mounted in rings and has the lightest of ring marks.  It was used on a 223 ar15 so it has not been beat up at all.
It comes with the box and paperwork.  The only thing I don't have is the flip up covers it came with.  The M-223 mount does not come with it but can for 60$ extra.

As you can see from the pics it has been modified to be more accurate - I have floated the barrel, glass bedded the action, and attached mounts and bent the bolt handle down so the scope will fit on it.  Right now I'm getting about 1.5 MOA which is really good, plus 1 in 4 fliers.  I think because it is the carbine model with the shorter barrel the factory ammo is just a touch overpowered and causing the fliers that are about 6 MOA.  As is I would feel very comfortable shooting a deer, elk, or bear out to 100 yards.  The last 5 deer and 2 elk I've shot have all been below 80 yards so it would be a good hunting gun for the Pacific Northwest.  Not sure because I haven't tried it, but I think if you did your own ammo you could take care of the fliers and you would have a great gun that could go out to 200+ yards.  I don't reload otherwise I would keep it.

Gun - $150
Scope - $40
140 rounds of military surplus ammo - $45
18 rounds of good hunting ammo -$15 
about 35 empty cartriges ready to reload - Free

Total is $250.  
A new super cheap gun with scope and that much ammo would cost at least $550 and it would be tough to find.

I don't want to ship, so you need to be willing to meet in Longview.

I'm not a gunsmith so I would want to get a waiver signed that you understand that.  I've shot at least 60 rounds thru it since it has been modified and I haven't had any issue but it would make me feel better.  The bolt handle was cut and welded back on at the angle and the mounts were welded on also, very shallowly so the structural integrity of the barrel/chamber would not be compromised."

Scope comes with bikini rubber cover and 4"" sun shade as well.  All this package is enclosed in a storm hard plastic airline compliant case with foam padding that is cut out to fit the rifle like a glove.  The rifle has a god-a-grip neoprene rubber finger groove grip attached as well as a leather sling and a foam cheek riser pad that is easily removable.  It has the aluminum bedded accustock that also has the buttstock filled with fiber glass.  This rifle has had 285 rounds fired through it, all of them 175 grain sierra match kings.  It will shoot 1/2 inch groups at 100 yards with this ammo.  I have shot 1000 yard steel plates with boring accuracy with this set up.  I am selling it because I won a ruger precison rifle at a match a few months back and this does not get used any more.  I have about 1900 in this complete set up and will sell the whole package with case, scope, and rifle for 1550 or best offer, this is a very good deal for all of these components combined and this rifle is a very accurate shooter and very capable of less than 8 inch groups at 1000 yards with good ammunition and a good shooter.  text Mike at REDACTED with any questions.

When I bought this gun, it had a terrible grip texture finish on it that I have sanded off with the intention of stippling and Ceracoating. However, I have had an injury to one of my eyes that makes this red dot sight very difficult for me to pick up, even in low light situations. I don’t really want to sell, as I saved and worked for a long time to build this gun, but I need a daily carry weapon that I can use properly with this eyesight issue.

I took the original slant muzzle break off and installed a Tapco Razor brake instead. I also polished the receiver rail guides, bolt, bolt carrier, and bolt carrier channel. I took the liberty of cleaning and re-lubricating the rifle so it is ready for use. There are two blemishes on the rifle. The first blemish is on the bottom of the hand-guard and the second blemish is on the top of the butt-stock right behind the rear trunnion. Someone I showed the rifle to damaged the furniture on accident. I am asking $1,200obo for everything. Update: (I fired 10 rounds of WPA Military Classic 7.62x39mm FMJ ammunition through the rifle on 6/13/15 for function verification. It has been cleaned and re lubricated).

The condition is good and it's all original. 
Union Switch & Signal company of Swissvale Pennsylvania, primarily made railroad signaling equipment but received a contract on May 5, 1942 for the manufacture of 200,000 M1911A1 pistols.  The first pistols were accepted by Ordnance inspectors in January 1943, but the company received word that their contract would be canceled, due to a severe drop in requirements for the pistol.  Within a month U.S.&S. had signed a contract to supply carbine parts. On March 8, 1943 the company was officially notified that their contract had been cut back from 200,000 pistols to 30,000 pistols.  However on June 26th, when the contract was nearly complete, and many of the workers had been transferred to Carbine operations, the company received a letter of intent to purchase an additional 25,000 pistols.  The last of the pistols was shipped on November 27, 1943.  55,000 Union Switch and Signal pistols were delivered serial numbered from 1041405 to 1096404 with peak production reaching 650 pistols a day.   

U.S.&S. pistols are the second rarest of the M1911A1s (55,000 produced), only the Singer is rarer (500 produced).  None of the Union Switch & Signal 1911A1s have the crossed cannons ordnance stamp even thought the practice was standardized in late 1942. Also most of the early pistols up through about serial 1060100 received no “P” proof on the slide and frame.  From about 1060100 to about 1082000, the “P” proof was applied, but at the Left edge of the slide where the curved part meets the flat.  This was due to a poorly drawn ordnance drawing showing the placement of the proof.  From about 1082000 to the end of production, the “P” was placed in its normal location on the top of the slide (center in front of rear sight).  When the ""P"" proof mark is found it will be on both the slide and receiver and be of the same size. Notice the ""P"" proof stamp is smaller then Colts but still an uppercase letter.
The number of different machining operations performed by US&S on the parts for the pistol, was 600. These required the services of 658 different machines; 421 types of cutting and drilling tools; 239 different fixtures, and 447 different gages. While the Government owned the machines, gages and fixtures, US&S provided its own perishable tools. The receiver for each pistol underwent 106 individual operations, during which some four fifths of its weight was machined from the original forging.

Another interesting fact is the development of the US&S firing range, the design of which was later adopted by various pistol manufacturers including Colt. On the range each of the 55,000 pistols produced was test fired 21 times. Not a single pistol manufactured and assembled by US&S was rejected by the resident ordnance department inspector, of the 55,000 pistols fired by the US&S inspector before being passed to the Government Inspector, only two failed in one test. They were found to be completely automatic in action, firing seven shots with one trigger pull. US&S was consistently rated high in tests for Interchangeability of parts.  The test was conducted once a month, the four producers of the pistol being required to send six pistols each to the key inspectors of the small arms pistol industry integration committee. The pistols were taken apart, the parts scrambled, and the 24 pistols re-assembled.

It is reported that Union Switch & Signal produced high quality pistols and did not experience the extreme production problems that Remington Rand and Ithaca had. The ordinance department reported the Union Switch & Signal pistols had a superior finish and consistently rated high in the interchangeability tests. According to the Springfield Research database a lot of these pistols were shipped to the Navy and the OSS.

This early example has the P on both the slide and receiver which is unusual. It was not acceptable for one reason or another and sent to the Salvage Crib to correct the malfunction.  This happened to many pistols, and is only noticeable on this one because of the late date of adopting the P.  There were so many, for example Ithaca sometimes had 10% or more, they became backlogged and often took several weeks or longer to get repaired depending on the severity of the problem.  By the time this pistol was submitted or resubmitted for acceptance the P proof mark had been adopted.  This pistol is a very collectible oddity .
