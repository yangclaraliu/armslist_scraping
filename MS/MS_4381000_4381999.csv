They ALL have 2 things in common and that makes it easy to spot their ads. 
1) they are all ""unregistered""
2) there is no phone number in their ads

however, there is other things that set them apart. The price seems unreasonably low, they have multiple ads for hard to find items or items in strong demand, no photos, offers to trade you for your lower price items, etc.

we can only do this if we band together and flag these ads. Thank you.

(Im pretty shake'y so im pretty positive the gun and scope are fine.) The scope is only bore sighted on right now because i had it on my 300 until i upgraded to a vortex viper. i could go sight it back in for you if you wanted. 
I also have many boxes of ammo in 150 grain. (about 7).  barnes, hornady, remington core lock, winchester, nd some cheap federal and vortex, plus about 30-40 misc rounds, most likely federal and about 10 handloads that my good buddy made me. I am willing to sell all of those as well, prices would just depend on the type, most likely all about half price of whatever they are at sportsmans. or i would just throw them all in with the riffle for $500-550

I can send more pictures if interested. it really is  great riffle, has a good scope, and a lot of really good ammo.

If it's not traded by Tuesday I'll sell it at my local gun store and buy the .45 there. Not for sale privately, please don't ask how much. I want a 1911 .45 for it. I'd prefer a Springfield but any normal slide length will be fine. Don't want a short slide."

Monday I'm ordering the last touches for this rifle and it stays right here. PLEASE READ THE AD BEFORE MAKING OFFERS. I have pictures to send but aparently armslist cant keep up with simple camara phone techknowlogy so I'll have to email them. I guess making it harder for people to post multiple ads is way more important while spamming us with ads rateher than making the site more user friendly takes presidence. It seems greed has not only poisned the users but admin too. If I come across as a bit harsh please excuse me but I'm pretty well fed up with the nonsense. So lets get down to business. What I have here is a flawless mil-spec S&W M-4 AR. This is not the cheap ass slick side sport you can buy at Wal-Mart for $600. If that's what you want there's nothing wrong with that, but if you want a quality AR in this world of mass produced junk that doesn't do what it should than this is the one you want. I have run under 500 rounds thru it but have not had a single problem with those few rounds. Not one FTF, FTE, or thank goodness a bolt over. It hits where you point it and eats any ammo you fed her. I know thats what a rifle is supposed to do but after a pile of AR's this is the first one I've squeezed the trigger on that just does what it should when it should. I like this rifle but when it comes down to it I'm just an AK guy. So I'd like to trade to an AK or take your cash and go buy a nice AK. I'll elaborate on trades below. Here's the full break down of what this package includes as well as the original parts. I doubt you'll find prices any lower than what I have into this but maybe you can. This is what I've payed unless I've found it at retailers for less, then I listed the part at that price.

$2400 minus 25% to reach fair used value = $1800. That's my FIRM cash price picked up locally. Same trade value as long as you follow the same formula. Ask new price on your trade and my price returns to $2400. I didn't fall off the turnip truck yesterday so don't treat me like I did. I'd prefer to keep this lot together but there are a few items I'd separate to help lower trade value if need be."

But with a twist. You can fire it the old way or the new way. For the old way, you soak your patches, cast your lead balls in a mold, fix your primer to the bullet, insert your percussion cap, pour in your pre-measured black powder and off you go. Just like in the olden days with all the smoke and noise. For the new way, you can use the speed loaders with rifled bullets just like the snipers use. You purchase pre-made patches, bullets, etc and just pour everything in to the speed loader.

This rifle is perfect for those hunters wanting a more intimate hunting experience. You get one shot. A lot of hunters feel that type of shooting is more fair to the animal. Whether you use the speed loaders or do it old school, it's traditional shooting. Power? It's 50 caliber folks. 44 magnum ain't got nothin on a 50. This round will stop the most determined pig/hog and with the rifled barrel, your accuracy is pretty much guaranteed.

This looks like your great grandfather's rifle, but isn't. The rifle has a composite (not wooden) stock and all metal barrel and mechanism parts. The military style blade sights give a great sight picture in low light. Easy to clean and maintain. The weight of the rifle is pretty substantial and takes a lot of the kick, so it's a comfortable rifle to fire and carry. The blued finish is easy to keep clean. Comes with a carry bag/case.

I am looking to sell it for $200 (or best offer) or trade for a hand gun. If you have a pistol you no longer use and would like to offer me in exchange, let me know. Text me ONLY at: REDACTED, that way your offer/question will have a date stamp and as it's first come, first served, you'll be at the head of the line. Thanks for looking."

Knowledgeable riflemen were quick to try one, liked what they saw and spread the word. Today, Kimber rifles are favored by many of the world's most accomplished hunters and shooters, and limited production keeps people standing in line to buy them. 

Kimber rifles offer a combination of features that set them apart from all other production brands. Barrels, chambers and triggers hold critical match grade dimensions for accuracy. Pillar and glass bedding ensures both accuracy and strength. Walnut stocks are finished and checkered by hand, and Kevlar-carbon fiber stocks are the finest available on a production rifle. As with Kimber pistols, all work is done inside the Kimber factory—the only way to ensure quality.

The 9mm cartridge in a 1911 designed for concealed carry may be the best of both worlds when it comes to muzzle controllability and magazine capacity in a 1911. The T4 contains some of the most evolutionary features offered by the company. The T4 resembles the popular T3, but on a 3.8” barrel platform. Reliability was the most important consideration when plans for the new pistol began, hence the 3.8” Nighthawk match grade barrel over the more popular but less reliable 3.5” or shorter barrel. The proven Bob Marvel Everlast® Recoil System was modified to fit into the smaller T4 frame, thus reducing felt recoil and decreasing recovery time between shots. The frame is thinned just like Nighthawks popular Lady Hawk. The proprietary barrel is crowned and recessed with the slide. On the outside, the front of the slide has cuts designed to reduce weight. They taper in towards the crowned barrel, giving a unique look to the T4 like no other handgun produced by Nighthawk. Grips are like the T3 and are thinned for less bulk."

Serial - DR 37xx. Parts are mismatched, this is normal for Romanian contract snipers because these guns were not originally built as snipers, but rather converted from standard vz.24 models at the factory. Parts are all Czech built and nothing looks replaced since the war. Finish is worn pretty good with very minor pitting in some areas on the surface. Stock looks like it has never been sanded and has a lot of character. It has some disassembly marks on the magazine floor plate. Import marked on the bottom of barrel. Original Czech Factory turned down bolt. Has cleaning rod. You can still see the top of the crest on the receiver from before it was converted into a sniper by the Czechs. Bore looks great, clean, no pitting. Iron sights can be used through the scope block mounts.

Scope mounts are hard to find. But not impossible. Originals and repros pop up every now and then on Gunbroker, ebay, or at gun shows.

Up for sale is a 2004 Dodge Ram 1500 

-Regular Cab 
-SLT package
-4x4 
-5.7L Hemi
-165,000 miles
-True dual exhaust (This means the check engine light IS ON due to the O2 sensors. If I remember correctly, it reads a cylinder 2 or 4 misfire. It has been this way for almost 8 years now, ever since I got the truck and had the exhaust done. You're welcome to bring a computer to check the code for yourself and/or a mechanic to check the truck over.) 
-35"" Federal Couragia tires on 20"" Helo HE879 wheels
-cold air intake
-power driver's seat
-towing package
-off-road package
-aftermarket CD player

The truck is in good condition cosmetically and mechanically sound. I've never had to do anything to this truck outside of typical, routine maintenance. There is a tear in the drivers seat and it has some here and there dings. Absolutely nothing major. The wheels and tires only have about 3,000 miles on them. It will come with the original 17"" wheels with 33"" tires (not much tread remaining). NO RUST.

The only reason I'm selling this truck is because I bought a Challenger and I have absolutely no need for a truck anymore. It hasn't ever been taken off road outside of going to a fishing hole. 

I'm asking $7,000 OBO. You're welcome to make me an offer on it, but if you look around, you'll notice that my asking price is more than fair. The KBB and NADA values on the truck are $6,700-$7,200, and that's without including the wheels and tires which were another $1,800. Clean and clear title in hand."

     Firearm has been very well kept and cleaned after each outing. I drew out for my deer hunt in Utah and would really prefer to use a .308 over 5.56. I also am trying to plan an elk hunt as well but this is my only rifle so I NEED a .308! That being said im willing to trade all for an AR10 because I prefer the platform. I am open to any semi auto .308 trade.  Let me know what you have. I will sell all for $1,100 OBO 

  Buyer or trader must be willing to sign a bill of sale and be in legal order to posess firearms. Im currently in Utah but im willing to travel.

I am willing to part it out if you see something you are interested in let me know and I'll give you a price.

If it begins to be parted out I will renew the ad with updated list of remaining parts. Thanks!!
I have a custom, high end, FDE 5.56 AR15 For Sale.  This Rifle was custom built with the best  precision made parts that money can buy. This was the most expensive AR that in my 20 plus years of building Custom AR's, I have ever had the pleasure of building. The Trigger, Muzzle Break, Charging Handle, & Stock alone were nearly $1000, not to metion the $600 for the Matching Upper & Lower Receivers and the FDE Cerekote. Again this Rifle is complete precision, in case you haven't heard of San Tan or Tac Con Triggers, San Tan Makes the BEST AMBI BILLET UPPER AND LOWER ON THE MARKET IN MY OPINION, and the TAC CON IS A 3 MODE DROP IN PRECISION TRIGGER THAT IS BATFE LEGAL SO NO STAMP NEEDED TO OWN. IT USES A POSITIVE RESET TRIGGER SETUP THAT WHEN USED PROPERLY IS AS CLOSE TO FULL AUTO AS YOU CAN LEGALLY GET WITHOUT A STAMP. HAS SAFE/TWO STAGE MATCH TRIGGER/ AND 3RD MODE IS THE POSITIVE RESET OR AS I CALL IT HELL FIRE MODE. LOL  . I am asking less than half of cost, (Can provide copy of receipts for each part on it if buyer requests.) because it was a partial down payment no show order that I ended up completing out of my pocket and am just wanting to recoupe my losses. So this is the deal of the century for one lucky local armslist buyer. I don't ship and don't have PayPal so don't ask or waste either of our times trying to get me too. This has had exactly 50 Rounds fired on it to sight it in and try the trigger. So it is new condition.  Anyway I'll run down the majority of the list of parts on it.

I am looking for an outdoor area, where I can shoot (target practice) safely in Johnson County.
I am a 65 yr. old man, and a responsible business owner, who is looking for a remote field or yard away from populated areas that I can use 2 to 3 times a month. I would use it for an hour per visit on weekends only. I would compensate the property owner $50 per hour for access to their land. I would also pay a retainer fee if necessary.

I am a very experienced shooter,  and have continued target shooting and hunting with a variety of guns all my life. 

We live in Greenwood on the south side and there is not an acceptable place to shoot except for indoor ranges which are usually crowded and unappealing. I'd rather spend that time on a pleasant, outdoor site where I can pursue my hobby and relax.

I will respect your property as if it was my own, and I will clean the area thoroughly when finished. I'll also use my own targets.

Please reply with your information.

Thank you,"
