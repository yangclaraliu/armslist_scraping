Prefer a newer one, but would also consider a police trade in model (especially one with night sights!) There was one on here a while back but I couldn't get ahold of the gentleman that owned it and missed the opportunity. I do not want the Type F model with the slide mounted safety/decocker as I dislike slide mounted safeties. 

another pistol I am interested in picking up would be a Lionheart LH9 MKII (the one with novak sights and a rail for lights/etc.) 

also interested in a FNS-9 LEO version without the manual safety, FNX-9 as well - prefer night sights. Interested in pretty much any pistol with a threaded barrel in 9mm or .45acp like Glocks, sigs, etc. Would also be interested in a Sig P250 full size 9mm, Sig P320 striker fire model as well. 

throw me your offers, I can be reached at 314-941-60three4

The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

Designed as a DMR, the MK220 retains lethal capability out to 800 meters with varying types of ammunition. The PWS Long-Stroke Piston The PWS long-stroke piston system combines the agility of the AR-15 with the reliability of the AK-47 into a sleek and efficient design. Smooth Recoil Impulse By utilizing a one piece design, the PWS piston system creates a purely gas to metal operation, rather than metal on metal contact that you may see in other designs. That, in addition to the longer dwell time from the increased mass in the Enhanced Bolt Carrier, creates a pushing action rather than a punch. This results in dramatically reduced felt recoil. Adjustable Gas Block Our four position adjustable gas block restricts gasses, rather than venting them from the side. This allows the unused gas to exit from the front of the gun, rather than the sides of the gas block, resulting in a more quiet operation. Position 1 is for normal operation with standard and some military ammunition. Position 2 is for use with hotter loads such as military ammunition.     Adjustable Gas Block Our four position adjustable gas block restricts gasses, rather than venting them from the side. This allows the unused gas to exit from the front of the gun, rather than the sides of the gas block, resulting in a more quiet operation. Position 1 is for normal operation with standard and some military ammunition.   Position 2 is for use with hotter loads such as military ammunition.   Position 3 is for suppressed use when running standard ammunition. Position 4 is for suppressed use when running hotter loads. An “X” position allows for removal the gas plug for annual maintenance. QPQ Istonited Barrels Utilizing only the highest quality chromoly barrel blanks, mk2 barrels are turned in house then Isonite QPQ® treated for surface hardness and corrosion resistance.  Twist Button rifled barrels feature a 1:10 twist. Chamber MK2 rifles are chambered in .308 Win. Profile Our barrels are designed with a heavier profile that increases longevity and accuracy, creating a balance between weight savings and sustained durability. Enhanced Buffer Tube Machined from one piece of 6061 aircraft-grade aluminum, PWS engineers were able to pack more features into the PWS buffer tube.  Goodbye Castle Nut Eliminating the castle nut, the PWS EBT’s unique indexing screw & plate system ensures secure fit and precise alignment.  Carrier Tilt Features a lip that extends into the receiver to support the back of the carrier to compensate for carrier tilt.  QD Attachments Unlike aftermarket items, PWS EBT QD attachments are machined directly into the aluminum for durability and weight savings.     Debris MK2 buffer tubes are fluted, creating channels for debris, and feature four drain holes on the bottom to allow for faster water drainage.   Buffer Low contact points allow debris to fall into channels, while Nickel Teflon coating keeps carbon from sticking. PWS machinists engrave the PWS logo directly into the 4140 stainless. Free-Floated Handguard PWS engineers designed a handguard which is ergonomic as well as durable. Featuring the KeyMod interface, the mk2 series handguard eliminates unnecessary weight and allows for a wide range of accessory placement. Extruded Handguards are extruded, then machined from aircraft grade 6061 aluminum. Picatinny Top Rail Impact extruded, then machined from aircraft grade 6061 aluminum, every handguard comes standard with a full-length Picatinny top rail and two 2 inch Picatinny sections. QD Attachments Integral sling swivel attachment points round out the front and back of the handguard. Keymod Interface The KeyMod Interface System was developed for multiple accessory compatibility without the need for Picatinny rails surrounding your handguard. This improved design enhanced the rail’s comfort and functionality without sacrificing strength and durability. Upper & Lower Forgings Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is as light as possible, mil-spec 7075 aluminum forgings are used for the upper and lower receivers. Each upper and lower are meticulously CNC-machined for perfect fit and function.  Coating After machining and blasting, all aluminum parts are Hardcoat Annodized at Type III Mil-Spec, for corrosion and wear resistance. Magpul Furniture All PWS rifles ship with durable Magpul furniture. SPECIFICATIONS:CALIBER: .308 WINWEIGHT: 9lbs, 7ozOVERALL LENGTH: 39.5""BARREL LENGTH: 20""MUZZLE DEVICE: PRC- Precision The PWS Precision Rifle Compensator (PRC) was designed to reduce the maximum amount of felt recoil while allowing the shooter to maintain an accurate sight picture of the intended target. Wider on the bottom than other PWS compensators, the PRC minimizes ground disruption when firing from the prone position."

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by Sig Sauer, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. Featuring the Sig internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. SigLite night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous.

I initially acquired this rifle with the hopes of perforating some coyotes, but I haven't used it for anything but target practice. It is, however, an incredibly smooth and accurate rifle, I'm just looking for something a bit lighter and more modular at the cost of accuracy. The rifle has seen less than 1000 rounds in it's lifetime, and has been cleaned and lubed regularly. 

The rifle has had an ACE Skeleton fixed rifle stock installed with a rifle buffer as well as a Hogue textured pistol grip, rubber ProMag magwell grip, an extended bolt release/catch, and an adjustable bipod. The TA01-NSN ACOG w/ killflash won't be going with the rifle, though. It is on there to look pretty. The trirtium is almost dead anyway.

I also have 4 GI 30 Rounders and 3 translucent MSAR XM30E4 magazines to go with it."

While this rifle may look like an AKM, the only similarities are the 7.62x39 caliber. Magazines and other AK upgrades will not work with this rifle, however, Vz.58s have their own aftermarket. In addition, the rifle uses a piston-cocked striker as opposed to the traditional hammer fired AK or AR. The safety placement is more akin to an AR and can be actuated with the right thumb. The takedown is similar to an AR as well, with two captive pins holding the upper receiver onto the lower. This rifle can also be loaded using SKS stripper clips.

Willing to pay up to $4000 with the right accessories:  foregrip, # of mags, optic (Eotech) etc.  Armslist/Gunbroker has 3-4 bare-bones conversions going for $3000-3250, I'll pay a slight premium to save on shipping/FFL but please be aware, I'm looking for a fair deal for both parties."

A modern pistol in every sense, the XD is packed with bells and whistles, but still affordable for the average shooter.
The XD's legendary Point and Shoot Ergonomics combines natural pointability with a compact, contoured polymer grip, creating an instrument that feels more like a natural extension of your body than an object in your hand.
The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch that there is a round in the chamber. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied. The Tactical version incorporates a longer sight radius for even better accuracy."

This is a Remington 700 AAC-SD .308 Win rifle, 20"" Heavy tactical Threaded barrel, never used.  It sits in a Manners Composite Stocks (the absolute best stocks on the planet) custom-ordered stock and their top of the line - MCS T5A DBM ... T5 is their tactical Thumbhole style stock A for adjustable and denotes their Loggerhead KMW adjustable cheekpiece (A $300 option if you wanted it on your regular stock, plus gunsmith installation), DBM = Detachable Bottom Metal ... which m which denotes their Badger Ordnance Mini-Chassis, which provides perfect lockup between stock and action and free-floats the barrel entirely, while providing for the use of detachable magazines - both AICS (Accuracy International/chassis-system) and Accurate Magazine (competitors) work in this.  

it also has a brand new, never been fired-on, Nikon Monarch 5-20x44mm Side Focus / Bullet Drop Compensator scope... one of the best values for dollar in the optics segment.

Also a Harris S-BRM pivot 6""-9"" bipod, a Viking Tactics heavy-duty padded tactical sling, heavy duty sling swivels (mounted in the custom-made flush cups in the stock), a custom bolt handle , and oh yeah the rifle stockis in custom molded-in Forest Camo.

This is a $800 rifle, a $1200 stock, a $550 scope, a $125+ bipod, $100+ sling and hardware, $75 bolt-handle upgrade, $50+ rings and bases,  and even had a gunsmith do the installs.  I have over $3000 in this package, but I am at the point where I have been unable to sell it for a reasonable price- 

if you want it, give me $1500 bucks today and it's yours.  I cannot believe a $3000+ custom ""sniper""-style tactical rifle can be still unsold at $1,500."

A three-point takedown safety system will not allow you to break down the firearm with the magazine in the gun or without the slide locked to the rear, making it difficult for an accidental discharge to occur.
Interchangeable polymer grips offer a secure hold and accommodate a wide range of hand sizes.
Lightweight and durable Flat Dark Earth polymer frame slide. Double-action striker fire operating system. Quick takedown with no tools required."

I already have my apartment in Phoenix lined up, so now I just need to either sell my guitars before I move, or if I move and end up having to ship the guitars to myself in Phoenix I will only be interested in local trades for firearms at that time!  As a student (with expensive taste in firearms) saving money and avoiding paying shipping on the same item twice is important to me.

This guitar is in excellent/mint condition. I'm the original owner who purchased it brand new in September 2014. Guitar was used sparingly and respectfully in a rotation with other American made guitars. As always, my gear is babied and kept in their bags or cases when not being used. Speaking of cases, the Fender tweed hard case this guitar comes with is pretty sweet if you dig tan and orange velvet! Never dinged, dropped, gigged etc. Light pick swirling on the pick guard, otherwise the finish looks flawless. Comes with all tags and papers, keys, strap locks, suede Fender strap, pack of Ernie Ball and pack of Elixir strings.

For buyers who aren't too familiar with this model:
-Made in America
-LSR roller nut
-Contoured heel for easier access to upper frets
-Deluxe Fender/Schaller locking tuners
-Softer C-neck profile
-Dual-coil ceramic Noiseless pickups

Why pay $1600+ online when you can buy one for much less? Only reason why I'm selling this is because I'm trying to do the impossible and limit myself to one guitar while I go back to school full time. Serious buyers please message me to request more photos.

$1250.00 includes ground shipping with insurance for buyers in the continental U.S.  Pickup in Boston for less."

The GLOCK 21 is a full-size high capacity pistol that puts proven firepower and trusted reliability in your hands. GLOCKs corrosion-resistant, ergonomically ideal, stronger-than-steel polymer frame provides a strong base that dampens recoil. The durable cold-hammered steel slide and barrel are coated with GLOCK's high tech Tenifer 64 HRC surface treatment.
Safe Action trigger system teams a trigger safety, trigger bar, and firing pin lock that automatically deactivate one after another as the trigger engages. The barrel's rounded interior profile offer easier cleaning and longer lasting precision. Loaded chamber indicator. Built-in mounting rails for tactical lights or laser sights. Double action. Black finish. Fixed sights.
Even though this is a used gun, you will have a hard time finding any signs of this pistol ever being fired. This is as close to new as you can get without paying “new gun” prices."

The Czechs have a long and glorious history of small arms manufacture, and under Soviet rule, they were the one Russian satellite country given permission to create alternatives to Russian weapons. The VZ.58 was an alternative to the AK-47. It fires the same round and looks cosmetically similar, but the mechanism and magazines are different. Function is very similar, the most noteworthy difference being that the bolt locks open on empty magazine.

This is one of the Century Arms rebuilt kit rifles. The receiver and barrel are U.S.-made. The furniture and most other parts are Czech. Furniture is the Czech ""wood-impregnated"" plastic - it has an interesting old-fashioned wooden look but is supposed to be more weather-resistant. The gun is in great shape with under 300 rounds through it. I polished the feed ramp.

It is very handy (the only gun I own that I would compare favorably with an M1 Carbine or Winchester 1894 for overall handiness), and the folding metal stock allows it to be very compact - I think it would fit in a backpack, though I haven't actually tried.

It comes with five magazines, which hold 30 rounds each. It fires the same 7.62x39 round as the SKS and AK-47. I can include some ammunition as a sweetener.

In full disclosure: Century Arms is not a particularly respected manufacturer. I love this rifle, but while it worked 100% for me with FMJ Tula rounds, I got some jams with HP Wolf rounds. Your mileage may vary. In my case, I was thinking of it as a potential home defense weapon, and if I can't use HP rounds in it, I'm not as interested. If you approach it as a range toy, it's a thing of beauty.

I am realistic about its value.

The VZ.2008
Cardboard box
Leather magazine pouch and five magazines

Introducing the most consistent and reliable barrier ammo on the market.
1) FLEXLOCK® BULLET incorporates two revolutionary Hornady features: the patented Flex Tip® that initiates consistent expansion every single time while preventing any clogging, and the heavy duty InterLock® band that locks the jacket and core together.
2) CANNELURED BULLET WITH CRIMPED CASE ensures no bullet setback during feeding.
3) INTERLOCK® BAND works to keep the bullet and core from separating for maximum weight retention and proven terminal performance through all FBI test barriers.
4) CORE is made of high-antimony lead making it extremely tough, delivering controlled expansion for unparalleled terminal performance consistency through all FBI test barriers. It’s also more economical than similar bonded bullets.
5) NICKEL-PLATED CASES resist corrosion and greatly enhance low-light chamber checks.

Law enforcement and tactical professionals now have a truly advanced, 21st century handgun ammunition solution that delivers the most consistent and reliable urban barrier performance ever created! The proven Flex Tip® design of the new FlexLock® bullet eliminates clogging and aids bullet expansion.

I bought this one to take the place of my G20SF as a lighter alternative for hiking/backpacking, but never found a suitable holster that I liked, so it's been parked in the safe.

This is a package deal and I'm not going to break up the package.

PACKAGE includes: 
 - The G29SF in the factory box with all the factory accessories (two original magazines, cleaning rod, brush, papers, etc.)
 - ONE factory Glock 15 round magazine with an A&G grip sleeve, and one extra grip sleeve.
 - Two Pierce grip extensions (on the two factory magazines) and one extension new in the packaging.  NOTE: These only provide a place for your pinky and do not add rounds to the mag.
 - Serpa Holster.

This is ready for immediate carry- just buy some cartridges and holster the gun.

The sights are dated 2009, so I'm assuming it was made in 2009. The guy I got it from a couple months ago said it had only been shot 50 times. It looks it. I traded it away because I had another one. It isn't as nice as this one, and I'd rather have the non-pristine one. That's oil-soaked lint in the close-up picture. What I'd prefer is to trade this TRP for a nice, worn, comparable 1911. If you have a finish-worn Les Baer or Ed Brown, even, I've got this sweet 1958-vintage 44 Mag Ruger Flattop I could offer up to go with the TRP. I got it from the original owner last year. I just picked up a shooter Flattop, so this one can go for the right deal. My cash/trade value on the TRP is $1050. For the Flattop, $850, if it's necessary for a deal. This is mainly an I've-got-itch-for-something-else thing. I'm not committed to getting rid of these, so if I don't get any interest, it's no big deal. Thanks





FTF, only, near Lexington, NC. I'll need to see your permit. I have a CCW. I don't have any cash to add, so no need to offer me that engraved Wilson Combat, unless you want to trade it .even for my two very nice guns.  Or, your gun and some cash for my two guns, depending on what yours is worth.


***I've got this old-school custom Pre-Series 80 Colt Combat Commander, if you'd prefer a trade including this instead of the revolver. I don't know who did the work. It was probably done back in the 80's. It's hard-chromed. It's been carried. It's got some VZ grips on it now. I don't have these grips any more. Just thought I'd include this, in case the revolver was a hard sell. I figure $700 is more than fair for this one, if it's necessary for the deal. Thanks"

Another unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip. The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands.  The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.Comes with 2 magazines and interchangeable sight options.Call Mike @ REDACTED  CASH ONLY Free Box of Ammo with purchase"

The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero. The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele trggers. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with. Caliber: 7.62 NATO/.308 Winchester.
