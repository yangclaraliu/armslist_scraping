From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

The PWS rifle is revolutionary in the AR15 world. It was the first AR15 to have a long-stroke gas piston system. The piston system is very AK47-like, so the reliability is 2nd to none. The bolt carrier group and pistol rod are nickle boron, so they never need lubrication. This rifle is chambered in .223 wylde, which will accept .223 AND 5.56, but will provide more accuracy for .223 compared to shooting .223 out of a 5.56 chamber. The PWS gas system is adjustable for different settings/conditions. The Keymod rail on the rifle allows for multiple attachments. Has magpul flip-up sights. The PWS muzzle break that's pinned and welded on the rifle cuts all recoil from the rifle. Comes with box, manual, gas adjustment tool. Comes with Hard Case, manual, lock, warranty card, gas system adjustment tool and one 30 round magazine.

Less friction equals less surface wear which will extend life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier.

One of Kimber's top-of-the-line, compact carry guns (7 + 1 rounds) the Super Carry Ultra not only looks great, it shoots great. Night sights (with a flat shoulder for one-handed operation), rounded heel on the grip, ambi safety, two-tone finish, scallop-type serrations on the slide and front-strap of the grip. This is NOT a Series II gun. This gun DOES NOT have the Ultra Annoying Series II Firing Pin Safety...one of the reasons I like it so much. The other thing I like is the weight...25 ounces empty.

I bought this gun new but have since acquired a Super Carry Ultra + so I have no need for this one.

It includes the box and all the original propaganda and other items shipped with a new gun. One magazine...YOUR CHOICE of the Kimber-supplied mag or a Wilson Combat mag.  Actually, there's no external wear with the exception of a small spot on the left side of the slide. I think that was a weak spot in the finish more than wear because I haven't really carried the gun much at all.

I've owned the gun less than 2 years so the sights are still bright. I probably have fired in the neighborhood of 200 rounds through the gun. It's never had a failure of any type with various types of ammo including steel-cased and various types/brands of hollow points.

Benelli's SuperNova Tactical embodies a modular design concept in a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. At the heart of this pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the SuperNova Tactical super-light, super-strong, and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova Tactical isn't just tough on the outside. Dual-action bars and a two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel ensures that the SuperNova Tactical is rock solid to the core and capable of handling everything from 2-3/4"" light loads to 3-1/2"" Magnums.

This SuperNova Tactical comes with newly designed, military-style ghost-ring sights (the harder to find version, sold out just about everywhere). The rear sight is click-adjustable for both windage and elevation. A magazine cut-off on the forearm allows for safe carry with a full magazine and empty chamber. The top of the SuperNova's receiver is drilled and tapped to accommodate easy attachment of military-style optics.


Benelli’s SuperNova Tactical is a modular concept pump action shotgun, that can be configured to fit any defense or tactical situation. The ComforTech stock absorbs nearly 48% of felt recoil to dampen the recoil of heavy buck shot loads. In addition to taming recoil, the ComforTech system minimizes barrel climb, putting you back on target twice as fast as other comparable shotguns. For tight quarters when clearing buildings or in a patrol vehicle nothing beats the compact versatility of the SuperNova.

This Benelli Supernova Tactical (20155) is a pump action shotgun that fires the 12 gauge shell. It has an 18.5” cylinder chrome lined barrel, overall 40"" length, 2-3/4"", 3"", & 3.5"" chamber, with a matte black finish. 7.8 lbs unloaded. This is a brand new shotgun that holds 5 shells (4+1 capacity) and comes complete with a Comfortech stock, receiver, barrel, ghost ring sights, stock shims, etc., manual, warranty card, and a box. Complete! All Mint, NIB. Many options available.

The Benelli SuperNova embodies a modular design concept in a pump action shotgun. It’s like having several Benelli shotguns in one.

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11 SLW (Super Light Weight) is one of the lightest, fastest-handling rifles available in the DDM4 line-up. Built around a Cold Hammer Forged, 14.5” Lightweight profile barrel, the V11 SLW has an Extended Flash Suppressor which is pinned and welded to reach the NFA required 16” minimum barrel length. The Mid-length gas system provides smooth and reliable cycling under any conditions and reduces both perceived recoil and wear on moving parts. A free-floating SLiM Rail 12.0 handguard offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. With the KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock and an uninterrupted 1913 Picatinny rail on top, the V11SLW has plenty of room for the sights, optics, and accessories the operator may require. The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

Whether you are buying your first AR rifle, or need an affordable yet accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is for you. Built to bridge the gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this introductory level carbine features a 16′ light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible, six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny Rail. The 16″ barrel, although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.
   We have 3 in stock, and have them priced to sell quickly for just $519 each.

I purchased this hornady progressive reloading press 2yrs ago and it has served me well. It only has about 10,000 rounds to its name so far so it is only yet getting broken in! All parts are clean, complete, and in good working order. I built a custom wood stand to mount the hornady to my workbench, which I would include at no extra charge if you want it. Also included are qty: 15 extra die bushings to make caliber changes very quick. 

I also have Hornady custom grade dies in 9mm luger, 40 s&w, 45 auto, and 223 remington. I will include one die set of your choosing and will sell additional die sets for $25 each. I also have shell plates for all the above calibers: shellplate #1, #8(9 mm), #10(10mm, 40 s&W), #16( 223 remington, 380 auto). I will of course include the shellplate that corresponds with your caliber free of extra charge. Any additional shellplates i would ask $25. 

also included in the package are 10 extra retainer springs still in their original packaging. these springs will break over time and its nice to have plenty of extras on hand so your ammo reloading doesn't come to a hault. 

If you know your reloading equipment this is a solid machine at a great price, I have priced everything to sell, please ask if you have questions."

I have for sale a 1898 Krag-Jorgenson rifle that has been sporterized. While it could be put back into it's original military configuration, those parts are not with the gun. The work appears to have been nicely done. It has been drilled, tapped, and fitted for a Weaver side mount & base for a scope, which is included. The stock is a Fajen with Monte Carlo cheek piece perfect for a scope. It has been fitted with a low scope safety. It has a set of open sights, that can be used also. The wood is in very good condition with only a few dings here and there. The metal is in slightly better than average shape considering its 117 years old! It has some external pitting all over the rifle, but the bore is quite good with strong rifling yet. This is a very nice shooter grade Krag! However, the usual disclaimers. I have not personally fired the rifle, it belonged to a relative, and I have no idea when the last time it was fired. Please have it checked out by a gunsmith before firing. No warranties on the suitability of the use of this firearm are expressed or implied. It is up to the purchaser to determine the safety of this firearm before use. I can provide additional pictures if interested. Would prefer not to ship, local pickup only at this time."

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want ‘em.The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!
Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.

This has the Grey (550 Type) Upper. This is the 133rd Sig556 ever made! Serialization started at JS001500 for these rifles. I dare anyone to find this factory color scheme. This Sig is simply a rare thing!!

RUGER SUPER BLACKHAWK HUNTER  STAINLESS
.45 COLT
7.5"" BARREL
LAMINATED GRIPS
Combine the Ruger Super Blackhawk Hunter with the 45 Colt and modern loads and you have a near perfect hunting revolver.
The Ruger Hunter series was always a steady seller in the 44 Magnum.  Ask any 45 Colt fan and they will tell you that the only thing better than a 44 Magnum is a properly loaded 45 Colt!  In the larger Ruger frame, the 45 Colt really turns from a mild ""cowboy action"" cartridge to a very efficient large bore hunting round.  For factory loads that take advantage of the 45 Colt's potential, check out Buffalo Bore Ammunition and Corbon.  For handloading info, Hodgdon got the ball rolling with the first ""Ruger Only"" loads section in their loading manuals.
Today, most of the loading manuals have a ""Ruger Only"" section and this gun is appropriate for those loads. There were two production runs of this model.  The original production run ran from 2003 to 2005 and consisted of 600 guns delivered.  Another 132 guns have trickled in between 2008 to 2010, most of which due to the parts cleanup Ruger has been doing the last few years.  The Ruger Hunter and the 45 Colt cartridge are a natural combination is a very sought after combination.

It is a all numbers matching down to the butt plate. it is unmodified as I am a starting collector of mosin nagants. The rifle is deadly acurate and was shot multiple times and cleaned very well after each trip. The bore is clean and has sharp rifling. The bolt is very smooth and gun functions flawlessly and is a joy to shoot. has a functioning side folding bayonet and a 20 inch barrel. has date 1955.

All of the metal is in descent condition, but the gun looks like it came from a war zone, which to me adds character to the gun, and most of these Chinese type 53 guns did come from a war zone from Korea to Vietnam to south america. The stock has no cracks or major gashes but did get a heavy beating from what i presume is from Vietnam. 

this gun is what I would call a collector piece, and what is interesting has Russian markings on the matching Chinese bolt. what my looking into found that this is because Russian engineers helped in manufacturing process in china.

asking 200$ which i think is a very fair price. 
will entertain trades, but will be tough if its not a caliber I own. 7.62x39, 7.62x54r, 9mm makarov, 12 gauge, 22lr"

He put 6 rounds of 38 special thru it and put it back in the safe. Some years latter he sent the gun to Ford Guns in Florida where they radius all the corners smoothed out all the sharp spots and polished all the stainless to a mirror finish. The gun is amazing looking and there is not a machine mark on it. It looks as good or better than any bright stainless Python. The gun was then sent to Grant Cunningham where the trigger job was done and all springs replaced with titanium springs. Everything about the trigger was polished and reworked. The single action pull is SCARY and breaks under a pound. The double action feels like its running on ice and is as smooth or smoother than any Python. It has a set of Hogue Rosewood grips and HI VIZ sights. The pistol is amazing looking and there is not a scratch on it any where. At 15 yards free handed you can cut the same hole. Has had less than 300 rounds thru it since new. Would like to trade only but you can feel free to make an offer. Make sure you know what it would cost to duplicate this pistol. WILL NOT RESPOND TO ANY STUPID OFFERS! AND WILL ONLY TRADE FOR ITEMS LISTED BELOW! Thanks for looking.
