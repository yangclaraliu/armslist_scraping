This offer includes the revolver, instruction manual, and a third-party case. Bought it new for $500 and asking for $400.

Has Finnish markings, from what I can tell from a little online research it was accepted by the Finnish Army and given to the Civil Guard. Overall rifle is in great shape, only bad thing about it is the rear sight is adjustable, however if you hold the rifle upside down the sight just flops up. Not a huge deal, still completely adjustable and shoot-able as is, unless you are trying to fire upside down? Will include one ammo pouch, and I have about 20 loose rounds of surplus ammo laying around.

This gun has meprolight night sights, a 3.5lb trigger and 4 13 round mags. This gun is used but in great shape. I love this gun but its time for something new. Of the 30 some glocks I've owned in my life this one is the most accurate and fun to shoot, it even consistently outshoots my buddies HK USP. I really hate to get rid of it but its time for someone else to enjoy it and for me to enjoy something new. This glock is somewhat rare in that it has the now discontinued ambi mag release. I guess a few of them had problems so glock discontinued them. Ive never had any troubles with the mag release, I see it as a future collector, the cool thing about the rare ambi mag release 21's is that glock will swap it out for a brand new gen 3 frame at no cost so at anypoint you could send the frame to glock and have a new one to replace it. This one doesn't have much ware so I'm waiting till it has been used a lot more to redeem the new frame. Im looking to trade for a used, midgrade ar-15 like a bushmaster or palmetto state armory just to name a couple brands that are cheaper on the used market. I don't care about barrel length but I would like to at least be threaded. I prefer flat top (A3} upper receivers but I'm ok with an {A2} fixed upper. No cheapo plastic ar-15 lowers please."

This is as original as it gets. Completely matching and unmolested 1939 date 27 code K98 Mauser with low serial number 194i. This is original down to the L&F 1939 dated sling, and even have the original cleaning kit issued with the gun in its original leather pouch. Also comes with a factory 1939 8mm ammo box.
Code 27 was formerly S27, which stood for Erfurter Maschinenfabrik (Erma). The receiver, barrel, rear sight group, bolt group including firing pin, bolt release, floor plate assembly, follower, trigger group screws, bands, bayonet lug, and stock are all matching. The stock has not been sanded and has an original K98K sling marked 1939 with maker.
The bore is excellent with no import mark on the barrel and the stock has not been cut. Still has most of the finish except for the butt plate. Erma stopped production of the K98K in 1941, and the serial number of this rifle is #194, making it a fairly early, hard to find variant.

The gun is all matching down to the screws, and cleaning rod. Nothing has been altered or changed since it left the field. Has the original blueing and is in excellent shape.
Gun has all birds intact and no import or Russian marks.

This is not a Russian capture, Yugo, or any of the other imported, mismatched, crap out there. Please don't waste your time or mine with offers not consistent with current, matching K98K prices.

Ex dragoon means it was originally a 91/dragoon/Cossack and they reconfigured them to 91/30 specs. Meaning different rear and front sights, and the fact that they are 2"" shorter than 91/30. These carry a premium with collectors as they are less common. Not gonna say ""rare"" because that's retarded, they made 18 million of these pattern of guns, at least?!

This is the highly sought after 3"" 357 magnum.  What makes it the ideal carry revolver is the 3"" barrel with the full-length ejector rod and a compact size.  It is just a hair bigger than a Ruger Sp101 but gives you six shots instead of five. It is about the same size as a Glock 19 or 23(pictured).

 Unfortunately, it is not perfect.  It has honest wear and no scars from abuse. It is half the price of what a mint 3"" S&W 65 would bring. The lockup is tight and the forcing come is perfect. I do not have the box.  All I have is the gun and a set of Pachmyer grips and the Hogue Bantams. I don't have any holsters unless you are left handed. I am pretty firm at $425.  I am so gun heavy that I am not too interested in trades.

I believe this one is an older model as it didn't come with the ""gear"" that most SA 1911s do now.  Took in trade for another one I no longer needed.  I'm the second owner.  Shoots well and groups GREAT as long as you do your job.  No malfunctions in around 100 rounds.  Has around 2500 rounds through it with recoil springs changed every 1000, reportedly.  Current spring is nice and strong.  I already have a TRP in Armory Kote and don't particularly care for the stainless look.  Thought I'd take this and try it and just doesn't suit me.  Grips are crossed cannons.

I have a strong regard this Sig Sauer 1911 Scorpion Carry with Threaded Barrel this particular model features as integrated features, designed and built into the pistol at the time of manufacture, features that make it a safe carry weapon, a home defense weapon, primary defense weapon for persons in law enforcement or as a pepper weapon if that is the end use that you embrace.

A scenario close to my heart involves a perceived intruder in the early morning hours!  With the included Laser Aiming module/Laser Sight, in complete darkness (or daylight for that matter) a highly visible intense green laser beam constantly illuminates the target revealing the weapons true bore sight.  You, the shooter, intuitively, immediately and precisely, place the tactical laser green dot on the target, and you will also be able to immediately discriminate that target is not a spouse (husband, wife) or other loved one.  The mechanics of holding the weapon to achieve sight alignment is also not a part of the larger equation at a time when the adrenaline is running high.

Unless one is a match shooter, then the objective of owning a weapon is under some preconceived scenario, a shooter desires to render an adversary incapacitated.  Then the adversary is no longer capable of advancing his or her sinister deed.  This is accomplished by using a weapon and load that is designed to deliver a bullet with a sufficient amount of kinetic energy in order to introduce the effects of a ballistic trauma in order to render the adversary incapacitated.  An elementary discussion of muzzle energy and the kinetic energy of a bullet can be found at the following URL,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy

I will include below two ammunition ballistics charts the ballistics101.com web site for a quick review of Ammo Ballistics, Muzzle Energy for both 9mm and .45 cal ACP capable weapons.  I am of the opinion that a large number of people that are carrying 9mm weapons do so for the wrong reasons.  Early on the 9mm pistol was introduced as a light weight as well as light duty secondary weapon that would be used immediately should the primary weapon become UN-serviceable.  It was also used by individuals that were not likely to be cast in a combat role.

While I own combat capable rifles, my primary side arm is not intended to serve as a light duty weapon.  Instead, it must be a pistol that meets the highest engineering standards while being capable of rendering an adversary incapacitated with a single shot.  At this point as an old and crotchety, gimpy, disabled Marine, one shot may be the only opportunity that I have to confront an adversary.  I want to have engineered reliability, kinetic energy and ballistic trauma working to my advantage, not for the bad guy!  Like so many things in life, when it comes to kinetic energy and ballistic trauma, more is better, assuming that recoil and weapon management are not an issue for the shooter…

So now, let me speak to this shooter.  This weapon is NOT like new, it is absolutely brand spanking NEW!  Sig Sauer has topped the 1911 Scorpion with the release the Carry version, the newest Sig Sauer 1911 incarnation!  It is the Sig Sauer 1911 Scorpion Carry and with a Threaded Barrel (.578” x 28 TPI)!  This is a real “Big Boy” shooter and readily concealable.

It remains un-fired.  And because words mean things, it has not even been fired once!  It has only been mauled by me as I added the following accessories:

A James Bond style removable muzzle break/flash suppressor, .45 cal threaded barrel w/right twist in .578” x 28 tpi.  You can also accessorize the threaded barrel on your Scorpion Carry version with your own sound suppressor as you wish.

A because the 45 cal Scorpion Carry versions’ frame has an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail under the dust cover for mounting lasers or lights, I added a detachable laser aiming module in addition to the steel flash suppressor.

This detachable Laser Aiming module/Laser Sight is a superb laser sight.  It emits a highly visible intense green laser beam constantly, and facilitates bore sighting to the weapons physical bore sight, enabling the shooter to intuitively, immediately and precisely, place the intense tactical laser green dot on the target, and then delivering an incapacitating round on target with a single tap/shot with no need to achieve sight alignment under any target lighting condition.  This gives the shooter an unequaled and unsurpassed winning advantage in any shooting scenario!  Now that’s a winning advantage that I want for myself and I want it for all of my brother Marines, other military, spooks, law enforcement and all of the other “good guys” that stand up each day, keeping our country safe!  Special Ops has it And So Should You!

579,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4651579,For Sale:  Price Reduced - 1998 ProCraft 215 SuperCombo with Mercury 250 EFI,"Louisville, Kentucky, United States","$ 9,000","Listed On: Thursday, September 10, 2015",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Great Fish & Ski Boat at a Great Price! This boat has a really good layout for Fishing, Cruising, Skiing or Tubing.

The Boat:
-	Scoot across the lake in this beautiful metallic black and silver 1998 ProCraft 215 SuperCombo with a 2004 250HP Electronic Fuel Injected Mercury outboard motor. This motor has had minimal usage since being installed in 2007 and has the power you need to get across the lake or to pull a skier or tube. You have a choice of props, from a 5 bladed ""High 5"" prop that provides really solid hole shot power to a 4 bladed ""Tempest"" for good low-end power with and a higher top-end than the ""High 5"". Both props are stainless steel and have zero defects. Relax and sit back while moving from spot to spot on the lake or pulling a tube or skier, there is ample and comfortable seating for 7 (three across back row, driver, co-pilot and two on the front) and you can keep drinks and food chilly with a built in cooler. Hey, while having a frosty beverage you can crank up the tunes on the (1 year old) marine stereo system with CD, Blue Tooth and USB capability. Tunes and beverage make you want to dance (just kidding)? The deck area makes moving about easy and provides a lot of open space. Whoa, starting to rain, wanting to catch some Zzzz's or maybe a little too sunny outside, throw on the included water proof cover or the removable bimini top and enjoy.
As a Skiing or Tubing Boat:
-	Mount the removable competition ski pole (really cool and rock solid), hook-up the ski rope and you are ready to go in a couple of minutes. Front and back decks for lounging and watching the action, room for seven passengers, ski and lifejacket storage lockers as well as three storage lockers up front, built in cooler, stow-away/easy access ladder to using when boarding from land or water and a GPS unit to bring you home.

As a Fishing Boat:

-	Attach the removable pedestal seats (one front and one back), turn on the GPS/Fish Locator and fire up the 250 to get to your favorite fishing spot. Once you are there, attach the 24V MotorGuide trolling motor (easy in and out of the water with a quick release mount), turn on the two aerated live wells and fish locator and have at it. All fished out and ready to leave! There is plenty of space to store things (two storage lockers as well three storage lockers up front and a built in cooler). Use the two-bank, MotorGuide battery charger to charge the batteries. It's as simple as plugging an extension cord into an outlet, no more hooking a battery charger up.

The Trailer:

-	ProCraft factory tandem axle trailer with five, one year old tires, surge breaks (units were replaced 6 years ago), carpeted bunks and these really cool jack stands (all you have to do is drop them, back-up a foot or so and the trailer is raised to the point that you can either take pressure off the tires for storage or change a flat).

General:	

-	This boat has really never given me a problem. I am meticulous in its up keep, always running premium fuel (only requires mid-grade) and oil (Mercury Quicksilver Premium Synthetic) treated with Mercury Quicksilver Fuel Treatments, storing covered in my driveway or in a garage. It has always been pulled from the water and cleaned after use and never run in salt water. The hull keeps you from getting hammered when the water conditions are less than desirable and the power steering makes turning a breeze.
-	Also included several life jackets, three new batteries (two for trolling motor and one for accessories), ski/tow rope, several docking bumpers, anchor and maybe a towable tube.
-	This boat is loaded with every option available at the time it was manufactured and if you are looking for a boat that you can do some serious fishing with or to take out cruising, skiing or tubing this is your boat. Offered at $9,000. Contact me with questions or to see the boat. The only reason that I am selling is because I only use it three or four times a year and do not see use increasing anytime soon. Private seller and no trade offers please.

Boat is located in Middletown, KY"

Arguably the most sought after 1911 in the world. 

The Professional is a full custom pistol that begins with a national match frame which has the oversized slide rails cut into the frame in the Springfield Geneseo machine shop. It uses all custom parts, including the Springfield Custom tool steel hammer & sear, S&A mag well, Wilson ambi thumb safety, Novak low mount rear sight, dovetail front sight, match skeletonized trigger, standard guide rod system, and 6 specially tuned Metalform 7 round magazines. These pistols are hand assembled by custom gunsmiths in the Geneseo custom shop, under the supervision of master gunsmith David Williams. The Professional models meet or exceed all specifications of the FBI SWAT contract, including the accuracy requirement of 1.5"" or better at 25 yards with Remington Golden Saber ammunition. The civilian pistols and the FBI pistols are built at the same time, with the gunsmiths never knowing whether a civilian or FBI agent will be using the pistol. These pistols are built approx. every 45 days, with the FBI order being filled first and civilian orders getting all of the remaining from the production run. These pistols do not have front cocking serrations or full length guide rods because the FBI chose not to have these features on their pistols. (Front cocking serrations catch on clothing and full length guide rods require additional tools for disassembly.) These pistols are finished with the Black T finish done by Walter Birdsong in MS.

Other Features:	The 92 series of semi-automatic double/single action pistols operate on a short recoil, delayed blowback system which yields faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Beretta's (92 (M9A1) Compact is a full 0.75"" shorter and 2.3 oz. lighter than its full-size counterpart, making it even more comfortable for all-day carry. Also, its shorter trigger reach makes it simple to shoot even by users with smaller hands. It has a super-resistant stainless steel Inox finish stands up to sweat while also making it more impervious to corrosion between shooting and cleaning. The 92 Compact features a lightweight, forged aircraft-quality aluminum alloy frame with a durable gray-anodized finish to match the Inox slide and 4.25"" chrome-lined barrel with a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. The open slide design virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping, and the chamber can be loaded one cartridge at a time. The attached disassembly latch simplifies field stripping. It features a reversible magazine release, beveled magazine well, an oversized combat trigger guard, checkered front and backstrap, and an integral Picatinny rail. This handgun will reliably feed most commercial ammunition designs, including the wider hollow points and the hardest-hitting +P. This attractive, perfectly-engineered pistol is suited for most uses, including competition.

The Franchi SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun manufactured by Italian firearms company Franchi from 1979 to 2000. Production stopped fully in the year 2000 meaning there are currently no SPAS shotguns being produced. Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated Franchi SPAS 12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the United States. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 was sold to military and police users worldwide on the civilian market, and has been featured in many movies, TV shows and video games.[1]

The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS-12 initially led to its ""Military"" designation as a Combat Shotgun. The SPAS-12 was designed from the ground up as a rugged military shotgun and it was named the Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun. In 1990 Franchi renamed the shotgun to the Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun, this allowed continued sales to the United States as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994. Following the United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban, imports of SPAS-12 shotguns were stopped into the United States. In September 2004 the ban had expired, but Franchi had ended production in 2000 of the SPAS-12 . The SPAS-12's retail price in its final year of 2000 was $1500.00 USD averaged for final sales outside the United States to non-restricted countries. Franchi S.p.A. Italy"

Binocular NVDs enable the operator to keep both eyes on the visual scene and provide greater depth of field than a monocular or biocular device. This unmagnified NVD has a focusable objective lens that allows the operator to focus on subjects within four feet. The 26mm f/1.2 lens system transmits a 40° angle of view and provides a wide viewing angle that is well-suited for nature observation and camping.

The Night Cougar LT binocular's first generation intensifier tube delivers 40 lp/mm typical resolution, and the tube also has auto-deactivation circuitry that deactivates the NVD to protect the intensifier tube and the observer's eyes from excessive brightness. A built-in infrared illuminator extends the visible range of the Night Cougar and allows the observer to see in complete darkness.

The included head gear kit has forehead padding for additional comfort and adjustable straps to create a custom fit when mounting the Night Cougar LT. The flip-up hinge allows the observer to disengage the NVD without dismounting it from the head gear.

Chinese Norinco Mak 90 AK47 7.62x39 - Slant Cut Stamped Receiver with all matching numbers.  Comes with 2 - 30 round magazines.  These are becoming rare guns since they are not imported into the states anymore since the early 90 s. The Chinese Norinco Mak 90 trigger is one of the very best AK triggers and in my opinion and the Mak 90 is certainly one of the best must have AK style rifles. 

This is an original unmolested gun that is in very good condition that appears to have been fired very little.

Swing away tounge on trailer

2 new trolling motor batteries last year 
Newer cranking battery
3 bank Minn Kota on board charger 
Removable ski/tube bar

The boat sits very shallow in the water, with the main motor up I've gone through 10"" of water with out touching bottom.

Top speed 38mph with 2 people and gear 


The bad
Exterior paint is faded
Interior needs to be redone, has a few soft spots in the floor 
Has 4 batteries but one is shot. The one that is shot only powers the radio, so I would just put the radio onto the cranking battery and only run 3. 


As I said earlier, it will be a good boat for someone to get on the water for the rest of the year, then fix it up over the winter. I was going to pull all the seats out and convert it to a fishing boat, not the fish and ski it is now.
