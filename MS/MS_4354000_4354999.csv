Ball and hollow point smooth and accurate. Please see the pictures and feel free to ask any questions. I will require face to face Florida DL and prefer CCW. I also will ship from my FFL to yours for actual cost. This is a rare and exceptionally well cared for, but not perfect Randall Service Model C / Raider with 2 Randall mags. The photo's do not show the true image of this pistol, it is much better in person. All parts are apparently original and function, will need recoil and firing pin springs in near future. There is not an idiot mark for the take down lever! How often is that possible?

RANDALL “COMMANDER”-SIZE .45 ACP PISTOLS
By August of 1983, Randall expanded its line of pistols to include the Service Model-C configuration. The “C” stood for compact. Initially, these handguns were even roll-marked “Service Model-C.” However, in the beginning of 1984, the company decided to give the guns a new identity, and dubbed this configuration as the “Raider,” so-named for General Randall’s unit which had been known as Randall’s Raiders.
Introduced August 31, 1983, the first in the Service Model-C series was the A211, which featured a round-top slide and fixed sights. Barrel length was 4.25-inches, making the over-all length .75-inch less than the standard A111. Magazine capacity (7) and height remained the same. Weight of the A211 was 36 ounces, compared to 38 ounces for the full-sized Model A111. After 992 of the Model A211 pistols were made, production of that model ceased on September 6, 1984. The serial number range went from RF02001C through RF05808C.
Next came the Model A231, which differed from the A211 in that it had a flat top slide and Millett Model 100 Gold Cup-type adjustable rear sight. The Model A231 was introduced on November 7, 1983. Only 574 of these pistols were manufactured, with a serial number range of RF02009C through RF03814C. The last of this model was manufactured on October 6, 1984."

It can be considered a subcompact/Micro Compact carry weapon. Shoots very smoothly and has been taken care of. 

I purchased an amazing DeSantis Leather Wallet Holster that slides into the back pocket of shorts/pants easily. As seen in pictures, it is a tad bigger than a normal size wallet and appears to be a wallet when you are carrying concealed. 

Upgrades/Extras: 
I have upgraded the Guide-Rod and Spring. The original worked well (which is included) but I wanted to make sure that I never had feed issues and that it would feed/eject very smoothly for any ammo that I choose to put through there. I never had a single issue. 

Also includes a BlackHawk ankle holster (good for an extra conceal carry during winter). Works well but i prefer the wallet holster.

Includes a wide array of butt-plates for the 2 magazines. There are a couple extended finger buttplates that I purchased for when I go to the range and don't want to shoot with the wallet holster. It allows an extra finger on the gun for better control.

Also including a couple boxes of ammo. The 1st box is high end personal defense Speer Gold-Dot 90gr HP. Unused box and includes 20 rounds. Typically a good bit expensive compared to most other HP ammo. Also included is some old school Federal target ammo. x38 rounds are left. Shoot a little dirty but work great for target practice. Also included is x7 rounds of Hornady 90gr Critical Defense HP. I shot the other ones, but this x7 is what I typically carried in the magazine with me when concealed carry.

Condition:
It's in great condition. It's a 2-3yrs old so unfortunately it isn't the brand new one that came out but it is priced accordingly. Functions smoothly and flawlessly for me. The new upgraded (not a cheap knockoff) guide-rod/spring make shooting the gun even better. The original parts are included as well. Not a lot of rounds have been put through the gun. I've maybe put around 5-7 magazines (6 rounds each) through the gun since I purchased it. I usually shoot my 9mm. I am going to try something a little different which is the reason for selling.

Meeting: I will meet close to the Lexington area. I live right at the Junction of I-20/378 (Sunset BLVD) in Lexington. 4295 Sunset Blvd, Lexington, SC 29072 is probably the best and closet address that you can use if you want to look up directions.

Trades: Not looking for trades at the moment unless you have a long slide glock G34/G35/G17L/G24 or a G17 (FDE preferred) or a Long Slide FN 9/40. The Glock 19/17 are the only 2 guns that I would consider as a trade for a normal length slide.
**Yes, I know those are only partial trades and I would need to include cash.


Pricing: Currently it appears that the Ruger LCP is going for around 325+tax @PSA, and around 300 on GunBroker. That is for the basic weapon. I would like to get at least $275 firm for everything that I am including (holster/ammo/ankle holster/upgrades/butt plates). Original box/paperwork is included! For this price, please do not expect me to drive 20 miles out of my way. I try to be extremely forgiving when I sell firearms so I don't have to haggle with pricing so please be mindful. Thank you!

I originally bought this gun for $600 at Turners, and I am the only owner. I've owned it for a little over 2 years and have only ran about 800 rounds through it. The gun itself runs beautifully and has never given me any malfunctions, but about a month ago, I noticed the beaver-tail/grip safety was not engaging. The main safety, however, is not affected. I've called the manufacture to see if this could be repaired under the lifetime warranty and they assured me it could, but I just haven't had the time to ship it out to them. This issue has no effect on the performance of the gun whatsoever, and if you decide to purchase this gun, you will be able to send it in under warranty.

The rifle shoots incredibly well and the two stage trigger has an amazingly smooth, crisp break. You can't get better than this when it comes to built target 10/22s.

Parts:
-50th anniv. Ruger 10/22 ($250)
-Hogue overmolded rubber stock ($50?)
-Kidd two stage trigger with ""medium"" mag release lever ($289)
-Kidd bull barrel ($200)
-Kidd bolt release, bolt charging handle ($40)
-Kidd bolt guide rod and springs (3 included, with various tensions) ($10)
-Leuplod VX-1 rimfire scope (2-7x28) with all the Leuplod mounting hardware AND the super nice Alumina flip-back lens covers (~$350)
-1 10rnd mag

I also have all the original ruger parts (except the stock), paperwork, etc. Other extras (plus or minus included, depending on what price we settle on):

-Ruger gun bag
-Spotting scope (Barska Blackhawk 18-36x50)
-Cadwell benchrests
-Various spash targets
-Cleaning supplies (snake, oil, hoppes, pads, etc)
-About 500-700 rounds .22lr

Basically every single thing you'd need to start shooting today. Top quality everything, all in great shape. The rifle shoots flawlessly and there are no mechanical issues whatsoever. The rifle is in just about perfect shape cosmetically as well except one spot by the bolt handle where I scratched the metal (I was just figuring out how to install the bolt properly, so it's my fault), but the area is small. You can see it in the pics. It's a really nice understated looking rifle but if you know 10/22s, you know what this thing has in it, and shooting it is a dream.

Selling because I'm moving to a city where I can't bring this rifle and I'll have very limited opportunity to shoot due to a new job. Sucks, but someone will make out from this.

As you can see this rifle has about $1200 in it. Asking price is $800 not including all the extra stuff. Prefer local pickup in CT but will do FFL if necessary.

	Hey everyone,
I have available for trade/sale an awesome and hard to find little 5.56 pistol. This is a Kel-Tec PLR-16. It is chambered in 5.56/223. This is a really hard to find pistol and they are literally a blast to shoot. This one has a brand new OEM Kel-Tec hand guard with picatinny rail. In addition, I have installed an aftermarket single point sling adapter (way better than the OEM janky one). It also has a Levang Linear Compensator installed. This helps with follow up shots and directs the blast forward so as to not be so hard on the shooters ears. This will come with the single point sling, single point sling adapter, Linear Compensator, one metal 30rd magazine, factory 10rd magazine, and original box, papers, and tools. Also have some ammo or extra mag available. These are nearly impossible to find at the moment so the price is all over the place on these. I am open to reasonable offers, but i know what I’ve seen these sell for at the last three gun shows and on the classifieds, so please don’t waste both of our time bickering about supply and demand. I just got this on trade and would keep it, but there are other projects that I would rather have. 
	I would also consider trades. Mostly interested in ARs in 1:8 twist, AKs, a 5.7x28 guns, AR10s, PMR30s, CMR30s, etc. Honestly, just make an offer, as long as it evens our fair on both sides then i will consider it. Please no Blackpowders, 22s, or shotguns unless it is weighted heavily in my favor. I would also do multi gun trades or partial trades. Some trades will require boot on your side, some will require it on my side. Can add boot on my end as well if it is something I am interested in. I would keep this, but i would rather have a full platformed AR  5.56/223 than the pistol variant. For any questions or for offers shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to be able to meet up in Norman on this if possible.

Thanks for looking and happy hunting

First gun, Excam Warrior HW357 .357 magnum revolver with a steel frame. This gun is in fair shape externally but works like it's brand new.

The sights are usable, but no longer adjust. I was told that the original owner was a security guard, and that fits with the condition of the gun. Carried much more than it was fired. Comes with a Blackhawk holster and two sets of grips; the original right handed target grips and a set of hard rubber grips off of a EAA  Windicator. 
This gun was built in Germany by H. Weihrauch. They have built revolvers for several different companies through the years including Excam, Arminius, FIE, Herters, EAA and others.

Second gun, Norinco model 54-1 in 7.62x25 Tokarev. This is the Chinese version of Tokarev TT-33 pistol that was built for import to the U.S. before the ban in 1993. It functions perfectly and all numbers match, including number on the magazine. Around 85 rounds of modern production PPU ammunition is included with the gun."

I had to use spacers to bring the tires out further to fill up the wheel well because of the weird offset that the impala has . I don't have the center caps , wheels looked good without them. Don't know what brand or who makes them , if anyone knows , that info would be appreciated . I am looking for $350 firm for the wheels.

This is an American Made, high quality, piston-driven AR pistol that is the material embodiment of machismo. 

I've owned this ""pistol"" for about six months. Had the pleasure of putting 120 rounds through it. In all honesty, I was told before I bought it that because of the piston driven system it wouldn't cycle lighter 55-grain .556 ammo. 2 of the four mags I put through this was steel cased FMJ plinking ammo and I didn't notice any difference. Everything cycled perfectly.

I added a magpul AFG and 120 lumen LED light and a single point sling that could go with it as well for the right price or trade

Just recently got this in a trade and it was a blast but I really want an AK so I need to gather some funds. The previous owner is a calgunner and he did a beautiful job of refinishing the stock. There are nicks and wear on the stock but nothing major. All matching numbers minus the trigger guard and it comes with the blade bayonet. My research leads me to believe it was produced in late '57. Round count is unknown but I fired 80rds through it and it ran flawlessly. Rifle will include 140rds of Wolf yellow box 7.62x39, recoil pad(was for my girlfriend), 9 or 10 stripper clips, and a rifle bag. Will ppt anywhere in the sfv (not turners reseda), simi valley, or burbank/glendale.

SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

Adcore entered their A-556 Elite in the Army's Individual Carbine competition and made it to phase II before the competition was cancelled due to funding issues.  The only other systems that made it to Phase II was the Colt ACM, FN FNAC, H&K HK416, and Remington ACR. 

Adcore manufactures parts for the Trident Missile system, radars on F16 fighter jets, and many other critical DoD systems.  They also used to make parts for Colt and Bushmaster not to long ago before they started to make their own AR15s. 

Features include: 
-1:7 twist chrome-lined cold-hammer forged FN barrel
-Optics ready
-Forward placed, reversible/ambidextrous non-reciprocating charging handle
-Gas piston system with multi-position regulator (great for suppressor use)
-Free-floating barrel
-Can shoot 5.56 and .223
-Ejection port dust wiper
-Two-piece keyed quad rail system
-Tool-less field strip design
-MPI, HPIl & shot peened bolt with properly staked gas key
-OAL 32.5”-36.25”
-Weight  7lbs

Upgrades:
-Bayonet lug (removable)

Personal observations:
-Smoothest bolt operation I have ever experienced on any AR15, M4, or M16 variant
-Cleaning is very fast and very easy thanks to the piston system
-Super accurate with match grade ammo
-FN cold hammer-forged barrels are of the highest quality
-I have shot 600 rounds through the upper, both match grade ammo and some NATO surplus (M193 & M855)
-Not a single FTE, FTF, feeding issue, or jam.

The stock and barrel shank are bedded. The bipod legs each pull down when the side buttons are depressed. The legs extend and contract when the retaining ring is pulled downward. The bipod legs extend from 6 5/8 inches to 9 ¾ inches with a total of 5 locking points for different heights. The monopod flips down when the button on the left of its base is depressed. The button on the monopod leg unlocks it and allows it to be pull down to a length of between 2 ¾ to 4 inches. The round nut can be screwed down to lock the height chosen.The bipod and monopod are in about Excellent condition. The stock shows various light scrapes and scuffs. The LOP measures 13 5/8 inches from the front of the trigger to the back of the recoil pad with all three spacers installed. The stock rates in about Fine overall condition.The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp. There is no erosion. The bore shows an M.E. of -0.5 (negative is a good thing when speaking on erosion).

This is a Colt AR15 Lightweight Sporter lower receiver, which has been modified for use in an M16A1 retro build, and has had one significant repair. Neither the mods nor the repair impact function. I have had this receiver installed on a rifle at the range and it functions perfectly. Sear block trigger, trigger guard (installed), and front pivot pin bushing adapters are included in the sale. The Modifications: This is an earlier Colt Lightweight Sporter receiver, originally manufactured with the large .315"" front pivot pin hole for the two piece screw pin instead of the milspec .25"" front pivot pin hole; the larger .170"" ""big pin"" fire control pins instead of the standard milspec .155"" pins; an integral sear block requiring use of a special sear block compatible trigger and half-moon style bolt carrier; and the SP1-style ""slabside"" configuration. This receiver has had several modifications, some reversible and some not. Permanent modifications: A) The fire control pin holes have been welded shut and re-drilled to the milspec standard .155"" size using an 80% jig to accept milspec parts; and B) the upper projecting ""horn"" on the sear block has been removed to allow use of a standard full circle bolt carrier (note, however, that the sear block remains in place and fully functional, and still requires the special sear block trigger, included in the sale). Reversible modifications: A) An M16A1 style full fence, cannibalized from an 80% receiver, has been affixed using an epoxy adhesive. It is firmly attached and functional, but could presumably be removed. B) The two tabs above the selector found on milspec receivers have been added, also cannibalized from an 80% receiver and attached with an epoxy adhesive, and also presumably removable. C) Adapter bushings to convert the larger front pivot pin hole to the milspec .25"" are included. One is affixed to the rifle by epoxy adhesive and could presumably be removed, the other is loose. D) the entire receiver has been coated using Brownell's Alumahyde II. This can be removed and the receiver refinished if desired (see comments on the forum boards on how to do that). The repair: A previous owner broke off one of the trigger guard ears. That missing part has been replaced with an ear cannibalized from an 80% receiver, which was drilled, tapped, and pinned in place. The repair is visible in the pictures. In order to avoid compromising the repair, I have left the trigger guard and roll pin in place and include it with the sale. Again, the sear block trigger, pivot pin adapter bushings, and installed trigger guard are included in the sale.

All original, 100% intact, & shoots great. Bluing is rough, but there. Stock has typical nicks, dings & bruises. This one in particular is COMPLETE. Very commonly these are found missing the inner magazine tube (rendering it a single shot... good luck finding that part). 

Very nice small game gun. Very slim & svelte. Can almost fit it all the way into a large Alice pack. That's why I loved taking this one out after squirrel & rabbit. 

I've found myself shooting this one less & less due to working on other projects. No time to hunt anymore really. In short, it needs a new home where it will be appreciated more. 


During the years I've had it, it has been treated gently. Comes with a box (100ct) of standard velocity lead .22LR.
