I got it because I thought I could practice with it instead of my 9mm, but the trigger action is so different than my XDs that it really didn't pan out the way I wanted. So I've gone back to buying 9mm ammo and practicing with the real deal instead.  Not a thing wrong with it, looks and works great. It's a really fun gun to shoot and ammo is cheap. I just don't really need it for what I thought I would. Red laser site included.

Has around 500rds through it. Wilson combat beavertail installed. Frog Lube treated. Crossbreed holster. 2 7rd mags. Perfect carry peice. I love this pistol but it is the model with trench sights. Some people love it, some dont. It's perfect for carry/point shooting and some people are very accurate with them, but i get ""hung up"" when transitioning between guns. Other than sight issue (personal preference), gun runs great, just want something with traditional sights. Not interested in polymer guns, rifles, shotguns. Prefer commander sized 1911's but would be ok with another officer size (sig, springfield, s&w, kimber, other colts, para ord, etc), sig 229 (scorpion would be awesome) & other similar pistols.

He won't make good on it, so I'm trying to see first if anyone around has an extra .40 mag and can use this one.  This will hold 12 rounds of .40, but I'm not sure how many .41 AE it'll hold.  Probably close.  This is a real factory magazine in excellent condition.  It's a shame what this site is turning into.  It seems that there are as many scammers on here as there are legitimate guys!   Anyway, I won't rant anymore.

Likewise I just have too many guns to store in such a small space and I'd like to reduce my collection.  As such this is for sale.  It's in awesome shape, basically brand new, I've fired about 60 rounds thru it and I'm the first owner.  The rifle's extremely accurate, built on a forged reciever with a Steyr made chrome lined CHF barrel and of course the really cool side folding stock.  It also has an ambi safety.  I added a removable extended charging handle knob to make it easier to work with.  It will come with one 30 round steel magazine.  I do not have additional magazines for the gun, sorry.

I'm not looking for any trades sorry.  Priced at $1000 even, firm.  That's far less than I have in it, I'm taking a loss of nearly $400, but it's more important to me to clear out space.  You will not find a better deal on a SAM-7 SF.  I can ship to your FFL if you pay for shipping.  For local pickup, I'm an individual, not a dealer in the business of profiting from gun sales, so you'll need to sign a bill of sale and present a valid NC DL or other government ID.  CHP is preferred.  By agreeing to purchase you also agree that you're legally able to own the rifle and have no criminal record, and also acknowledge."

orvel L. Reichert who knew something about war time P-38s, produced a list that rates 1939 to 1953 P-38s from 1 to 10 based on how desirable they are. Most Spreewerk [cyq] have a letter after the serial number [ suffix }and are a 1. this p38 pistol has a letter [ a ] before the sn [ prefix] and rates a 3 as a 6th variation [a-b prefix]. The increased value of a prefix gun is also reflected on page 1434 of the 35 edition of BLUE BOOK OF GUN VALUES. The"" CYQ late production second alphabet series"" is about $300 more than a suffix.

The average dry sound signature of the Ti-RANT .45 is 133 dB when fired on a Heckler and Koch USP Tactical .45 with Remington 230 grain ammunition. This puts the dry performance of the Ti-RANT .45 squarely in the ballpark of most competitor's 9mm pistol silencers. With a wet charge of 5cc’s of water, the sound signature drops to 125 dB. To put it another way, our .45 silencer is quieter than some company’s .22 silencers. The Ti-RANT .45 does not stand out among a sea of posers just because of its jaw-dropping performance. Intelligent material selection gives the Ti-RANT .45 unequalled durability in a deceptively light-weight package. The Ti-RANT .45 incorporates AAC’s new A.S.A.P.™ CLUTCH. This highly evolved Nielsen device enables flawless semi-automatic operation on all relevant host pistols, and can be fully disassembled for cleaning or piston replacement with no tools in seconds. The Ti-RANT .45 can be outfitted with pistons threaded M16 x 1 Right Hand, M16 x 1 Left Hand, and two pistons threaded .578-28; one extended for the Sig P-220 and 1911’s with a full length guide rod, and a flush mount for 1911’s with a standard G.I. guide rod. For multi-caliber use, pistons are available in the most common 9mm and .40 thread patterns to allow use of the Ti-RANT 45 on hosts in those calibers.FamilyTi-Rant SeriesModel Ti-Rant-45MType NFA - SilencerFinish CerakoteThread Pattern M16x1 LHCaliber / Gauge 45 ACPOverall Length 8.90 Inches"

Rifle has been cerakoted Atomic Burnt Bronze by Atomic Tactical. Gold inlay was done using Forsters gold fill kit, not a crappy paint job. Rifle has a Midwest Industries rail, synthetic Tapco grip and butstock, vertical fore grip and UTG LT-TL 101 flashlight. Rail has low profile rail covers. Rifle was made 922r compliant with Tapco double hook trigger/hammer group (3 compliant parts) (original Chinese components included-pictured in plastic bag). I also installed a retaining plate in lieu of the hook (drop in piece). Synthetic thumb hole stock is included. Will come with two mags. I am not the original owner. I have owned the rifle for almost two years and have only fired it twice: once to test it and once after it was cerakoted. No issues at all and less than 100 rounds fired by me. Smooth as butter! Cleaned after both trips to the range and was been oiled on a regular basis. What else can I say? It's a sweet piece, but I've got some trips coming up that need funding and I just don't shoot this beauty that often. 

 I will only sell/trade to a 21+ year old person with a CURRENT MN PTC or PTP and MN ID. Buyer/trader must be willing to present these at the time of sale and complete a Bill of Sale. NO EXCEPTIONS! I am not willing to ship and prefer transactions around the St. Peter area.

 Any questions, just send me a message. I do work for a living so I usually cannot respond between 8:00am-5:30pm, but rest assured I will get back to you ASAP. Those looking to get this for a WASR price need not waste their time but reasonable offers will be considered. 

 I can send more detailed pics of the cerakote and gold inlay. Just let me know.

Pump action / slide action rifle 

Serial # starts with 393**A which is a 1936 manufacture date

Remarkable condition for a 79 year old rifle. I took a very close look under the light and I don't see any signs of alterations for refinishing / reblueing etc. It looks like all original. This is not a new rifle out of a box either. It's been used and the usual spots from cycling the pump rubs away bluing on certain spots on the magazine tube, etc. There are surface marks here and there on the metal from age not from mishandling, and some light surface marks on the wood here and there, but no idiot marks. I would say overall maybe 75% of original finish to be conservative. Crown appears clean.

From what I've researched these guns were made between the 50's and 60's and it's in pretty good shape for its age. The ""birds"" that are on the gun appear to just be stickers and I'm sure they could be removed if wanted. I simply left them because they appear to be original to the gun.

This upper is a complete upper I bought from DSG arms and is built by seekins. It's still like new minus on scratch on the rail (pictured).  No bcg or charging handle.

Awesome carry gun but I travel now and can’t carry. My loss is your gain! If you know Walther you know how hard these are to find. German made gun, not S&W. I have owned for less than a year and was purchased unfired from a collector. I have put approximately 500 rounds through it with absolutely no issues. Has the longer mag release paddle. Comes with all original items in case (2 10rd mag, lock and backstrap) as well as a 15 rd mag and a 20 rd mag, both with the hard to come by grip extenders. Also included a Uncle Mike’s clip IWB and a special made Theis IWB holster. Will need to see DL and PTP or PTC before sale.

It features four outputs: Infrared Laser Pointer + Infrared LED Illuminator and Visible Laser Pointer.

All IR functions are completely eye-safe / Class1.  Controls are easy and intuitive.  Two buttons are presented on an angled rearward-facing surfacing.  They are perfectly located for quick access and easily activated with or without gloves.  One button is marked “VIS” and activates the visible laser and 400 lumen white light at the same time.  The other button, marked “IR,” activates the infrared laser and infrared illuminator at the same time.  Both lasers are co-aligned to facilitate zeroing procedures.  Windage and Elevation adjustments require a small screw driver and are recessed to prevent accidental movement.  By zeroing one laser, you are zeroing the other in tandem.  The DBAL-PL runs off two CR123 batteries.  The battery compartment features a very secure quick release latch.  The latch is not spring-loaded and requires positive engagement by the operator on both sides to lock and unlock."

History Lesson (Truth About Guns):
The Mod30 was an improvement over the Mod28. That gun was famous for the first of the early 1980’s JSAAP competition stages for guns aspiring to become the new U.S. armed service standard-issue pistol. Although Star outperformed both the Ruger and Smith & Wesson entries, the military brass eventually awarded the Beretta 92 the contract.) 

This pistol was adopted for service by a number of Spanish police organizations, and the Spanish armed forces. Spanish Air Force pilots and some Guardia personell used the MI also. The M30 was also adopted in some numbers by Peruvian police and security forces as well as French Special Forces.

This gun has NEVER been fired (except for the 5 shot test group at the factory).

Gun comes with case, warranties, cleaning accessories and two 18-round magazines.

From CZ: 

""The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).""

* If you're looking at this ad you realize what this weapon is and the glorious history that spanned 2 world wars. I have owned numerous rifles from Mosin Nagant Snipers, Mausers, and Arisakas as well- None can compare the beauty of the bolt action found on the 1903..It is simply the best ever made. The 30-06 round is equally as famous and has endured from the front lines to modern hunting all over the globe for more than 100 years. 

This particular gun is in great shape with most of the bluing in tact, the stock as well- bearing a satisfying amount of handling marks that just add to the overall character of the weapon. The bore is slightly worn but has solid grooves and landing and fires consistently. ALL #S MATCHING RIFLE ... It has been thoroughly Cleaned, inspected and test fired over 60 rounds in the last month alone-  So shoot with confidence from the 1st day you receive it. The action on this weapon performs flawlessly as it did when it rolled off the factory line almost a century ago.

It is in perfect condition, virtually unfired except for 24 rounds to verify reliability and accuracy.    The numbers all match, and it has a matching number on the magazine.  There is an extra magazine included.  The pistol was manufactured in 1968.  A small zipper carrying case is included with the gun.

THIS GUN IS NOT A MAKAROV. It does, however, use the 9x18mm, or, 9mm Makarov cartridge. The left side of the slide has factory rollmarks of 9mm  „P-64”.  Because the West knows the 9mm as the 9x19, importers added ""Cal. Makarov"" and ""x18"" in electropencil to indicate it's difference. The Polish P-64 and Makarov simply share their caliber - nothing else. 

The 9x18 will drive a 95gr bullet out the muzzle at around 1,000 FPS for about 231 ft. lbs. of energy far exceeding .22LR, .25 ACP or .32 ACP chambered pistols of similar size.

The right side of the slide is engraved with the Radom Circle 11 oval and shows the 1968 production date. 

The P-64 was designed during the late fifties by a team of Polish army officers.  Production started in the middle sixties under the official designation ""9 mm pistolet wz. 1964"" (9 mm pistol model 1964). 

The frame and slide are blued steel. The slide-mounted safety acts as a decocking lever and the slide can be operated when put on “Safe”. Though it operates and looks similar to the Walther PP, there are some design differences between the P-64 and the PP/PPK pistols. Distinctly different from the PP/PPK design is a European-style magazine release located at the heel of the grip. The slide will lock back after the last shot has been fired but there is no slide lock lever. Instead, the magazine must be removed in order to close the slide when the gun is empty. Takedown, similar to other blowback pistols, is achieved by swinging the front of the trigger guard down and resting it against the frame, allowing the slide to come off of the front of the pistol. The fixed barrel can then be cleaned from the breach.

This would be a perfect pistol for concealed carry because of its size.  Makarov ammo is cheap and plentiful, and I'm throwing in a box of ammo just to get you started.  This would be the perfect Christmas gift for somebody special.  Contact me so we can meet and let you inspect this pistol.  I know you won't be disappointed.  The price is $275 Cash only, and you must show me your Oklahoma Driver's license."
