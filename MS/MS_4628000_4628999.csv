Do an Armslist or GunBroker search, and you'll find 40s and 357Sigs, but no 2-Tone 9mms. These weapons come from the Sig Sauer Custom Shop, as you can see by the etching on the right side of the slide. The whole weapon undergoes a melt treatment to rid it of any edges that might snag while being drawn. This is a Gen 2 with night sites and the Short Reset Trigger group. It's had less than 300 rounds through it and is practically new. It hasn't even finished the break-in period. I kept the original packaging, including tags, all of which match the pistol. I properly clean all my weapons with Frog Lube and this one is no different. 

Everything you see is included, most notably, the Alien Gear Cloak Tuck 2.0 IWB holster. The shell fits the gun perfectly and comes with all the accessories to adjust tension as well as a set of J-Clips to secure the holster under your belt. Two 16 round magazines also come with it. 

I originally purchased this pistol to be my concealed carry weapon but it proved to be too big for my frame. I hate to sell it because I love Sig's reliability and DA/SA trigger for safety. The 229 is a fantastic weapon, as I'm sure you all are aware. My family and I are planning to purchase a bigger home and since the gun isn't being utilized for its intended purpose, we could really use its value to aid the move. Sig is no longer manufacturing the SAS models in two tone stainless, so due to its exclusivity I'm firmly asking for almost the NIB price. Plus with all the goodies, this is an awesome deal. If you are from IL, I will need your FOID information to complete the transaction. I also have more photos; email me if you want to see them. Thanks for viewing and I look forward to hearing from you."

The HHS provides a solution for engaging threats in CQB situations, then quickly transitioning to a 500m targeting or surveillance situation, and then quickly back to a 25m room clearing exercise. Instant transition is achieved through a quick Switch-to Side (STS) mount that offers a simple, quick disconnect feature to remove the magnifier and base. This durable, night vision compatible system offers wide field optical performance with superior light transmission for visibility in extreme low light conditions. The EXPS3-4 is configured with a new ballistic matching reticle image for the M4 carbine. The battle tested circle/dot reticle will be offered along with a series of 1 MOA aiming dots that are vertically aligned and calibrated specifically for the ballistic drop of .223 caliber ammunition.

The gun is in like new condition. It has had less than 200 rounds through it. 

The P-01 9mm (designated the P-06 in .40 S&W) was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry.

The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.

Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!

For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN."

One of the most innovative and reliable bolt carrier groups on the market. The Sharps BBC is precisely machined from S7 steel which then undergoes a proprietary heat treatment process. Finally the BBC is finished inside and out with NP3®/NP3® PLUS to minimize the need for lubricants, to aid in smooth operation and to make clean up a breeze. The BBC has the SRC logo machine cut on the side of the carrier which is visible when the ejection port door is open. It fits standard AR-15/M16/M4 rifles chambered in .223/5.56mm, 25-45 Sharps and 300 Blackout calibers.

The redesigned lugs of the Relia-Bolt™ virtually eliminate the most common MSR malfunction; the bolt to barrel extension jam. Haven’t cleaned your rifle? Is it out of time? Relia-Bolt compensates by providing a patented camming action which guides the bolt past obstructions and into battery. The rounded/tapered lugs push past carbon and debris when the square edges of traditional bolts would typically jam. Once into battery, the rear edges of the lugs fully engage the barrel extension for absolute strength and security."

IWI Tavor Unfired with Night Sights - I recently picked up a right handed Tavor in FDE, so I'm letting my left handed Tavor go. No need for both. I bought this one because I shoot pistols left handed and wanted to try and match up my rifles so my gear isn't fighting itself. Unfortunately after dry firing and doing a little practice indoors with gear on, I've decided that left handed rifles are a no go for me. I know all it takes to convert this rifle is a little bit of time and a right handed bolt, but needing a few more things before another CQB weapon.

The rifle is unfired minus a few snap caps I used during dry fire practice. It has everything with it from the factory including the original magazine, which I'll leave loaded just because I'm awesome, unused IWI cleaning kit which is very indepth and has quite a lot of value in itself, plus any and all documentation that came with the rifle inside the factory box. The front sight post does have a tritium insert, which not all do so it does have night sights.

FN FNS9 - FN FNS9 Compact pistol. In great condition, comes with all the factory goodies. The pistol is in excellent shape and comes with 3 magazines: 1 13 round flush magazine, 1 13 round magazine with a pinky extension, and 1 17 round full size magazine with a grip extension that gives you a full grip. I can also include an N82 Tactical holster for $25, but it is left handed so I didn't include it in the price since we left handed shooters seem to be a rare breed.

IWI Tavor Unfired - $1700
FNS9 with extra mag - $500
Total: $2200 - Yours today for only $2000.

early - most likely within the first year of
production. This variation has been discussed on
various forums, and experts on NAPCA forum and
P38 Forum agreed that CPB most likely stands
for Commerz-und-Privat Bank AG. Dieter
Marshall, a well known German expert on Walther
pistols, indicates that he has seven of these
recorded, marked in the same way, in the same
serial range. These C.P.B. marked guns serial
numbers are near the serial numbers of
Rechsbank marked PPKs. The original finish is
99%, nothing has been touched up or refinished
and the photos don't do the justice... Comes with
a early grip variation and the early finger
extension magazine. The last three digits of the
serial number are inscribed inside the slide and
match the full serial number of the frame. The
grip has no damages of any kind and so is
magazine finger extention. All in all, this is a very
rare Walther PPK variation that rarely comes up
on market in such condition."

Background:
I am the original owner, and purchased this about a month ago. As soon as I got the gun I ordered an Apex Tactical forward set sear and aluminum flat face trigger. I had never shot an Apex trigger M&P before, but now I know what all the support is about. I've never felt a better trigger on a striker fired gun. It has the reliability of a striker fired M&P but with the smooth and light trigger pull of a 1911. I put 100 rounds through it and it shot great. Super easy follow up shots. I was originally going to shoot USPSA limited 10 with this but chose to continue shooting production with my Glock 34. This gun really needs to be seen, these triggers really are amazing. The gun itself goes for around $600 with the factory night sights. The Apex parts cost me $175. You could always buy this, install the factory trigger and sell the Apex parts and have yourself a great gun and some extra cash.

There were two versions, a target version with full target stock and sights, and a sporter with a slimmer stock and less complex sights. The former sold, in 1950, for $57, the latter for $49.40. About 88,715 of both types were made 1938-1958. Like the Remington 513, Model 75's were bought during WWII by the military for rifle teams (not really for training as such, though). The value above is correct for the target version, but the ""cheaper"" sporter version is bringing a lot more money. $500 is the low end for a nice one, and they can range up to $1400+ for one like new. For cleaning, the bolt is removed simply by opening it and pulling it back while pulling the trigger all the way back. Trigger pull weight adjustment is by a screw under the receiver, accessible with the action removed from the stock. *FWIW, the Remington rifles bring a lot less today, partly because they made more, and partly because of the magic of the Winchester name."

This is a older Mk VII model (before they came out with the Mk XIX) This one is marked 50AE on the slide (Mk XIX they moved the caliber stamp to the barrel) and is made by IMI. They only made them like this for a couple years before the switched to the XIX. All parts (barrels and slides) will interchange with the XIX.

It is the NRA Limited Edition.  I got this from my local Friends of NRA banquet.  The serial number on this particular one is NRA1101.  It has never been shot.

It is a really great gun and would compliment just about everyone's collection.

Here is the description from Kel-Tec's website:

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

It is the NRA Limited Edition. I got this from my local Friends of NRA banquet. The serial number on this particular one is NRA1101. It has never been shot.

It is a really great gun and would compliment just about everyone's collection.

Here is the description from Kel-Tec's website:

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

Purchased NEW by me in 2014
Rifle is in pristine condition and has spent its life in a soft case. 
Gun has fired approx. 500 rounds and has been thoroughly cleaned and treated with slip 2000 lubricant each time. I do have the original box and manual with front sight tool. Absolute crowd pleaser and anyone who holds the gun instantly falls in love with it. 
Do the research and you will find that there are not very many of these out there and they are extremely accurate, lightweight, and amazing! With high velocity and armor penetrating capabilities the 5.7x28 round is used at the whitehouse by the secret service. This gun makes a great home defense weapon as well as being easy to shoot with its low recoil and mobility. The sleek design allows equality to left or right hand shooters with all ambidextrous controls and ejecting the empty casings out the bottom. Only reason for selling is to make room in my gun safe. Looking for cash sale in person and will not ship or trade, please contact me with any other questions. I easily have $2400+ invested in this VERY EXOTIC weapon that will only gain value rapidly over the next few years. If you are looking for a great deal on a jaw dropping gun for your collection this is your chance!!

This is a BPS 28 ga pump with 28"" vent rib barrel and walnut furniture. It has everything that came with it new, box,papers, choke tubes, lock etc.
I bought this new after shoulder surgery in the hopes of being able to continue shooting shotguns.  After shooting two boxes of Winchester AA I have concluded I am not able to shoot this gun and not damage my shoulder. (Have had two surgeries and facing a third)
It is like new with the exception of slight wear on the magazine tube from firing the two boxes of ammo.
There are 9 boxes of factory Winchester AA ammo included(No 8 shot) with this shotgun. I had bought a case of ten boxes and was given a box as a gift, fired two leaves 9.
This is a nice, light kicking, versatile gun in excellent condition.
Fall hunting is right around the corner or a great range gun!
