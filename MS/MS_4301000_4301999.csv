Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold® engineers developed Multicoat 4®, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You’ll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold’s Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it."

Its a nice scope, I used it out to 550m when it was still my buddies on range day and really liked it.  The entire reticle is green illuminated with 8 different brightness settings.  It is a FFP(Front Focal Plane) reticle, meaning it magnifies the reticle as you adjust the magnification up. The BDC works very well out to the 550 that I shot it, and is calibrated out to 1000m. Never got to use the rangefinding part of it the way it should be but It seemed like it was fairly accurate (we were shooting silhouettes) Glass is nice and clear. It also has a built in internal level, kinda cool that you don't need to add one on.

This is a custom built meticulously assembled rifle hand built to exact spec  using the best parts with attention to detail in every component of the build. Ak's are known and sought after because people regard them as rugged and reliable even in the most adverse conditions.  Don't waste your time with a century arms built AK with canted sights / or gas block,  built as fast as possible by the lowest bidder with FUBAR rivets.  Get the best of both worlds in this rifle, far better than any century or waffen rifle at far lower cost than an arsenal built Pre ban rifle.  This rifle is ready to go 922r compliant/ trigger job/  custom worked action. Slick and ready to be put to the test...  I'm not saying all century AK's are bad I'm just saying, why gamble?  880 as shown with both stocks. Will sell for 780$ wood stock and standard grip black or brown. See middle pic.  This is a 1,200$ custom AK 74 at a huge price reduction... Bonesteel stocks sell for 160 to 175 + shipping. Tapco grips are 30$ just something to factor in.

I also do custom work so if there is something you have in mind or don't see a caliber/firearm listed that you'd like, just Contact me. I can make them for just about any gun out there. Can design one off parts as well if you'd like something special and one of a kind. All of my designs are cad drawn, the tested through flow simulations (computational fluid dynamics), and once the maximum effectiveness is reached, decorative machining is added for weight reduction and a better overall appearance. Then each brake is tested at the range to ensure real world matches the simulations. All parts are made from aerospace grade titanium to make them as light and durable as possible. Will never rust or corrode and stand up to heat better than any other material out there. These parts are rated for full auto/ sustained fire and are approved for duty use. All of my parts come with a lifetime warranty for fit, function, and finish. I even cover stupid once. So if over time the finish wears or you ding it up, just contact me and ship it back and I'll repair, refinish, or replace it. All parts available in a matt titanium finish or available in TiCamo, Matt Black, F.D.E., or O.D. Green at no additional charge. Price varies typically from $115-$300 depending on the amount of material used and time required to machine it. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

It's a very clean, numbers matching VZ23 from the Brno plant in the Czech Republic. The serial number dates production back to late-1923 if my research serves me correct. It's a very clean rifle for being 92 years old; the bore is clean with no rust and the finish is in pretty decent condition. It was a non-sporterized model that stayed in the Czech Republic and has no export markings, meaning it's chambered in 8mm Mauser (aka 8x57mm/7.92x57). Shoots well and accurate.

I also do custom work so if there is something you have in mind or don't see a caliber/firearm listed that you'd like, just Contact me. I can make them for just about any gun out there. Can design one off parts as well if you'd like something special and one of a kind. All of my designs are cad drawn, the tested through flow simulations (computational fluid dynamics), and once the maximum effectiveness is reached, decorative machining is added for weight reduction and a better overall appearance. Then each brake is tested at the range to ensure real world matches the simulations. All parts are made from aerospace grade titanium to make them as light and durable as possible. Will never rust or corrode and stand up to heat better than any other material out there. These parts are rated for full auto/ sustained fire and are approved for duty use. All of my parts come with a lifetime warranty for fit, function, and finish. I even cover stupid once. So if over time the finish wears or you ding it up, just contact me and ship it back and I'll repair, refinish, or replace it. All parts available in a matt titanium finish or available in TiCamo, Matt Black, F.D.E., or O.D. Green at no additional charge. Price varies typically from $115-$300 depending on the amount of material used and time required to machine it. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

I also do custom work so if there is something you have in mind or don't see a caliber/firearm listed that you'd like, just Contact me. I can make them for just about any gun out there. Can design one off parts as well if you'd like something special and one of a kind. All of my designs are cad drawn, the tested through flow simulations (computational fluid dynamics), and once the maximum effectiveness is reached, decorative machining is added for weight reduction and a better overall appearance. Then each brake is tested at the range to ensure real world matches the simulations. All parts are made from aerospace grade titanium to make them as light and durable as possible. Will never rust or corrode and stand up to heat better than any other material out there. These parts are rated for full auto/ sustained fire and are approved for duty use. All of my parts come with a lifetime warranty for fit, function, and finish. I even cover stupid once. So if over time the finish wears or you ding it up, just contact me and ship it back and I'll repair, refinish, or replace it. All parts available in a matt titanium finish or available in TiCamo, Matt Black, F.D.E., or O.D. Green at no additional charge. Price varies typically from $115-$300 depending on the amount of material used and time required to machine it. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

I spent $160 alone on the two ten round magazines alone hence my asking price. 

This amazing pistol has less than 200 rounds thru it. It's amazingly accurate, gorgeous looking and has a modular grip to fit any hand. Problem is, I'm left handed and just doesn't work for me. 

Comes with everything in pics. Two mags (one is a pinned 15 rounder) and the other is a factory 10 rounder (just try finding one!) 

I'd rather trade than sell this beauty. Please, for the love of God, don't message me with trade offers for a Glock or M&P or a really ""nice"" 92FS. It's not going to happen. I'm looking for a quality full size 1911 Colt, Kimber or Springfield or perhaps ( I do mean perhaps) a Sig 226 in 9mm that is NOT a stock one. A MK25 with extra mags or a P228 in Tan. Sigs must be new or less than 100 rounds thru it with spare mags. I may also consider a quality AR-15 or AR-10 or a M1A. Those are my ONLY trade interest. 

I'm putting a $1,500 trade value. 

For those that love movies, this is same badass pistol Keanu Reeves used in ""John Wick"".
