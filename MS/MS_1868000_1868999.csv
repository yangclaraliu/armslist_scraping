These were the only P220ST pistols that ever left the Sig shop with the Nitron finish and they received special attention in production. The trigger pull shows that as it is awesome both in single and double action. This has been my baby, and is in excellent condition with around 500 rounds fired. I never had a single FTF/FTE, it ran flawlessly with any ammo. It has everything you need for any carry setup. As you can see from the information below, nothing but the best was used when putting this package together.

You will not find nicer 7400s in anyone's collection, I bought them new and they are still in that condition, I take care of my firearms and meticulously maintain them. You don't find them in this condition and couldn't again if you tried. The 270 with ingravings in new condition have sold for as much as 1750. When the market was booming, now is around 800. The 30.06 model beings it has an original English walnut stock and isn't the carbine length from that era were a low production run(less than 6500 made) sells for between 600-675. If you can find them. Both are rifle lengths 22"" vs. the carbine 18.5"" lengths in most gun cabinets great collection and as nice as they were when they left Remington. Have ammo as well. May seperate but prefer to trade together for AR or nice combos."

The lusterous blueing on the slide, barrel and other hard parts is nicely contrasted by the lovely walnut stocks with the carved S&W and Gunsite Raven logo's which is echoed in the Raven engraving on the receiver. The frame is made from Scandium. The sights are Novak low rise and make for a smooth, no snag draw from a holster (no front gold bead). The barrel is 4 1/4"" with a match grade barrel bushing. The trigger is adjustable. The gun comes in the factory lockable protective case with the original manual, barrel wrench, 2 S&W OEM ACT made, 8 round magazines and sealed packet containing the sample factory fired casing. 

I am the original owner and have fired this very accurate pistol less than 100 rounds of Federal and RP 45 ACP hardball. The earlier manufactured pistols like this one (SN FSP 0798) were completely hand fitted for maximum accuracy and reliability. The gun is in completely stock, unmodified condition since new. I will offer approximately 2 and 1/2 boxes of new RP (2 boxes of 50 rounds 230gr RN, approximately 1/2 box of Federal 230gr RN) to the buyer at my cost from about a year ago.

I play by the rules. For sale face to face only to bonafide Arkansas resident with proof of Ar residency, otherwise it has to go through (or sale to) an FFL. 

I also believe in describing an item accurately. Feel free to check my feedback on ebay (handle- achildofthesky )I am an individual and not a dealer or business and because of this, the gun is sold with out warranties of any type on my part and all sales are final. That said, if you have been looking for a truely nice example of these accurate and finely assembled and increasingly hard to find pistols, you will not be dissapointed with this one.  I have a couple of other high quality collectable guns I will be selling to help generate funds for a home purchase."

This gun has been fired less than 3 boxes of ammo since new and still has that ""new gun"" feel to it with the action a nice snug feel to it. I do not have the original box for it. I can offer the buyer the option to purchase at my cost from a couple years ago, 2-3 boxes of ammo (Hornady leverevolution, Remington, perhaps others, Ihave to see what I have).

This is the increasingly difficult to find original, made only from 2002-2004 (made in limited numbers) Connecticut made JM 336Y Spikehorn with 16 1/4"" trapper length barrel and a 1 inch shorter length of pull stock that is perfect for smaller stature shooters but also makes it a fine choice for all that appreciate a handy handling, all around rifle. 

The lusterous blueing on the receiver, barrel and other hard parts is nicely contrasted by the lovely walnut stocks. The exceptionally nice smooth, pistol grip buttstock and fore end are made from genuine deep and rich walnut (not some mystery wood or laminate like the horrid REMLIN rifles currently on sale) in excellent condition and the rifle wears the OEM factory recoil pad. The receiver is factory drilled and tapped for scope mounts. I will offer a buyer the option of a quality scope mount installed in place of the WGRS peep sight should they so desire. 

The sights are a Williams WGRS in the rear (windage and elevation adjustable peep sight with screw in aperture) and the appropriate height Williams Fire Sight front sight and also the factory rear sight is in place which is adjustable for windage and elevation of course. This would make a truely great fast handling deer & bear rifle for the woods hunter and also a fine first rifle for young hunters. 


Face to face sale to a bonafide Arkansas resident only with proof of Ar residency.

I am offering this rifle at this price for only a few days at this reduced price as I am moving before the end of the month."

Keep in mind when comparing this to other sales and or offers;  Sig Sauer only produced a total of three hundred of these 1911s in the Carry Model (4 inch barrel)  and while the full size model and the carry model both have the phrase ""MOLAN LABE"" engraved in 24k Gold, only the carry model is engraved in 24K gold with an additional distinction of being ""1 of 300"" to represent the 300 Spartans that remained behind with Leonidas to guard the pass and to serve as a reminder that the Sig Sauer 1911 ""Spartan 300"" model was a limited production run of only 300.

DONT GET HOOD WINKED, IF IT IS NOT THE SPARTAN 1911 CARRY MODEL and Engraved with ""1 of 300"" put your money back in your pocket (Especially if the deciding factor was because it was a limited production gun) because there's nothing Limited about the Full Size 1911 Spartan with the 5 inch Barrel ""its a catalog gun""..meaning there are more of'em

(I also purchased the five inch barrel version about two weeks ago to complement my Sig Sauer 1911 ""Sparta"" collection and will sell both of them for $2812.00 if a buyer is interested)  - 

Keep in mind both models are sharp and distinctive looking handguns and while I'm not totally adverse to keeping them, I'm more suited to my tactical shotguns, all this to say lowball offers will be ignored.  

The engraved 24k gold “MOLON LABE” translates as a message to Big Brother: “Come and Take Them”  

For a complete and detailed review of this handgun visit (http://www.shotgunnews.com/2013/04/02/molon-labe-sig-sauer-m1911-spartan-review/)

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The Ancient Greek phrase molon labé; means “Come and take them”.  It is a classical expression of defiance reportedly spoken by King Leonidas I in response to the Persian army’s demand that the Spartans surrender their weapons at the Battle of Thermopylae.

I installed a new ejector from Numrich, and have now shot about 300 rounds of back yard skeet with it.  It has a Cutts choke on it with Modified installed.  The gun is tight with no bolt drop or play, the action bar safety works normal, and the barrel is 28"" to the end of the choke.  The gun was manufactured in 1931, and if  you can't see the serial number clearly I'll email it to you.  With the exception of the Cutts, it is an original gun and the bluing is what you'd expect from a field used 1930's gun.  All works perfectly and you're more than welcome to come to my house and shoot it.

Up for sale today is my Benelli M2 semiautomatic shotgun with Nordic mag extension and ammunition. I am the second owner of this fine shotgun. It has a 19"" barrel and rifle sights, and has a 6+1 capacity. It comes with one choke (which I never use, so I have no idea which one it is) and a few accessories, like a sling, Limbsaver buttpad (orig. Benelli buttpad will be included) and a few other things which I cannot remember at the moment.

Gun shoots sweet and is accurate for a shotgun. Recoil is very manageable. It will not cycle low recoil 12GA buck rounds, but it just eats up universal/ #8 target loads all day, and does so reliably- this thing will not misfeed. There is wear on the parkerizing of the extension tube, evidently the previous owner decided to adjust the flashlight he had on it without untightening the set screw. Here are some pics.


I would like $925 and that includes me driving up to two hours to meet you. Make an offer, it's well worth it! Buyer gets first dibs on my remaining ammunition for this fine firearm.

Aug 4, 2013- If anyone picks this up within the next week I'll offer ~200rds of 00bk for $150 and all of my #8 target load for $125 (I have about six boxes). I'll also take $900 for the shotgun and accessories if it's bought this week (Aug 2-Aug 9)"

Critical DUTY® handgun ammunition is built to meet the needs and requirements of LAW ENFORCEMENT and TACTICAL PROFESSIONALS, as well as those law abiding citizens who prefer a full-size handgun for their personal protection and demand superior barrier penetration and subsequent terminal performance.* OFFER 

The FlexLock® bullets loaded in all Critical DUTY® offerings are rugged, heavy jacketed bullets that deliver virtually “barrier blind” performance (i.e. total penetration, weight retention and expansion are practically the same) when shot through common urban barriers* (bare gelatin, auto glass, sheet metal, plywood, drywall, heavy clothing*). In addition, Critical DUTY® loads are “full power loads” designed to function full-size handgun slides. Although designed to work flawlessly in ALL handguns, these loads are NOT optimized for short barreled, concealed carry style handguns; they will deliver standard recoil during firing. *As defined by the “FBI Protocol” handgun ammunition tests.

The Executive Carry is essentially the Executive Elite modified for carry. It's the solution for those who prefer a smaller model 1911, but insist on complete reliability. The slide has been reduced to the minimum possible (4.25"") without significantly impairing the legendary reliability of the 5"" slide. The frame has been modified with the innovative Ed Brown Bobtail® housing which reduces the projecting butt of the mainspring housing without sacrificing the full size frame and magazine capacity. The Bobtail® minimizes the print under your jacket when carrying and reduces weight. Officer's frames reduce magazine capacity and limit grip, while keeping the projecting, sharp butt. Slides shorter than 4.25"" are notorious for reduced reliability. These problems are eliminated with the Ed Brown Commander Bobtail® configuration, which reflects the genius of John Browning with an innovative modern flair. The functional simplicity has yet to be matched.

The Executive Carry is truly at the top of it's field. Get promoted to an Executive Carry - it's a serious tool for the competent professional!

The Executive Carry features the following:
4.25"" Commander model slide, single stack commander Bobtail® frame. The John Browning traditional design innovatively modified for concealed carry, without significantly detracting from reliability or accuracy.
Weight: approximately 35 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted.
Exclusive Skip checkering on forestrap and Bobtail®.

This load is a very high performance +P 45 acp load. The 185gr. hollow cavity Barnes all copper bullet mushrooms readily and still penetrates deeply for such a light bullet, while giving the low recoil and high velocity of a light bullet. This helps fast sight acquisition for quick/accurate follow-up shots. Expect roughly 13 to 14 inches of penetration in flesh and bone.

This load utilizes a low flash powder which gives an important tactical advantage to the shooter as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Being blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

As usual, Buffalo Bore tests and obtains our advertised velocities from real world over-the-counter firearms. We believe that the industry wide established practice of utilizing extra long test barrels to generate advertised velocities is dishonest and creates expectations that cannot be realized in real guns, in the real world, where it matters. With Buffalo Bore ammo, you’ll actually obtain the velocities we advertise.

    1193 fps -- Colt Series 90 Gold Cup, 5 inch
    1183 fps -- H&K, USP Tactical, 5 inch
    1158 fps -- Glock Model 21, 4.6 inch
    1159 fps -- Colt series 80 Commander, 4.25 inch
    1110 fps -- Glock model 30, 3.5 inch


In one of the above instances, you’ll note that a longer barrel gave velocities lower than one of the shorter barrels, showing that there is more to internal ballistics, than just barrel length.

This load reliably fed and exhibited very good accuracy in all test pistols."

The polycarbonate case is rubber armored, providing an extremely durable impact and ter resistant unit. This scope offers quality and function superior to scopes costing hundreds of dollars more. The Scout, Sibir T and Sibir TSH lines are the perfect spotting scopes for analysing the entry of a .223 cal at 100 meters. Your other spotting scopes can't do that!"

CCI makes rifle primers for commercial sale that matches military sensitivity specs that reduce the chance of a slam-fire when other factors go out of control.
