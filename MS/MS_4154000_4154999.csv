On a related note most of the ads that list Colorado as the location and no city are usally scams especially if the price of the firearm is much lower than you would normally pay. There is a Nighthawk 1911 one or two down in the board that is a obvious scam. Please flag em before one of the newer gunbuyer friends is ripped off.

Product Description
hr_1871_inc H&R's Pardner lineup pays homage to their total entrenchment in the shooting sports with a wide range of options to cover every situation and budget. The versatile and economical Pardner shotgun design has changed very little since they started building them back in 1893, because it works. Their break actions have long been the choice of straight-shooters who want the most out of their single shot at game or a clay target. They're lightweight, quickpointing and have very few moving parts to maintain. These guns open smoothly when you press the lever, lock up tight as a bank vault door, and feature H&R's Transfer Bar System that acts as a safety to prevent unintended firing. This 10-gauge Turkey gun has a 24"" barrel with a 3-1/2"" chamber, plus a screw-in extended extra full choke tube to keep a super tight pattern on your point of aim. The Mossy Oak Break-Up camo finished stock incorporates a counterweight system to soften recoil. Drilled and tapped for scope mounts.

This new “Heavy” 44 SPL load is designed for use in all 44 SPL handguns and rifles, except Charter Arms Bull Dog. Likewise, it is safe for use in all 44 magnum chambered firearms. This Barnes X type bullet will expand on flesh and bone and penetrate more deeply than most expanding lead core bullets of the same weight. Expect roughly 16 to 18 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone.

We’ve utilized a flash retardant powder so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire should he need to “drop the hammer” in low light. Since nearly 95% of all civilian shootings in the US occur in low light, when the criminal element is active, low flash powders can give an enormous tactical advantage to the user.

As always, Buffalo Bore uses real, over-the-counter firearms to determine our published, real-world velocities. We prefer not to follow the industry wide, duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory test barrels to generate exaggerated velocities that the ammo user will seldom, if ever see. With Buffalo Bore you will know what velocity your ammunition is generating in the real world, where it matters.

Product Information
It’s an exciting, but long, story of how our guys located this ammo at a defense contractor just after ATF’s announcement on February 16, waited for it to be declared surplus to a DEA contract; then worked hard to get it expedited to our warehouse. It arrived two days before our self-imposed deadline and here it is. Hard to imagine that this may be the last supply of SS109 ammo ever offered to the public.

 ______________________________________________ 

NOTE:  Due to extremely high demand - Please allow an extra few days in addition to the date shown for the shipment of this product.

 General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems is an approved supplier of ammunition to the US Military and other government agencies. This 5.56x45mm ammunition features a SS109 projectile, fully reloadable brass case and is boxer primed.

 This ammunition is an overrun from a DEA contract and is in extremely short supply.

 Please note that while this ammo is loaded with a true SS109 steel tip penetrator bullet, it does not include the painted green tip. The green paint is added to US military contract ammo for easy identification in the field.

THE STIPPLE JOB IS THIS HK IS OUTSTANDING AND WAS MUCH NEEDED AS THE STOCK TEXURE IS WAY TO SLICK. 110RDS DOWN RANGE. COMES WITH BOX, 2 MAGS, PAPERS ECT... PM OR TEXT REDACTED.

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014.

Often, we find military items, designed for combat, that transition perfectly into the realm of wilderness survival. The LaGana Tactical Tomahawk (VTAC) is a prime example of this. We highly recommend a survival axe of some sort and this durable hand axe, or survival tomahawk, fits the bill.

A survival tomahawk, like the LaGana Tactical Tomahawk or VTAC, can be used for emergency aircraft extraction, building shelters, cutting firewood, self defense and numerous other life saving uses. Because it is EXTREMELY durable and very sharp, there is practically no cutting task that it cannot accomplish. Durability and utility are two of the most important traits we look for when evaluating survival equipment. The LaGana Tactical Tomahawk is overflowing with both.

The LaGana Tactical Tomahawk (a.k.a. ""VTAC"") is the standard by which all other tactical axes are judged. Battle proven for over 40 years, Peter LaGana's axe-head design has served the United States in every major conflict since the Vietnam War. Modernized with 21st century materials and workmanship, the new LaGana Tactical Tomahawk sets the bar for ease of carry, toughness, and versatility. No axe in the War on Terror has seen and done more.

The military approved VTAC comes fully equipped with a heavy duty nylon sheath. This is the REAL VTAC, not a cheap knockoff version.

I am selling my as new BT-99, 34'' barrel, standard configuration. Born 2012 and purchased in 2013 and not a mark on it. It has less than 200 rounds through it and I just don't have the time or money for shells to get where I need to be at competitively. I shoot much better with my Citori O/U as I have owned it many more years. Comes with everything you see, manual, chamber lock and choke wrench. No box, didn't need another one laying around. Comes with factory full choke. 
Description:
INVECTOR PLUS™ CHOKE TUBE SYSTEM
 The Invector-Plus interchangeable choke tube system provides consistent, dense shot patterns in the constriction needed for your shooting situation. The longer choke taper inside an Invector-Plus choke tube works with Back-Bored Technology to produce patterns with more uniform densities and fewer flyers. The superior design eliminates gases slipping between the choke tube and barrel that could damage the choke tube and the barrel. CHROME CHAMBERS
 The BT-99 features a chrome-plated chamber to resist the toll thousands of shells can take on lesser quality guns. Corrosion resistance is also greatly improved.
 VECTOR PRO™ LENGTHENED FORCING CONE
 Longer, tapered Vector Pro dimensions minimize shot deformation and maximize pattern uniformity, consistency and density. Back-boring increases bore diameter specifications and decreases friction between the shot cup and the bore to maximize shot pellet velocity and reduce felt recoil. Reducing constriction from the forcing cone on the shot column results in fewer deformed pellets for more uniform patterns, and keeps more pellets in the central part of the pattern where they’re needed to smoke clays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barrel - The BT-99 features a back-bored barrel and utilizes the Invector-Plus™ choke tube system to provide more consistent patterns and reduce felt recoil.
Chokes - Interchangeable Invector-Plus™.
Forearm - Bold beavertail forearm helps absorb recoil and assist hand-eye coordination.
Extractor - The BT-99 features an extractor only.
Rib - High-post, 11/32"" rib.

HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, acombination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoileffects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.Manufacturer: Heckler & KochModel: USP Full SizeCaliber: .9mmBarrel Length: 4.25""Action: Double / Single Action"

The ARK is a relatively new rifle design released around June of 2014 by Creative Arms manufacturing in Des Moines Iowa. It combines the best characteristics of the most popular military rifles ever made , the Ak-47 and the M-16/Ar-15. It is the rugged /trusted Ak with the versatility and ergonomics of your trusted M-16/ar-15. 

They started with a chunk of billet aluminum and milled out a custom lower that will accept a M-16/Ar-15 trigger group ( this is not your standard ar lower ). They then designed a stainless gas piston driven rotating bolt carrier assembly . The barrel has a 1/ 9.5 twist with an A4 style flash suppressor. 

It comes with a pretty cool aluminum forgrip with top and bottom rails. The sides are drilled and tapped for additional rails. It is cerakoted in flat dark earth.

This is the rifle the range riders of the 1800’s would have loved to have had close at hand for picking off varmints or just plinking at whiskey bottles. But since the .17HMR didn’t hit the market until 2002, it will be up to you to make it a legend. Our Henry Varmint Express® rifle packs eleven .17HMR rounds in its tubular magazine. It features a 20″ barrel, comes with a checkered American walnut Monte Carlo stock. Like all lever action Henrys, the action is incredibly smooth from the very first shot. It will enable small game and varmint hunters to take full advantage of the .17HMR with regard to velocity, trajectory, wind drift, richochet resistance, quietness and accuracy. Already considered by many to be the most accurate rimfire cartridge ever produced, the .17HMR incorporates a .17 caliber bullet into a necked-down .22 magnum case. This high-powered combination produces a sizzlin’ muzzle velocity of up to 2,550 feet per second and the laser-flat trajectory makes it lethal for long-range shots on woodchucks, prairie dogs, foxes and other small varmints. Henry’s take on this revolutionary caliber, the Varmint Express, has a 20″ barrel that delivers dead-on accuracy. Just like all Henry rifles, it’s handcrafted in the United States using only high-grade components such as a checkered American walnut stock, and Williams Fire sights and, of course, it’s outfitted with that legendary, smooth-operating lever action that sets a Henry rifle apart from all the imitators.Comes with box, manual, lock and warranty card.

Description from Springfield site:  Is it possible for a pistol small enough to carry every day to have all the features and capacity that you’d expect in a larger pistol? If that pistol is the XD-S® from Springfield Armory®, the answer is yes. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack 9mm offers so much that you’ll be astonished that it all fits in the small, concealable profile.

The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol.  Use your XD-S® Single Stack with an X-Tension™ magazine and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there.

If you’re looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack  in 9mm. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

The NAA .22 Long Rifle is the most popular Mini-Revolver ever produced. With the many current accessories, it is versatile for many applications and is the standard by which other Mini-Revolvers are judged.

As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge.

Great hidden back-up gun. Can be hidden in a boot, a cap, in the crotch area or other secret places. Very easy to conceal. 

Don’t underrate the 22LR as a weapon. It is the favorite caliber for professional assassins and so also makes a great and inexpensive back-up weapon. It is so small you often forget you even have it with you.

I require CCW and ID to buy this."

Still needs more cleaning.  Cash only no trades please. The forstock on the Francotte does have a piece missing as picture shows. 
I guess I'm never gonna restore these beauties so they are up for sale. Neither of the actions open up all the way (partial only). I never tried to disassemble, I don't build ar's or ak's about all I can do to disasemble my pistols. These are C&R so no FFL needed. FTF in the Springs $245 each. Top picture is the Gahendra lower is the Francotte. Martini-Henry Gahendra was based on an 1869 Westley Richards patented design, this unique and extremely rare early breechloading Military Rifle 577/450 Martini-Henry calibre was produced under the direction of General Gahendra Rana in the 1880's to provide Ghurka regiments with what appeared to be the latest British Military Rifle. An ingenious design, it really surpassed the standard Martini in that its entire action was removable as one unit for ease of servicing or exchange. Production however caused massive logistic problems and by 1894 the Ghurkas were dangerously short of viable .450 cal. breechloaders to face ever growing threats from the east. Finally the British came to the rescue with a delivery of several thousand Martini short lever rifles in late 1894 and even more long lever Martini Rifles in 1908. The over complicated Gahendra Rifle was thereafter basically shelved, the void in up-to-date arms having been met. Always considered the rarest Martini variety of all, the Gahendra Rifle has a characteristic loading lever but in other respects closely resembles the standard Martini externally. A chance to obtain an extremely rare historical antique rifle that was a close relative of one of the most successful rifle systems of all time for an UNBEATABLE price!

The Martini Francotte patent System was developed in 1878 and utilizes a detachable mechanism fitted without the Cocking Indicator. Revolutionary at the time by compartmentalizing the mechanism for quick disassembly, it only lasted 10 years as the latest technology. It was replaced in 1888 by the .303 cal Lee Metford bolt-action Rifle's introduction into the British Military System. Although the British never embraced this European improvement, these ""Improved System Rifles"" saw much service on frontiers all over the World. Call or text mike 719/964/zero four 71"

 In the world of Browning,  the name ""Medallion"" is not tossed around lightly. Medallion means beauty, strength and function. The A-Botl Medallion epitomizes this idea offering a beautiful rifle with high gloss Walnut and blueing in a package with a super strong and accurate action.


• STOCK ◦ The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
◦ A durable gloss finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.

• ACTION/BARREL ◦ Durable polished blued steel for a striking appearance.
◦ Button-Rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
◦ The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
◦ Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
◦ Glass bedding provides stable and precise fit for the action, eliminating accuracy degrading physical stress.
◦ Drilled and tapped for scope mounts - optic ready platform
◦ 60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
◦ Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.

First is a flat top with a 233/.556 m4 contour barrel, A2 flash hider, quad rail and a nickle boron BCG. These are new uppers with all new parts. This one is 500$ and there are many available.

Lastly is another flat top upper. This is flat top as well chambered in the desireable .223 wylde that also shoots the .233/.556 but it is more accurate than the standard barrels.

I have to order these in but, the longest it takes is a week. To show I am not a scammer I will order in the uppers myself so you don't need to give your money to me until you have the upper in your hands. Serious inquiries please and have a great day!"
