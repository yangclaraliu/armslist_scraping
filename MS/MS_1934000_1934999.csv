Mine is a true Arsenal rifle, stamped Arsenal Inc!! These are not imported anymore with the Arsenal stamp!

 Made in the popular 5.45x39.5 caliber. The brainchild of two of the best gun makers in the world, the SGL31-61 rifle is manufactured at the world-famous Izhmash Factory in Russia then imported and remanufactured by Arsenal Inc, Las Vegas, NV into its final configuration. 

 The absolute reliability and authenticity make the SGL31-61 the ONLY CHOICE for collectors, perfectionists, and AK enthusiasts alike. All authentic components, made according to the original technology, and detailed attention, which went into the manufacturing, make the SGL31-61 THE rifle you will be proud to own and show off to your friends at the shooting range. The ONLY truly configured AK-74 currently available in the US market that uses brand new Hammer Forged and Chrome Line barrel, the SGL31-61 offers the safety and reliability that you expect from your rifle, making it the highest quality AK-74 available on the market. 

 This is one of the finest AK systems imported into the US. Anyone that truly knows AK systems, knows that Arsenal Inc. makes some of the best AK's in the world. I purchased this AK back in December brand new. When I purchased this rifle, it came configured as a true Arsenal SGL-31 61 with the black polymer furniture on it. I have since upgraded the rifle with new furniture and converted it to a sgl-31 94. Meaning I removed the standard buttstock and put on the ACE folding stock. The Ace folding stock is the second best folding stock made, behind the true folding stock that's standard on the 94. The Ace folding is made of light weight Aluminum and features an unique push button actuation method that securely locks the stock to the side when folded. It is a rock solid stock with no ""wobble."" I chose this stock because of the robust and durability characteristics it displays. 

 Now for the features and upgrades:

 *Chrome lined hammer forges barrel 
 *front sight block with bayonet lug
 *stamped receiver and magwell dimples for no magazine wobble (its an Arsenal!!)
 *Ace Folding stock with locking mechanism
 *US Palm battle grip
 *Tapco G2 Trigger group
 *XS Night sights (still have original sights as well that will come with package)
 *Kreb's custom retaining plate
 *Midwest Industries Rail system
 *AK74 muzzle break
 *Magpul AFG (black)

 I ordered 8 Bulgarian Circle 10 magazines from KVAR.com at $50 dollars each that I will include in thie package. Two of which are brand new, never used. The remaining 6 have been used but are in great working condition. These are the best magazines ever made for this rifle. It also includes 1 factory 10 round magazine. This is great for sighting in or hunting! 

 I will also include 1,000 rounds of 5.45 ammo to get you started with this rifle.

 Arsenal sgl-31 61...........................$1199.00 from KVAR.com
 Accys/upgrades.............................$500
 Magazines.....................................$400
 Ammo..........................................$200

 Basically over $2200 in this package. These prices are legitimate and can all be verified online with a little research. I know where I bought everything from and know what I paid for them. 

 Obviously, I can not expect to get the same amount of money that I put into it. Having said that, I will not respond to lowball offers, please be respectful and I'll, in turn, do the same. Please make a reasonable offer and we'll talk!

 *******I will take $1300 cash for the entire package if you buy it before the end of July!****"

This pistol was bought new on Nov 7th 2012 and I will provide a copy of the original bill of sale with my address blocked out. I have been having annoying problems with the trigger guard popping off its pin while firing, and I've read that Accu-Tek's warranty service takes ages. Rather than wait months to get it back, I'm just getting out of 380ACP altogether and sticking to other calibers. I figure the ammo is worth about $300 so you're getting a $100 pistol :) I will not sell separately."

Very similar to a Walther ppk/s in terms of cosmetic appearance and functioning. Springs on the gun have been upgraded (main spring, hammer spring, magazine spring) by Wolff gun springs or replaced (firing pin spring, trigger return spring) to reduce trigger pull and felt recoil and improve feeding. All original and other springs from the calibration kits are included so you can tune the gun to desired specifications.

I have fired over 200 rounds and have not had a single problem with feeding, ejection, firing, etc. It is in great cosmetic and mechanical shape. Would be a good CC weapon. Local sales only CO resident 21+. Must, unfortunately, follow current transfer regulations. Sorry. I know an ffl in Littleton that can facilitate transfers.

I have been surprised at how well they hold their value or increase in value.  Obviously, I could sell a few of them and get some cash and buy a motorcycle, but I would be interested in possibly trading with someone who has a cruiser bike they don't need and no cash, but wants some more stuff for his/her safe.  My safe is too crowded and I want to ride :)
I have several items that I might want to part with, depending on the deal.  AR-15, 1911, compact 45, .40 cal, Mark II .22 ruger, PPKS 9mm, 25-06 rifle, and a few more.

Obviously, I could get could cash, just selling these item, so if you are one of those people just looking to score a cheap gun, I am not interested.  I am specifically looking for good value for my guns for someone who doesn't have cash, but a good bike with a clean clear title to trade.

Only interested in Oklahoma buyers or dealers because I will require a bill of sale for both of our records. 

I might throw in some cash for the right bike depending on value.

Thanks for looking and please send info/pics of your bike if interested."

It says that it may require a break in period with magnum shells on a sticker inside the box... I put that to the test, and found that right out of the box it runs flawlessly without magnum shells. It's pretty lightweight. Kicks pretty hard but it has a nice rubber recoil pad and pistol grip. I was very impressed with this shotgun and you will be too. Also comes with a top rail and removable ghost ring sight. These retail for 550-580 dollars. I would like a trade value of 500 dollars firm and will sell outright for 450 dollars cash."

Basically, if you have a full-sized 1911 and are interested in a straight trade, contact me and maybe we'll work it out. I may consider other pistols. A Sig P226 or 229 would be great. I'd also really like to keep this deal local (Western NC) so please meet within an hour of Canton. I'd drive further for the right deal, but it would have to be an amazing deal for me. The only way I'd sell is if I got $600. I prefer dealing face to face, but if you had to have it shipped FFL, you would have to pay all fees, leaving me with $600. This price is very firm. Any less, and I will just keep it. I'm basing this value on the rarity of the firearm."

Is it national crack smoking week in the gun community? Why do I keep seeing overpriced ammo posts on this website? I don't know if you people realize, but ammo in just about any caliber is widely available at the moment, most of it at affordable prices. Dicks, walmart, and most of the local gunshops have ammo in stock at prices that aren't necessarily ideal, but affordable. There are also hundreds of companies selling ammo online. Gunbot.net and ammoseek.com are both excellent websites for seeking out the best deals. We need to stop feeding these leeches that seek nothing but to exploit and profit  from decent members of the gun community. When you see people selling overpriced ammo, dont buy it, mark it as overpriced and seek out better deals. Be a proactive buyer, create a demand for low priced ammo and it'll slowly make it's way back."

It has never been installed or used, still new on the pallet. It runs off of two 20lb propane cylinders and provides 3,400 watts of standby power to your home when the power goes out. It can also be connected to larger propane tanks or to a dedicated gas line from the street.

Some specs:

Reliable propane powered alternative to gas generators
Provides 3,400 watts of electricity for basic power needs during power outage
Power transfer monitor contains 2 sets of GFCI outlets
Uses 2 LP propane tanks (not included)
Non-CARB Compliant/Not For Sale In California

It sells new for $1800, letting it go for $850 or trade for some thing or things I can use.

PRICE DROP: $650

PRICE DROP AGAIN: $500

I am listing it here because I think it would make a great hunting cabin generator. Simply take two 20lb propane tanks to the cabin and connect them while you are there.

Located in Pinehurst, Southern Pines area so please consider that before offing.

This item is also pretty heavy and will require a pickup to move it, and some muscle.

I have had multiple offers and too many no shows. Understand that I am only available to meet weekdays between the hours of 9am and 3pm, no earlier or later. I work nights and weekends so please honor my time by not screwing around saying you will meet then not show.

I have a CHP and I am happy to sign a bill of sale on trades.

So if you buy from these creeps, photograph their vehicle and them too, post them on forums tell the people you know who can't buy ammo because of these guys !

It has factory tritium night sights and the stock has been upgraded to a magpul and a Scattergun Technologies (Wilson Combat) +2 extension was added. It will come with the original box and paperwork as well as the box and extra spacers for the Magpul stock.

I'm sure I will get a lot of questions of why this costs more than a basic 870 you see in a typical sporting goods store. Those are standard ""express"" actions even on the tactical models. They have a plastic trigger guard assembly, a weak MIM (metal injection molded) extractor, a week ejector, and most often just a plain bead sight. They also aren't made to nearly the quality the ""Police"" actions are and also have a cheap teflon finish. 

The Police actions use a metal trigger guard assembly, a heavy duty ejector, a milled extractor, and have a very nice parkerized finish. They are held to a much higher quality standard and the parts like the mag tube, and sights and hit temperature soldered. This model features adjustable tritium night sights (both front and rear). This is a buy once, cry once purchase that will last generations.

I have well over $800 into this shotgun and thats was getting a very good deal on it from Trader Jerry's. Most local shops sell this shotgun in the $750 range in factory form. I will take $600 for it FIRM. I will not take any less and I'm not interested in any trades."

My wife loves shooting it more than her .380. I've put about 500rds through it. Somewhere in moving, I've lost my case though. The reason I am selling/trading it, is that I have a Kel Tec Sub 2000 and I'm wanting to get a Glock so I can interchange my mags. If it weren't for that, I would just keep the gun. In a perfect world, I'd keep this gun and buy a Glock 23. But the voice of reason, my wife, is telling me otherwise. :) So if you are interested, the best way to get a hold of me is through email, but you can text as well. REDACTED).

Interior is clean and in almost perfect condition, with the exception of a little, normal, wear on the drivers side of the seat.  Exterior is slick, just a little surface rust, speckles, and only one small spot of bad rust, which is behind the drivers side door, at the bottom. AC blows cold and the truck drives great and reliably. The only known mechanical issue is that the automatic choke is on the fritz. You have to pump the gas to start and it sometimes sputters when turned off. The paint DOES look better in the pictures, but the pictures ARE current. If you look closely, you will see fading in places of the red paint. Like I said, it's all original with exception of engine. Asking $4,750.00."

I have a brand-new AR rifle lower that I out together myself after a lot of time spent chasing down parts.  The bare lower is from Palmetto State Armory.  Eventually, I was able to find a PSA lower build kit that included a complete lower parts kit, along with a Magpul MOE grip and rifle stock.

This lower is completely assembled and ready to mount to virtually any AR-platfrom upper.  I clicked it onto my Colt LE6920 SOCOM upper with no issues and it functioned-checked perfectly.

This is a great starting point for a nice new rifle.  I had intended on turning this into a nice Coyote rifle, but I need the money now instead, desperately.  I just want back what I have into parts, which I got at very fair prices.  Cash only.  No trades. Price is FIRM.

Below is a description of the Beretta I am selling:

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm.

 Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
