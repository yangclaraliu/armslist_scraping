Up for trade is 1 case of AE223BK. This is excellent quality factory loaded brass cased 55grain ammo. Excellent shooting. The cheapest I found it online in stock currently was $369.00 plus shipping. So I am setting the trade value at that. Any trade must be in excellent condition. 

As for trades I am open to most firearms related stuff. 

Remington 870 or Mossberg 500. Please keep the trade value in mind. I won't straight trade for a standard hunting shotgun. Home defense setup (18"" or 20"" barrel extended mag) will be preffered.

S&W M&P Shield 9mm even trade. 

Ruger lcr 357

S&W 38 snub nose 

Polish p-64 plus cash

Possibly an eotech or aimpoint

Nice lever action in 30-30

Would also consider a ps4 or Xbox one package. Must come with games, controllers etc. my buddy owns an electronic shop so I will be basing the value of your stuff off what he would be asking for it in his store.

I absolutely love this gun. It shoots so smooth, dead nuts accurate, and has less kick than any other 9mm i have shot. I have fed this beast every type of ammo I could find just to see if it would malfunction. I'm pretty sure you could put a primer on dog shit and this would shoot it. 
Fully adjustable rear sights, decocker, mag disconnect, safety features and functions that are desirable. 
It's 9mm, 16 round capacity, and functions flawlessly. Do your research and you'll find out this gun is one of the best 9mm ever made. It's in the category of the ""Wonder nines"" and it's easy to see why.

The Eotech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sight was developed after extensive testing of various optical sights, and US Special Operations Command has standardized on the Eotech Holographic Weapon Sight as its 1X weapon optic for close quarter and urban combat zones. To meet the stringent requirements set and demanded by our elite fighting forces, EOTech has developed the EOTech Holo Sight M 553, modeled after the ever popular, battle proven Eotech HWS design. The EOTech M553 Holo Sight incorporates many additional features required within the SOPMOD Block 2 program. The advantage of EOTech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sights is its holographic reticle patterns that are instantly visible in any light condition, instinctive to center regardless of shooting angle and always remain in view to achieve lightning quick reticle to target acquisition without covering or obscuring the point of aim. The magic of EOTech Holographic 553 Weapon Sights is the edge they provide to you in close quarter or urban combat zones. The EOTech Holographic M553 Weapon Sight will remain fully operational even when the laminated window is obstructed by mud, snow, rain, or even damaged/shattered, as long as you can see through any portion of the laminated window, the entire reticle pattern will be visible on target with point of aim/impact being maintained and fully functional, the operator can still engage with confidence"

This is a true Left Hand version of this awesome rifle (Anschutz made several iterations with left hand stocks but right hand cocking etc.) I have replaced the truly ugly blue laminate stock sections with exhibition grade Circassian walnut because I love the feel and smell of great wood and life is too short to shoot an ugly rifle. There is plenty left on the pistol grip so you can customize it to fit your hand. The rifle is set up to match the 2013L 3P small bore rifle in weight and balance. This allows one to practice for small bore at home with the air rifle. I found this to be a very successful strategy and economical considering the relative costs of Ely ESP vs. RWS pellets.

These are some great, unusual firearms. 

First is a Bryco Jennings Jr. 22lr Rifle. These weren't made anytime recently. This one is in fairly good shape. 16"" barrel, rifle sights, synthetic stock, stainless bolt. Fun rifle to shoot. Its very accurate, shoots great and is super lightweight. How many people can say they own or have ever seen a Jennings rifle?

$100

Second is a Buckeye Gun Co. 12 gauge shotgun. Single barrel, break action, 2 3/4in chamber, full choke with a 34"" barrel. Manufactured in Lynchburg, VA (to a pretty high standard) this shotgun shoots perfect and would be great to take hunting or to just hang up as a conversation piece. Has some patina and wear on the metal but it just makes the shotgun look even better. 

$100

Will do both for $160. These are both fairly hard to find and in decent shape for their age. Call or text REDACTED. If I don't answer just leave a message and I'll call right back. Would like to sell TODAY to pay some bills. Willing to meet anywhere in the tri cities before 5pm."
