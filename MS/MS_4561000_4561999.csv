This early variant was produced in .380 ACP caliber in El Monte, California. OMC produced a short run of these pistols before the molds were purchased by Arcadia Machine & Tool, who took over production.

The original AMT Backup was produced with a single-action trigger mechanism, while the later Backup II used a double-action-only mechanism. These pistols were manufactured by AMT and later Galena Industries (until November 2001).[1]

The AMT Backup is a small semiautomatic pistol available in a wide range of calibers: .22LR, .380 ACP, .38 Super, 9×19mm, .357 SIG, .40 S&W, .400 Corbon and .45 ACP have all been offered. This pistol was designed to be carried as a backup gun by law enforcement and security professionals or anyone desiring a small concealable weapon. Its marketing slogan was ""the smallest, most powerful"" backup weapon available.

1.)  Bushnell Zoom Dot Tactical Red Dot, sold new for around $300, Amazon has used and refurbs for $150-$180, selling mine for $80 obo shipped.  Great condition, but the rubber lens caps/plugs were cut off.  For info and reviews:  http://www.opticsplanet.com/bushnell-zoom-dot-tactical-riflescope.html  

2.)  Hornady Critical Duty 9mm FlexLock 135gr +P JHP 50rd. boxes.

$300 FIRM per case, 10-50rd. boxes(500rds.) or trade for 1,000rds. of Federal or equal M855, XM193.  Out of 100+ sites on AmmoSeek, the cheapest is $0.68 per round not including any shipping and/or taxes, I am selling for $0.60 per round, if you want cheap ammo, this is not for you, I will no longer respond to lowball offers.

3.)  AK-74 Mags:

1 - 30rd. Polish Radom mag, $30 (pictured with the two plum mags)

2 - 30rd. Izhmash Plum mags, the one in the center looks like a speckled plum, but I've only seen this on Tula mags before.  $80 for both

$120 for the remaining 5 mags or $130 shipped.

Prefer cash, but will consider trades if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested.  If wanting to trade, please be specific on what you are offering exactly, straight trade, trade +/- cash and how much, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I have other items listed for a bigger deal on something.  

Trades considered:

A few items I can think of right now, AR-10(or nice upper / lower), Sig 556R 7.62x39 Gen 2 only, maybe the new converted U.S. Saiga AK-47 since they are $750 new.  I could use a quality stripped AR-10 lower, quality 1"" AR one piece scope mount with pic rails on the rings and 1-2 GG&G Ruger Mini 14/30 scope mounts.  Clean Ruger GP100 SS 6"" .357 mag and SA XDS 9mm(post recall), the ""essentials"" package would be fine, since they are less than $400 new.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice trigger groups etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs. 

Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed at additional cost and I can accept PayPal as a ""gift"", unless you want to pay their fees."

- .30 caliber
- round bolt
- lever safety
- ""W"" marked barrel
- with one 15-round magazine
-- this magazine does not hold the bolt back on last shot

THE GOOD : this is a Winchester, one of the more desirable of the M1 Carbine manufacturers.  And it works.  Since this is more than 50 years old, it is exempt from Colorado's stupid background check law.  (The other guns I have for sale here DO require a background check)

THE BAD : The sights on this carbine are not original military.  Somebody welded a front sight base on the barrel, and put a Williams peep sight on the rear.  I don't know if the dovetail in the rear was cut for the new sight.  When I shot this carbine, both sights came flying loose.  The stock has a plate with the name ""Rick"" on it.  I have no idea who Rick is.  The opening for the sling attachment at the rear of the stock has been filled.


I had originally planned to have this restored to its original military configuration, but never got around to it.  This has been sitting around for a few years untouched -- I only shot it to get the pictures for this web page.  However, I've since lost interest in either restoring, SBRing it (i.e., Vietnam war era Special Forces folding stock pistol), or investing in other alterations, which is why I'm selling this.  Since it has already been ""bubba'ed"", lowering its collectible value, it would also be a good candidate to modify into a more modern defensive carbine, with an Ultimak rail and red dot sight.

If ever there were a revolver of excellent, almost perfect ergonomics, it is the Smith and Wesson Model 19 Combat Magnum.  A revolver of medium weight that has
excellent handling, and fires a powerful cartridge with accuracy.  It is well balanced, feels very good in the hand, and offers more power per ounce than practically
any other handgun. 

Unlike some of the guns you see made today, this Excellent 1983 Vintage Revolver still has a nearly perfect original deep luster blue finish consistent with the high quality of firearms coming from Smith & Wesson at the time.  There is only the very lightest trace of a turn line on the cylinder.  The Hard Rubber combat grips and the Extra wide combat style hammer spur and trigger, (which are case color hardened), feel especially nice and inspire handling confidence.  The trigger is light and crisp, and the cylinder locks up tight...It is mechanically perfect.  Bore and cylinder are nice and shiny. All in all, this is an outstanding revolver...You definitely can not go wrong with beauty and quality like this."

This is a genuine Saiga IZ240 made in Russia by the same factory that makes the Russian military rifles. This particular rifle has been converted to an AK-74 from the original sporterized configuration. These rifles have been banned from import to the U.S.. The price of the base rifle (bare bones IZ240) has already jumped from $400 to $600. Gunsmiths charge hundreds of dollars to perform these conversions, not including parts. To build this rifle would be over $1200 (not including labor), asking only $950.

This rifle has never fired any corrosive ammo. Only commercial, non-corrosive ammo has been used. Round count is 865 since purchased new in 2011. 

Functions flawlessly. Overall this rifle is in very good condition, only a few minor cosmetic scratches. This is a working rifle, not a safe queen.

Six black magazines included: two Circle 10 (steel reinforced) and four Tapco Intrafuse

Ammo available, but not included: 1600 rounds of 5.45x39mm (mix of Silver Bear, Wolf WPA black box, and Wolf MC), all non-corrosive. Will sell rifle without ammo, will not sell ammo without rifle.

More photos available for serious inquiries.

All laws followed. If Illinois resident, we will need to do the FOID lookup on ISP's website. If you don't live in Illinois, must ship through FFL in your state. Prefer face-to-face transaction, but will ship. Buyer pays shipping. Must receive payment before I will ship to your FFL.

Only 2500 made from my understanding. It has the RTF grip which is absolutely amazing. Has the less glossy slide compared to the Gen 4’s which makes it much easier to grab ahold. It has less than 50 rounds down range. Still had full copper coating on the inside of the slide (seen in pictures). Comes with the following.

-Eight Glock 19 mags (15 rounds each, one with pearce grip holds 17rds) two have Vickers tactical FDE base plates for much easier ripping out if an emergency occurs.

-Vickers U notch rear and tritium steel front site

-Streamlight TLR-1S with original box

-Extended FDE mag release

-Extended take down lever

-Extended slide release.

-Glockmeister frame/grip plug

-Also has all original parts if you would like to switch things back.

THIS IS A PACKAGE DEAL ONLY. I WILL NOT SELL THE STREAMLIGHT SEPARATE SO PLEASE DO NOT ASK.

The only thing I may consider is keeping the Streamlight myself and selling everything else.

These Glock are very, very difficult to come by and they are no longer made or ever will make anymore. Gun broker has them going for $679.99+ tax stock with two mags

My price for everything is $900 or best over. That’s including the $130 Streetlight and 6 extra mags that are easily $35 a piece. You’re welcome to do the math.

Or $825 Or best offer without the Streamlight

This one happens to be a Glock. The frame of the pistol can be enhanced by adding a permanent texture to the frame which can limit slip when firing a handgun, especially if moisture or perspiration is present. Some also feel this enhances the look of the pistol while others feel it takes away from the stock look. At Kilo Company we deliver what the customer wants and are all about customization. With polymer pistols there's plenty to add to aesthetics and functionality. Note this pistol also has the trigger guard cut out to relieve pressure on the middle finger. Also note the second undercut for the supporting hand. Stippling can also be done with patterns and images. Stippling ranges in prices significantly depending on size, pattern, and complexity. Starting at $15 for magazines, $35 for handguns. Contact us for a quoteKilo Company offers stippling of polymer framed pistols, rifles, and magazines.  Much like every job is unique, so is the price.  Most handguns run no more than $60 for a full frame.  Finger grips can be removed/modified, trigger guards can be cut or dual undercut."

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

May have bent the shaft. Definitely bent the blade. I am not a mechanic and was again, no time to mess with it. Has key start and charger. Mulches and has the bagger. Make me an offer.
Basically cleaning out space in the garage on items I don't have time to mess with. Contact me via this site and I will email you back."

These magazines are possessed by millions of law-abiding Americans for a variety of legitimate purposes, including self-defense. This ordinance will not prevent violent crime. Instead, it will limit the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners who choose these magazines to defend themselves and their families. Now, 30 duly elected California Sheriffs, two law enforcement organizations, the California Rifle and Pistol Association (CRPA), and several other individuals have filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the ordinance. The lawsuit challenges the magazine possession ban on legal “preemption” grounds, because California state law specifically allows for the possession of such magazines. Under the conditions of the ordinance, the mere possession of any “large-capacity” magazine within Los Angeles after November 19, 2015 will be a misdemeanor offense. Los Angeles residents must get rid of their banned magazines by that date. The lawsuit asks the court to stay enforcement of the ordinance while the matter is litigated, so that law-abiding city residents can maintain possession of their lawfully acquired property pending a resolution of the case. But if the court refuses to stay enforcement of the ordinance, Los Angeles residents who possess any “large-capacity” magazine generally have the following four options available to them: Option #1: Surrender all such magazines to the Los Angeles Police Department- Although state law allows you to sell or transfer any “large-capacity” magazine to any California peace officer, the ordinance as written only allows you to transfer all such magazines to the LAPD. If you choose to surrender your magazines, you must do so by November 18th, 2015. DO NOT attempt to surrender your magazines to law enforcement within Los Angeles after November 18th, as you will be in violation of the ordinance and could face a potential misdemeanor charge. Option #2: Sell or transfer all such magazines to a properly licensed person- There are limited options available to civilians under state law when transferring or selling “large-capacity” magazines. One of the few is to sell your magazines to a properly licensed firearm dealer in the state of California. Option #3: Remove all such magazines from the City of Los Angeles- If you are able to do so, you must remove your magazines from the City of Los Angeles before the ordinance takes effect. But you must also be careful not to unlawfully transfer the magazines to another person. To avoid doing so, only you can have access to the stored magazine (e.g., only you have the key to the safe or storage area where the magazines are kept outside of the city). Once outside of the city, you can also sell or transfer your magazines to any California peace officer. Option #4: Permanently alter all such magazines- The ordinance does not consider magazines that have been permanently altered in a way that will only allow them to accept 10 or less rounds to be “large capacity magazines.” Unfortunately, it is not clear what constitutes a “permanent” alteration. If you are a Los Angeles resident and you fail to exercise one of these options for any of your “large-capacity” magazines before the ordinance takes effect on November 19, 2015, you should contact an attorney experienced in firearms law to discuss your situation. Significantly, the law doesn’t just apply to Los Angeles city residents. Non-resident gun owners must avoid traveling through any part of the city of Los Angeles while possessing any banned magazine. It is practically impossible to know all of the city’s exact boundaries, as illustrated by this map. The borders of Los Angeles intersect every major Southern California freeway. In some cases the city of Los Angeles completely surrounds other smaller cities, like Beverly Hills, and Santa Monica. So anyone traveling out of Santa Monica or Beverly Hills, and anyone traveling through the city of Los Angeles with a banned magazine can be prosecuted."

This rifle is in excellent condition. Comes with USGI rear sight and flash hider.  With their forged receivers and chrome-lined barrels, Polytech M14-S rifles are considered by many to be closer to USGI military spec than Springfield's M1A. Springfield's cast receivers are actually made at the Imbel factory in Brazil. This rifle has seen very little use, it is in top-notch condition.

The stock has a few dings, but I assume that it would be upgraded with a USGI stock anyway, as the original wood isn't that desirable. It comes complete with the chicom cotton sling, one 20 round magazine and one 30 round magazine. There are parts to a cleaning kit in the buttstock still in wrap. The weapon has been zeroed in at 25 yards with the iron sights. I'm listing this under Springfield because Polytech is not an option. These battle implements have not been imported in quite a few years and there won't be any more coming into the country.   Call and I'll send more pics

Selling to downsize my collection and I’m not all that interested in the rifle. $1195 OBO.  A serious gun for serious buyers. Prefer face to face with Ohio CCW. If no CCW, valid Ohio drivers license required. Must be 21+ years old. Will ship to your FFL at your cost."

From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.
