I can include ~65 rounds of quality ammo for it for the right trade.  The other gun is a swedish mauser sporterized by Kimber back before they got bought out and started doing 1911's.  Chambered in 6.5x55, comes with 10 rounds of Nosler white tip ammo and a Nikon prostaff 4-9x scope.  I'd say the bore on the mauser is a 8 out of 10, where 1 is nasty with rust and 10 is your match-grade tack driver.  The remington's bore is probably a 7.

I had this on a rifle for a few months and several range visits. The finish is in excellent shape with minimal wear. This is the 9-inch version, intended for use with mid-length gas systems (though it should fit on a carbine setup with low-profile gas block).

I really like this rail, it's extremely lightweight - 7.8oz WITH the barrel nut, according to Rainier's website. Pic rail on top, keymod at 3/6/9. Dual anti-rotation tabs at the top. It's also got molded-in quick-detach sling receivers in several places. Very rigid when shooting off a rest or standing offhand. I never mounted anything to it.

I am supplying this with a brand-new, never-installed barrel nut and hardware. This is possible because I bought a longer version of the same rail for my rifle and left the original barrel nut on the gun rather than swap it for the new one.

These list for $175 new. I'd like to get $100 OBO for the rail and the new barrel nut.

Glock 30s in 45 ACP.  Less than 200 rounds through it. The 30s is a Gen 3, SF.  I bought it from a LEO friend of mine, turns out he's not a 45 guy.  I'm a 45 guy, turns out I'm not a Glock guy....but at least I tried.  The original owner put a box of 50 through it.  I've put 120 rounds through it.  Never holstered, never carried.

- Talon grips, rubberized

- 2 ten round mags
- 1 thirteen round mag w/sleeve
- Original box & paperwork, loader, etc.

There isn't a blemish on this gun.  It's pretty much perfect.  A few more pictures can be provided but I can only post one it seems.

All NC laws adhered to and cash only (unless trade).  Cary during weekdays, Rougemont, Bahama, Butner area evenings/weekends.

Please don't ask me if I'd take 400.  I won't, I don't need to sell.  I'm already asking less than some here that believe a used $550 gun is worth $575.

Since I can't find the text box for trade considerations, I'll put it here.  Would consider trade for an XDs 4.0 45 in equal condition and magazines count in value (would probably require some cash but we'll see) or a SW 649 in 357 and in good condition.  If you've got a decent 30-06....that's a possible."

The plate carrier is fitted for 10"" x 12"" plates
Comes with 2 trauma pads. Which are used to
dampen the felt impact.
4 single mag pouches that lock up nice with
Velcro straps. They are molle compatible/removable
Also I have a admin pouch/flashlight compartment
that comes with the carrier.

The stitching on the plater carrier is well done I believe it is 800D nylon on both the stitching and the plater carrier.
It also has a quick release pull cord that rests at the bottom
Back of the carrier. You pull the cord and the vest will fall right off. Perfect for Tatical drills involving water, and SHTF.
The plate carrier and all its pouches A-TACS camo patterned.
Which also helps very well in my opinion from a designated marksman stand point.

The plates are made of AR500 steel and are said to withstand
Hits up to 7.62 Nato. But tests we have done on seprate plates show it can stand up to mild steel core 7.26x54r Soviet.
They are 10x12 plates painted green to protect the steel.
They are in perfect condition.

This is the very first generation Glock 17L 9mm Long Barrel. Rare gun.
Comes with the original box/ 3 magazines/ loader.
The long factory barrel makes this gun even rarer.
The longer barrel provides better accuracy, 
It also muffles the sound a bit so not as loud.
Asking price is $950, make me a reasonable offer.
This gun will only increase in value because the 
first generations are becoming increasingly harder
to find. The longer barrel on this one is practically 
non existent in the market place. I made the trip
out to Arizona to purchase this gun from a gun
collector enthusiast, He purchased the gun brand
new and only fired 400 rounds while target practicing.
Most accurate hand gun he has ever owned.
I personally have not put any rounds through it.
Email me your best reasonable offer.
Moving out of state and could use the
extra cash, otherwise I would keep it"

To start with, I am a Glock armorer and have babied this from day one. I started with replacing the factory sights. With this pistol, I opted for the XS Big Dot 24/7 sights. These have tritium in both the front and the rear sights. The are excellent. sights. 

In addition to the custom night sights I installed an extended slide stop to improve slide manipulation. I painted the Glock inlay on one side of the weapon that is removable if you prefer the all black look.

The internals have been polished and a 3.5 pound connecter was installed, resulting in a smoother trigger pull and smoother reset. 

I have one magazine that has the Vickers Tactical base plate installed. The other two magazines have factory bottoms. I can include a third factory base plate also. Included is 14 rounds of defense ammo and 26 FMJ. 

I am not looking for trades with the exception of very limited G19 or possibly 17 or 34. I am pretty particular in what I would consider. 

Also, you will get the case and all other factory items, such as reading material and backstraps, cleaning material, etc.

Sonny Crockett had one in season 3 of Miami Vice, now you can have one too.  They are getting harder to find in any kind of great condition.  This one is pristine condition and comes with all the original items Original S&W box (s/n does not match though but the box is correct and in excellent shape for the years), original wax paper the gun was wrapped in, Safety pamphlet, warranty card and statement, 645 owners manual, magazine dis-assembly, up opened S&W cleaning kit, and finally a warning label.  The standard weapon comes with 2 – 8 shot magazines, there are an additional 3 more making a total of 5 – 8 shot magazines all are S&W. 

This 645 is all stainless steel with wood grips and white outline adjustable rear sight plus red insert front sight.  There are no marks on the frame or slide at all it is the best one that I have seen in years.  This one has been shot but it looks new.  For those that want the total package here it is.

Gun is in great shape.  There's a slight discoloration on the barrel that I've tried to photograph.  It appears to be where the original owner placed his hand on the barrel, when the gun was broken down and the stock was over his shoulder.  Barrels are modified over improved.

The VZ2008 is an American made copy of the VZ58 in order to get around import laws and 922r. The receiver is American, and the barrel is American, but other than that it's Czech...heck this thing is basically the firearms version of Wilbur, NE!  
I do know that this gun is unlike any gun I have ever played with before. I assumed it would be a bit AK like with very loose tolerances, sloppy shooting and handling characteristics, etc. but boy was I wrong. In contrast to the AK, the VZ58 is better in the following ways.  
All vz. 58 rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK-47s are stamped. Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47. 
The bolt of the vz. 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. 
The vz. 58 can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle.
The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the vz. 58. 
The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the vz. 58. 
The vz. 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
The alloy magazine of the vz. 58 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. 
The vz. 58 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure.

This deal is the rifle and magazines pictured, six of them in all, and 500 rounds of brand new Tula 7.62x39 for $800 cash or trade combination."

Slightly used Ruger LC9. It was the wife carry gun. She now owns a Kimber micro and prefers the micro over the LC9. The LC9 is equipped with a Crimson Trace Laser and a Galloway trigger kit. The Galloway trigger kit includes, new: Precision trigger bar along with the reduced power hammer spring, reduced power blocker spring, reduced power lifter, reduced power firing pin return spring, along with the fully adjustable RTK Solution trigger.

No one likes the stock massive long trigger pull. This will create a 1.5 lb trigger pull that has a 50% shorter than stock trigger pull length and reset. That's 35% shorter due to our trigger bar and an extra 15% reduction from the trigger, equaling a 50% shorter pull length. The break is still at the rear of travel but reset and rest are at the half way point of stock pull.

This gun is not picky with ammo selection. It has shot everything I put through with zero problems. It continues to fire. 

Also included is:
-14 rounds of Winchester Hollows 
-50 rounds  Blazers Brass FMJ  
-2 Ruger blue mags 
-IWB Old Faithful Holster
-OWB Side Guard Holster (waited 3 months for this holster)
-Flashbang holster
-OEM holster (does not fit with CT)
-OEM soft gun case
-OEM manuals, box and lock

Here are some specs and a review from http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2012/11/chris-dumm/gun-review-taurus-pt-92-af/
SPECIFICATIONS:
Type: Short-recoil locked-breech semi-automatic pistol
Caliber: 9×19mm (also available in .40 S&W as the PT-100)
Action: Hammer-fired DA/SA with manual safety/de-cocker
Barrel Length: 5″
Magazine Capacity: 17+1 with factory magazines
Sights: 3-dot configuration with integral front and dovetail rear
Length: 8.5″
Width: 1.5″
Weight: 34 oz. empty.
Street Price: $450

RATINGS (out of five stars):

Accuracy * * * *
 Three-inch groups at 25 yards are definitely better than average, and better than most of us can shoot offhand anyway.

Styling * * * *
 The elegant and iconic looks of the Model 92F/M9 are even better with a frame-mounted safety.
Ergonomics * * * (carry) * * * * * (shooting)
 Too zaftig for CCW, but its comfortable controls, excellent trigger and minimal recoil make it an absolute joy to shoot. Definitely try one out before purchasing, if you’ve got small hands.

Reliability * * * * 1/2
100% feeding, ejection and firing (with brass-cased ammo) through more than 450 rounds fired. It doesn’t like steel-cased ammo, but we don’t care. Deduct half a star for the failure to slide-lock.

Overall * * * *
 A damned fine pistol and a great value. After comparing and shooting the Taurus and Beretta side-by-side, I would choose the Taurus first."

I got home and one case had a bullet pushed into the case as shown in the photo. This is called telescoping, and is very dangerous if this happens inside an AR-15. Google for photo of .223 telescoping if you don't believe me. So anyway I didn't think anything of it. Thought I'd run them in my AR-15 on the third she'll one jamed and was found telescope in the chamber. I feel I about blew up my AR-15. So I'd like to sell this box of ammo to someone who will shoot these in a bolt action. I'd not recommend them to be shot from an AR-15. Box contains 16 factory loaded shells.
