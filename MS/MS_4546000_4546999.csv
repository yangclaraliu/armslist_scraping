It comes with 4 17 rd mags, box and all papers and like accompaniments. 

Altogether, its about $1500 worth of gun.

The weapon has been carried but shot seldom (I train more with my 17) and cleaned with frog lube. The slide / frame has approximately 600 rounds through the weapon. The story behind this weapon is a great testament to the quality of the company producing the pistol. I was hunting pigs in south georgia a few years ago and had a Gen 3 G19 on my hip, over the course of four days in S. GA heat the glock rusted.....yeah....rusted. I was living in smyrna GA at the time and brought the weapon into the plant for an inspection. The staff at glock took my G3 G19 and apologized and apologized. To make things right they gave me a brand new G4 G19 fresh off the target testing bench 3 new mags and let me keep the original mags all within 20 minutes while there on my lunch break. Glock stands behind their products and I recommend this company to all people currently interested in a perfectly designed pistol.

It's not like your traditional DAO firearms.  Recoil spring is excellent and has a strong resistance to tame the recoil of the .40 S&W.  Plenty of life left in this P229R. Asking $650 or best offer.

Everyone always talks about how much a tack driver their gun is, so I will save you the talk. I will say that this rifle set up has far more potential than most shooters abilities will ever realize. The lower is a BMG Raptor gen 2 billet made to the most exacting tolerances, they incorporate a lot of ergonomic upgrades in these lowers but the real advantage to having it is the tight tolerances for setting the trigger group and lock up to the upper receiver. There is no play or slop in this system. The trigger is a JP competition trigger single stage set at around 3 pounds with no creep. Upper is a Rock River Arms Predator Pursuit 16 inch stainless barrel with a 1 in 8 twist Wilde chamber, and mid length gas system. Free floated hand guard is ceracoated in Magpul FDE. Front sight is a YHM HK type integrated gas block sight with Picatinny rail section at bottom. The bolt carrier group is a Rainier Arms, and the charge handle is the Bravo Company long handle for ease of charging with a scope on. Rear sight is a Magpul gen 2 in FDE. Grip is an Ergo Tactical Deluxe Sure Grip in FDE. Stock is a Magpul CTR with friction lock and a single point sling HK type rear plate. The Bipod is a Harris swivel type with notched legs. Scope is a Leupold Mark 4 M1 Reticle 8.5-25X50; http://www.leupold.com/tactical/scopes/mark-4-lrt-riflescopes/mark-4-lrt-8-5-25x50mm-30mm-m1/ It is mounted on a Burris P.E.P.E.R. mount, torqued properly per Leopold's instructions. Also included on the scope is a scope level, extended sun shade, and Butler Creek flip covers. It all fits in the padded case pictured which has a muzzle protector built into the end, durable nylon construction with carry handle and strap, 3 Velcro mag pouches and a forward zippered accessory compartment. I have the 5 round mag that is in it as well as 3 Magpul 30 rounders couple in FDE and one in black. This gun is built ground up with the best stuff and is amazingly accurate, compact, and fast.

As you can see from the pics, she is in beautiful condition!As you can see, the muzzle is threaded. They were threaded for a blank firing adapter. The Swedes had blanks that had a wooden bullet. The adapter shredded the wooden bullet. Initially they just told the troops not to aim directly at each other when they were up close, but as a fellow vet you can guess how well that worked.The Gevär m/96-38 proved so successful that when new rifles were ordered for the military in 1941, the contract issued to Husqvarna specified that the new rifle be built to the same pattern.

The Phantom was designed from the outset to provide the highest possible level of concealment by being adaptable to wear with virtually any style of clothing. What makes the Phantom so unique is its ultra-thin, body-hugging pancake profile. This profile, in conjunction with the Eclipse Modular Mounting System, allows the Phantom to be worn either on the belt or inside the waistband.

This holster is coyote tan in color, a 10 degree forward cant and the full slide height sweat/ shirt guard. It also has IWB belt loops and kydex OWB loops included. I bought this holster a few months ago, carried it for about two weeks (very comfortable) then traded my Glock 19 for another pistol. Although this is an outstanding and well built holster that comes with a great reputation, I no longer need it. I paid about $110 but only asking $60 or best offer."

Make me an offer.

It is with much chagrin that I am parting ways with my beloved 91. The Maverick is Mossberg's 'value' line of firearms, made from the exact same components as their popular 500 & 835 counterparts, but with subtle differences like a cross-bolt safety instead of tang safety, as a way to keep costs down. The model 91 is based on the 835, which means it has the ability to fire 3-1/2"" magnum shells. 

This particular 91 has an Accu-Mag barrel that measures 28 inches from tip to receiver and comes with 2 chokes, which are Full and I think I/C.

It also comes with a 20"" barrel from a 590A1 that has been machined to accept Remington choke tubes, and has a Remington Tactical Choke. I bought this barrel primarily for slug hunting whitetail deer, but it also works quite well as a home defense setup.

I have a random assortment of 12ga ammo that I'll throw in because I don't have any other shotguns. There are some slugs, some buckshot, some birdshot. No I'm not going to tally it up or post a quantity, as far as I'm concerned these are bonus material not included in the price.

In case you're wondering why I'm selling this setup: I don't bird hunt anymore. Got rid of all my decoys a couple years ago. I just picked up the slug barrel earlier this year, but I've decided to instead use a pistol for deer hunting. The funds from this sale will be going towards procuring a 357 or 44 revolver that purpose.

I do believe the price to be extremely fair. Gunsamerica.com recently sold a 91 for $275. The 590 barrel was $200, the Rem choke was $40, and the I/C choke was $25. That's a total value of $540, not counting tax."

Location: Allentown, PA 18109
Price: $350 OBO
Description: Up for sale is a Taurus PT 709 Slim in two tone, green with stainless slide. I have owned this gun for a little over a year, and it is a great shooter. Only selling because it is to small for my hands and I need to fund a WW2 M1 Carbine purchase. I have put under 200 rounds through it without it ever failing or jamming. It comes with everything you see in the pictures: the pistol, 2 magazines, a Alien Gear 2.0 inside the waistband holster, and a Galco leather inside the waistband holster. Will also throw in a box of 50 FMJ rounds. Asking $350 OBO due to the second magazine, factory made, and the few extras I have for it. If the price is to high for you, please don't complain. I know there are cheaper ones on gunbroker; however, most of the $200 ones only have one mag and no extras. Buyer pays transfer at your location of choice, might be willing to mail, as long as it is not to far from me."

Accessories include: Nikon M-223 scope mount for flat top style AR rifle; Bushwacker 44mm eyepiece flip cover; and Butler Creek 50mm front objective flip cover. I was going to use this for a build but then had a change of plans, so now it just sits in the cabinet. I have not shot this scope and so it is in new condition. All told I have $269 invested, will sell for $180 CASH ONLY. And no, I will not break up the set.

All offers from burner phones with offers of checks payment will be treated as scams; so please do not waste my time. Long distance calls will be called back immediately, no answer = a scam and will be handled accordingly.

Thank you for looking."

This is not only an awesome hunting rifle but also a fun target shooter. VERY ACCURATE. I'LL SAY 1MOA. LOTS OF GUNSMITH WORK.  It has an ATI stock (makes it lighter), Welded scope mount (makes it hold zero and secure and protect the scope against reckless recoil movements that damage scopes).  Tri-rail score mount for accessories attachment. It simply like good and sounds good too.  And the barrel is in very good shape.  Rifling can be seen clearly with no effort. If you're into cheap military surplus ammo you're going to be happy with this one for sure. I'm selling because I just finished customizing another one for my own use.  
Fyi: Scope mount included but no scope.

This single action only 1911 type pistol has a double stack 10-round magazine, in the original Para Ordnance hard case, with paperwork, 

This is an off-list pistol in California, our law here says NO shipping on this one.

Para came up with the first original double-stack 1911 45 ACP pistols, of which this is an excellent example.

I bought this new and NEVER FIRED this safe queen, yes mint, pristine, sparkling, virginal, unspoiled, new ... 

it's been in my safe for years.

For local face-to-face sale only in the Redondo beach and adjacent South Bay L.A. 
areas (Hawthorne, Manhattan Beach, Torrance ...)  

  Bright chrome/stainless frame and slide, 4 1/4"" barrel, in the original hard case, just as it came, with ONE cali compliant 10 round mag.  Yes, Para only included ONE Cali Compliant 10 rd mag with this gun, along with a coupon to buy optional 13 rd hi-caps, which I did. 

  If you are LEO or have an out-of-state residence that I can legally ship hi-caps to to I'll sell the two 13-round hi cap mags for $60 extra.

I find it very comfortable to handle, but a double-stack mag .45 is not for someone with small hands.

Here's the best of all possible world: compact conceal ability, a 4 1/4"" barrel, plus the stopping power of 10 +1 rounds of .45 ACP (13+1 for $60 extra if you are LEO or have an out-of-state residence that I can legally ship hi-caps to). For accuracy, reliability and overall quality, plus standard features that others offer only as custom extras, the P13-45 is a commanding presence in the field of 1911A1-type defensive handguns. 

    The original Canadian Para Ordnance company is gone, and its US successor, Para USA, has been killed off by Remington, but you can own this beautiful piece and be the first to fire it.  Original Para Ord black & white hard case, with ONE California compliant magazine.

The gun cost me $350 plus I have over $100 in the Galloway Precision parts and mags were $40 each so in total I have little over $550 in it but will let go for $450 or trade value of at least that amount.  Thanks for looking."

BARRETT MODEL 82A1

 The Barrett 82A1 stands at the pinnacle of firearm design, and has been proven in long-range accuracy, ruggedness, and dependability in any environment (military or civilian). The low recoil and self-loading action of the 82A1 created it’s own hallmark! If you are anything like me, the more that you research the engineering that goes into the Barrett Model 82A1, the more you will be inspired by the close tolerances and meticulous engineering that has gone into every single part of this gun. It is unparalleled.

 I was so overwhelmed by Barrett’s development of the Model 82A1, that I got this rifle to hold onto. I am the sole owner, and this rifle has remained new and unfired, to this day. It has been well maintained and stored in climate-controlled conditions with thorough cleaning and lubrication regularly. I NEVER intended to sell this beautiful gun, but must now due to financial necessity.

 If you are unfamiliar with the Barrett Model 82A1, please watch some of the You Tube demonstrative videos of this rifle. There simply are NO Comparables.

 The Swarovski Optik high-performance scope is made in Western Austria by Swarovski; a family business that was established in 1895 after Daniel Swarovski invented the first electric grinding machine for jewelry stores. In 1935, Wilhelm Swarovski pursued his passion for astronomy and built far better optics for telescopes than the world had ever seen. This gave rise to Swarovski Optik, a company that still stands firmly behind their products. I believe this to be the best scope, atop the best rifle.

 The Pelican 1750 case for the Barrett Model 82A1 is built like a tank, and is specially designed for the 82A1. It is watertight, crushproof, and dustproof, and comes with a Lifetime Guarantee of Excellence. It measures 53” Length X 16” Width X 6.12” Depth, and is made of polypropylene with stainless steel bearings. It comes with a side handle, end handle, and roller wheels.

 I cannot bring myself to piece out the gun, so I am selling it with all of the accessories. EVERYTHING IS IN NEW CONDITION. This includes everything detailed in the attached photos, including:"

The Saiga-12 is a 12-gauge combat shotgun available in a wide range of configurations, visually patterned after the Kalashnikov series of assault rifles. Like the Kalashnikov rifle variants, it is a rotating bolt, gas-operated gun that feeds from a box magazine. All Saiga-12 configurations are recognizable as Kalashnikov-pattern guns by the large lever-safety on the right side of the receiver, the optic mounting rail on the left side of the receiver and the large top-mounted dust cover held in place by the rear of the recoil spring assembly.

 This 4x32 BAC ACOG scope provides a dual-illuminated reticle using fiber optics and tritium for a bright aiming point in any light condition. The ranging reticle is calibrated for M193 ammunition (5.56, 55gr FMJ, common military surplus) fired from a 16"" barrel.

The chevron reticle is designed to be zeroed using the tip at 100 meters and the BDC goes out to 800 meters. The width of the chevron at the base is 5.5 MOA which represents 19” at 300 meters. This allows range estimation for silhouette targets.

Former Marine (2111) I took care of this Rifle, I have my eyes set on a New Rifle that is why I want to sell it.

Heavy Barrel From Barrett: 
Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 optics rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match-toleranced barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a rock-solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The chamber area is encased by the thick-walled aluminum extrusion of the receiver, resulting in unparalleled safety for the shooter.

The bolt is machined from a single piece of shock-resistant tool steel. The action’s strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt’s few moving parts, an extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly, make it reliable and easy to maintain.

The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is exclusive to Barrett and virtually maintenance-free. The bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting. 

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 combines smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot."
