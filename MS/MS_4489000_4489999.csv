26,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4489026,For Sale:  How to tell if that armslist ad is a scam.,"seattle, Washington, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Monday, July 6, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am constantly coming across armslist ads that are complete bullshit. There are several ways to tell if an ad is a scam

A. Do a reverse image search of the pictures posted.
You can do this by right clicking the image and clicking ""search google for this image"". If there are other copies of this image on the web, chances are this is a scam.

B. Search the text posted in the ad. If it was a copy/paste and the text appears in another ad, this is a scam. I found one that still had the ""first one to post I'll take it, wins."" from the AK-Files. Often times old versions of the same ad pop up posted in different cities. Obviously a scam.

C. Contact the seller from a separate email and do an email trace. In gmail this is done by clicking the drop down arrow onthe right side of the email box and clicking ""show original"". Copy the header by following the directions on this website:

http://whatismyipaddress.com/trace-email

If there is no IP address, it is a scam. If there is, copy it and paste it into this website:

http://www.ip-tracker.org/

If the IP shows a different location than the one posted in the ad, it's a scam.

D. Ask for additional pictures of specific parts of the gun. If they are unable to provide those, it's a scam.

E. If they pass all of the above tests, DO NOT send any money yet. Arrange to have them go to their FFL before payment is made. Go to your respective FFL and have them contact each other. If their FFL can verify the weapon is there in the condition posted, you are good. If not, it's a scam.

Stay safe out there, and don't give your money to asshole con-artists! I dream of a day a Dexter like individual dedicates his life to tracking down armslist scammers and makes them disappear."

The SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace is a shooter's aid that is designed to  improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped  pistols.  This veteran-designed  and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil. Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits any equipment with  a buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.

The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator's forearm to provide stable  support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any  user.

I have two guns I'd like to trade to an AK or maybe an AR, rifle or pistol variants. Factory built guns only please and no poly receivers or slick sides. So heres what I have to offer.

1) Ruger stainless MKII target/competition with rare slab side barrel. It's a tack driver and hard to find. Comes with millet red dot and three ruger mags. These are averaging $650 with no extras, I'm asking $700 with the extras. I do have ammo available for an additional charge. Just what I payed for it no mark up. These pistols are no longer in production and very sought after by serious shooters. 

2) H&R SB2 ultra 308. Good shooting little rifle with medium contour barrel, and color case hardened receiver. Has 3-9x50mm scope, prefer to keep the bipod in pic but it's negotiable and ammo available again for what I payed for it. These 308 rifles are kinda hard to find too. Average price I have found them for is $300-$350, I'm asking $300 for mine. The barrel alone is selling on ebay for $350. Would make a great truck gun or varmint/deer rifle for a new hunter.

I would prefer to trade these as a package deal  valued at $1000, but may separate if i get an offer I really like. Willing to travel up to an hour for a good deal."

Paying cash for a natural/matte stainless Sig Sauer P226 9mm. Sorry to be redundant, but to absolutely specific I am definitely looking for the [wonderfully heavy] all SS framed model. I would actually like the standard version but willing to consider the 'Elite' if I can make your asking price work with my budget.  

I am not out to low-ball anyone. I want a solid and well-function sidearm and will pay fair market value depending on condition and what all is included in the sale.

I am a legal and responsible owner and require that both parties sign a bill fo sale and exchange copies of government issued photo ID.

If you have a stainless P226 that you'd like to sell please respond by email, send the serial # so that I can run a quick check to make sure that it has a clean history, and give me your preferred contact info.

My office is in downtown Austin and I live in the NW (near Cedar Park), but my work schedule is flexible and I can meet pretty much anywhere in the city (with a little notice). 

I will not waste your time. If you have what I'm looking for we can agree on a price and suitable place to meet at your earliest convenience.

Thanks for your time.

Also, I placed another WTB ad for a Smith & Wesson 5906 (also all stainless framed) so if you have one of those, or if you have both, then please get in touch. I'm hoping to find one of each (for my wife and I)."

Up for grabs is one of my many incomplete projects. I picked this thing up with the intention of building a bada$$ Mosin Nagant and filling it with aftermarket modifications and turning it in to a real tac driver. As it turns out, living at college is expensive, and sort of limits the amount of projects I can do. As such, I decided this one is gonna have to go and find someone whos got the time and money to build a rifle. 
This is a 1943 Izhevsk Mosin. The reciever itself is just what you'd expect, a nice solid, dependable chunk of steel. The Bore is in great shape, 8/10. No rust, very little pitting, and good strong rifling. 
Included with the reciever is a picatinny rail adapter, as pictured.

I also have lots of extra magazines that I will sell with it for a very reasonable price. Those are Taran Tactical extensions on those magazines. Extensions alone are worth $41 each brand new, plus the $35 for the magazine. $1100+ total value when brand new. I will trade all for a new or like-new Glock 21; will trade gun, 3 compact mags, and holsters for a Glock 43; I will sell everything for $625; or just the gun with holsters and 3 compact mags for $375. If you just want the 8 magazines, let me know and we'll work something out. The extended ones are 23-rounders. Everything works flawlessly. Don't be afraid to send any other offers.

Up for sale I have some type of 520 shotgun thats quite old. The barrel is extremely long, but great to shoot clays. The gun still shoots, but not without its quirks.

I have some replacement springs for the bolt, replaced the extractor and firing pin. The current extractor screw is too long and will cause the slide to catch, that will need to be worked on.

This gun has the awesome feature of being able to slam fire. Would make for a great budget retro trench shotgun. It also is a takedown and splits in half. The safety is in the trigger guard called a suicide safety which indicates the shotgun is very old, probably 1910's-1930's.

This was a weird project that seems excessive but really isn't and turned out great.
This is a Remington 760-7600 in 30-06, pump action 
The action, barrel and operating system was completely disassembled, deburred, bead blasted and refinished in Cerakote FDE.
The pump action has a custom machined sleeve mounted on, can't remember company, so that any 870 foreend will work on it (7600 is smaller diameter)
The gun has a Mesa Tactical stock adapter with a MAGPUL MIAD GRIP, ENDINE HYDRAULIC BUFFER STOCK EXTENSION, with a Magpul MOE stock 
The foreend is also Magpul for an 870, with rail mount and Ergo handstop
Sights are standard Remington rifle sights with new front blade. Sighted in at 50-125 with 150 gr rounds
Also has a weaver base for scope or optics. 
Has factory 5 round mag and 2-10 round mags
With the hydraulic buffer THERE IS NO RECOIL,,, surprising for a 30-06, you can dump through rounds as fast as you're able too! 
This gun is awesome,,, IT IS EXCESSIVE , but an awesome platform, still capable of hunting,,, or as a tactical weapon. 
If you're familiar with an 870, this gun is second nature in regards to controls and action

The Colt 1911 model holds a unique place in the history of combat arms as the sidearm of choice of such great leaders as Eisenhower and MacArthur.  Just as our crest, laser engraved in the exotic tulipwood grips, reflects the trials and tribulation of our four years at the academy, so too does our class pistol.  As our experience at the academy will remain forever etched in our hearts and minds so is the distinct engraving forever etched in the slide.  The stainless steel slide is strong and durable as are the ties that bind us.  It is the proper mix between functionality and grace that so distinguishes our class as leaders within the Corps and as future Army officers."

Sierra #: 1355 
$15 each box of 100.

20 boxes available

For rifles, this 55 grain #1355 Full Metal Jacket Boat Tail bullet was designed specifically to duplicate the military M193 bullet, and it is intended for use in semi-automatic rifles, such as the AR-15, M16 and Ruger Mini 14. It features an exceptionally heavy full metal jacket with a cannelure properly located for crimping and positive feeding. This is an excellent bullet for hunting varmints and small game where pelts are to be preserved. It should be loaded to medium velocities for this purpose.


In handguns of 22 caliber, this is a non-expanding bullet that will minimize damage to pelts as well as meat in small game. It is best used at medium handgun velocities to prevent tumbling upon impact. It is an ideal choice for the trapper or pelt hunter with a handgun in a 22 centerfire caliber.

The #1355 was introduced in 1985."

$15 each box of 100.

20 boxes available

For rifles, this 55 grain #1355 Full Metal Jacket Boat Tail bullet was designed specifically to duplicate the military M193 bullet, and it is intended for use in semi-automatic rifles, such as the AR-15, M16 and Ruger Mini 14. It features an exceptionally heavy full metal jacket with a cannelure properly located for crimping and positive feeding. This is an excellent bullet for hunting varmints and small game where pelts are to be preserved. It should be loaded to medium velocities for this purpose.


In handguns of 22 caliber, this is a non-expanding bullet that will minimize damage to pelts as well as meat in small game. It is best used at medium handgun velocities to prevent tumbling upon impact. It is an ideal choice for the trapper or pelt hunter with a handgun in a 22 centerfire caliber.

The #1355 was introduced in 1985."

Sierra #: 1355
$15 each box of 100.

20 boxes available

For rifles, this 55 grain #1355 Full Metal Jacket Boat Tail bullet was designed specifically to duplicate the military M193 bullet, and it is intended for use in semi-automatic rifles, such as the AR-15, M16 and Ruger Mini 14. It features an exceptionally heavy full metal jacket with a cannelure properly located for crimping and positive feeding. This is an excellent bullet for hunting varmints and small game where pelts are to be preserved. It should be loaded to medium velocities for this purpose.


In handguns of 22 caliber, this is a non-expanding bullet that will minimize damage to pelts as well as meat in small game. It is best used at medium handgun velocities to prevent tumbling upon impact. It is an ideal choice for the trapper or pelt hunter with a handgun in a 22 centerfire caliber.

The #1355 was introduced in 1985."

Product Description
Product Description
The MONARCH 3 is now the single largest riflescope line in the Nikon family. With eight different magnifications and five different reticles available, there is a MONARCH 3 for every purpose. Nikon has placed smooth zoom control with magnification reference numbers viewable from the shooter's position and included a quick-focus eyepiece. Nikon's Ultra ClearCoat optical system is common in all MONARCH 3 riflescopes. It is engineered to provide the theoretical maximum light transmission a scope can deliver – up to 95% – for a clear and incredibly sharp sight picture between dawn and dusk. With spring-loaded instant zero-reset turrets, every MONARCH 3 offers an in-field advantage by allowing shooters to easily make adjustments on the fly. In addition to the enhanced ring spacing, the new MONARCH 3 is waterproof, fog proof and shockproof.
