$200 for scope, $50 for rings!


I have a Weaver Tactical Grand Slam 3-10x40mm with MIL (mildot) reticle and .10 Mil tactical/target turrets.  New in box.  It comes with a set of 1"" Burris XTR low picatinny rings.  

This is a great scope for someone wanting to get into a MIL/MIL scope without breaking the bank.  It's one of the only you'll find with variable power from a reputable brand in this price range.  It has very bright glass.  I bought it with the intention of having a slightly smaller alternative to my 30mm target scope, but just never ended up using it. 

These are serious rings you can absolutely count on.  6-screw design and a simple but effective locking nut to attach to your base that makes them easy to attach/remove and return to zero.  I've used these on two other rifles and they've always held solid.  They are about $70 bucks new.  They are aluminum so despite their beefy design they won't add a lot of heft to your rifle.

This is a great setup for someone that wants to cross between long range target, dialing in your dope, to a hunting rifle that is still practical to carry up and down the mountains and make a close shot or one all the way across the valley.  

New in box, it has only been mocked up on the rifle but never shot.  I have a rear Butler Creek flip cap to throw in but can't find the front."

This is DA/SA with ambidextrous decocker  My price includes 2 18-round magazines and all of the normal factory items, e.g. lock, brush, paperwork.  I have one other brand new, OEM (third) 18-round magazine that I will sell for an additional $45 if you like.  I paid $47 + shipping from CZ Custom and can still return the magazine it, so I won’t sell that any cheaper.

I paid $625 plus tax for the pistol, so now is your chance to get a brand new, highly sought after pistol for about $75-$100 cheaper than purchasing new from a local gun shop if you can even find one.  The ONLY reason I am selling it is because I have decided to add a revolver to my collection and go with my CZ PCR and Kadet Adapter for now.  It’s a hard choice as this is consistently rated among he top 9mm pistol in the world, but for now practicality wins out. 

I will require an affirmation that you are eligible to purchase a firearm and are a WI resident. This affirmation will include that you have not been convicted of a felony, crime of domestic violence, not under a restraining order or never been mentally committed. I will also need to inspect your full WI DL at the time of purchase to verify residency, age and identity.  If you have a WI CCP that would be even better as I would like to snap a picture for records.  I WILL NOT take any reproduction of your WI DL…I wouldn’t want mine floating out there, so I don’t expect anyone else to either.  Cash only for local sales, preferably with the new $100 bills.

I frequently travel between Eau Claire and Madison and Eau Claire and Minneapolis (I’m a military reservist) and can meet anywhere in Wisconsin between these points if it's convenient to my travel schedule. 

I will hold it a few weeks to match up travel with a $60 deposit.  If you change your mind, I’ll keep the deposit, but I’ll still send you the spare magazine so you won’t be out too much. I expect this to sell quickly, but if it doesn’t I will need to return the spare mag within a couple weeks.  My price is fairly firm, but I will consider including a box of target ammunition to sweeten the deal if necessary."

1942 TIKKA M91 Mosin Nagant Rifle.

Built on a 1899 Sestroryetsk Receiver, assembled in 1942 in Finland. I bought the rifle, took it apart correctly and inspected it, cleaned it, completely oiled every surface, put it back together correctly and it's sat in the safe without being fired. Nice shiny bore. Bolt matches the barrel, mag plate and buttplate are different, which is common for these rifles. Upper handguard was missing when I got the rifle, some of them didn't get replacements even in the military armories.
Leather Sling is NOT included, I had to use it on another rifle. More pics are available, can only put one up here.

Here is some info copied straight from FNH website along with a link for more specifications further down.

The FN SCAR® is the semi-auto only version of the newest service rifle of U.S. special operators. Light, fast-handling and quick shooting, the FN SCAR® 16S is chambered in 5.56x45 mm and features a free-floating, cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel with chrome-lined bore. Fully-ambidextrous operating controls on both models instantly adapt to any shooter and any shooting position. The receiver-integrated MIL-STD 1913 optical rail and three accessory rails enable the mounting of scopes or electronic sights, plus tactical lights and lasers. The telescoping, side-folding polymer stock is fully adjustable for comb height and length of pull

Here is some info copied straight from FNH website along with a link for more specifications further down.

The FN SCAR® is the semi-auto only version of the newest service rifle of U.S. special operators. Light, fast-handling and quick shooting, the FN SCAR® 16S is chambered in 5.56x45 mm and features a free-floating, cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel with chrome-lined bore. Fully-ambidextrous operating controls on both models instantly adapt to any shooter and any shooting position. The receiver-integrated MIL-STD 1913 optical rail and three accessory rails enable the mounting of scopes or electronic sights, plus tactical lights and lasers. The telescoping, side-folding polymer stock is fully adjustable for comb height and length of pull

NO TRADES unless they are well in my favor (QUALITY firearms and cash) but obviously cash is PREFERRED I have the original grip, manuals, and Plano all weather tactical case its been stored in.

Neither affect function, I've shot it and my brother used it for deer hunting before he got his ishapore.  I'm not an expert and Don't know how to grade a bore, but I would say frosted.

A really nice 1894 winchester rifle in 38-55. The bore is very nice
a 7+ of 10. Good rifling, grooves, and well taken care of.
The forearm wood is very nice, no cracks, swelling or darkening.
The rear butt stock is very healthy with some signs of oiling in the wood.On the rear
by the lower tang, some light imperfections in the wood are seen. Most likely
over oiling of the rifle.
The action is tight nearly perfect, and all mechanics are excellent. This rifle
is ready to hunt once again. The 38-55 is a good sub 200 yard deer rifle cartridge.
The butt stock plate is missing a screw on the top.
The safety works, and will not push or pull off.

The Winchester Model 1894 rifle (also known as the Winchester 94 or Win 94) is a lever-action repeating rifle
that became one of the most famous and popular hunting rifles. It was designed by John Browning in 1894
and originally chambered to fire two metallic black powder cartridges, the .32-40 Winchester and .38-55 Winchester.
It was the first rifle to chamber the smokeless powder round, the .30 WCF (Winchester Center Fire, in time becoming known as the .30-30).


The .38-55 Winchester cartridge (actually .3775 caliber) was introduced in 1876 by Ballard. 
It was used by Marlin Firearms from 1875 on for various single-shot target rifles and their 1893 lever action rifle. 
It was later offered by Winchester in its Model 1894. Winchester continued to use the round in various rifles until about 1940, 
and also used it in a few commemorative editions of rifles since then. In addition, Marlin offered it in some 336s and it was used
 in non-lever action rifles such as the Remington-Lee bolt-action and Colt's New Lightning pump-action rifles.
The .38-55 is renowned for its exceptional accuracy at ranges up to 330 yd  (300 m). It is often used to hunt black bear 
and deer at moderate ranges, and is also used in Cowboy Action Shooting side matches.

I've put about 200 rounds through it and have never had a jam that people complain about(I'm very meticulous about cleaning it too) As close to new as you will get. Have all boxes and paper work.

*The IZ109 Saiga 12
*5 round magazine
*10 round promag
*Around 100 rounds of birdshot(cant remember if I used any)
*5 rounds of buckshot
Get it all for $850 and pay the $25 transfer fee. A guy was going to get it, but it didn't go through. So you can get all of that new for $1002.50-$1027.50 and this ones as good as new and you wont have to wait weeks to receive it(and also have to pay taxes which would be $70+). Used a little but 200 rounds is nothing and it was extremely cleaned after.
 Pop one of these buttstocks for $50 on ebay and these thing will look even more nasty. This is the stock that half of the people pop on and then ask $1500 for the gun for

Two kids make range time difficult, and it's too big for most of the game I'm hunting down here. Sitting at about 2k into the weapon, but need to down size...

Serious offers please... Hunting season is just around the corner and I'd hate to have her miss a hunting season sitting around."

The buckles used throughout the pack are National Molding, and are all easily replaced if broken. The straps and PALS webbing are heavy nylon that were cut with a hot knife then sewn over for the former, or sewn into the pack on the latter.  The zippers are all YKK brand.

The pack itself has two exterior Nalgene bottle pockets (fits the 32 oz. perfectly), exterior PALS for attaching whatever type of MOLLE pouch you choose.

To enter the pack, you have a coroner zip opening which gives you access to the interior. Inside you’ll find more PALS attachment options for radio sleeves, first aid pouches, etc. There are also four long-pockets with velcro closure and four smaller-sized mesh pockets with zipper closure. The top flap is identical to that found on the 3-Day Assault Pack, with a 4×6 velcro panel for patches, IR flags or ID’s.

There’s also a zip-opening admin area, a zip-opening large mesh area, and a two-way zip opening for tube routing or access to your radio inside. 

The Skiritai is a discontinued model however still backed by Mystery Ranch and still popular by those who have used them.
