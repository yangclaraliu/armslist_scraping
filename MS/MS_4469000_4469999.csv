Got a vintage Browning Nomad for him instead. A great starter gun to learn on, especially as the design is an exact 1911 with the only real difference being no grip safety (and it is 22 of course). All steel with the heft of a centerfire pistol, this is a great training aid as well as the grip geometry and weight is right there with many 1911 models. Though it used to be where 22 was a very inexpensive practice and target caliber, it is still less than .45 by far. Quiter with less recoil for younger or newer shooters, or anyone who likes a plinker with the feel of the 1911. Half the cost of most centerfire pistols, this ""as-new"" in-the-box pistol is priced 35% to 45% LESS than new ones and even less than a used one listed that has no box and one mag. You get the SAME exact pistol in the case as a new one, that has been test fired and has NO ISSUES at all. Single action trigger is quite crisp with no real creep at all. Sights are drift-adjustable and complete instructions in the manual detail every aspect of using this pistol. DO NOT DRYFIRE is in the manual as well as on the label. Has a locking system like Taurus that lets you LOCK the pistol so NOBODY can fire it, rendering it safe for storage, a great feature for the kids, even the ones learning to shoot with this for complete safety. Zero wear or anything that is not NEW. Ships to FFL for $30 if it can go Priority and will have adult signature and insurance. Paypal okay if discrete (I will invoice) and add $3 for Paypal (I am splitting the fees with you) Local sales with valid ID and CWP (ensures non-felon status and if no permit, there are other options)"

Not anymore! I went to town on the whole thing with gun cleaner, Flitz and various other good stuffs. I replaced the spring and follower and cleaned the living hell out of the mag tube and treated it. Broke it completely down and polished everything internal. I also rehydrated the stocks with mineral oil and they are actually pretty damn good looking. Replaced the safety switch so that's nice and new.

113,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4469113,"For Sale:  Armi Tanfoglio Excam Single-Action .22 7A766 Wood Grips, Superb!","Davie, Broward, South Florida",$ 178,"Listed On: Monday, June 29, 2015",Handguns,Tanfoglio                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"Before you dismiss some of the brands that are not the ""Big 5 or 6"", there are many that are as good or that surpass them in many areas. This is not one of the high end ones at all, but it is extremely well made, all steel, with wood grips and has a feel and action that really equals several more well known names. Now, these are a pretty simple design and the mechanicals have not changed much in 150 years, but this is not one of the ""pot-metal"" or cheap alloy pistols (mostly semis) that were made by several companies (same owners)that change names every lawsuit. Tanfoglio makes the Witness series, and the higher end competition ones are pushing $1000. (standards are CZ-75 designs at $400)This is a single action with the typical ejector rod and side loading gate. In order to be imported to the US it needed a safety (dumb on a revolver I know, but GCA of 68 requires it)so there is a firing pin block safety that really is a nice design as it does not interfere with trigger pull or action at all. It just flips up to block the hammer and is pretty easy to pop with your thumb while holding it. A heavyweight barrel of 5.5 inches and the barrel and cylinder are a bluing finish that is a very dark, blackish tone. The receiver frame is steel and a black color that does not appear to be blued, while the grip frame is the only area that may be an alloy, though at 35.1 ounces empty, it may very well be steel as well, just a different tone to the color. With 2.25 pounds and a single action curved grip, shooting 22s in this is a dream as there is little muzzle rise and no recoil. I have had this for several years and only test fired it with ""indoor"" colibri and CCI quiet low velocity ammo (500 and 675 fps). It was bought for my daughter who loves single actions but she lost interest in pistols before we ever took it out. The trigger break is superb! I mean way better than it has a right to be on a lower cost gun. Crisp and just like breaking the glass rod, I guess the simplicity of the design leads to less slop and movement as the exploded diagram I saw shows just a handful of parts. When cocked, the cylinder has so little play, it could really be called none, and the gap between cylinder and forcing cone is barely paper thin as an index card will not fit, and plain paper is tight. As I have no range experience with it, I can not speak as to accuracy though indoors with the Aguila Colibri rounds, it nailed the target (taped to a telephone book) Great for beginners or youth, this is an inexpensive and excellent way to learn proper shooting form and discipline. I have a new semi-auto 1911-22 listed as well for the next step. With the CCI Quiet rounds, and a proper setup, it is awesome for basement range work though those rounds are a lot louder than Colibris (primer only) The wood grips are flawless except for one TINY chip that is pinhead size. The cylinder and barrel are perfect with a faint turn line on the cylinder and the ONLY area that is not perfect in finish is a 1mm spot on one side of the top-strap and a 1.5mm on the other side, right where it meets the barrel. It is just lighter here, thats all. Other than that, perfect including the hammer top and muzzle end. Ships to FFL for $30 IF I can send it Priority. Local is fine, and within FL we can deal direct if you have proper ID and a CWP that is valid (non-felon). Paypal is fine if discrete (Ill invoice) and add $2 for Paypal as I'll pay most of the fees for Paypal."

It comes with a beautiful custom stock, has a great metal finish and is even topped with a Leupold scope that is mounted with quick release rings. The scope can be removed if necessary and the iron sights can be quickly used. This is a nice feature. As a hunter of big game you want to take every precaution - just in case. This is a great custom rifle that will suit collectors and big game hunters.
Here is some information the .458 Lott from Wikipedia: “The .458 Lott is a .458 caliber belted hunting cartridge designed as a replacement for the less powerful .458 Winchester Magnum. It is based on the full length .375 H&H Magnum blown out and shortened to 2.800 inches (71.1 mm). The cartridge is designed for the purpose of hunting African dangerous game…The .458 Lott was designed in response to perceived inadequacies and problems encountered with the .458 Winchester Magnum. While the cartridge was slow to gain popularity at first, it is now becoming the standard by which dangerous game cartridges are judged. The cartridge provides a distinct step up in performance over the .458 Winchester Magnum…the .458 Lott is designed to provide about 200–300-foot-per-second (61–91 m/s) more velocity than the .458 Winchester Magnum. The performance goal does not just match but exceeds the original performance specifications of the .458 Winchester Magnum. The cartridge is capable of firing a 500-grain (32 g) bullet at 2,300-foot-per-second (700 m/s) from a 23-inch (580 mm) barrel such as the Ruger M77. This capability easily exceeded the performance that was expected of the .450 Nitro Express and the .458 Winchester Magnum."

This is a rare and somewhat hard to find carry pistol made in the 1990's. This is finished in a ""frosted"" stainless steel, has a 3"" barrel with a threaded barrel setup for a suppressor, and has factory grips and 1 factory mag.

Unfortunately I do not have a box or papers so you will only get the gun and 1 mag.

Price is $450 and that is fair and firm

I have ZERO interest in trades so please refrain from making offers.

I can meet FTF in the Knoxville and surrounding area

If you need more pics just ask for the particular shot and I will try to accommodate. 

I place the build date around 1995 so this pistol is going on 20 years old and in outstanding condition."

Please don't ask me to drive any further as I am not.  PRICE IS $375/FIRM.  If you send me an email offering less I will only delete it.

I also have 280 rounds of .380 ammo I will sell for an additional $75.  It is 200 rounds of fmj and 80 rounds of hp ammo.

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially. The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components. The MR762A1 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series including adjustable buttstocks, ergonomic pistol grips, mechanical sights, and the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard. This MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” type rail system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be removed without special tools by the user and ensures 100% return to zero when reinstalled. Ambidextrous operating controls are standard on the MR762A1, including a convertible charging handle and an ambidextrous selector lever. The MR762A1 uses the same 10- and 20-round translucent polymer box magazines made for the HK417; a 5-round magazine is also under development. MR762A1 rifles are well-suited for a variety of applications including law enforcement tactical, police patrol, general sporting, and hunting (a 5-round magazine is under development).

 No human institution lives up to its ideals all of the time, and our magnificent military Services are no exception. For many reasons, honorable men and women who have faithfully served the United States often find themselves wrongly accused, unjustly punished, or the victim of administrative error or injustice; face punishment or administrative sanctions that are disproportionate to the error or misconduct committed; or are incorrectly denied benefits to which they are entitled. If you are such a current or former Service Member, I would like to help. I spent my career in operational, training, and administrative billets serving in line units and on higher level staffs, and I have seen these issues from the perspective of the Soldier and leader. I graduated from West Point and completed a U.S. Army War College fellowship; served in Regular Army in the infantry in both rifle and support platoon leader rolls, as a company XO, and as a battalion S1; I deployed to Somalia as a rifle company executive officer; I commanded a rifle company in the Army National Guard; I taught ROTC at a major university; and I deployed to Iraq as head of a military advisory team embedded with an all-Kurdish Iraqi Army infantry brigade. Id like to assist you with criminal charges; inspector general (IG) investigations; Article 138 complaints; Correction Board appeals; grade determination issues; discharge proceedings and discharge upgrades; clemency hearings; Non-judicial punishment (Article 15) proceedings; and any other administrative or punitive matter you are facing.

The bolt is brand new made by AIM surplus, the buffer and spring are still in the bag, the barrel is new made by SOTA arms, the upper is new but has marks on the top. will not interfere with optics. the upper has a forward assist assembly hole, but I don't have one in it (useless). the stock is a mil-spec 4 position..also new. the barrel has a fake silencer on it. I like the looks but it does nothing and can be removed for a normal break. the lower parts kit is the parts kit from the other gun. there is nothing wrong with it, but it does show some handling marks.
