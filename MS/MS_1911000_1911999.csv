The EMOD is based on the same rugged and practical design as the original Vltor Modstock - with specific features designed from lessons taken from the modern battlefield. 

The EMOD is about one inch longer than the original Modstock and with the rubber butt plate installed, is about a quarter of an inch longer than the CRANE SCB. The increased length of the EMOD is a major benefit when used on scoped rifles (SPR/DMR), as it increases the available comb for any given length of pull. 

The buttplate of the EMOD is slightly wider and longer at the toe than the regular M4 stock with a noticeable negative pitch, making transitions from the ready feel much more natural. The EMOD was given enough weight to help balance out the normally muzzle heavy feel associated with negative pitch buttstocks. 

The toe of the buttplate is rolled under; giving the EMOD a superior feel when the weapon is held in the ""out of pocket"" heads up hold. The buttplate is covered with a removable rubber buttpad that is molded over a metal strike plate. The shape of the buttplate and the rubber buttpad give a solid stock purchase in all situations. 

The EMOD features more storage in the removable, waterproof side compartments; the EMOD holds up to four CR123 or three AA batteries. There is also an additional weather proof compartment in the clubfoot area of the stock, this compartment can be accessed quickly and holds two AA batteries or other small parts. 

Constructed from the finest materials, the EMOD will stand up to the most rugged demands. The EMOD is available for either the standard ""MilSpec"" receiver extension tube, or for the aftermarket ""Commercial"" size tube. Available colors include Black, Foliage Green and Flat Dark Earth (tan). The EMOD is only available in the Clubfoot model.

Since 2002, the original Modstock has become well known and respected by Military, Law-Enforcement and sports shooters worldwide. Even though the Modstock is considered the best on the market, Vltor believed it was time for improvements. The improvements are subtle but necessary. Feedback from end users will make the IMod the choice over the competition. 

When compared to the original Modstock, the IMod series is now available to fit either the Milspec or Commercial diameter receiver extension/buffer tube. Unfortunately, the IMod will not fit both receiver extensions, so when ordering, pick the correct item and part number. 

Like all Vltor stocks, the IMod is available in the three most popular colors; Black, Flat Dark Earth (tan) and Foliage Green. As with the original Modstocks, the IMod is offered in the conventional, “Standard” configuration and the unconventional, “Clubfoot” configuration. Even though the Standard model is the most well-known model amongst the shooting public, the Clubfoot version is a hybrid model that bridges the gap between tactical and prone shooting positions. In other words, the Clubfoot portion of the stock allows the shooter, with his/her off hand, to support the stock and to control the rear of the weapon, while shooting in prone or rested position. 

The improvements of the IMod are as follows: Integral, but removable non-slip buttpad (color matched to stock components) 

•Rolled/angled buttpad toe with wide traction area. This will assist in running the stock high on shoulder, making the IMod system more user friendly when using web-gear and/or body armor. 
•Improved lock paddle, making it easier to operate and making the contact surface non-slip when operating the lever. 
•Removed most sharp edges that may cause “snag points” to web-gear or other vital equipment. 
•Improved strength throughout construction of the stock chassis. This will provide maximum strength during “Mortaring exercise” or unexpected impact. 
•Integral, but removable non-slip buttpad (color matched to stock components) 

Installation note: The installation of the IMod stock should only be performed by a qualified gunsmith and/or certified armorer. 

IMOD at a glance: Details 
Design Removable rubber buttpad and storage compartments. A true Modular buttstock for the AR15/M16/M4 carbine series. 
Construction Impact and temperature resistant polymer, specially blended for Vltor. Metal components are either carbon steel or stainless steel (depending on the application) 
Compatibility Milspec IMods will only fit receiver extensions/buffer tubes with the outer diameter of 1.150”, while Commercial IMods will only fit 1.170” diameter receiver extensions. 
Weight - Nominal Less than 9.4 oz. (Milspec and Commercial with storage compartment and buttpad installed) 
Dimensions Length: 6.250” (without buttpad) 
Length: 6.626” (with buttpad) 
Width: 2.500” (with storage compartments installed)Height: 5.210” (with buttpad installed)

Color Finish All stocks have a matte (anti-reflection/glare) finish. IMods are only available in the following colors: Black, Flat Dark Earth (Tan) and Foliage Green. Foliage Green is more of a “grey” green versus Olive Drab. 
Special Features Storage capacity: Each side compartment can hold at least two AAs or three lithium CR123 3-volt batteries. The internal diameter of each compartment is 0.685”. 

Sling mounting: All Modstocks, including the IMod will accept a push-button, quick detachable sling swivel or a conventional web sling, measuring up to 1.375” in width.

This is a rare Winchester youth 22 that was patented in August of 1898 by the famous John Browning. Gun was produced 1928-1931 but there's no way to tell what year exactly because they were produced without serial numbers. All original. Has some stock damage which could be fixed but I wanted to keep it this way to maintain its collector value. Not many come up online still original so this could make a great addition to your collection at an affordable price. All trade offers will be considered.

Magpul PMAG Gen M3 $ 15.95

The Magpul PMAG 30 Gen M3 AR-15 Magazine reflects five years of research and development to advance the already proven PMAG design. Improved materials and manufacturing methods have made the PMAG M3 magazine perform to a higher standard in all tests: durability, impact strength, chemical resistance, and exposure to extreme temperatures. Internally, a new low friction, 4-way anti-tilt follower and enhanced constant curve geometry further increase feeding reliability in adverse conditions. Externally, the M3 PMAG has been significantly strengthened in the feed lip and spine areas to better withstand direct impacts when loaded to full capacity. The new Gen M3 has also been engineered to be compatible with a wider variety of magazine pouches via a smaller profile floorplate (which also boasts improved drainage capability) and lower profile ribs on either side of the magazine’s body. These “smoother” side ribs are complemented by the addition of horizontal grooves molded into the front- and back-straps of the body to ensure a positive grip in all conditions. The integration of eight dot-matrix panels (four on each side) enables the shooter to positively mark and identify magazines in a clear and abrasion-resistant way.

The PMAG 30 Gen M3 incorporates additional external improvements to the magazine catch and bolt catch notch areas that have expanded its firearm compatibility to include more than the AR-15 platform alone. It is also fully functional with the FN SCAR-16, the British SA-80, and the HK416/IAR/M27 platforms. The drop-free characteristics of the PMAG were also improved to ensure compatibility with a wider range of magazine wells, including those with tighter tolerances than mil-spec. Made in the USA.

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.

“The values listed in the Blue Book of Gun Values online subscription are based on national average retail prices for both modern and antique firearms, and some important accessories/acoutrements may also be included. This is not a firearms wholesale pricing guide. More importantly, do not expect to walk into a gun/pawn shop or gun show and think that the proprietor/dealer/collector should pay you the retail price listed within this text for your gun(s). Resale offers on many models could be anywhere from near retail to 20%-50% less than the values listed, depending upon locality, desirability, dealer inventory, and profitability. In other words, if you want to receive 100% of the price (retail value), then you have to do 100% of the work (become the retailer, which also includes assuming 100% of the risk). “

I have the almost impossible and hard to find ProMag Extended (15rd.) magazine for the Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .380ACP! New in the factory packaging.

This is Not the 10 rds mag, This is the 15 rds Extended Mag!! 

I have 3 of the same items for sale !! 

The Pistol Shown in the Listing Pictures is Not For Sale !!

 Promag is one of the largest manufacturers of high quality aftermarket magazines. They back their products with a LIFETIME warranty! 
•Magazine body is constructed from heat-treated, blued steel for durability
•Follower, lock plate, and base plate are molded from black DuPont Zytel polymer (matches the factory Smith perfectly)
•Heat-treated, chrome-silicone wire spring offers strength and reliabilty
•Magazine base plate is removable for easy cleaning

So, just imagine...you carry your Smith and Wesson concealed (where allowed by law) and you keep the factory short magazine in it for concealability. And, when you get home, just pop in this higher capacity magazine to have greater fire-power at hand. It's just that easy.

This magazine matches the look and feel of the Bodyguard's finger grips perfectly.

I am asking for $40 for one Extended 15 rds Magazine for S&W Bodyguard 380 ACP Pistol !! 
Face to Face, Cash Sales Only !!

AIMPOINT COMPM2 - M68/CCO RED DOT SIGHT

First introduced in 2000, nearly 300,000 CompM2 sights are now in use by many Armed Forces including elite Special Forces around the world. The CompM2, also known as the M68/CCO (when used by US forces), is the standard sight for the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force as well as the armed forces of many NATO countries. Due to its compatibility with all generations of night vision device (NVD), the CompM2 is ready for use around the clock. The CompM2 holds up under the roughest physical handling and can withstand the most severe weather conditions and temperatures. In fact, the CompM2 is completely submersible and will withstand pressures up to 2.5 atmospheres allowing it to be taken up to 25 meters underwater. When the CompM2 was released, it became the benchmark against which all other combat optics are measured. While primary utilized by armed forces, hunters and sport shooters who want a professional grade sight can also use the CompM2.

This is a solid trailer that I bought brand new just before deer season last year.  I have used it to haul my stand to and back from my lease. It has been lightly used and well maintained. I will sell it outright for $1150 cash or consider trades valued at $1300. Willing to consider cash plus guns/gold/silver or straight trade. Your trade offer must be of $1300 value.

 This will only be an in person face to face cash transaction. I prefer to sell to somebody that has a CCW, if you do not you must have a valid state driver's license and I must have a signature on a bill of sale only to promote proper transfer of such a weapon. I need to make sure that everything is documented so that if the weapon was over used the wrong way it doesn't come back on me. I am NOT looking to do a background check but just to make sure YOU ARE WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE AND to cover myself. If this is not OK with you please do not waste your time or mine. 

 ANY responsible gun owner will understand.

 At this price you will be saving a good deal after tax that you would normally pay in a store."

These were used by my two sons, they quickly moved on to rimfire and then centerfire rifles and no longer use these. They liked them because they are very ""tacti-cool.""

There is an 11mm rail on top for optics or peep sight. The blade sight height can be adjusted down and out of the way if you choose to mount something on top.

We bought them new and have had them for about 2 years, although they were only used for about 2 months of periodic 10-meter target shooting.

Description
M600U-A
Compact and extremely powerful, the M600 Ultra Scout Light® uses a virtually failure-proof LED to produce 500 lumens of output, and it continues producing blinding tactical light for 1.5 hours on a set of batteries. This brilliant output is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens into a far-reaching beam with an intense 13,000-candela central area that also provides significant peripheral illumination, making it ideal for close- to longer-range applications. 

The compact size of the M600 Ultra—under 5.5 inches long—minimizes added weight, frees up rail space for other accessories, and increases weapon maneuverability compared to larger WeaponLights. It attaches by means of an integral thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. 

The M600 Ultra comes with two switches: (1) a pushbutton tailcap switch: press for momentary on, press further to click constant-on; and (2) a momentary-on tape switch with a 7-inch cable that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. 

Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for maximum light transmission, the M600 Ultra is O-ring sealed to keep out the elements. Like all SureFire WeaponLights, the M600 Ultra is built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black or Desert Tan. 

Fits: Rifles, carbines, or submachine guns with a Picatinny rail on the forend. (See our Picatinny Rail Forends).
Features
•	High-performance, recoil-proof LED generates 500 lumens of blinding white light and continues producing tactical-level light for 1.5 hours
•	Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens creates intense, versatile beam with enough reach for longer-range applications and significant surround light for peripheral vision
•	Construction: Mil-Spec hard-anodized aerospace aluminum, optically coated tempered window, O-ring and gasket seals
•	Ergonomic tactical switching: click-on/off tailcap and pressure-activated tape switch (both included)
•	Thumbscrew clamp securely attaches to any Picatinny rail

Wanted to give the 500 a fair shake against the 870. Very nice shot gun.. I see why people like the location of a few things like the safety and the rack button. Has a vented barrel which im not sure I see a difference. Seems like they are more dressed up. But I personally like the 870 and how it feels in my hands.

I have a CZ85 Combat for sale. I am not looking for trades at this time.
This was ordered from their custom shop with their trigger job. The package comes with the original target from them with the finished trigger break in lbs for SA and DA.
I have had a Fiber Optic front sight installed and have the original sight also. It has 5 mags. 1-18, 2-16's & 2-15's.
This pistol has never been holstered or shot in competition. I worked up some loads and put it in the safe. Pistol is just over 1 yr old. 
This one is a shooter! The factory target is pretty much the way this shoots. Most accurate 9mm I've ever shot and has a single action trigger that breaks like a 1911.
You won't be disappointed if you are the purchaser!!
I prefer to sell locally , but will consider shipping  for $45 to your ffl , if legal in your state."

Great practice round if you want to practice with HP's these are very consistent as well and have a good snap to them. Best price I found (in stock with shipping was $40 ( per 25) for the Buffalo Bore and $50 (per 50). So I figure $50.00 for the whole lot is ridiculously fair .

UFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE HEAVY 357 Mag - 125 gr. Barnes XPB @ 1650 fps - 20 Round Box

PRESS RELEASE FOR BUFFALO-BARNES HEAVY 357 MAG 125 gr. BARNES XPB (ITEM 19J)



For those needing/wanting a Lead-Free, HEAVY 357 Magnum load, generating full power plus, here it is.

Below are real world velocities taken from my personal real world stock guns. The established use of long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings is essentially misleading to the public who won’t be firing ammo from a laboratory test barrel in the real world, where it matters.

2145 fps - Marlin mod 1894, 18 inch barrel
1583 fps - S&W mod 27, 5 inch barrel
1591 fps - S&W Mt. Gun, 4 inch barrel
1507 fps - S&W mod 66, 3 inch barrel
1448 fps - S&W mod 66, 2.5 inch barrel
You’ll notice that the newer S&W 4 inch Mt Gun gave higher velocities than the older 5 inch model 27 S&W and this is because of different internal barrel dynamics of the newer gun.

Due to the long-for-weight all copper bullet, we did not have the case capacity to use a bulky flash retarded powder and thus there is noticeable muzzle flash with this load, except when firing it from the rifle, which yielded little to no flash.

This load is the typical Barn-Burning, Turbo-Charged, Buffalo Bore type of HEAVY 357 mag. load and as such, should only be used in revolvers made of all steel. It should not be fired in light weight alloy framed or cylinder revolvers. Feel free to use it in ALL/ANY 357 mag. chambered rifles and all steel revolvers."
