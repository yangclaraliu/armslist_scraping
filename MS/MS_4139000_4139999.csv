An R3 recoil pad permits greater control by eliminating slippage while firing, and the grooved, steel-lined fore-end provides a better grip, sling swivel studs are preinstalled, and as a bonus the package includes a Butler Creek padded sling.

It shoots great. You can tell by the picture below.

3 inch target at 21 ft.

It did have a few failures to feed while I shot it.  It was because of one of the four reasons that I could think of .

1. I haven't cleaned or lubed it yet. 2. I gripped it too loosely. 3. It needs it's feed ramp to be polished or 4. It may have been just the cheap ammo that I used to test it.

Each time it happened, while keeping the gun on target, I simply used my other hand to slightly pull the slide back and releasing it.It took less than a second to fire. And, on target as you can see from the photo.

If I was going to keep it (I have another), I'd clean, lube, polish it and buy quality ammo, but I'm not."

Description



The Ruger® SR9c® Compact Semi-Auto Pistol provides shooters with a low-maintenance, rugged, and reliable concealed carry handgun. The matte SR9c has an alloy steel slide, finished in a hardwearing, non-reflective black nitrate finish that won't give the gun's position away in bright sun light or under artificial lights; front and rear serrations provide a positive grip when loading or unloading the pistol. To ensure reliable operation with a shorter barrel and slide, the SR9c (Compact) uses a dual captured recoil spring and guide rod. With its lightweight, slim design, the SR9c semi-automatic pistol is comfortable for concealed carry all day, with most any type of clothing. Its ergonomic grip has an easily reversible backstrap that allows shooters the choice of a curved or straight backstrap. The SR9c features a structurally rigid, glass-filled nylon grip frame that reduces recoil and enhances handgun control, and the front of the frame has a built-in Picatinny rail for modern handgun accessories. The high-visibility 3-Dot sight system provides quick and easy target acquisition, with adjustment for elevation and windage. A loaded chamber indicator can be seen or felt, providing confirmation of a loaded or empty chamber.

This is a high grade Stoeger import Royal with a rare beavertail forened and even rarer single selective trigger. Excellent all original condition. 28 3/8"" nitro steel barrels choked Improved cylinder x improved modified. 2 3/4"" chambers, sideslips and a Greener cross bolt. Barrel blueing is excellent at about 95%. Heavily engraved action retains about 80% of the bright original case color. Wood is as nice as the rest of the gun and is set up for a long LOP. Ebony drop points and very fine checkering. LOP is currently 15 1/2"" from the front trigger position and 14 1/2"" from the single trigger in the rear position. LOP from the front trigger position is 14 1/2"" of wood without the recoil pad so a Sauer buttplate could be reinstalled to bring the gun back to original configuration. In other words the wood has not been cut. Gun locks up tight and on face with all numbers matching. A really nice higher grade Sauer. it's the best among my selections...email or cal if interested: laforcedavid87@yahoo.com , NO TRADE AND MONEY ORDER ONLY"

This particular gun was made by S.N. ROMARM SA/CUGIR in Romania and imported by C.A.I., ST. ALB, VT. By the serial number it appears this weapon was built in the year 2000 and has been shot very little over the years since I purchased this weapon around that time. It has a 16"" barrel with no muzzle brake or threading on the barrel with a side mount v-rail for scope attachment. It comes with a MTK-83 attachable side mount scope rail made in Belarus with a black    3x9x42mm objective NcStar brand short length scope with a sniper style recticle and the mount can be removed/attached without losing zero from the gun. This mount also allows use of the regular iron sights when it is attached to the gun since it is a cantilever style curved mount. It also includes see-thru scope covers on bungee type cords that can be removed or left on during shooting.
It also comes with 5 - .223 caliber marked Bakelite tan colored 30 - round magazines, 1 - black polymer circle 10 marked - 5.56x45mm 30 - round magazine, and 1 - blued steel 5.56x45mm 5 - round magazine that came with the gun which has no markings. It also has a very nice heavy 1-1/2"" nylon adjustable strap that was on the gun when I purchased it all those years ago. The weapon comes with a Doskosport brand hard plastic case which is 52"" long x 15' wide with a carry handle. It has 4 closure latches and gray egg shell foam in the top/bottom of the case to protect the weapon. The fit/finish on the weapon is in very good condition and the safety has never been engaged which usually marks the side of the receiver. I purchased the weapon new about 14 years ago from Bill's Gun Shop in Robbinsdale, MN and I have not fired the gun very much all these years. I am looking to sell this gun for cash and I am not looking to make any trades at this point. I am dropping the price on this very nice weapon system by $100.00 dollars cash to $800.00 dollars cash for the weapon & accessories at this point on 05/22/2015."

This SKS was hand picked by me in the 1980's out of an arsenal weapons crate.This gun has never been fired by me.The action and bore appear unfired.This gun has a beautiful brown patterned stock. The bore is good and all numbers on the metal parts match the Trigger guard,magazine,receiver cover,carrier,gas tube,etc. As for the markings on the receiver cover it has a circle with a triangle with an arrow in the triangle, below that is the date 1954r and below that is a diamond shape which means Re-arsenaled. As for the stock it has a star and below that is the date 1954r and below that is XXX to cross out an old serial number then below that is the serial number that matches the gun numbers.  Also various arsenal markings. You just don't find these in this good of shape to often.   You won't be disappointed. You must be able to legally able to own a firearm and I will record you DL info for my records. The transfer of this rifle will take place in the parking lot of the Seymour PD.

Details at link. Shotgun is in A+ condition, and will come with about 200 rounds. Retail is $300, so in awesome shape plus that much ammo, I think $300 is a fair price. This is NOT the Mossberg 88 you see at Academy for $180. 
Would make a kick-butt home defense gun, or sturdy and cheap enough to throw in the truck during hunting season and not worry about it. Perhaps you need a good first shotgun for your little one? Trigger safety plus first-pump safety make this a good one to learn on as well.

Comparable in size to a smart phone and weighing only 11.5 oz, the ultra-concealable Bobcat has been the ultimate pocket pistol for over three decades.

It is user-friendly, durable, reliable and accurate, while with its snag-free lines is can be tucked in any kind of holster or pocket for deep concealment. It is perfect for concealed carry (on its own or as a backup pistol), and it keeps besting all pistols in its class for quality, value and design.   

User-friendly design is common to all Beretta small frames. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber without racking the slide. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by giving an easy and absolutely safe way to check the bore and and remove a live cartridge. Jamming and stove-piping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas.

Beretta pistols in the 21 Series utilize a tough forging process for their barrels, while slides are fashioned from solid steel bar stock--and frames from solid aluminum forgings. The new stainless-steel version (“Inox”) employs the finest and toughest steels, making it exceptionally corrosion resistant and durable.

Comes with Beretta case, manuals, 1 seven rd clip and black suede leather gun holster."

Has less than 200 rounds through it and I’ve decided a full size .45 isn’t high on my priority list right now.  I upgraded Magpul grips but still have the original.  I also have 100rds of Winchester 230g fmj.  I'm basically throwing the grips and ammo in for free.

Looking to expand my options for concealed carry and would like a double action 9mm that is able to hold 15 rounds.  I am NOT interested in any old law enforcement trade in’s or something that has 5,000 rounds through it.  I AM looking for a gen 3 or 4 Glock 19 with a low round count, maybe a full size m&p 9mm, or a double action sig that would be suitable for carry purposes (I think the p250 is the only dao model that will hold 15 rounds of ammo, but I could be wrong).  Something along those lines anyway.

If the add is posted it is still available.  If I don’t respond it’s probably because your offer was a complete waste of my time.  The MSRP for the Para is $713 so plan on adding cash, ammo, or something else of value.  I would like to trade instead of sell but if I had an offer of $600 cash I'd probably take it.  Don't bother if you are planning on offering less.

.35 Whelen cartridge and features a 24-inch Douglas barrel of 
the “S” configuration for perfect weight and balance. 

In addition to its custom barrel, this Number One also features 
beautiful casehardening of the receiver, lever, and grip cap.

The beautiful stocks are original to the rifle and did not require
replacement to create this spectacular custom rifle. This also keeps
the cost for a Trophy Ruger No.1 at a reasonable price. Custom wood
for a Number One will generally add an additional $4000 to the price.

Also included with the rifle are loading dies, 100 new brass cases,
and both jacketed and lead bullets. 

All in all, this custom Ruger No.1 is a handsome Trophy Rifle that is 
capable of handling any game in North America with ease. And with
heavier bullets, most anything in Africa as well.

Because I rebuild Custom Ruger No.1s, another Number One may 
be considered as a bargaining chip in trade toward the purchase 
of this custom rifle. 

Additional detail photos are available to serious parties.
Will ship to your FFL dealer. Price does not include shipping
or any other costs incurred by buyer to complete
