Advantages of this platform is that not only is pistol ammunition cheaper than rifle ammunition, I have yet to hear of a range that didn't allow the use of pistol caliber carbines. These guns also have a utility beyond that of simple target shooting, namely self-defense. Depending on the caliber and load, you’ll see an extra 100 to 300 fps boost when firing pistol ammo out of a carbine-length barrel. The lack of recoil and quieter report not only make them great choices for new shooters but those of slight build as well.

This listing is for One set of grips, actually a one piece grip; buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-grip price and with no additional shipping charges. Here is a real find. Photos show specimen from a limited acquisition of genuine walnut, factory Harrington & Richardson one piece grips we found in an old Southern Warehouse. We estimate these were manufactured in the mid 1980s, prior to Harrington and Richardson phasing out operations in 1986. Construction is from American Walnut, with plain oil finish. These are not glossy finished like many of the old revolvers’ grips are, that we planted a good many of during the 1960s and 1970s; and that we trade for from time to time. These will fit only Harrington & Richardson Rimfire .22 caliber double action revolvers that were styled on a Western Look, including models 649, 676, 686, 949, and 976. Owners can check their revolver’s frame dimensions. First, the revolver should have a straight back strap to its grip frame, not a curved one, see the photo that shows the perfectly straight backstrap contact area inside these grips. The butt area recess measures exactly 1 3/4 inches, so these will only fit a revolver whose grip frame butt measures 1 3/4 inches. Top of the back strap, the center of where it will fit, measures 1 1/4 inches from that point on the walnut to the upper shoulders of the grip. The flat backstrap recess inside the grip measures 3 1/4 inches on the center, from the rounded backstap area where the grip stops at its top center, to the back edge of its butt area that mates with the butt of the revolver’s grip frame. Interior diameter is .570 to .575 inches, so the grip frame of the revolver should be no thicker than that. These grips did not come with grip screws, but grips screws are readily available throughout the country at around $5.00 for a pair. Grip screw holes have 1/4 inch counterbore recess from their 1 5/16, or 1.330 thickness at the grip screw, so screws should have about a 1/4 to 3/8 inch shank. These grips are not replaceable; production cost for a custom made set would probably reach $100 or more. We’re offering the carefully measured grips in the photos, however, or their identical mates, each for only $ 29.00. Shipping.Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

The venerable Mossberg 500 Shotgun had been around a long, long time before Cruiser style pistol grips became fashionable in the 1970s. We still see some home made hillbilly cruiser grips, whittled out of the original hardwood stocks, come into our store with the stock bolt shining. Our more affluent owners wrap those with gray duct tape. For the past 25 years, we see lots of them with their hardwood forends intact. The buttstock is much easier to change than the forend, no real disassembly of the shotgun required. A person just gets a Phillips screwdriver, takes one of the butt pad screws loose, swivels the pad, and then goes into the buttstock with an extension socket wrench or even a long shanked big flat head screwdriver, takes the old stock off. Then, using the big Allen wrench shown and enclosed, along with the washers, install the pistol grip. Even our photographer can perform the procedure. Photos show brand new factory Cruiser grips we took off some Mossberg 500 M&P Parkerized finish 18 inch barreled shotguns, so we leave their conventional buttstocks on them. All these grips are brand new, factory fresh with their factory plastic bag and hardware like the one in the photos. Installation leaves an overall length of well over 28 inches. Installation will, however, transform the Shotgun into Any Other status on the 4473 form, and owners must be at least 21 years of age, same rules as handguns. Also, installation may run a person afoul of local laws, checking those is the responsibility of the buyer. Buyers should be advised that 12 gauge shotguns generate substantial recoil, and should be kept well away from the operator’s face while firing. These cruiser grips will fit any 12 gauge model 500, model 535, Model 590, or Model 835. They will not fit a Remington 870 or the gear shift column of a 1963 Pontiac. Replacement pricing on these often approaches $60 apiece in our area. We’re offering them each, however, the factory Mossberg grip in the photos or its identical mates, for only $ 29.00. Shipping.

Mostly commercial headstamps a few military. All crimps have been removed (swaged). The brass has been sized, pockets uniformed, swaged if necessary, trimmed, case mouths chamfered and de-burred. 
The brass was trimmed on a Giraurd trimmer set to approx. 1.748"" trim length. There were a few commercial pieces that were short, near 1.740"" or slightly less, that I let go thru. Your choice if you feel you want to pull them. I've loaded plenty of short ones and couldn't tell the difference for my plinking. 

So lets just say this brass is not match quality but I expect that it will perform well for normal blasting purposes.

(brass gets caught on extractor). This is a great range rifle, considering it kicks shell casings forward and to the right, where you won't need to pick them up. I've been using cheap TulAmmo .223 with good accuracy and reliability. (costs about $5.50 a box) 

This is the newer generation with the GLNxxxxx serial number

With this rifle, you are getting 320 rounds of steel cased 223 ammo, 

60 rounds is Tulammo 55gr FMJ

80 rounds Monarch (AKA Brown Bear) 55gr FMJ

180 rounds Wolf Military Classic 55gr HP

Includes a free Plano polymer ammo can!

This also includes 6 original IMI steel 35rd magazines!

I will meet you at a gun shop, where you will be free to look the rifle over without people freaking out. I however, WILL NOT SHIP THIS TO YOU. DO NOT ASK.

NO LOWBALL OFFERS. No I will not take much less than $700, and no I will not trade down unless you're going to add cash. Yeah, I've got bills to pay, but I'm not going to rip myself off. These rifles go for $700 WITHOUT the mags and ammo! Not to mention, they are rare. If you want to trade me a $500 gun and not add cash, then don't even bother."

Models 68 88 351 352 461 462 851 971 972 Modified from Old Stock S&W J Square Grips Herretts typ,"Henderson, Tennessee, United States",$ 49,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 8, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Seller Stock #: GRsil066R This listing is for One set of grips; buyers, however, may take any number we have on hand at the same per-grip price and with no additional shipping charges. Blue Steel Rossi Revolvers used to be much more attractive when Interarms shipped them with wood grips. Present production Rossi Rubber Grips look good enough on Stainless Revolvers, but make their blue guns look much like Archie Campbell’s Mugly Other and Sad Blisters. Photos show representatives of only a couple dozen Italian Walnut grips we found in an old Southern Warehouse for Smith & Wesson J frame revolvers with a square butt grip frame. They are modeled closely after Mr. Steve Herrett’s Shooting Star grips that are now classics. Since current production Rossi Revolvers are essentially copies of the J Frame Smith & Wesson, we were able to modify them with minimal alterations for a decent fit on Rossi Revolvers with square butt grip frames like the older Smith & Wessons had. Note that the fit is not perfect, it is decent, though with no more than .01 inch of grip frame or grip showing. Candidates include Rossi Models 68 and 88 imported by Interarms from about 1975 until 1998; and their descendants imported by Braztech, including Models 68 88 351 352 461 462 851 971 972. All of those revolvers have Square Butt Grip Frames like the Rossi 851 grip frame showing in some of our photos. They will not fit the old Pre-1969 Rossis with round butt grip frame. These are period appropriate for classic 1980s and 1990s Interarms import small frame Rossis. We found a limited quantity of these in an old Southern Warehouse. Manufacturer was Italian, and importer was Sile Inc. of New York City. Construction is satin finish, cut checkered Italian Walnut with nickel plated grip screws and escutcheons. These grips are fully ambidextrous, and their Herretts-inspired design will accommodate the use of 36-A size speedloaders.

I have one unfired Zastava PAP M92 AK pistol with many extras. Read Below.

The Pap m92 AK Pistol is built like a tank as you likely already know. It comes with Hogue Grip, one Bolt hold open Yugo steel mag in excellent condition free of cosmoline, and one surplus steel mag of unknown origin but functional.
I'm also adding an additional Flat Dark Earth polymer tapco mag with one Black that I customized in mossy oak camo. Check out the picture. 
I'm also including a 30$ brand new E93 EchoNineThree sling adaptor and I can install it for you if necessary. Upon inspection it has a very crisp double hook trigger and smooth action. Also comes with the original factory grip in case you want to replace the Hogue I installed. Comes with all paper work, certification, and century arms box.  
Excellent starter AK for a project or just fine out of the box. These things are a blast.

I'm mainly looking to get close to my money back but I'm selling at 500 so a bit of a loss in order to sell quicker, but also open to trades and offers. I could sell for lower if you prefer to remove the magazines, grip, and or sling adaptor. So for 460 if we removed the adaptor, grip, and remove 3 of the magazines. I'd be primarily looking to trade for any quality pistols from Sig Sauer, Glock, SW, FNH, or AR Rifles or pistols. Let me know what you have.

The reliability of these uppers is unmatched due to the nature of their operating system which is also adjustable to accommodate various types of ammo and use of a silencer. Besides incredible reliability, PWS also uses Isonited barrels on their guns which means you can expect out of the box performance and accuracy even after throwing many thousand rounds downrange. The quality of the BCG is also something to be admired seeing as how this upper has almost 300 rounds of 5.56 through it yet the points of friction of the BCG that interface with the inside of the receiver are totally free of any wear and tear. 

This package comes complete with a very reliable Bushnell TRS 25 red dot sight, BCM Gunfighter charging handle, and Magpul flip up sights. Please don't hesitate to email me if you would like any additional pictures or have any other questions.

Buyers, however, may take any number of extras at the same per-holster price and with no additional shipping charges. From very light duty in the Cold War Days of Communist East Germany comes these attractive, protective and eminently serviceable leather holsters originally designed for East German Police Pistols that were Walther PP knock-offs. They will also fit similarly sized CZ Pistols, models CZ24, CZ50, and CZ70. They fit the single action Zastava Yugoslavian made M70 in .32 ACP. Beretta models 1934, 1935, 70, and 71 fit well in this holster, and that goes for the 70 clones made by Tangfolio and imported by FIE and Excam, including models TA380, E380, E32, and E22. Measurements will accommodate a pistol whose length measures up to 6 1/2 inches from its muzzle to its grip frame strut beneath its hammer; with a slide thickness of up to 1 inch; and with a muzzle height of up to 1 1/4 inches measured from the top of the front sight to the bottom of the slide. The pistol’s height from the top of the rear sight to the floorplate bottom of an in-battery magazine should not exceed 4 3/4 inches. Manufacturer on these was probably the State Factory in Baden, East Germany. Construction is smooth grained dark brown leather outer, with natural soft suede type finish inner. Stitching is close looped cotton twine. Strap is eye type, secured by a two piece aluminum alloy stud. Belt loop is single 1 7/8 inches wide secured by six alloy rivets, and will accommodate up to a 2 inch wide belt. This is a well made holster that will protect a pistol very well, and its styling is distinctively European. Surface wear is minimal, and we do not believe these served on duty for more than 2 or 3 years, if that long. Most specimens are marked on the inner flap by the MDL, the East German Ministry of the Interior in loose translation, certifying its fitness for duty use. We estimate these holsters were manufactured in the mid 1970s to early 1980s. We’re offering specimens from the photo lot each for only $ 24.00.

Sile brand grips have been around for most of our lifetimes. Before the days of Hogue, the battle was between Pachmayr and Sile for the Stainless Revolver market. Pachmayrs looked better, but they were bulky and square feeling. Many shooters preferred Siles, like these that were actually manufactured during the early 1980s. Neither Pachmayr nor Sile had inlaid logos in their rubber grip panels until the mid 1980s. Sile grips have always been Italian manufactured, and smoothly finished. This is Sile’s Hard Rubber, Thin Profile Combat Finger Groove Grips for any Smith & Wesson J Frame Revolver with a Round Butt Grip frame. All J frame guns made after about 1995 are round butt. Models included are 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, and those models’ 6 prefix stainless variants; model 63 post 1995; and the 3 prefix series of Air Lites including models 317, 340, 351, and 360. If you aren’t sure whether your Smith & Wesson is square or round butt, please see the S&W Photo to tell the difference between Square and Round. The 1993 Satin Nickel model 442 is not included, and we are not advertising it for sale on this listing. These Sile Grips are very attractive combat rubber grips, brand new and never installed. They are in the comfortable and distinctive finger groove Combat configuration, but with checkered panel centers for optimal control, that in addition to their attractiveness.

Ruger 10/22 Design Contest Rifle (Lightly used)

The sights are the best irons I have used on a 10/22 (not click-adjustable, like the Tech-Sights, but much more crisp to my tired eyes) and the extended picatinny rail works great for a low-power scope or red dot. On top of that, you also get a threaded barrel, removable comb-piece, swivel studs, and stainless-steel barrel. 

This rifle has been to the range a couple of times but has <1 brick of ammo through it. Other than the slight wear on the rail and around the sight from adjusting it during zeroing (seen in pictures) it is in very good condition. I am somewhat conflicted about selling this, as it is my favorite factory 10/22 configuration, but I am out of room and something has to give.

All Smith & Wesson J Frame Revolvers made since the mid 1990s are Round Butt Grip Frame, and Square Butt Js were never plentiful. Hogue grips have knocked Pachmayr off the ruling perch in the past 20 years with their ergonomics and affordability. Pachmayr, of course, wins all the beauty contests, but for shooting comfort and ease of handling, Hogue is the winner. This is Hogue's pink colored, finger grooved, compact size, concealable grip to fit any Smith & Wesson J Frame Revolver with round butt grip frame. Manufacturer is Hogue, Inc. of Paso Robles, CA. Construction is two piece pink outer shell rubberized polymer, with a hard black internal sleeve bonded to an absorbent yet firm synthetic rubber with stippled surfaces. Anchor inserts are steel, and they use the frame of the revolver itself for strength, not screw and escutcheon type that can easily loosen and break. These grips fit models 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and any of their 6 prefix stainless variants, including the model 60 itself. Smith & Wesson small or J frame revolvers, most specimens made since about 1995 are round butt, includes models 34, 650, 651 and the 3 prefix Air Lite siblings. For any shoppers who aren’t clear whether you have a round or square butt revolver, please see the grip frame photo. Lord knows there are plenty of them out there and there will be for decades to come. We mean the round butt Smith & Wessons. These Hogue Bantams preserve the compactness and don’t really take up as much space as a traditional set of Magna Goncalo Grips with a Tyler T on them.

We do not ship these internationally for several reasons. Here is the original, still viable ergonomic grip revolver grip adapter. This one is the most traditional of all, the Tyler #1, to fit any Smith & Wesson Compact Revolver in J frame with a round butt grip frame in conjunction with traditional small Magna type service grip panels. It will not fit over rubber grips because it anchors to the grip frame front strap, and rubber covers that area. Manufacturer and warrantor is Tyler Manufacturing of Oklahoma. Construction is one piece polished aluminum alloy, with copper alloy retaining clip and steel clip ring. Finish is mirror polished. This grip adapter became a classic in the 1960s ad 1970s distributed from Mr. Melvin Tyler in Oklahoma City. It will fit any Smith & Wesson J Frame Revolver that has small size grip panels of similar size to the factory grips shipped until the 1990s, when rubber took over. It will work just fine with current production Smith & Wesson 21995 grips, with Ajax magna size grips, with a Barami Clip Grip. Smith & Wesson models include models 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 48, 60, 317, 351, 437, 438, 442, 637, 638, 640, 642, 650, and 651. It will work on 5 shot Rossi or Taurus .22, .32, .38, or .357 Revolvers so long as they have standard magna type panels. It will not work on a Rossi Princess, will not work on a Smith & Wesson K Frame 6 Shot; will not work on the turn signal lever of a 1974 Ford Pinto. It will only work on a Smith & Wesson J Frame Revolver or one of its close Charter Arms, Rossi, or Taurus clones that have magna type grips that do not cover the front strap of the grip frame. This Tyler T provides support for the shooter’s middle and ring fingers, with enough space for the pinky to rest on the grip frame front strap for most shooters. It allows access to the strain screw without removing the grips. Its purpose is a better feel, but they also allow a much smaller grip circumference than Rubber or Combat grips, and it will reduce felt muzzle flip with magnum loads. This grip adapter, with the above listed requirements, is relatively easy to install. All a person needs to do is loosen their revolver’s grip panels’ screw just enough for the copper tabs to fit around the grip frame’s front strap, slide it into place and then retighten the grip screw. This grip adapter restores the classic 1970s – 1980s appearance to any J Frame Smith & Wesson Revolver, and it is certainly Period Appropriate for any Square Butt variants.

Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable back strap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated de cocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol."

It will also fit Winchester Models 1200, 120, and 1300 Shotguns, as well as Mossbergs 535, 590, and 835. That is because it comes with two adapters included that make it almost a one size fits all. This full-length shotgun stock, writes the factory, is finished in black and features a slim, ergonomic design for maximum comfort and control. Made from indestructible extreme temperature, glass-reinforced polymer, the non-slip pebble texture on the pistol grip improves shooting accuracy and a rubber recoil pad minimizes recoil shock. For buyers replacing their full length stocks, installation uses the factory stock bolt and has a sling swivel stud. If a person has only a cruiser grip shotgun and wants to install one of these, you will need to find a stock bolt. On the Mossberg 590, for instance, it took a 516x18, 5 1/2 inch bolt. Papers included show the proper threads for each shotgun variant. This pistol-grip stock fits most 12 gauge, Maverick 88, Mossberg 500/535/590/835; NEF Pardners, Hawk Industries model 981 and 982 clones of the Remington 870; Remington 870 itself and Winchester models 120, 1200/1300. It will not work on a Remington 11-87 or 1100, or any semi automatic shotgun. It will not fit a 16 or 20 gauge shotgun. It will not fit any other make and model except the ones we have listed. Further, a person firing a shotgun chambered in 3 1/2 inch Magnum should secure the shotgun against his or her shoulder to prevent damage to the pistol grip section of the stock. The pistol grip is not designed to bear all the recoil pressure from a 3 1/2 inch magnum by itself; and neither, we might add, is the human wrist. Length of pull, measured from the trigger face to the end of the 1 inch recoil pad, will run between 13 1/2 inches on a Mossberg to 14 1/2 inches on a Remington or Winchester.

Winchester 94 Sporter Lever-Action 30-30 Win Rifle, 24 Inch Barrel, Walnut Stock, Winchester 534178114
What makes the Winchester® Model 94 so exciting is the variety of models available, and each offers a level of accuracy that will impress you.

The satin oil finished walnut stock is finely checkered with double-line bordering. Note the 24″ half-round, half-octagon blued barrel that’s reminiscent of the original rifles. The hammer is drilled and tapped for a spur extension, which is included with the rifle. The Sporter has a semi-buckhorn rear sight and a fine gold bead on the front.

Hit Buy It and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price, and with no additional shipping charges. For the past few years, American Tactical Imports has led us to appreciate Turkish Gunmaking Finesse. Here is ATI’s factory 10 shot magazine for its well made, slick-finished FS9, CS9, and HP9 series of pistols, modeled and named after John Moses Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power. Italian influence, rather than Belgian, is more in evidence on the pistol itself as well as on its magazine. The tell-tale marking on the magazine is its patent number 5386657, a Mec-Gar patent. Manufacturer is Tisas, shorthand abbreviation for Trabzon, Turkey, Gun Industry Corporation; and these are manufactured on Italian equipment. These magazines also fit the ATI FS-9 and CS-9 pistols. Interestingly, it will not fit a 92F series Beretta, but it works just fine in the Beretta 8000 Cougar, and the Stoeger Cougar Clone pistols, with only a quarter inch or so of protrusion past the butt of the Cougar’s grip frame, as the photos show. It will NOT fit a PX4 Beretta, either. Construction is smooth bright blue finished steel, with steel spring and heavy duty black polymer extended floorplate and cartridge follower. This magazine flush fits the grip frame of the HP-9 pistol, as opposed to its standard issue extended twenty rounder. Pricing on this magazine often approaches $60 apiece for the ten rounders, even more for the issue magazines that usually come with the pistols. Our Single Mag price is $24.00. We’re offering the ten rounders in the photos, however, or their identical mates, in lots of 3 or more at only $16 per. Own 3 for only $ 48.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City.

This morning was the public hearing on SB 941 the universal background check law they are trying to ram through here in Oregon.
The good folks who introduced it declared it as a ""public health emergency"" this way there will be no public vote on the bill.
They schedule the hearing at 8am on a weekday to keep as many people as possible from coming.
They even changed the hearing room at the last minute. They then schedule the work session where it will be voted in tomorrow morning. Which does not even give them time to review the public comments. Which is just how they want it.

I am against having a gun registry. Which is exactly what these UBC laws are.  What other personal belonging is so highly regulated and requires such means to transfer ownership. This law if/when it passes will make me a criminal when I go out to the woods (which is where we shoot around here, not a range) to target shoot and let my girlfriend (as we are not married) shoot one of my guns...or a buddy try one. Just unbelievable. 

The next step after gun registration is confiscation...just look to NYC, Connecticut, California, Australia, Canada, Nazi Germany, etc etc etc. History has proven this to be a fact.

We have a democratic super majority here in Oregon now mainly due to out of state $$ being pumped into the last election mostly from Bloomberg and other rabid anti gun groups. So I am afraid this bill is already passed in essence.

We are already getting the ball rolling on recall efforts. This is the only way to fight what is happening here. Wish us luck! Please check out northwestfirearms.com for more info on that!

Here is a video of today's hearing. Most of the anti's arguments centered around family members who were killed by a STOLEN firearm (the clackamas town center mall shooting in 2012). This bill will not keep this type of stuff from happening in the future. Bad people will do bad things and they will NOT follow laws. If we could make every gun in America magically disappear, bad people will just use a hammer, bat, machete, car, or who knows what other ordinary item to do bad things. We will just have one less way to protect ourselves and those we love from them.

I give props to the Sheriff who testified. Also to Kim Thatcher who was on the panel and was the only voice of reason up there until basically being told to shut up by Prozanski. This is not how government is supposed to work.

This is your gun!

Up for sale is my Sig Sp2022 40cal Nitron finish with Night Sights and a number of extras.  If you have never felt one you have to pick this up!  I own a number of Sigs and this polymer framed pistol feels almost identical to my 226's.  If you are unfamiliar with these guns I have included a link to The Sig Sauer website where all specs can be found.  

This gun has many extras:
Only downfall with these guns is the fact they only came with one mag (other sig mags dont work, only sigpro .40cal) and for any range/tactical classes that can be a negative but no worries....I have added number of mags so that is an issue no more!  Comes with box and papers.  

Extras:
3 (for 4 total) 12 round sig magazines (40$ per mag)
Sig paddle holster ($20)
Double magazine pouch ($25)

This gun is in great shape.  Kept in the safe except for range time. Night sights have plenty of shine left so no need to change.
$150 in extras 

$550 for the entire package.  FTF deals in the greater Charleston Area preferably.
Will respond to emails and can provide phone number for serious inquires.  I also have a few more photos I can send if you want more.  Not opposed to trades but prefer a cash sale.
