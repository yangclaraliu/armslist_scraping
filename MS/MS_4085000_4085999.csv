The agent told me this was one of only three he saw come in with a gold bead front sight and plain black Novak rear sight. The pistol comes in the original #s matching box that states it was shipped to the FBI Academy and then returned to S&W. Also comes with 17 magazines which only two look like they have been used. The rest look like new. Also comes with 17 original S&W magazine springs. The straight grip is on the gun now but it also comes with the FBI palm swell, curved, and a prototype that S&W was working on at the time. One box of Federal XM100A which was the load Federal was experimenting with for the 10mm. The rarest box is Winchester Western 10mm subsonic marked sample ""C"" restricted sales only to law enforcement agencies. I talked to Winchester and the gentleman told me they were trying to compete with Federal to devlope the load for the FBI and there were very few of these loads ever made. They finally went with the Federal Classic 180 grain HISHOCK. There are six full boxes that come with the gun as well. The pistol looks like new and he told me he had only run 4 mags thru it since the buy back. You want find a nicer more complete FBI gun ever. PISTOL IS FOR TRADE ONLY AND ONLY FOR ITEMS LISTED BELOW!

I bought it new and it was one of the first year or two these were made (late 90's).  I've put about 100 rounds down the tube through the years, mostly just to ensure my scope was still sighted in on annual basis.  I've taken it on about 3 hunts and it's a perfect woods gun.  The JM guns like mine were made by Marling before they were purchased by Remington and some consider them of higher quality compared with those  being offered today.  I can't say if that's true, but they do command a premium.

I've had this since new - probably 17 years or so and it is in great shape.  There are a few minor marks here and there, but nothing that detracts from the appearance.  It's been kept in a warmed safe since new.  

I looked at gunbroker and like rifles have SOLD at prices making this offering very fair with no extras.  I'm offering:
The rifle in great shape with all original equipment plus
I have RCBS dies and shell holder ($50)
A Leupold (I believe) base and ring set ($80)

California supreme court has upheld a ruling that all new handguns sold in the state must microstamp the gun make, model, and serial number on the cartridges. LOL, this technology doesn't exist! so they have effectively banned all new sales of handguns. apparently D.C. has passed this same law and it goes into effect next year. this is a blatant violation of our second amendment rights and if you don't think it effects us here in ky think again. last year Ky passed several new firearms laws that restricted gun ownership in Ky. Remember when we could just make ourselves a gun here and didnt need to serial it or register it? well guess what? that law has been changed and now you are supposed to. remember when ky law said any firearm manufactured in the state of Ky was exempt from federal law? well, guess what? that law was changed. yep, even here their liberal agenda is edging ever closer. the pen is mightier than the sword, FIGHT VIA YOUR COMPUTER AND WRITE TO YOUR SENATOR TO MAKE SURE THESE LAWS DO NOT COME TO KY"

The 91/30 is in decent shape the stock has some scratches and the finish is coming off in some spot but the action and internals are very clean. The person I got it from has had in in a safe for 15 years and never fired it and he got it from his uncle who did pretty much the same thing. I have test fired this weapon. The rifling is in great shape. It is a 1942 C.A.I. Georgia VT 91/30 model. Nothing special but all numbers do match. I believe I have the bayonet and cleaning kit as well but I am not sure where it is because I just moved. As for the Marlin it is a Model 60 22LR tube feed 14 rounds a mid 1980s model has the 22 inch barrel. I have only fired this gun a few times and when I first got it I wasn't sure if it had been fired at all. There was no residue on the inside only dust and there was no signs that it had ever been taken apart. The internals and action are in great shape. The stock is also in great shape I would say 90% it still has the original test fired by sticker on it. The barrel and tube however have some light surface rust on them. It is only cosmetic but still takes away from the great shape the rest of the rifle is in. They can be replaced (they are both pretty cheap) or redone if one desires or left the way it is and just plink away with it. It has a cheap Tasco 4x15 scope on it as well.
The Taurus is a PT22 that I am calling a parts gun it has been taken apart but all the pieces are there. I don't have the time or care enough about it to put it back together. I have too many other projects going on. I am looking to trade all three or both rifles for a different rimfire rifle that I can start a build with. Can be semi auto or bolt action. Prefer stainless. I'm putting a trade value on all three at $275 that's $140 for the 91/30, 75$ for the Marlin and 60$ for the Taurus PT22. I can add cash for the right trade as well. Not looking for any tactical 22s. Stainless is a plus so is semi-auto. 10/22, Bolt actions in 22LR 22MAG or 22WSM no .17s."

A key design feature for the IOTV is that the entire armor system is able to be released with the pull of a hidden lanyard.

The MS4 maintains material construction and specifications identical to that of the standard MS3, but features two heavy-duty push-button QD sling swivels rather than the Magpul Paraclip aling with a steel D-Ring to allow one to two-point convertibility. This modification allows compatibility with QD sling cups commonly found on lower receivers, receiver end plates, buttstocks, and many low-profile forward QD Sling mounts, including the Magpul RSA-QD. The MS3 Dual QD GEN 2 incorporates a new low profile quick-adjust Slider which minimizes bulk and allows for secure, yet effortless, sling adjustment. Webbing length has also been increased for a comfortable fit with all body types and armor configurations. Made in U.S.A. and 100% Berry Amendment compliant
Specifications:
•	Heavy-duty push-button QD sling swivels for both one and two-point attachment
•	Durable, precision-cast steel QD D-Ring allows for quick transition from one to two-point mode and is finished with Melonite for extreme resistance to wear and corrosion
•	Custom 1.25 inch wide nylon webbing material is strong and wear resistant while remaining anti-chaff for user comfort
•	Low-profile adjustment Slider for adding or removing sling tension in two-point mode with a single-hand
•	Colored webbing has Near Infrared (NIR) treatment to reduce IR signature
Sling Mounting: REAR/FRONT - Compatible with buttstocks, end plates, receivers, and hand guards that have a QD socket as well as the Magpul ASAP-QD, RSA-QD, MSA-QD, and shotgun Forward Sling Mounts.

The packaged Magpul Sling is what you are bidding on.  I had another sling that was out of its package that I used for the pictures.  

I prefer a cash-only FTF in the Highlands Ranch area but I am willing to ship. No trades. Please include a phone# with your email if you are a serious buyer.

I will also ship this for anyone seeing this ad out-of-state (or anywhere not close enough for a FTF). The buyer will pay for shipping and handling.  I will take PayPal, money orders or personal checks as payment. If using a check I will deposit it first to make sure it clears and then I will send the item."

The ""Taurus Judge"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 3"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law."

This is why the cases will appear to be discolored. This is done on purpose in order to meet the military requirement for overall strength and durability of the finished round."

I'm wanting to sell my Center Point scope. It's very nice. It has green and red illuminated reticle and provides an incredibly clear picture. I had it on a rifle that I have since sold.

I'm interested in trading the scope, plus some .22 LR ammunition for an stripped AR upper, or other AR Parts.  I AM NOT WANTING TO SELL THE 22 AMMO SEPARATELY.

So, to restate, I am wanting to SELL this scope alone, or TRADE with .22 LR for a Stripped AR Upper Receiver or other AR Parts.

The Mossberg 590 is the most accurate, reliable and durable shotgun money can buy. The evident choice for law enforcement, US Navy, Marines, FBI and Special Forces. These people don't make mistakes when choosing their weapons.  It is as dependable as the sunrise, and as simple as an anvil. It has served our armed forces well from city streets to swamplands and deserts and still does so in many places around the world. Easy to use, easy to maintain, extremely dependable in any climate or weather conditions.

If is also the most make-sense choice for a home defense weapon.  There is no other sound that will more convincingly persuade an intruder to give up on his intentions than the homeowner pumping this shotgun to chamber the first round.

The U.S. Armed Services established Mil-Spec 3443E in a brutal and unforgiving torture test with 3,000 rounds of full power 12 gauge buckshot. Only one pump action shotgun was able to pass this test. The Mossberg 590. Today the Mossberg 590 Series is recognized as state-of-the-art when it comes to heavy-duty police/military slide action shotguns. It is engineered to the exacting standards of the National Institute of Justice. Standard features include dual action bars, corrosion resistant parkerized finish, ambidextrous tang safety and ""swab straight through"" magazine tube.

I have the top rail off but all that stuff would obviously come with the gun.  Oculus is Bass Pros optics brand but it's surprisingly great quality.

I'd put the trade value of the whole package around 900, and am only interested in trades for other bolt guns, equally valuable handguns, or AR setups.  Let me know what you've got.  No cash- I'm not in any kind of hurry to get rid of this rifle."

Hi guys, selling my beautiful flat dark earth g23 .40 with all factory mags backstrap cleaning rod manuals magazine loaders etc. Gun is In absolutely mint condition better than new w a ghost 3.5lb light and crisp as frozen celery stick trigger, all internals are polished, oem 6.1 rear sight (and original) so it shoots from POA to POI from 7-60yards. Trigger guard is undercut so you can get higher up I the gun and it won't give you the ""glock knuckle"" on your middle finger when shooting and is much more comfortable for everyone w small or large hands.
I also have 200rds of armscore 180gr, 100rds of tul 180gr which shoots great for 12$ a box!!!! And I have a full box of Atomic 180gr 1100fps match hollow points that have virtually identicle ballistics w a 10mm. The gun runs perfect with all these Ammos and shoots fantastic at out to 125yards! (I have a range on my property I shoot almost every day)

Shoots very gentle. I swear, if you are thinking of tossing those little pellets (9mm) because of recoil and follow ups, this thing has LESS snap and flip than my G4 g19 did will very easily double and triple tap as fast as anything. Yet give you a heck of a lot bigger hole. 40cal ammo is only 1-2$ a box more expensive than 9mm for the cheap practice ammo as well as the high quality +p defense ammo such as the Atomics I might include.

pricing:
-gun as shown with everything but no ammo $540
-with the 300rds of ammo plus 50rds of defense ammo $590

This was my 5th Glock and they are great guns, like I say in my other adds for stuff I'm selling, im only selling because I have Gun-ADHD. 

Feel free to shoot me a text to talk about it! NO CRiMINALS or stupid lowballers, this is a RARE color FDE glock w a trigger job and frame job that was babies by a glock-a-holic!!!

Sorry for terrible lighting in pics, gun is much darker in person and looks really cool for a carry gun because if someone sees a chocolate brown thing in your pocket they won't automatically assume it's a gun. Plus, how many of hear have you seen at the range! Everyone asked to see it and when the hold the frame they say wow, feels like a much less blocky gun and more natural"

Because of the flammability of terpene, fatwood is prized for use as kindling in starting fires. It lights quickly even when wet, is very wind resistant, and burns hot enough to light larger pieces of wood. A small piece of fatwood can be used many times to create tinder by shaving small curls and using them to light other larger tinder. In Louisiana ""fatwood"" is known as ""rich lighter"" and cut slivers are what is referred to as ""kindling"" because of the abundance.

Specific feedback from law enforcement officers, hunters, boaters, and engineers led to the development of the Seek Thermal XR. The extended range of the Seek XR sees objects twice as far away with the same clarity and resolution as the original Seek camera, and can focus on objects as near as 8 inches for precise, close-up macro imaging.

The Seek XR allows you to literally see heat, making it possible to spot people and animals in daylight, total darkness, or in obscured visibility conditions. This true thermal imaging camera uses the data from over 32,000 thermal pixels to create a visible image on your smartphone. Prior to the Seek Thermal camera, this type of resolution was only available in cameras costing $3,000 and above.

A few common ways to use the Seek XR:
Hunting: Scout terrain, track game, and follow bloodtrails
Boating: Detect and locate harmful objects on the water at night
Safety and Security: Scan a dark parking lot or around your home for danger
Home Inspection: Reliable, non-contact testing and thermography
Electrical Engineering: Inspect components, circuit boards and assemblies.

Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference."

Got this from a great guy who had it tucked away. I cleaned up the gummy bolt and the gun shoots flawlessly.  Bore is not bright or dark. Its somewhere in the middle and has great rifling. Stock has great patina and all the scratches and dings were clearly aged right into the rifle. Its a numbers matching 1933 with the popsicle stick nose cap. more info and pictures just message me.

#2 is a 1930 mosin nagant 91/30.
it has a reproduction pu setup and turned down bolt handle. Stocks been refinished, has a but pad and the hand gard is a bit off. 3/4 inch short with brass fittings And a bayonet. Ill tell you what though, we got that scope hitting home every shoot at a 100 yards. Hitting the neck of my ar500 steel target every shoot.

Trigger guard is undercut so you can get higher up I the gun and it won't give you the ""glock knuckle"" on your middle finger when shooting and is much more comfortable for everyone w small or large hands.
I also have 200rds of armscore 180gr, 100rds of tul 180gr which shoots great for 12$ a box!!!! And I have a full box of Atomic 180gr 1100fps match hollow points that have virtually identicle ballistics w a 10mm. The gun runs perfect with all these Ammos and shoots fantastic at out to 125yards! (I have a range on my property I shoot almost every day)

Shoots very gentle. I swear, if you are thinking of tossing those little pellets (9mm) because of recoil and follow ups, this thing has LESS snap and flip than my G4 g19 did will very easily double and triple tap as fast as anything. Yet give you a heck of a lot bigger hole. 40cal ammo is only 1-2$ a box more expensive than 9mm for the cheap practice ammo as well as the high quality +p defense ammo such as the Atomics I might include.

Enjoy these delicious treats anytime anywhere with this single serving Mountain House™ freeze-dried food pouch. Don't forget to treat yourself even during difficult times!   Mountain House™ freeze-dried foods are stellar when it comes quality and taste. Freeze-Dried foods offer many advantages over dehydrated foods. To begin with they taste much better because through the freeze-drying process the foods retain their taste, texture, and shape of fresh frozen foods. In addition, freeze-drying locks in the freshness, vitamins, nutrients, color, and aroma of fresh frozen foods while providing the shelf-stable convenience of canned and dehydrated foods.   All the contents of a Mountain House pouch are freeze dried to allow for a 10 year shelf life. Mountain House has also tested the pouches 30 years after the manufacture date and they were still safe and good to eat.All of our products are brand new and are in the original packaging.PayPal: For PayPal transactions please send us your PayPal email address and we will send you an invoice for the products you would like to purchase.

For sale is my Kidd Supergrade complete rifle built by Tony Kidd (scope extra) back when they still did custom orders. I ordered it in July 2011 and it was delivered in February of 2012. If you are not familiar with Tony's work check out www.coolguyguns.com.

This rifle has seen exactly 1,450 problem-free rounds; 1,000 Wolf Match Target and 450 Eley Target (it will come with the other 50 rounds from the brick of Eley Target). 

I have shot a 0.13” three shot group at 50 yards with Wolf MT, but the rifle is capable of better (I am not as steady as I used to be). This rifle is in excellent condition and has been very well taken care of. Build specs are below:

The scope base is 0 MOA, but the scope has sufficient internal adjustment to shoot to 100 yards and still has adjustment left. Scope comes with a transferable lifetime warranty. This is a fantastic scope with accurate and repeatable adjustments and very solid zero.
