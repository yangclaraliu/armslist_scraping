Ruger, Model 77, 338 Win Mag, Stainless Steel, Green/Grey Laminated Stock. LC Trigger. Flawless.
These rifle were produced in a limited number. I purchased this rifle New In Box and it has never been fired. No dents or scratches . . . NIB in very way. 
24"" Bbl, Original SS Scope Rings, box and paper work. LC (Light & Crisp) trigger is outstanding and is Ruger's very best. I rate this edition as one of Ruger's all time best rifles. The green/gray/black laminate stock has the checkering found only on those limited rifles.
This rifle configuration will completely withstand adverse weather conditions and never fail you with its stainless steel, laminated stock and robust controlled round feed action.
I also have a matching 300 Win Mag in this same rifle (not Consecutive serial number) listed. 
These rifles are no longer available and you would be hard pressed to ever find them ""New In Box"" again. Shipping: $35.00 ... prefer face to face sale. All ATF rules apply.

These rifles, also known as a Romak-3, SSG-97, and PSL, are extremely accurate and reliable. The Dragunov design has been in use since the mid 60's, and is still the 
official design of Russia and other Com-bloc countries. This is the Romanian version, which improved on the Russian design as far as reliability goes. This is a great weapon for several reasons. First, it uses the same type of action that an AK-47 uses, which makes it drag-through-the-mud reliable. Second, it's semi-automatic, which means if you miss with the first shot, you have an immediate chance to make up for it. Third, it uses a very powerful 7.62x54R caliber bullet, which is a monster round. The large size of the round and the long barrel of the rifle combine to allow shooting out to 1000yds. These features make the perfect long-range weapon for any situation. This rifle comes complete with scope (very cool, built in range-finder reticle which was originally lit with radioactive Tritium), cleaning kit, broken-shell extractor, small spare parts, cleaning rod, oil bottle, leather sling, owner's manual provided by importer, and a hardcase."

The M&P is in good shape, and will come with all of the factory stuff, box, backstraps, and three factory 17 round magazines. Also has bright factory night sights and a trigger job.

Mainly looking for a similarly equipped Glock 19 (maybe 17), Walther PPQ, Beretta 92fs, Springfield XDm or maybe XD, maybe other quality 9mm's.  Not really looking for .40's but I MIGHT consider a similarly equipped Glock 23 or 22. No Kel Tecs or Taurus please.

Would also consider some rifles in trade.  Would be interested in a entry level AR15 like an M&P sport and I don't mind ones with polymer lowers.  I also like pistol caliber carbines and would like a Kel Tec Sub2000 that takes Glock mags or a Hi Point carbine plus some cash or similar.  Would like a Mossberg MVP patrol in 556 or 308, maybe a lever action in 357.  Not interested in hunting rifles or .22's.

It only has about 200 rounds through it and has many upgrades:
-Timney 3lb competition trigger (very smooth and made my groups very small)- worth $230
-Nikon monarch 4-16x scope specifically calibrated to the .223 / 5.56 round and Leupold single piece mount - worth $600
-Bipod - $45
-Foregrip - $25
- Laser/light combo - $70
- Quad rail - $45
- Magpul adjustable stock - $45
- rubber pistol grip - $15
- Aftermarket sling and sling mounts -$50
-Also, rifle comes with nice a blackhawk soft carry case and 2 30 round magazines.
As you can see, there is over $1100 dollars worth of upgrades on this rifle. Also, this model of AR-15 is not the crappy ""sport"" model offered by S&W. This is a step above that with a better barrel, dust cover and bolt carrier group. It was $1060 brand new. I'm also going to throw in 800 rounds of ammo for free, which is worth an additional $300. So, you're getting almost $2600 dollars worth of stuff for $1300. No trades please.
I would be willing to sell the scope and rifle separately, I would take 1000 for the rifle and I'll still throw in the free ammo. The price is negotiable, Please feel free to call or text anytime, day or night: REDACTED"

Minuteman/2nd Amendment, Molon Labe/Come and Take It, Walking Lady Liberty, USA Eagle, Gadsden Flag 'Don't Tread on Me', USMC, Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard.

These are 1 oz, .999 Pure Copper, Bright and Shiny.  They will remain bright/shiny if kept in their protective sleeves.  I carry mine so they have a great looking patina to them.  Great conversation starters as well.

Step 1.
Take a look at our product line of the finest, fastest and easiest weapons cleaning products available today.

'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' utilize 2015 technologies and materials.  All are  AMERICAN MADE, from raw material to the finished product and developed and produced right here in the USA. 
(As a Disabled Veteran, I am glad to see a company that is American Owned, Veteran Owned/Veteran Run.)

Our product line was designed to be vastly improved (2015 technology vs. 1995 technology) over our competitors products or anything previously available.

Our primary product is a hand sewn, Kevlar 'sleeve'. This sleeve encases a sturdy, non-absorbent and nonporous foam element. The foam inner element of our product is slightly over sized thereby allowing it to exert uniform, 360 degree, pressure within the barrel of the weapon.

In a rifled barrel the foam inner element acts to push the Kevlar and cleaner solution into the rifling. Pressing the Kevlar into the rifling, allows it to 'cut into' and remove burnt powder, spent nitrates and the fouling associated with our sport.

'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' contains NO METAL BRUSHES, BRISTLES OR EXPOSED METAL.  Because our 'Bore Scrubbers' were designed to be ‘reversed’, while still inside the barrel, the cleaning motion effectively ""scrubs"" the barrel bore.

This simple action greatly aids, and speeds, the cleaning process, without damaging the weapon or the product itself. We do not recommend you try this with any competitor product, you may damage the weapon, you WILL destroy their product.

In smooth bore (shotgun) barrels the 'carrier' liquid also acts upon the tiny bits and pieces of melted plastic, softening the remnants of the wadding and plastic shell cases associated with shotgun shooting. At the same time, the Kevlar and cleaner solution work in unison to remove carbon, burnt nitrates and powder residues.

Users are able to very quickly clean, and protect, valuable firearms from corrosion, rust and internal damage by utilizing our 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' and combining our proprietary blend of cleaner, lubricant and protectant, the ‘Dragon Tail Bore Cleaner’.

Metal parts, brushes and bristles of our competitors, or the pieces of a traditional cleaning rod, are very prone to damaging the internals of a barrel by adding needless scratches and ‘micro-abrasions’. These damaging ‘micro-abrasions’ may greatly effect accuracy and consistency during shooting. Also, accidentally dragging or dropping our competitor or a traditional rod onto a weapon may result in damage to the finish or bluing. That scenario is completely impossible with our product.

As well as the foam core, the Kevlar is also nonabsorbent and serves to 'wick' the cleaning solution along the working length of the 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubber'. In doing so it greatly reduces the amount of cleaning product needed and helps prevent waste. This allows our product to be more cost effective for users.

'Dragon Tail Bore Cleaner' is our proprietary cleaner using a liquid base serving as the 'carrier' for the actual cleaning product (detergents) and lubricant/protectant. The 'carrier' evaporates very quickly and leaves behind a protective, moisture repellant allowing for long term storage without the need for additional oil patches in the barrel or a second protective product to be applied.

Because 'Dragon Tail' products utilize 2015 Technologies taken from the Aerospace, Aircraft, Automotive Engineering as well as Weapons/Arms/Armor industries, when used properly, a weapon cleaned with 'Dragon Tail' products may be immediately stored for several years, then reloaded and fired, without fear of damage.

By using modern technology we absolutely destroy the 'generations old' methods of our competitors’ products.  Additionally, our products do not have a 'build up' (either sticky or gooey, or hardened and flakey) that may be observed after use of our competitors products.  Remember, our products utilize modern, scientific, Aerospace and Weapons Manufacturing industry materials, elements and technologies.  An added accidental bonus comes in the form of the anti-fingerprint property of our protective finish.

'Dragon Tail Bore Cleaner' may be used over the entire weapon. It will not harm the finish, stocks, grips or synthetics of modern firearms. The same long lasting, moisture repelling properties are then transferred to the exterior of a weapon and allow a single product to thoroughly clean and protect virtually all or your firearm collection possessions.

* Care should be exercised in the cleaning of wooden, varnished portions of “high value” weapons (for instance a $35,000 Merkel Shotgun) as the varnished finish may be susceptible to damage without proper care. The metal interior and exterior surfaces, however, will only benefit from maintenance and cleaning using our products.


Step 2.
Decide which of our product(s) would best benefit you or which you would get the greatest use from.

Our Bore Scrubbers, unlike our competitors, may often be used for many, many different calibers or weapons rather than just a single caliber.

For example, I have cleaned my .45 ACP pistol then used the same Bore Scrubber to clean my 9mm without damage to the weapon or the Bore Scrubber...  I then decided to demonstrate to a client that I was able to do the same thing with my 12 Ga Bore Scrubber and used it to clean a 16 Ga shotgun.  Although this is NOT recommended and did take a bit of pulling to clear the 9mm and 16 Ga barrels both the 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' performed flawlessly, without damage to themselves or the weapons in question.
(Don't try that with our competitors products... metal bristled Bore Snakes, Hoppes Brushes, or Otis cleaners.  You will destroy their product, and very possibly, damage your weapon.)

Sig Sauer MK25 9mm NRA Edition one of a kind!

The SIG SAUER® P226®, writes the factory, is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs. Photo specimen is one of only a few released to the NRA Foundation and sold exclusively through Friends of NRA fundraisers in 2013 only. It comes in a special Pelican hard case with fired brass case, instruction manual, factory papers and lock. Box bears the Friends of NRA Logo. Medallion included commemorates the Navy SEALs Foundation, and Sig has donated to that foundation with each pistol produced. This edition has UID labels on components. Manufacturer is Sig Sauer Inc. of Exeter, NH. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and parts in Nitron® finish, with Black hard anodized finish alloy frame. Specs on the 226 are what S&W calls traditional double action, 10 pound vicinity double action trigger pull from the decocked position on the first shot, then single action 4 pound vicinity on subsequent shots during the firing session. The Sig 226, of course, does not have a manually operated safety. It has a decocker lever to put the car in park. Sig has a firing pin block safety that prevents accidental discharge if the pistol is dropped, yet even with that, Sigs have the best single action trigger pull of all from the factory. Weight empty is 34 ounces; finish is black; barrel is 4.40 inch chrome lined; and it has the conventional white bar rear and white dot front sights. Accessory or light rail is incorporated with the frame. Sights are MH3 Siglite luminous Night Sights, made for Sig by Mepro. These are always point of aim from the factory. Overall length is 7.7 inches from the muzzle to the grip frame strut, height 5.5 inches, overall width 1.5 inches; sight radius 6.3 inches. This 226 MK25 comes with a total of three each fifteen round magazines, steel floorplate with matte anti-friction steel bodies, made for Sig by Mec-Gar in Italy. This specimen was never out of NRA custody until we got it. It has never been fired or loaded."

Model 1894 CS  serial number 0507XXXX Owned by a retired Border Patrol agent rarely fired! This rifle needs a new stock the old one has been repaired but the stock is not mint.  I had rifles out of the safe one day and this rifle was standing in a fast position with the barrel down and fell on the carpet which cracked the stock.  The rest of the rifle is in supreme condition so I am doing a reduced price because of the stock. I know what the rifle is worth and I am asking a fair market value based on the rifle needing a new stock.  New stock is around $100  The rifle shoots and operates absolutely flawless. the stock that's on it has a buffer piece added for recoil but it does need a new stock.  It has a holographic site with rail mount attachment which I bought new just a few months back $100 value.  We will do $550 cash NO TRADES.  You have to dial 1-REDACTED  call or text.  Thanks

The block is easy to remove for cleaning or for securing the rifle against unauthorized use. Safe, Fast Operation The K 95 is always carried uncocked, making your hunting experience as care-free as possible. The safety slide cocks the rifle smoothly and silently immediately before the shot. If you decide not to shoot you take the safety slide back noiselessly and uncock the rifle. Reloading is just as easy and silent. Fine Single-Stage Trigger The K 95 trigger enables you to fire each shot in a controlled, concentrated way. Such precision and reliability is reassuring in every possible hunting situation.

The gun is a rarity. It was imported by TGI but IS a Romanian built gun. It is NOT a parts gun. It has all matching serial numbers with the exception of the magazines and optic. I installed a recoil buffer in the rifle to reduce wear and tear on the rear trunion. I have only run light ball ammo through it and its had approximately 350 rounds through it. Not quite a full cans worth. I have two magazines for it. This gun is picky on magazines. Some magazines run flawless and some have issues. The finish is nice but not perfect (its an AK variant). Rifle is accurate. This rifle is very accurate and you can get consistent groups with this.

Rifle will come with 2 magazines, sling, PSO optic, crappy but serviceable hard case, and around 100 rounds of ammo.

If you have any questions about this rifle, would like to see pictures, or are interested in trading then shoot me an email. Im not interested in selling it or trading for anything other than a RFB but I will happily give advice to anyone in the market for one of these."
