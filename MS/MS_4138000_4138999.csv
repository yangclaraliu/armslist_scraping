I also will include two extra mags, one 9 round and one 7 round. Must have NJ FID card & purchase permit.
From checking around, it appears the pistol is in short supply. With the extras I believe this is a good deal. If you live in NJ, we can do a face-to-face which saves you transfer, NICS and sales tax. Out-of-state I'll ship to your FFL at your cost.

It does not appear to have many rounds fired through it.

Since I have acquired it, I have added a Vicker's Tactical extended magazine release and brand new Trijicon night sights. 

This handgun will come with one factory Glock 13 round magazine. I do not have the cased for this one.

I am asking $525 with the night sights or $475 without the night sights (can give the buyer the stock plastic sights if they want them but they will not come installed) as I know sights are really user preference. I am not really looking for any trades at this time. Please use the sites email function if interested. Also, please be patient in regards to waiting for replies as I work 12 hour shifts and don't check my personal email at work.

I've cleaned/oiled the gun regularly and never had any problems with it; I just don't really like the Olive Drab color and would rather have a Gen 4 Glock in Black/FDE.

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry.The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.Reliability: The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN. CZ 75 P-01 Compact 9mm Handgun link to deguns.net"

Tritium night sights. 5 magazines with pearce extensions. chrome pin kit, tungsten low recoil guide rod. hand sanded trigger bar, has the ghost 3.5 pound rocket trigger connector. and probably a lot more that I cant remember.

put 250 rounds through it today and Blazer brand ammunition functioned great, the slide stayed open as if it were empty on 2 occasions when there was still ammo in the magazine. 
I also tried Winchester white box and the gun did not want to eject the Winchester rounds. (4 times in about 80 rounds)

This gun cosmetically is flawless however tends to pick the ammo it wants.
on top of the original price of the gun there is well over $1,000.00 into upgrades alone into it."

The Ruger® SR9c® Compact Semi-Auto Pistol provides shooters with a low-maintenance, rugged, and reliable concealed carry handgun. The matte SR9c has an alloy steel slide, finished in a hardwearing, non-reflective black nitrate finish that won't give the gun's position away in bright sun light or under artificial lights; front and rear serrations provide a positive grip when loading or unloading the pistol. To ensure reliable operation with a shorter barrel and slide, the SR9c (Compact) uses a dual captured recoil spring and guide rod. With its lightweight, slim design, the SR9c semi-automatic pistol is comfortable for concealed carry all day, with most any type of clothing. Its ergonomic grip has an easily reversible backstrap that allows shooters the choice of a curved or straight backstrap. The SR9c features a structurally rigid, glass-filled nylon grip frame that reduces recoil and enhances handgun control, and the front of the frame has a built-in Picatinny rail for modern handgun accessories. The high-visibility 3-Dot sight system provides quick and easy target acquisition, with adjustment for elevation and windage. A loaded chamber indicator can be seen or felt, providing confirmation of a loaded or empty chamber. The Ruger SR9c Compact Semi-Auto Pistol has an ambidextrous manual safety and magazine release that are easily reached and actuated during stressful situations. Comes with one 10-round, flush-fitting magazine, and one 17-round magazine with a grip extension.  Made in USA."

I will pay a fair and reasonable price, and I am willing to drive anywhere in Oklahoma and the surrounding states. I have been searching for one of these for 4 years and am yet to find one! Thanks and if you know who is the butt-hurt loser is that posted the armslist ad calling me a scam artist that would ""screw his mother for a profit"" please disregard his pathetic attempt to slander my name. He made me a ridiculous offer for a gorgeous beretta that I refused. So have a great day!"

It was built between April and June of 1944 based on the serial number. The barrel has two grooves and has a bright bore with sharp rifling. There is a lot of life left in it based on the bullet in the barrel picture below. The finish is in good shape, but shows aging. I tried to get a good pic of the right side of the receiver where there is a dark spot beside the Savage markings. No import marks. The stock is Beech, has not been sanded, and has strong stock cartouches. Numbers do not match on bolt or magazine but are serialized to other Savage Enfields. I have shot it, shoots good, headspace is also good. Any questions feel free to ask, or if you would like more pictures I can send more"

It is set up as an XM177 clone.  For those who don’t know what that is, it is a 11 inch barrel with an attached 5 inch flash hider.  This particular one looks pretty slick as you can see in the pics.  I got this used several years ago and have put about 300 through it with no issues.  It is one sweet shooter.  It comes with a quad rail and folding foregrip.  I also currently have a Magpul CTR stock on it.  It also has a Geissele ALG Advanced Combat Trigger (which is mighty slick by the way) installed.  I am willing to leave the trigger in but the cost will go up or I can replace it with the standard mil-spec trigger that came with it, its your choice.  The upper and lower are both Stag Arms, note the mil-spec Omega marking on the upper receiver in the pic.  Stag did at one time make an 11 inch barrel but I cannot find their proof stamp on this particular one so I am not 100% sure that this is a Stag barrel.   
I am selling to fund another project of mine.  I am asking 595 or the best offer I get.  It is one sweet shooter.

For sale today is a Hi-Point .45 ACP handgun with two 7-round magazines.  This appears to be the first-generation version, which uses a European style magazine release, does not have the proprietary accessory rail, and has a 7+1 capacity.  This version also does not seem to have a magazine-drop safety or a last-round hold open.

Hi-Point's 45 ACP pistol is a semi-automatic striker-fired blowback-operated pistol.

It appears to function well and cycle consistently from condition 1, though carrying it in condition 1 is a topic of debate anyway.  (-:

This gun shows some wear, but it's sighted in and works fine.  It has a rubber wrap for comfort.

All Hi-Point firearms include a best-in-the-industry lifetime warranty.

Trades and best-offers are welcome.  Let me know what you have.  Thanks for looking!"

For sale today is a beautiful Walther Colt 1911 .22 Government Model Rail Gun.  This piece is in practically like-new condition!  It includes one steel magazine, the original case, manuals, tools, and loader.  Also included is a few hundred rounds of .22 LR ammo.

Colt licensed the design to Walther, who built this gun using actual 1911 parts, allowing some customization.  It uses a blowback action for increased accuracy.  It has a rail and a complete 1911 action and safety.  The grip panels are rubber for comfort and are rather attractive.

This would make a nice piece to add to your collection, as a special gift, or for 1911-style training.

Ruger 10/22 Design Contest Rifle (LNIB)

After trying my first of this model 10/22 early last year, I went ahead and picked up another on an impulse. While I am keeping the first rifle, this one has only gone as far as my safe and is yet to be fired.

The sights are the best irons I have used on a 10/22 (not click-adjustable, like the Tech-Sights, but much more crisp to my tired eyes) and the extended picatinny rail was great for a low-power scope of red dot. On top of that, you also get a threaded barrel, removable comb-piece, swivel studs, and stainless-steel barrel.

Henry Lever-Action 22lr Large Loop (model H001L)

I I hate to part with it, but this little guy needs to find a new home.

The H001L model combines the standard size stock of the H001 with the 16 1/4"" barrel of the youth model. The result is sheer plinking fun. I have added a DIP picatinny rail, which sits low enough to avoid interfering with the irons. The rifle has <500rds through it, as I have been reserving my .22lr for the kids lately.
