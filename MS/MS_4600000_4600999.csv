From the Airforce website:
The Condor is for shooters who need a rifle that is not only more powerful than a spring-piston air gun, but is also more powerful than any other pre-charged pneumatic rifle. It is the most powerful pre-charged air gun on the market as it easily achieves 1250 feet per second in .22 caliber. The Condor is light weight (6.5 lbs) and offers adjustable power (600-1300fps depending on power setting, caliber, and pellet weight). Dial the power down for target shooting at close ranges, or dial the power up for long range small game hunting.

An integral extended scope rail allows for easy mounting of lasers, bipods, and other accessories to provide the shooter with an adaptive air gun shooting system. Designed for air gun hunting in the growing number of states that allow hunting, this system can also be used by various military and law enforcement agencies for pest control or special tactical applications.

I test  fired  16 rounds (all my buddy had  of  garand  ammo)   of  pmc  garand  ammo  and shot  well. Hit  what  we  were aiming at  and  cycle   properly  and   ejected the clips

It  has  arlington  va  on the barrel  which means  it  was    brought  back to the  states  some  time   after  being  rebarreled  and  stocked with  53'  parts. Very  well could  have  seen  action in wwii  and then maybe  korea.  

It  has  a  total  of  47  en blok clips  
26  of   them  loaded (208 rounds total)  with  Austrian military  ammo (not  sure if  any good) also  has a Bandaleer and  aome  type  of military  clea in stuff and a m1 garand   book/manual of some sort

My  gunsmith told my to list  it on  gun broker  with  a  reserve at $1,250 as he  sold a  very similar  one  not  to long ago without the ammo and clips an sold for $1700.  I  dont think ill get 1700  bit  if  thr reserve  is  met   (and i think  it will be very easily ) od at least  be content.   .  Was offerd  $1500 cash   ao figured  why not.  But now  fell through so goin to list on gb    prob  tonight"

The 24/7 OSS combines more features than is offered by any other semiauto pistol on the market, and it has an entirely new trigger mechanism that completely eliminates two of the longest-standing problems with double-action and double-action-only pistol design. When you take up the slack in the new Taurus PT 24/7 OSS pistol trigger, you’ve got a first-shot pull that’s as short and quick as a standard single-action Government Model 1911. And for every following shot, the trigger returns to the same fast, short-pull position. No more long, mushy trigger pulls on the first shot then transitioning to a short pull on the second shot, as is the case with conventional double-action autoloaders.

Moreover, if the gun fails to fire, the 24/7 OSS mechanism automatically and instantly resets to a conventional double-action long-pull position and allows you to pull the trigger again–just like a double-action revolver–without needing to manually manipulate the slide. Essentially, it’s a single-action pistol that becomes a double action in an emergency.

I have thoroughly examined this little .410 and believe it to be the real deal...a near new, factory original, custom ordered Model 42. There is slight wear on the jeweled bolt and slide.  It carries the correct grip cap for its date, and the engraving is a version of 42-3 B or C, with a duck on the left side and a dog on the right side.  
The degree of polish on the metal, the perfection of the stampings, the clarity of the engraving are all indicative of the Pigeon Grade special order M42.  Rare in any condition, this is  one gorgeous Model 42 considering features and condition.

This is a remake of the 1950's Whitney Wolverine by Olympic. This gun is a blast to shoot. A very nice, natural pointing, retro-futuristic, Art Deco looking 10 round .22. I've had it for 3-4 years and shot it 2-3 times. Very low round count. $250 FIRM or trade. Includes original box / paperwork.

There are some marks on the barrel and cylinder as shown in the pics as well minor marks elsewhere. The gun actually looks better in person than in the pics. Locks up tight, no flame cutting, ejector is straight, and screws are minty. $400

It has the Yugo grenade launcher which is ported to also serve as a compensator as well as the Yugo night sights.  It has the Yugo recoil pad on the buttstock and the blade bayonet which is in excellent shape.  It holds ten rounds in its box magazine.  There are some signs of use including a small scratch on the receiver cover and some fading of the bluing here and there, but there's no rust or pitting.  The stock has some dings here and there, but there are no cracks.  It's overall condition is very good compared to most of the milsurp SKSs you see out there.  The serial numbers of the receiver, box magazine, and the bolt match.  The serial number of the stock does not match.  It does not have the toolkit in the stock, but it does have the cleaning rod.  It might not be the most collectible SKS, but it is definitely a shooter.  Yugo SKSs are known for being very well made at the Zastava factory with their milled receivers.  I can tell you it shoots better than all the Chinese SKSs I have ever owned.  The only reason I'm selling it is because I recently acquired another Yugo SKS in even better condition.  I'm also throwing in a handful of corrosive milsurp ammo and some stripper clips.

I will require that you sign a bill of sale acknowledging this. If you refuse to sign, then no sale. This will be a deal breaker with me."

The gun typically can be bought for around 1k, extra mags are about $45 and there's 4 of those, extra grips are ??, and the holsters were collectively around $200-$300.  So I'm figuring something short of $1500 worth of gear."

This is a used rifle/shotgun that my son has outgrown. The .223 rem. was hard to find and a great first deer rifle. This is what the Rossi online has about this. 

The Rossi Matched Pair has set the standard for 2-barrel guns. This combination long gun package is unequalled, having been recognized as the best top notch 'full-size' backpack take-along. They start with a popular single shot rifle, then hand fit a shotgun barrel to create the Matched Pair. The result is a highly reliable rifle with adjustable sights and a button rifled barrel for enhanced accuracy, which quickly swaps barrels to become your favorite shotgun. This makes the Matched Pair the perfect gun for hunting or a fun day at the range.

Just so you know, this gun has been modified by a craftsman gunsmith, not a guy with hacksaw.  I bought this gun as it is exactly now.  It’s one of the most beautiful 22 rifles I’ve owned.  I believe the barrel was 24” when it came out in 1972 but was cut down to 20” at some time.  However, as far as I know the 20’ barrel was the way it came from factory originally as custom upgrade.  The barrel crowning wasn’t cut by an amateur for sure – see pic.  The butt plate isn’t original but has a decent Remington plate.  I’m sure it can be made to look like original.  I don't know a lot more about this rifle, other than I had a gunsmith at Fine Guns in Bass Pro evaluate it and he said the custom work was done by a professional.  I’m planning on going to the gun show in Springfield this weekend to see if I can possibly find a better butt plate to fit.  Perhaps the previous owner wanted it customized a little shorter for a youngster to shoot, I don't know.  All I know is that it's a very nice 22 rifle that’s near excellent condition and possibly values at for a lot more than I'm asking.  I just need the cash right now for house projects.  If I don’t get what I thinks it is worth, no problem.  I really would like to hold on to it to give to one of grandchildren someday.  I’m firm on my price."
