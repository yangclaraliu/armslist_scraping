Serial number dates this rifle to 1948. 
This is the target model with micrometer rear (Lyman 58E) and globe front (Lyman 77) sights. Magazine holds 5 rounds.  5 and 10 round magazines are readily available.

The rifle is in very good condition, the bore is bright, shiny, and sharp. Bluing is slightly worn on the trigger guard and a small spot on the crown. The only other ""issue"" is one of the factory scope mount ""filler"" screws has the head broken off. Any competent gunsmith should be able to fix this easily (although a scope kind of defeats the purpose of the awesome sights).

The stock is perfect and finished with an old-school oil finish. Very handsome piece of wood.

This rifle shoots beautifully. With cci standard ammo at 50yd, 1/4 to 1/2 inch groups are easy with the match sights. Shoots best with standard velocity (subsonic) ammo.

This is not a ""youth"" rifle- this is a full size rifle with an adult size length of pull. The barrel is heavy profile and 28"", giving a 32"" sight radius. The trigger is very crisp.

Like all things Winchester, these rifles are becoming very collectible, and with the renewed availability of .22lr ammo, cheap fun!

I'm asking $550 or reasonable offer

Also included are two black (blued) Kimber magazines and one stainless Kimber magazine with a slam pad. I also have a pair of dark charcoal VZ Operator grips that fit this beautifully.

Both pistols approach the precision found on the Mark 23 by adding an extended threaded barrel with a rubber O-ring, adjustable trigger, and adjustable target-type sights. The .40 S&W Tactical models are built on the USP 9mm/40 caliber frame.Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.  All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.  The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.  Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.  The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes. Features & System Characteristics:      - Threaded O-ring barrel with polygonal bore profile (no O-ring barrel on 9 mm    variants)     - High profile target sights     - Match grade trigger (not present on 9 mm variant)     - Adjustable trigger stop (not present on 9 mm variant)     - Target sights with micrometer adjustment for windage and elevation     - One piece machined, nitro-carburized steel slide     - Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes     - Patented HK recoil reduction system     - Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish     - Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame     - Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves     - Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines     - Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories     - Ambidextrous magazine release lever     - Extended slide release     - Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator     - Patented Lock-Out Safety device"

I received this pistol on trade several months ago and have only put a few rds down range.  The privious owner had the stippling and under cut done.  I have no knowledge if it was preformed by a shop or a DIY job.  Either way, the frame is solid and I personally like the aggressive grip and look.  The privious owner also stated that some minor trigger work was preformed, not sure what however it is notably cleaner than my other standard glocks.  Round count is somewhere around 200, there is limited wear on the barrel and barrel hood. Paint on the mag base plates is Krylon & removable.

Cash price is $550. I may be interested in straight trades or trades with cash for handguns in 9mm or 357 mag [snubs only].   I'm located in Jacksonville, I would drive 45 mins in either direction to make a deal.  Thats about my limit. A bill of sale will be required.

I bought two of these and set them up identically. This one is mine, the other belonged to my wife and we traded it for a Sig 2022. I had 4 AR's though so I wanted to let a few go at a low price because the way things are going they might be banned in the near future. If you've been considering purchasing a Black Rifle then now is the time, and even if you don't buy mine I'd urge you to grab one now before either the rifle or the ammo becomes illegal or hard to get.

***This is a Gen 2 Omni Hybrid; The 1st Gen had issues and there aren't many reviews online about this model, but the problems of the previous model have been resolved in the new models and this rifle shoots and functions remarkably well***

 That being said, this weapon has under 50rds. through it and half of those were used to zero in the optic. The Sight-X optic has a new battery installed and 4 different reticles to choose from and those are visible in bright sunlight.  
The Magpul MOE handguard and MOE vertical grip are brand new and have never seen a trip to the range yet. The handguard comes with 2 rails installed.

Comes in the factory box with all paperwork and the stock handguards as well.

     Features:

*Metal-reinforced polymer lower receiver
*Inter-Lock hammer and trigger pin retainment system
*Built to military specifications (Mil-Spec)
*Enhanced trigger guard
*Beveled magazine well

 *This rifle DOES have the M4 feed ramps. I'm making this known because I know some folks mistakenly list their rifles as an ""M4"" when in fact they have the regular AR-15 ramps. 
 *The buffer tube is also Mil-Spec but is one of the rare versions with the slanted end, like on a commercial tube. 

 The rifle was $560 and I've got about $110 into the Magpul furniture and the optic, so I'm thinking that $450 is a pretty fair deal.
 For any other questions or info please feel free to email or call/text A.J. @REDACTED.

I bought this gun for pocket carry, as I found it to be the smallest semi-auto with the best profile for pocket carry. I no longer need to pocket carry, so I would like to sell it and get something bigger. I will give you a ""Pocket Rocket"" with the gun - the best purse/ pocket-carry holster I was able to find. You can carry in your jeans pocket and it makes it look like a wallet and doesn't come out during a draw.

With a choice of three frame colors (green, tan, or black), the full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components.  The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.  The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy.  Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger.  The HK45T can be converted to nine different kinds of trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) mode. The HK45T is well-suited for military, law enforcement, security use, and civilian sport shooting."

The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls.  Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.  The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.  Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.  Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.  An improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.  By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.  Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45 is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only).

The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls.  Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.  The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.  Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.  Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.  An improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.  By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.  Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45 is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull.  Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45 Series is a new paradigm for Heckler & Koch handgun design and is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Buy now: http://www.calibersusa.com/hk/hk-p30-9mm-v1-lem-dao-15rd-m730901a5-1830 A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.  Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.  The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.  P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger  A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.  Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.  During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.Features:      - Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame     - Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life     - Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes     - Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish     - Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves     - One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel     - Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories     - Ambidextrous magazine release lever     - Extended slide release     - Patented Lock-Out Safety device"

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.Features:      - Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame     - Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life     - Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes     - Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish     - Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves     - One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel     - Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories     - Ambidextrous magazine release lever     - Extended slide release     - Patented Lock-Out Safety device"

Comes with two 15-round magazines. S Model has ambidextrous safety.A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.  Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.  The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.  P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger  A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.  Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.  During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. Key Features:      - Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates     - MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories     - Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame     - Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life     - Multiple trigger firing modes available     - Patented HK recoil reduction system     - One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel     - Corrosion resistant “hostile environment” blued finish     - Ambidextrous slide levers and     - Ambidextrous magazine release magazine     - Patented lock-out safety device     - Bobbed hammer (LEM models)     - Spurred hammer (DA/SA models)     - Automatic hammer and firing pin safeties     - Ambidextrous safety levers (P30S model)"

Currently zero'd at 50 yds and holds nice tight groups. Just shot 350 rounds over the weekend with no issues.

NOTE: The other 715t's you see listed are the carry handle top, which does not have a rail on the top of the weapon, only the quad rail on the fore grip.  That makes it nearly impossible to add a scope. Yes, you can get an adapter for a top rail, but the scope will sit high above the handle ( which is not removable). And you are adding extra expense unnecessarily. 

This has both a top rail and the quad rail, the scope is included and sighted and it shoots fantastic.  Why screw with something to make it work when this one is already done and works great?"

This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter’s hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.A set of abbreviated “industry standard” mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines. Available in 9 mm, .40 S&W."

Buy new in box: http://www.calibersusa.com/hk/hk-p2000-v3-9mm-13rd-m709203a5-48312 This Heckler & Koch P2000SK V3 9mm pistol includes a 13 round magazine and features the law enforcement modification trigger system. This trigger system prevents unintended firing with a combination of a unique pre-cocked hammer system and a double action hammer.The first of the many recent additions to the Heckler & Koch handgun line, the P2000 and incorporate features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” model.  The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.  Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.  With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 – 8.5 pounds (27.5 – 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7N).  The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.  Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.  A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike.  Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines."

Control lever on left sideOriginally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.The modular design of the USP’s internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type oaf trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.Features:      - Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame     - Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life     - Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes     - Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish     - Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves     - One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel     - Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories     - Ambidextrous magazine release lever     - Extended slide release     - Patented Lock-Out Safety device"

Despite its small size, the HK P30SK features a magazine capacity of 10+1 rounds. The HK P30SK Subcompact V1 ""light"" LEM DAO pistol includes comes with two 10 round magazines, two additional backstraps, and two additional sets of lateral grip plates. The subcompact model of the renowned P30 handgun, P30SK (SubKompact) series has all of the sought-after characteristics of the larger frame P30 and P30L pistols but in a more concealable design.  The completely adjustable P30 grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.  And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.  Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.  An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.  Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm."

This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm."

It’s a great shooter, and I’ll be sad to see it go.Contact me with any trades or questions via TEXT ONLY: nineOI - four I O – two7nine6DO NOT EMAIL, ALL EMAILS WILL BE DELETED AND NOT REPLIED TO UNLESS THERE IS A NUMBER FOR ME TO TEXT."

Got the rifle a couple years back for coyote hunting but never really got the chance to go, so it's been a safe queen. Round count is under 100, as you can see by the bolt face.  From what little I've shot it, it's very accurate.  With the 24"" heavy contour barrel it's easily a 1/2MOA gun, it will print clovers at 100 if you feed it match ammo.

The gun is roughly 95% condition with just a few handling marks throughout. Nice deep blue-black color with that subtle hint of gray the 29-2's are noted for! Pinned and recessed which Smith and Wesson dropped after the 29-2 because it was cheaper to produce, but not near as nice! This gun has Target trigger, Target Hammer, and Target stocks, known as the ""3-T's, and the most desirable model configuration. No major blemishes, a few dings here and there. If you wanted the ""Dirty Harry"" this is it! Will not ship, sale to WI residents only, in person. This gun was well cared for believe me! If you check the prices on the online auction sites, you will find this gun very fairly priced at $1,195.00. Case is missing the bore mop, and has been professionally re-lined which is quite common for the Presentation Cases of this era. The factory flocking just doesn't hold up for more than about 25 years."

I bought the gun as a fun project. It had surface rust and the front sight was missing.
I have removed the rust and sprayed the gun with a light coat of high temp paint. I am considering cerakote, but have too many projects currently. I did add a fiber optic front sight. After a good cleaning, the gun fires, but typically cycles 4 to 5 rounds before failing to feed into the camber. Some polishing might resolve this issue, but again, I've taken on too many projects and this one is low on the list.
