It is in like new condition with very few rounds down the pipe.
It has not been shot by me, previous owner really only had it as a wall gun at his cabin for a few years. Bagged a pheasant or two.Few dozen rounds of light field loads at most.
It is very clean and shows almost zero wear, or dings in the finish.

Beyond that, what can I say. It's a Mossberg 590. The action runs smooth and true like an oiled bank vault door and it's built like a battleship.
This is a hard-duty use gun, and has been babied its entire life thus far.

FIRST AND FOREMOST: In order to protect yourself and your funds I encourage anyone interested to please request a proof pic of the gun from me, so you know that the gun, myself and the listing is real. Sucks, but there's a lot of liars and scammers out there.
