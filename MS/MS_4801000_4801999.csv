With only 300 made, this handgun is rare and almost priceless; the engraving and workmanship is perfect as only Colt could produce. It comes with its box and presentation case along with all the paperwork. There's even a letter from Colt's Historical division authenticating the pistol. I saw one of these on GunBroker about a year ago and the minimum bid was $2,500. There was another on GunAuction for $1600; I've seen them sell as high as $3500.  I want to sell to purchase an AR-10; if you have and AR10 and want to trade, lets make a deal.  If you want to purchase this fine firearm, the first $1600 will get it. I can send additional pics if you want to see more of this beauty. See below for additional discription:

Someone once asked Spyderco's chief designer ""if your son or daughter were deployed, what knife would you send with them?"" The question raised three powerful considerations: 1. The blade had to have relentless cutting performance and edge life. 2. It had to be lightweight, ergonomically usable. 3. For field-use it needed to be made as indestructible and failsafe as humanly possible.

The resulting Military Model, or Millie, covered all considerations by pairing a premium stainless blade with a slim handle that feels like a natural extension of the hand. Our C36CF90VP is a variation on that standard, limited in number and availability. It's a classic Millie with a high-end twist. It has a peel-ply carbon fiber handle and Crucible Steel's CPM S90V exotic alloy blade.

This Glock 17 RTF2 FDE Vickers Tactical was a collaborative work with combat veteran and face of the tactical firearms industry Larry Vickers. Keeping the tactical shooter in mind, he designed this pistol with everything it would need to take it from “pretty good” to become “the best.” After taking the basic 3rd generation Glock chambered in 9mm, this weapon received Wilson Combat VT sights to ensure shooters would have perfect accuracy when it matters most. Next, Vickers slapped on an exclusive slide stop and magazine release, ensuring that the handgun would always have a smooth action.

Beyond its tactical superiority, this is a limited production firearm and features an FDE rough texturized finish on the frame that is sure to attract all the right attention while adding a better grip option for the modern shooter. To top this off, the weapon includes a few extra special parts to ensure your success, including 2 Tango Down magazine base plates."

The SIG SAUER® P226® Tactical Operations (TACOPS) is a full-sized 9mm featuring a stainless steel slide with rugged, wear-resistant Nitron® finish, front cocking serrations and SIGLITE® rear night sight, a TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and features the Short Reset Trigger or SRT. SIG engineers designed the SRT to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The beavertail frame is black hard anodized light weight alloy with integral Picatinny rail and polymer Magwell grips. The pistol comes with four (4) 20 round super capacity magazines so it’s ready to see action. The SIG SAUER P226 tactical Operations pistol is backed by SIG SAUER with a Limited Lifetime Warranty.

I picked this pistol up year and half ago thinking I'd use it for competition, but went a different direction.  I've shot it a few times.  It has never been holstered.  I'm a shooter, not a collector and can't see keeping this just because its cool.  The price is firm and fair.

I simply don't shoot pistol enough to keep it.  I am looking to get $500 cash, but I am happy to entertain interesting, firearm-related trades.

Black hammertone paint finish with black door, riveted steel tread plate panels and silver/gray steel accents.Exterior Dimensions: 21” W, 18” D, 55” H 2–Gun tactical storage section includes adjustable barrel rests that are extended to accommodate the added depth needed to store tactical weapons. 7 Rifles or shotguns can be stored on each side of the tactical gun storage section or can be converted to shelving for storing ammo cans, pistols or other items. 1 Full width steel shelf and 3 removable half shelves are included for added storage. Just assembled one of these and I was impressed by the quality of the hardware and the ease of configuring the product.  In case it isn't clear, the cabinet is divided into four sections by the two vertical and one horizontal divider.  You are given a variety of shelves and gun standoffs to configure the cabinet to fit your needs.  You can leave out the shelves and have long guns on the right, center, and left.  You can mount shelves to the right, left, or in the center.  The bottom, shelves, and top shelf all have foam padding.  I configured the one I put together as you will see in the product pictures with room for rifles/shotguns on the left and center with shelves on the right.  The cabinet is sold a lot of different places with a wide range for prices. The cabinet has a MSRP of $399 and prices you will find are all over the place.
