I've had it about a year or so, but it's had less than 300 rounds through it to this point. Great rifle, hate to sell but I'm an Air Force vet headed back to school and need some money to do that.

With the rifle I'm including 1500 rounds, all still in the case/boxes, as well as 60 rounds already in mags: 6 PMags (4 still in package), 4 E-Lander steel mags (3 still in package), and 1 60-round surefire magazine. 

The rifle will also come in the hard-case I have it in. I'm not sure of its brand, it's also like new but nothing special, will get your rifle from point A to point B and meet the transportation regs.

In addition, I'm including an unused SSAR-15 slide-fire stock, SBS version. 

Serious offers will be entertained but no trades."

This is a gun I bought brand new to add to my collection.  You can see from the ammo I am throwing in how many times the gun has been shot.  It fired flawlessly.  The multiple impact bullets are brand new and full.  Google search these and watch the videos.  They are the ultimate home defense ammo and a 50.00 value in themselves. This is a special collectors edition so I have included the Hogue grips if you plan on doing heavy use of the gun to retain its value. I have the manual and everything that came original including the lock.  I personally only fired it to test and planned on leaving in my collection.  I am downsizing and simply selling off my doubles.  I can text or email you more pics if needed. Price firm.  REDACTED (Jared)  Call or text any hour."

There is nothing more disrespectful than wasting another man's time and resources by offering trades, accepting trades, accepting purchase amounts, or agreeing to terms and then not showing up to a scheduled meeting and then not returning calls, texts, and / or emails. Fucking pieces of garbage if you ask me.

What happened to when a man's word was his bond and it was taken seriously? Anyone on Armslist that says they are true Americans and love the 2nd Amendment but then fuck over a guy after a trade deal is agreed upon or no-shows deserves to turn in their firearms and go vote for Hillary Clinton!

If you do not own the guns you have listed, offend a guy by saying his stuff is worthless but yours is worth full new retail pricing, or no-show / no-call after making a deal you need to find the nearest shotgun and blow your own fucking head off because you are the exact reason this country is in the shape it is in!

Integrity, honesty, and respect for another man and his things is paramount in society. Yet your flagrant contempt for common rules of decency and an honor system among firearms enthusiasts is what has allowed gun shows, trader sites like Armslist become places for guys to rip off one another and make decent guys stop dealing with assholes!

I've changed directions on useage and this is now surplus to my needs. You will need 3 #8 Shot to install as these are used in securing the system to the upper. Once used they cannot be used again. Also you will need the appropriate allen wrenches 1/8th and 1/16th inches. The first picture is of the actuall unit, the other is from the Copper Custom website. Only the Dolos system is included nothing else. 

I'm willing to trade: looking for a mil spec 6 position buffer tube with H2 buffer, spring and MagPul Stock. Or???? 

From the Copper Custom Web Site:

The Dolos (Greek god of deception) is a revolutionary new product being exclusively sold through Copper Custom that allows the user to quickly remove their barrel, or change calibers, in seconds on their AR15 rifle or pistol with no tools. There are other takedown systems on the market, but none can compete with the Dolos in terms of speed, handiness or repeatable accuracy after a barrel change. To break the rifle or pistol down, simply lock the bolt to the rear, turn the aluminum handguard and pull the barrel assembly straight out of the receiver. To reinstall the barrel, insert it into the receiver and twist the handguard. The kit comes with a handguard, locking ring and set screw. Installation takes only a few minutes and the Dolos is compatible with any mil-spec AR15 upper.

The kit is designed to work with any carbine or pistol length direct impingement gas system. The system is designed to work with the supplied 7″ carbine length handguard. 

The kit is designed to work only with direct gas impingement systems and is not compatible with gas piston conversions. The Dolos works fine with railed gas blocks on carbine length or longer barrels using the factory 7″ handguard."

It has a forward assist, dust cover, complete BCG, sling mount, bayonet lug and A2 birdcage flash hider. This is a great value and a good gun for someone looking to get into the AR arena for fun or just to have a good personal/home defense rifle. Just slap on a lower receiver and you'll have an $800+ AR for close to $200 less than buying the complete rifle for retail. I am selling because I need the money to move cross country to Washington State. Thx for looking! :) -Jordan"

•Fiberglass bedded stock provide longevity
•X-Lock four-screw scope-mounting system
•Three-lever trigger system fires with a crisp break
•Bolt-unlock button blocks the firing pin when you cycle the action
•60° bolt throw is easily operable with heavy gloves
•Rotary magazine feeds rounds in line with the bolt
 Browning's X-Bolt Composite 3D Bird's-Eye-Maple Rifles are packed with innovation that rivals firearms costing thousands more. Their 60° bolt lift prevents your thumb from hitting the scope and provides quick cycling for follow-up shots. The 3- to 5-lb. adjustable and predictable Feather Trigger breaks like glass at the precise moment for tack-driving accuracy. A lightweight polymer detachable-rotary magazine feeds the rounds in line with the bolt for perfect feeding into the chamber. An ergonomic top-tang safety quietly clicks into fire mode to prevent spooking your trophy. The bolt-unlock button atop the bolt lever provides peace of mind while unloading your firearm because it prevents the safety from being turned off to unlock the bolt. The receiver's X-Lock™ scope mounting system uses a four-screws-per-base design that secures the scope in accurate placement, providing reliable accuracy on demanding hunts. Glass bedded to provide a sturdy foundation, connecting the receiver to the stock. Inflex Technology recoil pad is constructed of a soft rubber that directs recoil forces to prevent muzzle climbing while drawing the comb away from your cheek. Matte-stainless steel receiver reduces game-spooking glare that keeps a showroom-quality finish. Matte-stainless barrel looks as good as it hunts. Free floating and hand chambered with a target crown, providing superior accuracy. Composite stock with a bird's-eye-maple finish resists the elements. Black-textured gripping panels on the forend and pistol grip provide a sure hold when the weather doesn't cooperate. Dura-Touch Armor Coating provides long-lasting dependability."
