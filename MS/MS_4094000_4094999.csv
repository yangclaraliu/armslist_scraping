DESCRIPTION

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin."

Two 10 rounds, or one 20, or 30 rounds. The stock and trigger mechanism can be folded forward for added safety and to facilitate secure storage, or carry under extreme conditions. The SU-16 has a conventional gas piston operation and utilizes the proven M-16 breech locking system. It is compatible with standard M-16 magazines.
The “Bravo” model retains all the features of the original SU-16, such as integrated bipod, Picatinny rail, and rotating stock with magazine storage.However, the “Bravo” has a lighter and shorter barrel, about 8 oz. and 2.3.
The front and rear sight are hard coat anodized aluminum and adjustable for elevation and windage respectively. They are both removable and the front sight uses AR-15 style front sight posts. The SU-16B is not a replacement for the original SU-16 but a complement for customers that put a premium on light weight and compactness. The “Bravo” type sights can be purchased as a retrofit for SU-16 owners preferring the AR-15/M-16 front sight system.

Includes:

5 30 Round Magazines (NEW)

Sun Optics Red/Green Dot Sight (with multiple intensity settings) NEW ($91.97)
Soft Case (as pictured with plenty of storage and fits the Ruger PERFECT) NEW

*Note: Threw it out for an $800 ""Quick Sale"" for a week, and I SINCERELY APPRECIATED ALL of the offers that I received for trades, and had the ""right trade only"" presented itself, I would have seriously considered it.  Some very nice pistols were offered (S&W M&P, Kimber, and even a Colt Commander...which was NOT an easy choice to turn down being that I, well as any real enthusiast IMO should own, numerous 1911's but no Commanders, as well as the others).  But they all were looking for ""across the table"" trades, and although a couple were priced accordingly (Kimber & Colt) that caused me to pause and consider, for the remaining this is a PARTIAL deal (ii.e. $500 Glock + $500 Cash sorta thing).

I now see another Sparta Archangel Mini-14 FOR SALE ONLY at $990 just listed on here whereas I am offering MUCH more for less. I understand these are difficult times for many $$$$ wise, so I was hoping for at minimum PARTIAL TRADE so it doesn't hit someones bank account too hard.  Dealers are selling the inferior (again IMO, and I believe the other Sparta owner on here would agree as he even mentions the accuracy of his Sparta Mini-14) Mini-14 ""Tactical"" for over $1100.00 (seen one wanting $1350.00!).  So I dropped mine temporarily down to an insanely low price of $800 for a couple of bumps, my apologies to those who missed out on the ""$800 Quick Sale"" but if she doesn't go for $900 (or trade + CASH) then I'm going for a Glock deal in Phoenix or she will be a keeper.

As of this moment I have a tentative agreement with a fellow brother in arms out in Phoenix (that I plan to drive by in the last week of June as I am going on vacation up North) for a LNIB Glock 23 .40 RARE OD Green/Black (I know I was trying my damndest to stay within my calibers so I don't need to go out an stock up a couple thousand rounds for ONE FIREARM), 1k rounds of .223 & he is throwing in 300 rounds of 7.62x39 once he learned of my Yugo M70 AB2 Underfolder AK to sweeten the deal.  However he and I have an understanding that the Mini is STILL FOR SALE, and that I would keep him appraised should the situation change. /Note

The Sparta Archangel mod ($279.00) is BRAND NEW and has never seen the Sun, it consists of a 6 position stock, cheek rest, full rail for the mounting of ANY kind of optics you could want.  The ""donor Mini-14"" had less than 300 rounds through it before changing it over into the Sparta.  ABSOLUTE SOLID FIT.  The Sparta Archangel was made SPECIFICALLY for this rifle and looks as if it were a factory produced rifle as there are NO GAPS or WIGGLE ROOM ANYWHERE.  It is as solid as a new factory built AR-15.

I will also throw in a SOCOM ACCU-STRUT that is only in need of a single part (the bridge between the SOCOM Strut and the Mini-14 barrel, everything else is there).  The strut is in like new condition, no scratches or marks and is clearly labeled SOCOM and is gun metal dark chrome in color.

Seriously only please. Oh and price IS FIRM."

I am the original and only owner of this firearm. I bought it, painted it, installed the sights. The paint is Duracoat's Daniel defense fde. The sights have plenty of glow left. I take great care to maintain my gear but I'm lazy sometimes. So I'm estimating the round count to be about a box shy of the break in period. Includes 3 15 round mags and the updated back strap kit. I'll only trade for a gen4 glock 23 with night sights or my gun, ammo and $ for a HK VP9 9MM. If you dont have those to trade please dont make any offers.

The fool that pisses me off is the jerk with the picture of 7.62x39 with magnets sticking to the jacket of his ammo claiming you better buy it NOW because its special {some of the stuff from China has a mild steel core}. I have several thousand rounds of 7.62x39 that a magnet sticks to because the jacket is bi-metal {steel with a copper wash} and it penetrates very well and can be found quite cheaply - the same fool also claims his hollow point rounds are made for hunting - they are NOT, that hollow point will not expand, its also a bi-metal jacket and the only claim made for it that you might want to listen to, is that it has an improved trajectory.  If you hunt with 7.62x39 a {soft point} projectile in 7.62x39 is what you might want - most folks do just fine with the surplus ak/sks ammo however.

- 5 New Magazines ( 30rd. 7.62x39mm )
- 150 Rounds of Ammo included
- Bayonet and Sheath ( Bayonet has been sharpened and pointed )
- New Sling still in bag
- New Magazine Pouch ( Fits 4 magazines )
- Sealed Cleaning Kit
- I created a very simple and comfortable cheek guard for the wire stock ( purchased copper tube styrofoam insulation from home depot and cut to size, works very nicely )


Some information about this rifle:

- The VZ2008 is a surplus parts kit that has been assembled by Century Arms and sold online and in store by many retailers

- Although the VZ2008 looks very similar to an AK47, the only thing it shares in common is the caliber it fires, the 7.62x39mm ( Magazines are NOT interchangeable with AK47 )

- This gun is a Czechoslovakian design from the 1950's that is still in used to this day by the Czech republic as well as Slovakia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vz._58 )


Technical Information about rifle:

- It is a milled receiver that is lighter and more accurate than the AK47

- Folding wire stock makes this rifle very compact and convenient for storage and transportation

- The gun has a bolt open feature on the last round

- The handguard is made of a wood/polymer mixture and as such, after a few magazines tends to get hot. This can be easily modified by replacing the wood, or adjusting your grip closer to the magazine


Feedback:

-There are many reviews of this rifle, the VZ2008 online, and I can try and provide you with a number of different sources to read through, but a simple search on youtube for VZ2008 or a google search will bring up everyone's experience

- I can tell you that the rifle I have has been 100% reliable when I have been shooting it, and while I haven't put thousands of rounds through it, I have put over 150 rounds and not experienced one problem

- First video when searching VZ2008 on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXtO7KLip9M

- First website review when seraching VZ2008: http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2013/10/04/vz2008-vs-700-rounds/




Information about this specific rifle:

- I have taken this gun out to the range and fired 150 rounds through it to test functionality of magazines and firearm ( 30rds x 5 magazines ) It was 100% reliable, with very powerful spent casing ejecting many feet away from shooter

- I was able to hit pop cans at 35-45 yards one first/second shot with this rifle, sights are dead on

- Much lighter than any AK47 I have ever shot, and surprisingly accurate and ate all 150 rds. fired through it with no issues ( I used Tula purchased from Walmart for the test )

- Folding stock took a little while of practice to get right, but now I am able to open and close it with no effort ( The stock opens and closes the same when the cheek guard is on as well )



**IMPORTANT** Starting after January 1st, 2013, Michigan Law regarding folding stocks on long guns has changed. This weapon was purchased after Jan 1st, 2013 and thus falls under the new legal terms for a long rifle. It meets the criteria set in the law which is the following:

- The rifle is AT LEAST 26"" in over all length WITH the stock folded or contracted And the barrel is AT LEAST 16"" in length


(^What the above means is that this firearm is considered the same as any other Long gun, and what what means is it can be sold/purchased via private buyer in similar fashion, thus why this is being posted here instead of the Handgun forum)"

I am the original owner of this firearm.  It’s a great handling rifle that comes to the shoulder naturally, and is comfortable in hand.

This rifle has polished bluing (unavailable in later years), and walnut stock.  The rifle shoots great and functions properly, with less than 100 rounds having been put through it.  Overall condition is very good to excellent, showing just a few very minor marks in the stock, and one small/light rub mark on the bluing.  These small marks are not even noticeable in the pics.  In fact, its lighting reflections and shadows in the pictures that might appear as visual defects, but they are not present.  No cracks, no rust, no oil or water damage, etc.  The bore is bright and shiny, and the crown is in great condition.  Removal of the fore stock reveals a clean semi-auto action with no rust.  As opposed to the exaggerated description that accompanies many used gun ads, this is a very honest appraisal of this rifles condition.  It will be evident in the pictures, and in person.

Additional pictures can be made available to serious buyers.  Additionally, many used Rem autoloading rifles suffer from having their semiauto actions completely ignored, and never maintained.  As the sole owner, I can attest to the fact that this rifle has been properly cared for.

A gunsmith installed sling swivel stud with the accompanying forend bolt swivel were added to this rifle, and are obviously included.  With that exception, this rifle is 100% factory original.

Extras:  Buyer gets an additional genuine Remington 7400 magazine, Uncle Mike’s sling swivel stud & forend bolt swivel, see through scope rings, factory offered Remington hardcase, owner’s manual, and Redfield scope with flip up scope covers.  

The scope is a Redfield Golden Five Star 3-9x40mm with duplex reticle and the fitted Butler Creek flip up scope covers.  It’s a great scope, in excellent condition, and properly matches the rifles bluing.  I might consider reasonable offers without the scope; however the scope ring mounts would still be included, as they are made specifically for this rifle.  For now, I’m leaving the scope on the rifle for the buyer who wants the entire package.  This will save them the trouble & expense of scope mounting, bore sighting, and initial sight in.  

This package is ready to go hunting, or to take to the range.  I shot 150gr and 180gr Rem Core Lokt’s through this rifle, both with good accuracy."

I have shot exactly 2 magazines or 26rds through the gun.  I love the size and feel of the firearm but have decided to switch all of my firearms to 9mm so I'm replacing it with a Glock 19.  This gun is in perfect condition.

The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.
