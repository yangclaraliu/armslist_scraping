This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds.  Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that has made the 870 legendary.
Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability.  The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot.  Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a wood stock and fore-end.  
Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and Remington’s continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded pump shotguns around.  Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.  In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years.

Seller's Description and Comments

This 1987 Fiero GT is in amazing condition. Rebuilt engine ~ it drives great and has much more power than your average Fiero. The body is flawless and the original paint is good for its age (you can see in the pictures how reflective the paint still is as it is reflecting the trees in the back ground and even the white lines from the parking lot). The motor runs and sounds great (as perfect as this car looks, the engine is the gem of the car). I am the type of person who is skeptic of any after market work done to any car I buy, especially of an engine that has been re-done. This car was not re-done because it was broken down....it was redone to make it better than your average Fiero and done right. I took it in to Gaynor's Automotive (A premium Shop here in Vancouver) and they actually opened it up and did a complete inpsection and said whoever did this engine did it right, and the car sounds like it! It is a 2800 V6 bored 30-over with forged pistons with a 5 speed transmission. It has roller rocker arms, a crane cam shaft, ported-heads, and a Holley Fuel Injection System. A new cat converter was installed so it passed with flying colors through WA DEQ which cost me $700. I looked for the perfect Fiero for almost 2 years and found this one in Detroit in 2010. The only time this car has ever been driven in the rain was when I drove it home from Detroit, and it drove great! It is currently licensed in WA State. It has a K&N Air Filter and custom dual-quad exhaust. The odometer reads 130,827 but the previous owner rebuilt the engine about 43,000 miles ago. He also did all of the modifications listed above. 

It has been kept in my garage since 2010 and the previous owner owned thi car since the early 90s and babied it more than his kids. From the time he owned it and as long as I have, it has always been garage kept. The clutch and plugs were recently replaced and have less than 250 miles on them. The car has 4 wheel disc brakes. The front brakes have been checked and look great. The calipers in the rear are new along with the pads and one of the rotors. It has leather interior that is in great shape. The head lights are fully functional. It has Fiero-GT floor mats, and a 10 disc CD-changer. It also has the huge sun roof shown in the pictures. I have nearly all of the paperwork for the car from the early 90s until now. This Fiero is garaged (and covered) and has been meticulously cared for. 

And you will not have to worry about this car having body cracks or such issues that I have seen recenlty on another fiero here on Craigslist that was in this price range. Can't beleive someone is selling for about my price for their fiero (with low miles) with cracks?? Just because it has lower miles does not mean it is nicer.  The air condiitoning is perfect and ice cold ~ and brand new.....have receipts.  

If you drove one of these gowing up, you know how fun they are...and if you have not yet, you are truly missing out. 

I have over 10k into this car since 2010 and have receipts.  

We can meet at my FFL Dealer in Vancouver if we make a deal.

Best Cash Offer or nicest trade gets this Fiero GT."

Now, you can have this classic revolver in the most classic sixgun cartridge of them all, the 45 Colt.
This is the first Ruger Flattop made in stainless steel with a 4 5/8″ barrel and is the first stainless steel Flattop chambered in 45 Colt. As of right now, this is the only Ruger 45 Colt stainless steel single action revolver with adjustable sights being produced. The regular stainless steel Blackhawk in 45 Colt was discontinued by Ruger several years ago.
As a bonus, we spec’d out these guns to include an auxillary 45 ACP cylinder. This production run will also feature “gunfighter” style simulated ivory grips that Ruger has used on some of their special edition guns, such as the Joe Bowman commemorative. For those of you who don’t like the “cheesegrater” (as some people call them) black plastic grips that have been included on the Flattops, this will be a nicer feel. The front sights on these 45 Colt revolvers are taller than the sights on the 44 Specials revolvers so that there is plenty of elevation available for various bullet weights. On this stainless version, the front sight is pinned into the base so you can switch the front sight out for other heights or configurations that work best for you. All parts, including the gripframe and ejector rod housing are made out of a brushed finish stainless steel.
   We have 2 in stock, and have them priced to sell quickly for just $619 each.

The trigger to the Blaser F3 Game Luxus allows you to achieve the ideal forward allowance without any delay. The IBS Anti-Double-System prevents fan firing, which also merges the highest possible safety and with the best possible trigger characteristics. The linear guidance of the firing pin has a lightning fast ignition and the best use of kinetic energy. The Triplex Bore Design: The extremely flat forcing cone of the F3 with an angle of 2.5 degrees ensure the perfect combination of optimal muzzle velocity, consistent shot pattern, and a moderate recoil. The EBS System activates the ejectors when the shots are fired and the springs cock when the gun is opened, unlike how conventional ejector systems cock the ejector springs when the gun is closed. When closing the gun, this keeps the resistance at a minimum. To add on, the smooth operating hinge also keeps the closing of the gun extremely soft with minimal resistance. The Blaser F3 Game Luxus shotgun has optimized geometry of the deep positioned center bores and the high positioned hinge pin, giving you minimal strain.

The brand new bullpup-rifle from IWI that's taking the world of modern semi-auto rifles by storm. After more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Bullpup configuration; short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy

Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles

Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies

Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR® SAR parts

Last round hold open on empty magazine

What Cheaper than Dirt says about the OTMRP round:

""Designed as a replacement for the M855 ""green tip"" round, this ammunition is virtually identical to cartridges currently being issued to Special Forces units fighting in Afghanistan. With a reverse drawn copper jacket giving it better penetrating capability; this ""barrier blind"" bullet has significantly less deflection when fired through light cover such as doors, windows, and thin walled structures. Designated as an Open Tip Match, Rear Penetrating (OTMRP) round, it has a heavier 62 grain bullet with an aerodynamic boat tail. """

The absolute reliability and authenticity make the SGL31 the ONLY CHOICE for collectors, perfectionists, and AK enthusiasts alike. All authentic components, made according to the original technology, and detailed attention, which went into the manufacturing, make the SGL31 THE rifle you will be proud to own and show off to your friends at the shooting range. The ONLY truly configured AK-74 currently available in the US market that uses brand new Hammer Forged and Chrome Line barrel, the SGL31 offers the safety and reliability that you expect from your rifle, making it the highest quality AK-74 available on the market. 

I have put 200 rounds through this rifle so it is in great condition. It features a rifle dynamics M-4 stock adapter and magpul CTR stock, and a set of upgraded tritium night sights. I have a set of wood furniture to go along with the rifle as well. I am selling/trading the rifle by itself or as a package with 1100 rounds of 7N6 ammo and Bulgarian circle 10 magazines.

The really nice thing is that the case coloring on the frame is still clean, colorful and shows almost no signs of wear like most of them out there. The stocks are without cracks, but have some minor wear from handling and the safe. They could be easily refinished. There is a John's (brand name) slip on butt pad that I believe dates back to the '50s. it's hard, but serviceable. There is no buttplate. Replacement butt plates are still being produced and can run from $15 - $25, if you really want to do it.

Lone wolf slide and barrel chambered .357 sig also accepts .40 barrel. Truglo rear sight, front and rear cocking serrations, barrel and slide port matched, frame fully stippled, 3.5lb trigger, g27 .40 mag (also feeds the .357 ammo) with pinky extension. Have a box of speer lawman ammo somewhere if i can round it up can go with gun. Gun comes just as you see it pictured. Im not sure where its at but i do have receipt for the barrel and the slide with a total of $718. So you can imagine what the total cost of overall gun would be im sure. I got it from the individual that purchased it new and had the work done for it. Does not appear to have been shot much if any. I know ive maybe shot a couple mags thru it myself but thats it. Had thoughts of making it my every day carry piece but cant seem to get away from my factory g26 ive carried for years so i really dont have a need for this one. I prefer to sell it outright but will entertain trade offers with cash as well as maybe an even trade for the right item. Trade interests are listed here below. Cash price is 900 obo feel free to shoot me an offer. Lowballers will receive no reply. Please contact me through armslist email and i will reply asap since i receive emails on my phone. Valid Indiana resident identification is required at time of sale and ccw card preferred, bill of sale will be required to be signed by both parties for my personal records only. Thanks."

Please email with questions. 

 Here's the description from Daniel Defense: 

 The Daniel Defense M4, V7 Upper Receiver Group is built off the extremely popular V5 platform. We incorporated the Modular Float Rail 12.0 to provide each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability. Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube. In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rail sections is accomplished with little effort. This allows the shooter to customize the rail set up. The DDM4v7 URG is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach to the barrel assembly. Daniel Defense complete upper receiver groups come complete with bolt carrier group and charging handle.

The M14 E2 was an attempt at a replacement for the BAR in Vietnam. As it was deployed late in the Vietnam war parts are becoming increasingly hard to come by. The M1A is Springfield's version of the M14. It sits in an unissued 1969 production birch E2 stock that is finished with tung oil. The stock's hardware is reproduction (original hardware simply no longer exists. I have searched for months to no avail). E2 stocks in this condition are very difficult to find, especially originals. It sports a Springfield M2 bipod, Fulton Armory National Match flash hider with bayonet lug, and fulton armory reproduction compensator that attaches over the flash hider (it does a great job at mitigating perceived recoil). To finish it off I added a 1973 production new in wrapper E2 sling. E2 slings are different from standard M14/M1A slings as they are longer and sport a clip for an optional forward handgrip. The Handguard is a slotted and vented fiberglass handguard that was issued in vietnam, but is considered in excellent condition. Will include a both a 25 round and a 10 round magazine. I'm open to negotiation on price and trades."
