I bought them as project guns, but I have become preoccupied with other projects, and just haven't got the time to finish them. 

The top one is an American Eagle model 66 an exact copy of the more popular Noble 60 shotgun. It has a 3inch chamber and adjustable choke.  I have replaced a few parts on it and it does fire. The only problems I am aware of is the magazine tube cartridge stopper is missing so it tries to load too many rounds at once.  This is a 7 dollar part online but last time I checked they were sold out. Also the choke needs some work.

The bottom shotgun is a Westernfield XNH 560 8A. It also fires, but the trigger guard is broken and is missing the magazine tube spring, and a few other internals I cant remember the names of.  It does however have a really neat adjustable choke on it. It is chambered for 2 3/4 shells. 

Buy both for 200
or the American eagle for 130
and the westernfield for 100

Notice the safety selector is [D] (for Democrat, LOL), the FIRE selector is "" .30 CALIBER CLIP"" and the AUTO Selector (Which obviously doesn't work...semi-auto lower) is: /HALF SECOND. It's very funny, rare, and ORIGINAL! The serial number is: GHOST01XXX

These lowers are 100 percent new and left the boxes for pictures only. I've decided to use other lowers in a couple of builds I'm working on, so these are available. Aero Precision is an awesome lower, built from a company that makes airplane parts outside of Seattle, WA, and used to make their lowers for other companies to stamp their names upon. Now, they finally decided to just sell their quality lowers under their brand.

The price of each out-of-production lower is $149 CASH in the Tampa Area. I will listen to reasonable offers.

PLEASE NOTE, THERE ARE TWO NON-NEGOTIABLE ITEMS HERE:

1) I will sell ONLY to a CCW holder...I WILL NOT sell with just a Florida Driver License only...CCW Permit IS required. Sorry, but I NEED to be certain the new owner(s) are legally permitted to own a firearm.

2) The new owner(s) will be signing a receipt with name and address off of a Florida Driver License, for the protection of the new owner and the seller.

If you have any questions or need more pictures, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks for your interest, and be safe."

I am looking to trade my Sig P250SC sub compact in 9mm for a quality in-line muzzleloader with scope or a quality 9mm/357 or 22/22mag convertible 4"" revolver.  I have two extra 12 round magazines, that makes 3 12rd mags total. Pistol came with one, extra mags for the sub compact are hard to find, and when you can, $45/mag. I shot 250 rds through the pistol, never jammed, well cleaned and broken in.  This is a Double action only, (DAO) gun with a 3"" barrel- really good choice for high capacity concealed carry gun.  I don't conceal carry and prefer longer barrel handguns. Some municipalities restrict magazine size to ten rounds, so know if the 12 rds is ok for where you live or concealed carry. 

I want to lengthen the Illinois deer hunting season, so my preference is for a quality black powder in-line  hunting rifle with decent optics.  Tell me what you have, I'll google and determine if similar value to my pistol.

It has a Leupold VX3 2.5x8 scope on it. I will make you a great deal on the gun only as I have $600 in the scope alone. Or I will sell as a package. I can drive to meet if needed.

I have a total of $2100 in it with the gun, scope, rings, and TAX !! I need $1050 for the gun or $1500 for the package. I also have a partial box of shells, 25 cleaned and polished cases, and a brand new set of dies if you reload. If you don't, you will want to as the ammo is pretty pricey if you want to shoot it a lot. It has had the 25 rounds through it but I liked it so much I bought the dies so I could shoot it more but I found a gun I can't live without and must use the funds to get it....
