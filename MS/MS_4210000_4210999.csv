These rifles are hard to find with the ""Son"". Mr. Lamb had (2) sons and both eventually went into business with him but the W Lamb and Son was only stamped for a couple of years making this a scarce signature. 

This is a nice piece and the craftsmanship on this rifle is great. The condition is good for its age as well with some normal scratches, light rust and pitting, and a repair on the stock. But the pictures never do justice to the actual piece. The rod looks original to the piece as it has the same amount of wear and is matched to this type of rifle but I am not sure. The overall length of the gun is a little over 55 inches with a 40 inch barrel. The barrel is marked W Lamb & Son and has IIII marked in the barrel as well.

These are machined from T6 7075 Aluminum Forgings. They are Cryo treated before and after machining. These have a deep bevel to the magazine well for feeding and feature checkering on the front of the magazine well for grip. The magazine well is broached so the walls are thicker and stronger. The buffer tube threading is reamed and bored which keeps alignment at less than one ten thousandths of an inch variance for proper alignment. These include a Sully Trigger Guard. 

SLR15  - Forged Lower Receiver
The lower receiver of the SLR15 Rifle is forged. This is done for strength because forged is stronger than cast. Forged is what the U.S. Military requires for their issue weapon systems.

•	Magazine Well Grip Enhancement
This allows a more secure grip in all conditions. The grip enhancement is to give the operator superior hold and control when bracing the support hand on the magazine well/front end of the lower receiver.

•	Trigger Over-Travel Adjustment
Trigger creep adjustment with screw, for those who wish to take all the play out of the trigger for a clean crisp break.

The gun also comes with its original case, all the original parts that were replaced, and some lengths of green and red fiber optic and a blade tech drop offset holster. In the picture I have it configured for IDPA which doesn't allow he drop offset.

I've kept this firearm clean, with regular cleanings after range trips. I used it mostly for competition in IDPA and Steel Challenge. In all fairness, the gun does have some scratches from installing the firing pin and sights. When installing the sights I did got a little too aggressive and dented the rear sight blade on the side. It does not affect functionality and is only cosmetic. I'm only looking to sell this to replace it with a lighter polymer based pistol.

This weapon was designed to be an extremely versatile platform, canted iron sights allow for quick target acquisitions at close range, while the 3-9x Mark III illuminated scope enhances your accuracy at longer ranges, the GFG side charging handle makes clearing jams much easier, magpul pistol and afg grips provide a smooth solid purchase for both hands, and a magpul bad lever allows for easier bolt operation. The two magpul gen2 pmags included with this rifle are coupled together with a GFG mag coupler monopod. Extended take down pins make disassembling the rifle fast and easy.

The suppressor is a mock suppressor that drops back over the barrel concealing a full size 16in barrel. You do not need an NFA stamp.

The scope has a small ding, and there are small scratches on the rifle from light use. The round count is low, in the 500-1000 range.

I am selling a CAI Centurion C39 AK47, and it is the version 1. It is not chrome lined and as you can tell, it has pink furniture. You can use polish furniture if you wish. My girlfriend and I shot about 200 rounds through it. You should also know that this rifle originally came with an upper and a lower tang for the stock, I was going to put a different stock on it so it's adjustable in length of pull, so The bottom tang has been cut (you can always rivet a new one on) as you will see in the pictures. The lack of the bottom tang does not make the stock loose or anything. The stock is attached nice and firm. In my opinion, it didn't even need the lower tang.

-Rifle has a Tapco trigger group and it is a double hook trigger. I have sanded and polished the hammer so the action is very smooth and nice.

-I will sell/trade the rifle with the magpul grip.

-Rifle shoots dead nuts.

- It will come with two (2) polymer Tapco 30 round mags, box and paperwork.

Because the furniture has some scratch marks and the lower tang has been cut, we would like to either trade this AK for an underfolder AK47 or sell for $500 FIRM!

Please don't offer me a heavily used AK or low ball the asking price. I would like to do a FTF meet in Beaverton. If I sell, you need to be 18 or older, have valid Oregon ID. If you are 21 or older, It would be a plus if you have a valid CHL but it's not required. We can do a bill of sale if you want to buy. I HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SALE TO ANYONE AT ANY TIME!!! and as always, no criminals please.

Has had roughly 200 rds altogether through it. I bought it to see what all the Glock people were talking about. After a year and a half of owning it I'm not impressed.

While carrying it at work it got snagged on a truck seat and broke the butt plate holder on the grip. Other than that it has minor scratches and blemishes... I did carry it everyday - Don't expect a brand new pristine firearm. I've never had it fail on me, I just can't get used to the grip angle.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Looking to sell my Smith & Wesson 422 Target model pistol. This pistol has the upgraded sights over the Field version and is the more sought after shorter 4 1/2"" barrel. It is in amazing condition for a gun made in the 1990's. 

Comes with hard to find original factory 12 round magazine and 3 factory 10 round magazines. Includes the take down tool for field stripping and cleaning. Unfortunately, the original box and paperwork are no longer around. I will include the hard case to hold everything. 

Must be 21 years old to buy and would prefer to deal face to face with someone with a CWP so I know you are a good guy."

The first-ever issue authorized by the Marine Corps Association.

This Tribute honors the heroic contributions of all those who have proudly served in the United States Marine Corps.

The left side of the slide proudly honors the Marine’s “Finest Hour,” the grueling and hard-fought victory at Iwo Jima.  Also featured is a scene from Vietnam depicting two Marines firing at enemy troops through dense jungle.  Prominently featured at the center of the design, the heritage of the Corps is honored with the familiar eagle, globe and anchor logo.

$980 cash or might look at trades.

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, so I will be pretty picky on trades, basically, the deal will have to make sense.  If offering a trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  Below are items I will consider.  I already have several firearms in the platforms and calibers listed below along with plenty of ammunition for all, but again, I may trade if the deal makes sense on my end, otherwise I will wait for cash.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants.  

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP, maybe .357 Sig or 10mm, but may consider others, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag., maybe others.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590 models & 930 SPX), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars, maybe gold in grams

Maybe quality optics like Vortex 4-16x(mid level models) or greater, maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

This was my project gun, never really got around to finishing it. As outfitted it is quite light with the NFA Polymer lower and standard AR15 upper. Very tight fit between lower and upper. As the upper has never been fired, I highly recommend having the barrel torqued to spec and breaking it in progressively to maximize accuracy. I have another rifle with a Doublestar upper and it is a tack driver, very high quality barrel.

This tactical knife is MINT!!   It has NEVER been carried or used to cut or pry ANYTHING!!   I got it a couple years ago from an old girlfriend, I played with it a few times (The knife that is) and put it in the safe where it's been ever since. Both sides of the non-serrated blade are factory sharp and the entire unit is immaculate.  I'm not just saying that either....I have the pictures to back it up.  No scratches or blemishes anywhere on this bad boy.   It extends and retracts without incident and locks up solid with no blade play at all.   The knife comes with a nylon belt pouch and the factory box and paperwork.  

As far as I know, Microtech no longer makes this particular model and the ones I'm seeing from second hand dealers online are going for $600 or more if they're even in stock.   I'm asking $500 OBO (Lowball offers will just be ignored).  If it's selling for $300 elsewhere, why are you even messaging me?!?!   Go buy it!!   I didn't fall off the turnip truck yesterday ladies and gentleman.   I've heard all the excuses, completely logical reasons and other compelling arguments of why I should sell it to you for half price.   Here's the thing tho....I don't care how much you saw it for on some sight years ago.  It's elsewhere for cheaper, go for it!!!   It looks fake but you'll still give me $200 for it?...Mighty nice of you but no.   You only have $300 and think I should sell it for that?.....If you can prove that works with the gas station attendant, credit card company or new car salesman....we'll talk.    You know what I mean folks.   You're all big boys and girls so please don't think I'm as dumb as you are smart.    

Aside from cash, I'd also consider a trade depending on what you're offering so feel free to put out whatever you've got, worst I can say is no. 

If you have any questions, would like to request more pictures or would like to make any offers, feel free to shoot me an email through armslist or text.   REDACTED    Thanks for looking and be safe.

A special issue firearm in tribute to our great Nation.
The edition limit has been set at 911 Tributes,
in remembrance of the tragic events and
the loss of innocent lives from the unprovoked attacks
of September 11, 2001.

The left side of the slide features a powerful and vigilant American bald eagle, a beloved symbol of America’s strength, independence and grace.  The eagle’s right wing shelters and protects brave police officers and firefighters as they raise the American flag, an inspirational image signifying the determination of Americans to rise up in unity against those who would threaten our freedom.  To their left, you will find the bold inscription, “God Bless America,” which today unites Americans throughout our land, and reminds us how blessed we are as a nation.  Also featured is a portrait of the Statue of Liberty, torch in hand, a world-recognized symbol of American freedom.  A gift from the people of France, her torch has served as a beacon of freedom for generations of immigrants from around the world.  Only a short distance from the destruction in New York City, Lady Liberty stands as a symbol of American freedom.

The right side of the slide features the Liberty Bell, another time-honored symbol of American Independence.  Beside it waves the cherished American flag, the most recognized symbol of our great land, with its stars and stripes waving gently.  To the right of the Liberty Bell, the American eagle stands proudly, wings outstretched, ever vigilant for any sign of danger.  The eagle is overlooking what has become America’s credo in this war against terrorism – “We will punish the guilty and those who harbor them.”  Also featured is the dome of the Capitol building.  At the base of the Capitol, you will also find the individual edition number for each Tribute, from 001-911. Craftsmen specifically commissioned by America Remembers decorate each Tribute."
