Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.Features:Caliber: 22 LR & 22 MAGCapacity: 6Barrel Length: 3.5""Barrel Material: 1215 SteelCylinders Material: 12L14 SteelFinish: Blued Frame Frame Material: Aluminum AlloyGrips: Mother of Pearl GripsAction: RevolverLand and Grooves: 6Land Width: .076""Length of Twist: 8.785""Sights: Open fixed type; Notch at RearStyle: Bird Head FixedTrigger Pull: Approximately 6 PoundsWeight Unloaded: 33.4 ounces (Aprox)"

This is a very mint condition Mosin and I still love in much more than a lot of other rifles out there. It has a retractable bayonet on the barrel and, although somewhat scratched up, has the original finish. I bought it from someone who had a grandfather that took it home from the war and kept it. Roughly 100,000 of these were made and less than half made it out of WWII as imports. I'm not sure, but the markings on this rifle indicate military use, which only 1,000 Tula M44s were offered as. These were used by Russian special forces to invade Berlin in 1944, and the Russians made it there before any other allies. This is a very special historical rifle, it functions beautifuly and feels like its only 3 years old or so rather than 71. This is a very special rifle, I was lucky to get it so make me an offer. I have it in camo wrap at the moment and a flashlight attached. Comes with that and 50 rounds, 20 of which are lead tipped brass cased. Also comes with case, sling/strap, old school ammo pouch, and tools for cleaning and fixing."

The rifle is packaged in the original box, with an RWS 3-9x40 AO Scope & RWS 1-piece mount.  The scope and mount have not been opened or used. Everything is packaged as new.

I bought 2 of these rifles, thinking I would keep 1 of them as-is, and I would put a custom stock on the other one. Well, after getting the rifle, I don't like the feel of the synthetic stock as much as I thought I would. I plan to keep just the 1 rifle and add a wood stock to it. Since the place where I bought them doesn't allow returns, I have to sell this on my own.

When I took apart 1 of the 2 rifles to install a Vortek kit, I noticed that there were no lubes anywhere.  The rifle was dry as a bone.  So to sweeten the deal for this rifle, I de-burred the compression chamber using Swedish files, and then lubed the entire rifle.  The compression chamber was burnished with JM Moly Paste.  The piston was lubed with JM Moly Paste.  The spring was lightly lubed with JM Tar.  The pivots were all lubed with JM Moly Paste.  I then reassembled the rifle and fired 2 shots with H&N FTT 8.64gr pellets to confirm that everything worked.  I can't say that it's as smooth as a Vortek kit, but it's better than a stock rifle with no buzz after the shot.  Lastly, the entire action was cleaned and then wiped down with Ballistol Lube.  I then reattached the stock and placed the rifle back in the plastic with everything packaged up as new.  I did not Loctite any of the screws, in case the buyer want to disassemble the rifle to check it out.  If the buyer wants (and AFTER I receive payment) I will Loctite the muzzle brake screws, and all 3 stock screws.

The buyer must be at least 18 and is responsible for knowing the laws/legality of purchasing this equipment in their city/county/state.

Please feel free to email me any questions, or if you would like me to email you higher quality images.

I am selling this rifle for $200.  I will only accept cash for payment, and will not ship these items. Please respond with your email address in the body of the email, otherwise I will consider the reply SPAM.

The blueing on this diamondback is very nice and strong throughout, with only a very faint thinning near the tip of the muzzle. There are also some very small scratches on the underside of the trigger guard that I have tried to show in the photos.  

I am asking $1400 in cash or trade value. I am interested in Colt 1911's, both full-size or commander/ officer.  I am particularly interested in older, series 70 colts in good condition, especially guns in nickel or the bright stainless finish, but will take a look at what you have.  I would also be interested in a Springfield M1A or possibly WWII weapons. 

  I can add cash for the right trade. Thanks for looking.

This sight was part of rifle package that I recently purchased.
Aimpoint shipped it directly to the gun shop (upon receipt of my purchase) and I picked it up from my local gun shop last week. I have an old Eotech 512 that still works fine and have no tactical need for such an advanced weapon sight. This sight it absolutely brand new and was never even mounted to a rail. I put the included battery in to make sure it worked, took pictures, and then packed it back up. 

This sight came with a factory mounted 39mm spacer and Aimpoint's quick detach, return to zero LRP (Lever Release Picatinny) mount.

I list a few of the notable specs but for further detail refer to the link below. The listing on the link is that same exact setup as the T-1 here received. 

2 MOA dot
50,000 hours battery life
Night Vision Compatible 
Submersible to 80 feet
Rugged and Durable
LRP Quick Detach mount (return to zero)

I believe $640 is very fair for this sight so I am firm on the price.

This is a very hard to find scope. The Titan series was Tasco's competition to the European 30mm scopes.  VERY WELL BUILT AND BRIGHT! HEAVY meaning solid components in my experience. German #4 reticle with an additional 200 yard marker. Includes weaver style 30mm rings, which are $30 alone.

Made in 1993 and looks brand new with all original documentation.

Dont let the name Tasco fool you...this was their flagship scope to compete with the $500 European scopes. Made in Japan, exactly like many of the German scopes are made today. Japanese glass is the best IMHO for quality optics. 

$175 FTF or $190 shipped. Priced to what these sell for on eBay. 

NO TRADES PLEASE and please do not ask.

Thanks.
