About the 30SF:  http://www.guntherguns.com/glock-30SF-p/gl-pf3050201.htm
The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 AUTO offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands."

I have shot 2 boxes of ammo through it and have one left in Hornady 110 grain VMax. It also comes with RSG front grip and sling. I have all of the original paperwork magazines and carry case from Barrett. If ya wanna hunt deer or varmit this is the AR15 rifle for it. It has a gas piston driven system and a chrome lined barrel. It's very accurate and the 110 grains Hornady bullets hit with some authority. This model cost a bit more because of the Magpul PRS stock on it. It's fun to shoot and has low recoil and you can put any AR15 top on it you want and have 2 rifles. These are very well built rifles and you can see and feel the quality when ya pick it up and shoot it. I have over 2600.00 wrapped up in this rifle so please don't low ball me on price but I'm willing to negotiate.  I am also willing to trade for an enclosed trailer single axle around the 6x12 The scope and rings I gave to a friend for his first hunting season but I have not taken a new pic yet.

Have a recently purchased hk416 22AR. Is equipped with a bushbell ar22 scope setting on a weaver 1in tactical mount. Great scope and clear glass. Also have a total of 4 twenty rd mags with deal. I took to shooters and ran 80 rounds thru it and no hiccups. Gun is as new as can be without paying taxes or transfer fees LOL. Its a great top of the line 22 that i just dont get to use. Dont have much time to get to outdoor ranges. Its on paper from shooting indoors but would need dialed in better for more distance. This is a real AR22, not a lightweight plastic piece like the mossberg or smith. This has a solid quad rail, dust cover, the hk style stock and is a heavy solid rifle.
Optic, mount, and mags are close to 300 alone. Great training rifle to cut cost and save ur 5.56 ammo. Will also throw in remainder of the high velocity brick of winchester 22 with trade."

I'm regretting doing this, but I'm selling my Desert Eagle 1911C to help pay for a new computer setup (as my old one has breathed it last breath). It includes a Blackhawk! carbon fiber holster, a 10rd Magazine, and two 8 rd magazines and magazine holsters. Has original Magnum Research case with lock.

Two upgrades include rubberized finger grips and a heavier spring. The stock spring was too light to return the slide to battery. Less than 200rds have been through this 1911. It was my daily carry piece.

I will only sell to locals with a valid NV Concealed Permit. I'll show you mine if you show me yours!

Feel free to call, email or text. Price is negotiable. Cash only, no trades unless you want to buy me my computer parts? No ammo included in package. My other 45's wouldn't like that.

Thanks for your consideration!

I have gone another route as to time and interest and as such am selling the pair of Boltless Rifles for what I have into them. The barrels are the stock 29"" and as far as I can tell, the bolts and the Elevation adjusters for the rear sights are all that are missing. Both rifles have cosmoline encrusted inners and on the outside as well. The wood is rough and the metal shows its age as one might expect from this era of a rifle. The inside barrels/lans grooves look good and are strong and raised.
Someone looking for a wall hanger or props for a production may have found the answer in these 2 critters! 
No trades as I just want to get some cash towards another project.
Even though these are antiques, I will still ask for buyers to be Oregon residents 18 or over & willing to sign a Bill of Sale.
$310 Firm for both as I will not be breaking up and selling individually.

Text questions to REDACTED

The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.

Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.

The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date."

The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a Mid-length gas system. The modified ultra  lightweight profile barrel  is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.

The flip up sights are polymer diamondhead front and rear that have the ""NiteBrite"" photo luminescent inserts. It also has a Magpul grip, buttstock and one Pmag (with window).

The KAC M4 RAS (Rail Adapter System) was developed for use on the US military’s M4 Carbine, and with over 1 million rails issued to date, it is one of the most battle proven designs available for the AR-15 platform. This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine Mil-Spec M1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M4 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle’s barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical accessories. Includes three KAC 11 Rib Rail Panels. 

Manufacturer: Knight's Armament Company
Model: 98064
MSRP: $350
Length: 6.25”
Weight: 8.9 oz
Free Float: No
Material: Aluminum
Finish: Black Anodizing

Rifle Requirements: The M4 RAS is a drop-in replacement part for standard, 2-piece polymer, M4-type handguards. The rifle must have a carbine length gas system, delta ring assembly, fixed front sight/gas block, and round handguard end cap. Lighter barrel profiles work best (M4 or Government contours). Heavier barrel contours may require modification to the inside of the rail. For AR-15/SR-15 based platforms only; not compatible with SR-25 variants. Installation instructions are included.


U.S. Army Standard-Issue Backup Sight For M4/M16A4
MATECH BUIS Leaf Sight is current issue to US Military. This Windage and elevation adjustable flip-up rear iron sight is battle tested with a low-profile design. Folds down out of the way when not in use. Will fit under a Trijicon ACOG riflescope.

Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for M4 carbines and M16A4 rifles flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights."
