They informed me they are not in Eau Claire but in Pennsylvania and need personal info and payment if you wish to proceed. The ads are obvious scams. A Python in new condition? A Desert Eagle brushed stainless for 900? I don't think so. 

Here are the replies I got.

""Yes it is still available and it is clean and functions well
where are you located?""
""Am in Pennsylvania, how would you like to proceed? price includes shipping to your FFL,do you have an FFL dealer that you  work with?""

These are replies to my detailed questions which were never answered, obviously suspicious.

The Klipsch KG4 speaker system provides 100 watts of continuous power per channel; each speaker has a maximum power of 500 watts. The speakers have a nominal impedance of 6 ohms, lower than the 8 ohms standard on most speaker systems; this means that these speakers may draw more power from their source and put out more wattage per signal. It is recommended that you check the compatibility of your stereo device with a 6-ohm impedance speaker. The Klipsch KG4 speakers have a frequency range of 38-20,000 Hz, offering close to the full range of human hearing. The Klipsch KG4 speakers are each fitted with a tweeter and two woofer diaphragms set in a medium-density fiberboard enclosure. The woofers are each 8 inches and the tweeter is 1 inch. The speakers have a two-way design, meaning that input signals are split so that the low frequencies are routed through the woofer while the high frequencies are routed through the tweeter. This ensures that the sound will provide as close to a full and equal range as possible.

It has served me well as a top of the line IWB CCW since 2007 when I first purchased it new. I carried it a lot, but did mix it up with other guns I own for my daily CCW. It has been shot periodically, but by no means ALOT/DAILY etc. In fact, because I don't shoot it as much as I should to help with my trigger control etc, is one reason I've decided to trade it in for a polymer which I seem to shoot better. It shoots WAY better than I do and is what all other 1911's strive to be in a 45! 

This gun has either ridden on my side or has been kept top shelf in my gun safe. It has been well cared for, never been dropped or abused, but does show the typical signs of holster wear. Though it is not new, it is in excellent condition. I have had it completely stripped, examined, lubed and appraised by a local and well respected gunsmith of 20 something years in the field. I have a written appraisal detailing his evaluation that I will post and include with the gun.

I am selling this as a package deal, but if you see something you like, I would be willing to split a few items, but want to include at least one holster and 2 mags with the gun. I've researched the web and based on this as well as the appraisal I received, I feel the asking price is more than fair. I would consider a trade plus cash on your end for a NIB or near new GLOCK 30S only at this time. There are other guns I am wanting at this time, but I also need some cash for life expenses right now. 

I've posted some pics here, but have many more that I can email or text any other pics that you may need of this gun. FTF deals or shipping to your FFL dealer for additional $25; insured extra. Feel free to contact me with any questions. 

This is a TOP OF THE LINE 1911 - if you want the best of the best 1911 in a complete conceal carry package, you will not do any better.

This shotgun is a better alternative than spending twice as much on a FN SLP or a Benelli and I believe a better all around shotgun.
This Mossberg 930 cycles both Low Brass and High Brass with ease which the SLP cannot. The action is smooth as butter, the trigger breaks crisp, and it is balanced nicely

Since I purchased it I have put 250 rounds of Low brass with 2 malfunctions and 100 rounds of High brass 00 buckshot with ZERO malfunctions.

To the best of my knowledge the previous owner had shot less than 100 rounds through it. 
So I am guessing the round count is around 450. 

Excellent condition both cosmetically and mechanically. 
Will come with original synthetic stock.
12 gauge ammo for sale with purchase.

Asking price is 750$ OBO as she sits with the light, mount, side saddle, and optic.

If I get the asking price of 750 I will include a 25 round shotgun bandoleer loaded with 2and3/4'' inch 00 Buckshot. a full side saddle of 3'' mag 00 plated buckshot, Winchester PDX1 segmenting slugs, and a mags worth of 2 and 3/4'' 00 buckshot.

Since the primary contractor in Britain couldn't build them quick enough Britain contracted mainly with Remington to build these rifles, essentially making this a Remington .303. It holds 5 rounds and has never had a misfire of any kind for me. A very good rifle that I just don't use. It does have a small bit of surface rust and a small bit of bluing is gone but overall a very good rifle for almost 100 years old. Would be a great hunting rifle, back up rifle, first rifle or mantel piece. A very good rifle. $300 OBO or open to some trades, mainly ammo, mags, firearms or? Worst I can say is no.

Truly one of the premier self-defense pistols available from any manufacturer. The XD(M) line by Springfield has gathered huge acclaim, and here is your chance to own one at way below retail in a merket that is selling way above retail!

DESIGN
Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.
(M)odel Contour Frame(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations
(M)ega-Lock Texture

TECHNOLOGY
Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. 
With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory®.(M)elonite®(M)atch Grade Barrel
(M)inimal Reset Trigger
Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 
The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. 
Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. 
The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. 
Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. 
New! 3.8 model with slip resistant slide serrations.
The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 
The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. 

INNOVATIONS
The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD® is now captured in the all new XD(M)® line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M)® series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.
(M)aximum Reach Magazine Release
(M)inimal Error Disassembly
(M)ega Capacity Magazine
The modified contour of the new XD(M)® grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip. 
Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster. 
The new XD(M)® Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR™ Mag 
X-Tension™ (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)® is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.

PERSONALIZATION
Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.
(M)ould-Tru Backstraps
(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System™
(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case
(M)agazine X-Tensions™ (USPAT.7191556)
With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit. 
A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position. [Zoom]
With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions™ , SPRINGFIELD ARMORY® has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)
Your total XD(M)® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M)® it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M)® pistols.

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.

Facts about this rifle:
-It is post 2007 manufacture and has installed the TAPCO G2 trigger group that was built to eliminate the ""trigger slap"" that was common in previous models. 
-I bought this rifle new out of the box in 2008. Over the years I replaced the original front grip with a wooden foregrip. Parts for this rifle are cheap and easily obtained. You can dress her in whatever clothes you want. 
-It is not and never was a safe queen. I actually use/shoot/train with my rifles. She has been dropped,scratched, carried across the mountains of Western NC and Eastern TN, and otherwise put through her paces. 
-After each outing, the rifle was cleaned and oiled, and then given a hug for being so good to me. 
-The rifle has been fed a hearty diet of steel case ammunition of foreign manufacture. She is not picky and will eat whatever her master feeds her. 
-She is what she is. She will not light a match at 300 meters. She will, however, throw lots of lead and copper in the match's general direction, which is what she was designed to do. 
-Im selling her because I would like a Glock 21. If you have one to trade and are interested please let me know. 
-The magazines in the picture do not come with the rifle. They are expensive. If you want to buy some, let me know."

I have for sale or trade a UTAS UTS-15 shotgun, 12 gauge pump in perfect condition Like BRAND NEW.

Modern technology Tactical design - - 85% Polymer construction, weighs 6.9lbs.    Has twin magazine tubes and a switch between the two tubes.   Holds 14 + 1 rounds of 2 3/4 shells.  Or 12+1 of the 3 inch Magnum shells.   Can set switch in the middle and alternate drawing from each tube automatically.

18 inch barrel, bullpup design for tactical situations, 28.5 approx overall length.   No sights but comes with picatinny rail across the top   - - if you want the Red Dot or the laser/flashlight will cost extra.  Sites pitured are NOT included.

Comes with factory packaging and tooling and paperwork.  Rest assured this is a new version WITH the stamping and serial number on the inside of the stock --- ""MADE IN THE USA"" is laser etched on this firearm.  It has the steel switch mechanism which will not break like the former plastic version.   The kinks have been worked out in the new version and this one has shot flawlessly thru 80rnds now of 2 3/4 Magnum #4 buck and mostly cheap stuff from Dicks sporting goods - low brass #7.5 target shot winchester ""universal"" that i've put thru it so far. I haven't yet had chance to nab up some 3 inch Magnums Slugs to put thru it - honestly my shoulders not really up to task for such a small short shotty. ;)

Older versions were not USA made and NOT stamped as such --- they were blank in this spot on the stock -- and reliability cycling ammo was an issue and the switch mechanism was plastic and not up to the task; now its steel or alum anodize not certain - but definitely a complete metal re-design.   See photo of serial badging -- on older models this badge was not present and there was no made in USA marking whatsoever.

I'm selling because for the price of this thing i can have TWO handguns that i want and truthfully i can't get used to the uber short tactical Bullpup setup - i am used to a longer style shotty w/telescoping stock.

UTAS is ultimate tactical situation arm for manuevability in close quarters if thats your desire or need -- then this is your firearm!

I am the original owner bought it from an FFL Dealer out of Canton OH, named Ben Ellison -- real nice guy and he is aquainted with the guy who designed this weapon - he knew alot about what went into it the polymer/CF design and all.  This gun is first of its kind in materials used for construction with polymer receiver, etc --- weighs 6.9lbs.

TRADES --   Double Tap .45 and/or Kahr CM's highly preferred.  Might consider a nice .44 Magnum pistol."

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

I have a problem- all my current pistols and revolvers are valued over $800 and 2/3 are no longer made or collectable so I don't want to loose them if they had to be used in a defense situation.

Requirements- 
1. I don't want to pay more than $600, but if its less then 50$ over lets talk.
2. I prefer stainless over blued, If its a glock or similar where the coating is very durable and resistant to rust then Im ok with that- I sweat allot and work in a very hot envirement so blued is not preferable.
3. Generally I want a .357, .38 special, or .45 auto. if its a belt/iwb gun, Ill do a 9mm if its the right gun. Smaller calibers considered if its a pocket gun.

Otherwise Im open to just about anything, Ill throw a list of firearms out there to give you an idea of what I have in mind, but it never hurts to tell me what you have- It might be something I have never heard of before.

springfield xds, xd,-- glock 19, 30, 36,--Taurus/rossi .38s and .357 revolvers-- s&w airweights and all steel snubbies-- ruger security six ""or six series"" snubbies sp101 gp100-- 1911 pistols any size as long as they are less then $600 and reliable-- any of the pocket .380's except keltec-- ruger lc9-- smith and Wesson m&p .45-- sig p238-- bersa thunder .380 concealed carry--

Anything that blends into my 3 requirements will be considered. Thanks so much for looking hope to find something soon!

Also- I have my cpl and if it eases your mind I am comfortable doing a BOS or firearms transfer form. I don't want to travel half way across the state for a carry gun, there are plenty locally so please be in or around Snohomish county or be willing to meet halfway.

Never a Failiure of any kind in 525 rounds. Pull the trigger as fast as you can and let it rip.  Gun is new except for that one trip to the range.  Fired the entire box of cheap Remington Golden Bulk Bullets during that trip and every single round fed, cycled, fired and ejected perfectly. Zero problems.  I ran a bore snake through it and wiped the action out when I got home. Clean and ready to go. It was dead accurate at 50 yards with open sites, (after I adjusted them). I was hitting a coke can and chasing it across the ground, repeatedly, at 150 feet (50 yards).  I installed the 3x9 Simmons scope after my trip to the range. I haven't sited it in or used it yet. The scope isn't new, just the rifle. I've had the scope for two years. Scope is clear and works perfect. I'll throw in 200 + rounds so that whoever buys it has some ammo starting out, too. I paid 323.00 out the door for the Mossberg new and drove a long way to get it. I will take 300.00  for the *rifle and the box of ammo*, or 320.00 for the *Rifle WITH SCOPE AND AMMO*   I won't take any less.  This one is the most fun out of 14 firearms that I have, but I always want to see what else is out there. Very willing to trade it to someone who has always wanted one of these and wants it to look and run perfect. Again, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it, just selling/trading to have something new to play with. Offer me a 300.00 (ish) trade and lets swap."

Approx 100 rounds through this gun. I bought it back in December and it is incredibly accurate. Did not care for the factory trigger so bought an Apex Tactical Forward Set Sear trigger. This dramatically cuts down on pretravel and eliminates the gritty feeling trigger that these guns normally have. Also drops down the trigger pull down to approx 4 pounds. If this is too light I will include the 5.5 pound spring as well as all the factory parts if you decide you would like the factory trigger instead. These triggers are normally 150 dollars or more plus gunsmith installation if you do not do it yourself (pain in the butt). Comes in the factory blue plastic box with 2 magazines and 3 different backstraps so you can customize grip for your comfort. Gun will not be sold to any felons or others who cannot legally possess a firearm. Be prepared to show drivers license or CHL (NO ""identification cards"" as law abiding citizens will almost always have either a DL or CHL). I will NOT ship this and the sale must be face to face."

This vehicle was purchased from a BMW dealership and has only been owned by two people. It has never been used as a daily driver and has been garage kept since it was purchased. 

 The BMW is fully loaded and some of the features include a factory remote autostart, power everything, HID headlamps, cd changer, integrated cell phone, GPS, parking sensors, fog lamps, beautiful wood grain interior, heated and cooled power leather seats and much more. The car has the original manuals, 2 key fobs, factory floor mats, premium professional window tint. The car has the upgraded larger BMW factory chrome wheels. The vehicle has always been maintained at BMW dealerships BMW has never been in an accident or a flood.

 I try to provide very specific details about the car's condition. Obviously, the car is used and has normal wear on it. The car currently needs a new tire and parking sensor, and a brake job. The sensors are not needed for the car to be used. The current owner decided not to repair those items because of plans to sell the vehicle this year. Physically, after inspecting the car, I observed a very small ding on the passenger side and a small 3 centimeter scrape on the driver's side. The chrome wheels also have some weathering inside the spokes upon looking directly at them. The trunk has all of the factory tools included with the car and has a brand new tire on the spare with an aluminum wheel."

Well Ive run across another gun that I had never really seen values on and seems to be rare. It is a side by side double barrel.  This is a Import from turkey. It was bought brand new by the guy who contacted me wanting to sell it because he has never used it. So, he wants to just cut his losses and get some cash out of it. It is a Huglu 201A 12 gauge gun with the silver engraving on the entire metal action. It also comes with the 5 chokes from the factory for the barrels. He has literally never fired the gun, and does have the original box. The main question is what is a fair value? As in what could I get for it if I listed it on here. Huglu isnt exactly a common one stateside so i dont want to grossly overpay, or underpay. it is truly a very pretty gun, I would just be getting it to list on here because he does not have the ability to do so. So, oddly enough, I just want to know what a fair value on the gun would be/what you guys are willing to pay. Im not literally asking someone to buy it right now, just what is fair. yall were very helpful on another rifle I bought off a lady and helped me get her a good price without underpricing it. I do have pictures of the gun if you would like to see them. Please TEXT at REDACTED or respond via email if you would like the pictures or if you are willing to tell me what the value is/what you think it is

I do have pictures of it, and I know it is the 5 inch barrel. He said it shoots great and functions awesome. He simply needs the money for school stuff. Can yall please let me know what is a fair price on this so that I can get a decent deal and he wont get ripped off.
