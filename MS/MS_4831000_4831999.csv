Title says it all, as stated earlier, it's a mean little gun to shoot. Don't be fooled by the .327mag, it's on par with a .38+P energy and .357mag velocity. Target ammo runs $30.00 per 50rds (Murphy's has +-10 boxes target) and are reportedly MUCH MORE FUN to shoot. I bought it new as a novelty and to try to get into revlovers, put 3 boxes of defensive thru it, and still don't care for revolvers.

I paid $370.00 for the gun and $125 for the ammo at the last show."

70,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4831070,For Sale:  USED SKD PIG PLATE CARRIER + AR500 AND KEVLAR ARMOR SET,"San Jose, Almaden, San Francisco, California",$ 700,"Listed On: Monday, November 9, 2015",Tactical,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I am selling my khaki tan SKD PIG plate carrier, along with all armor peripherals with it. I am selling it because I need the cash for other purchases. This carrier has been one of my favorites so far- it comes with two internal kangaroo-style magazine pouches that fit AK mags perfectly (and will securely hold AR mags with a bungee-system peripheral sold by SKD), and the plate pockets are designed to take up to 11x14 XL plates and soft armor, however 10x12 plates work just fine due to an inner Velcro lining that holds the plates in place. This carrier is very high quality, comfortable even while weighed down, not likely to make you overheat while wearing and I've been mostly impressed by it and I'll probably regret to see it gone, but I could use the cash.

What I'm selling with the carrier, if interested, is a curved 10x12 level III AR500 plate, a flat 10x12 level III AR500 plate, two 6x8 curved side plates with the anti-spalling coating buildup, two 10x12 plate backers designed to lessen impact trauma, two 6x8 side plate backers designed to lessen impact trauma, 2 side plate carriers, 2 original 11x14 plate backers, and finally 2 11x14 level IIIA Kevlar plate backers to defeat frag, pistol bullets that skim the plate, or armor-piercing rifle rounds that might pass through the hard plates, which is currently installed instead of the foam.

This carrier is not designed for smaller statured people, as I have it cinched down about as much as it can go to have it accommodate me, being 5' 11"" and 180 lbs. if you're a larger guy, or if you like the peace of mind of being able to accept XL plates, you'll appreciate this carrier more than a Banshee or most Condor carriers. It is very well made and so far the only thing to have needed mending in the year or so that I've had it is the right kangaroo pouch, which came apart at the seam. It was easily fixed with a little sewing and is now secure.

Doing the math, I've found that I spent just over a grand on all this armor, not counting the shipping costs, AND the 8~ weeks that AR500.com took to manufacture my armor plates. If you choose to buy this, you'd have to pay one shipping cost (or none, if you pick up locally) and you don't have to wait to get your plates made.

Here's the math:
1x SKD PIG carrier- 329.00
2x PIG side plate carriers- 29.50
1x AR500 10x12 level III curved plate w/ trauma backer- 120.00
1x AR500 10x12 level III flat plate w/ trauma backer- 100.00
2x Ar500 6x8 level III curved side plates w/ paxcon buildup and trauma backers- 146.00
2x Armour-Wear.com 11x14 level IIIA soft kevlar panels- 299.90

TOTAL: 1024.40 NOT COUNTING SHIPPING


I'd be willing to part with the entire package for 700 if you pick it up, or 750 if you want it shipped, on top of you covering the shipping costs.

I could also only sell certain parts of it, or sell it without certain parts, if the right deal is made. I'd be more than willing to hear you out if you want certain components, and I could even be persuaded to make a trade if you have something I especially want. I'd also be willing to sell for under what I paid for them, but not too far under.

Also, body armor is illegal for felons or use in crimes. I will not sell to you if you are underage, are a non-resident, are badly dressed, or have teardrop/gang tattoos. Bring your ID. I will NOT respond to messages or emails that look like they were written by a high school dropout. If you wish to trade a gun for it, FFL transfer is REQUIRED and it must be legal to own in California. If we sell locally, we will meet in the daytime outside of a supermarket, police station, gun store, or any other place where you'd have to be a complete moron to make trouble. When in person, you can examine the armor as much as you'd like, and if you want an image of a specific piece or more detail, message me and I'll take a picture for you. Don't waste my time and I won't waste yours. Thank you."

I'm selling to get cash for other purchases.  This is a heavy-duty IIIA vest made to stop .44 magnum rounds. It's thick and hard enough to even stop hard stabbings, and has pockets to accept 10x12 trauma plates on both the front and back. However, it is not the most concealable vest- under a shirt it's about as obvious as it gets; to conceal it you'd have to wear at least a heavy coat or a down vest. For a vest to throw on during a home invasion, it's alright, however it's not the most tactical thing in the world. If you're on a budget though, this will do you just fine.

I got the vest from Bulletsafe.com for 300 dollars, however, I'd be willing to do a face-to-face sale for 190 even, and 225 to have it shipped. I'd even be able to entertain and cough up cash for certain trades, if you happen to have something I want.

Also, if you'd be interested in buying 10x12 plates with this, I am also selling AR500 plates and I could throw one or two of them in with the vest if you wanted to cut a deal. If you're after something more tactical with magazine pouches and dedicated rifle protection, I am also selling an SKD plate carrier here: http://www.armslist.com/posts/4831070/san-francisco-california-tactical-gear-for-sale--used-skd-pig-plate-carrier---armor-set

finally, body armor is illegal for felons or use in crimes. I will not sell to you if you are underage, are a non-resident, are badly dressed, or have teardrop/gang tattoos. Bring your ID. I will NOT respond to messages or emails that look like they were written by a high school dropout. If you wish to trade a gun for it, FFL transfer is REQUIRED and it must be legal to own in California. If we sell locally, we will meet in the daytime outside of a supermarket, police station, gun store, or any other place where you'd have to be a complete moron to make trouble. When in person, you can examine the armor as much as you'd like, and if you want an image of a specific piece or more detail, message me and I'll take a picture for you. Don't waste my time and I won't waste yours. Thank you."

Not looking for anything modded out or beat to hell. I'm not looking for anything fancy, but would prefer something in great condition. I do have cash on hand if anyone has something sitting in a safe not getting used. Would also consider paying a little more for any ammo and mags you want to get rid of. 

Please don't bother sending a message if you're going to ask more for a used rifle than what I can get a new one for. Yeah, I know you probably overpaid because you were too lazy to do any research but that's not really my problem. Over pricing is a HUGE issue here on Armslist and I will not contribute to that.

A casual day of plinking or more serious varmint hunting is offered to you in this nine-shot wonder gun!Extended Ejector Rod: For positive extraction of fired cases.Ribber Grip: Exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.Features:Model: 990SS4 Finish: Matte Stainless Steel Caliber: .22 LR Grips: Ribber Capacity: 9 Weight: 38 oz Rate of Twist: 1:16.5"" Barrel Length: 4"" Frame: Large Action: DA/SA Front Sight: Fixed Length: 8-3/4"" Grooves: 6 Safety: Taurus Security System,Transfer Bar Trigger Type: Smooth Rear Sight: Adjustable Grooves Turn: Right"

It has a good trigger, I like the controls and it works great with the high thumb hold. The function is not the problem. What don't I like about it? It's not concealable, extra magazines are expensive and most importantly, my fiance doesn't like it. I'm trying to trade it for something that will suit both of our needs. Specifically, a Glock 19 or a .357 revolver. The two revolvers I'm most interested in are a S&W 686+ or Ruger GP100. Both of those would obviously include cash on my end. Let me know what you have.

RIGHT HAND. 243. ALL AUCTIONS SUBJECT TO IN STORE SALES. . THE WORLDS LARGEST BLASER DEALER. Focused repeating In-line repeating in the correct shooting position allows for a relaxed posture in situations that require a quick succession of shots. The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. ""Blind"" magazine exchange The magazine buttons are positioned above the trigger guard and can be operated „blindly“. When pushing both buttons at the same time, the magazine releases directly into the shooter‘s hand. If required, a second loaded magazine can be inserted within a split second. The magazine is loaded by pushing in cartridges from above, so that pushing the cartridges under the magazine lips is not necessary. Thus, the magazine can be loaded easily, even when it is inserted into the rifle which is a huge advantage for active hunters. Magazine capacity: caliber group Mini: 5?+?1 Standard: 4?+?1 Magnum: 3+1 Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy Blaser Radial Locking System Extremely strong consentric locking directly to the barrel without rotary motion. Besides barrel bedding and quality, the Blaser radial locking system contributes decisively to unsurpassed accuracy...unable to say everything about the rifle but you bidding already know more ."

I am moving soon and am cleaning out my storage. This is new and was installed on the upper I purchased new. I've had another AR with this exact handguard on it, its light weight and comfortable. It is a Radical Firearms 12in free float ar15 handguard, not sure of the model name. It is slotted for Magpul Moe picatinny rail so you can add accessories, no rails were included so it doesn't come with any. It has a built in full length picatinny rail at the top. It comes with everything you would if you bought it from radical firearms.
-Handguard
-Barrel nut (uses standard ar15 armorer tool for removal and installation, so no special tool needed)
-8 Allen hex bolts to mount the handguard to the barrel nut

Mounted on the rifle is also included a 4-16X50 Nikko Sterling scope with a mil dot reticle and exposed turrets.  The trigger on this gun is a very nice two stage trigger. I was impressed with how crisp the break was on it the first time I picked it up.  It has a three stage safety and this particular model has a heavy barrel in a nice blued finish.  Buyer responsible for transfer and $500 is firm.  Thank you

This stock is really ridged for a factory stock, much more study that what I've seen on Savage or Marlin rifles so I think a bed job in this stock would make for a pretty accurate rifle.  I have already done some inletting of the stock in preparation for a bedding job so it really needs to be bedded to your action to get good accuracy.  I have recently done a bedding job on my hunting rifle and my average group size went from around 1.5MOA to around 0.625MOA after bedding the action to the stock.

Note that this stock is inletted for bottom metal that uses the Remington box magazines.  It may work with the hinged floor plate type bottom metal but I haven't tried, looks like the only difference is it has recesses for the box mag release tabs that wouldn't be needed with the hinged type bottom metal.

I'm asking $35 for the stock and I may would entertain the ideal of bedding your barreled action to this stock for an extra $50 if interested but I typically don't work on other people firearms."
