Have $60 recoil reducing tactical door breaker pistol grip that goes with it. Tried using it for recoil and while it does reduce recoil I found a pistol grip on a shotgun was as comfortable as I thought it might be.  So, you can have it.  
So, you are getting a practically brand new $300 shotgun with no tax and pistol grip to boot.


Gun and stock new are close to $400 so my lowest dollar for it all is $265."

So here is my dream gun from last year. 

$1075 FIRM no lowball offers I'm not desperate or hard up to sell.

Savage model 10FCP-HS Precision in .308 with the special 5R barrel 1 in 11.25"" twist rate.  Order #19056 $1100 + shipping and FFL fee.  It comes with 2 one piece EGW scope mount rails. One is 0 MOA and the Other is a 20 MOA they were $70 each. I will also include the EGW 30mm scope rings that are matched and numbered for precision, they were $120. I also called Savage and purchased an extra factory Magazine. $60 also has muzzle brake $75

I'm in it close to $1500

It has has exactly 56 rounds through her. I followed the savage break-in procedure exactly as the link below. The green target was during break in. And the white target was the first shots after completing the break-in. Both targets were shot with a low quality scope (vortex crossfire II) installed and good quality factory ammo but not match ammo. This rifle will be awesome when dialed in with good optics. And hand loads or good match ammo. 

Burris scope in picture is not for sale. I just bought it and will be moving it to my next project. 

If you looking at getting into long range precision shooting this will be a fine choice. Please Do some research to confirm this.

It has a minor grip reduction, reducing the ""hump"", a medium texture stipple with index points on both port and starboard sides of the frame and a double undercut on the trigger guard. The undercut is not highly polished, but is very smooth with no hotspots and it beats the old Glock-Knuckle. 

The round count is fairly low, sub-1000 for sure. It is equipped with 2014 dated Ameriglo CAP sights that regulate well to the dot at 15yds and in, top of the blades beyond. It will come with 3 standard capacity, 13rd mags. I can also throw in a couple boxes and mags worth of defensive ammo with it, as I won't have much use for it.

Open for trades : smith and Wesson 44 mag, higher end 1911 Steyr’s design was quite a good one, offering both light recoil and better than average accuracy. It did this by utilizing a gas delayed blowback system virtually identical to the last ditch German Volkssturm Gustloffwerke (VG1-5) rifle. Basically, the front half of the slide acts as a gas piston, and ports in the barrel allow gas into that piston while the bullet is still in the barrel, thus slowing down rearward movement of the slide. In the photo below, you can see the gas sealing rings machined into the barrel, to prevent that gas from venting down around the recoil spring. The piston sleeve rotates to unlock from the slide for disassembly. The fixed barrel necessary for this type of gas delayed action has the happy side effect of allowing very good accuracy. In most service handguns the barrel moves on firing as do the sights (being mounted on the slide), requiring two major parts to realign precisely for accurate fire. In the Steyr, only the sights move – not as good an arrangement as one where the sights are fixed to the barrel, but better than the norm. The gas delay system also slows down the recoil energy transmitted to the shooter. In conjunction with the mass of the gun (approximately 2 lb – it’s a full-size steel-framed pistol) this provides a pleasant soft-shooting feel. Italso came standard with an 18-round magazine capacity, which is large even by today’s standards."

I'll do my best to accomodate you if you're traveling a distance, but due to too many no-shows by Armslist users, I am no longer driving long distance for a sale/trade.  No Glocks, Savage, Mossberg, Hi-Point, Saturday night specials, etc.  I'm willing to listen to all offers, but I'm not really looking for handguns right now.  If it's not on the list but you have a weapon that is similar to what I'm looking for, I'd love to hear about it. If your trade is worth more, I will do my best to make it even in additional trades.  I don't have cash on hand to add as boot.  Trade value is $450.00.  Cash purchase is $400.00 firm.  Please call or text Matt @ (732)213-seven nine four six.  Thanks for looking.

The bore/barrel is nice and clean, and the rifle is in great shape. Not sure who owned it before me but I don't think it has been shot much. Its a good shooter, I've never measured the groups really but I have shot it at 100 a lot and get pretty tight groups on the steel. I had it out at 200 yards recently and was pounding the 2/3 size steel silhouette no problem. I like the rifle but I dont shoot it as often as I'd like and I would rather put the money into something else. This is the only picture I could find of it but I can always take and send more if you would like, it is in great shape. All laws followed and all that good stuff. Thank you"

Trijicon's finest Acog ta31 (4x32). Scope is in really good condition (id rate 7.5/10). Got very minor wear marks. Glass is very clear (the one u look into has a few small scratches but doesnt effect the view whatsoever). Also comes with a (2 bolt) mount. I have checked and checked the ""famous facog look"" and am 100% this is authentic. Has the raised letters ""Trijicon Acog"" on one side, while ur viewing through scope on the bottom it says ""4x223f"" i believe f, and also all s/n match, & it has the jn8:12 bible verse on one side, and the riticul lights up very bright when its seen sun light during the dag. As you can see all this in pictures. Bought off a ex military guy several weeks ago (doesnt have original box due to previous owner loosen during a move), thought i was gonna be in heaven (mounted it carried around the yard a few times) turns out its really jus not my type (has been sitting in my safe dark, collecting dust) figured id let the next guy get good use of it instead of it going to waste.

I got this off the internet: The end of the production Python was caused, oddly enough, by its quality. It was a difficult gun to make, requiring skilled labor and a lot of hand-work. Pythons were all hand-fitted-an expensive and time-consuming process-and Colt could no longer afford to produce them, even through the Custom Shop."

This gun has 2 barrels that go with it, one shorter vent-ribbed barrel with a Cutts Compensator and a field length bead barrel.

This gun is no safe queen.  It is mechanically sound, with nice wood furniture, but it has been a field gun.  The finish is not perfect, and blue is letting go around most of the firearm.  There is only very minor pitting (the worst of which I included in the receiver picture) but the gun itself is an extremely good example of a well-used A5.  It would be a great candidate for a reblue as the firearm itself is in good working order and really just needs some TLC to be gorgeous again.

I would place overall condition of the gun at 80%, with the finish at about 60% but mechanically in great working order with 2 CLEAN bore barrels.

Given the price of Browning A5 barrels at over $100 a piece, the price for the firearm and both barrels is $500 firm.  I am not interested in trades, only a sale.  Thank you!"

It is engraved to commemorate the shooting down of a Boeing CH-47 Chinook on August 6, 2011 in Afghanistan, killing 31 American troops. I will post the link to the Wikipedia page for this tragic event. It is a beautiful handgun and has a strong story behind it. You will not find another 1911 like this again. It is practically brand new, as the engraving shows, and I personally have not shot it yet. Buy it sooner rather than later, or that will likely change. I am in no rush to sell this gun, so please don't be offended if I don't take your trade or offer. I paid $1k for it so if you want it for cash, that's the price. I am more interested in a partial trade, either gun+cash or gun+ammo. Listed below will be what I would be looking for in trade. Comes with 1 8rd mag and 2 7rd mags.  Thanks for reading and let me know if you have any questions. My name is Peter and my number is REDACTED.

Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.Sorry, not interested in trades for this firearm.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays exact shipping or sales tax. www.copsgunshop.net The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays exact shipping or sales tax.www.copsgunshop.netLike us on Facebook at C.O.P.S.

This one in particular is a more desirable P226R because it has a German made frame which has a fit and finish a cut above American made frames. It also has the previous generation P226 grips that screw on instead of snap on. These more conventional grips are preferred by many as they fill your hand out more than the new ones and don't require a special tool to remove. On top of this, the pistol is literally like new and has only had about 5 mags run through it and that is not an exaggeration. Here's why: This P226 was acquired from a LE distributor as a BRAND NEW Law Enforcement turn-in gun just 2 months ago. It was originally purchased by a L.E. Dept in 2009 and then sat sealed in their arsenal un-issued until they sold the pistol a few months ago. When I bought the gun, it and the mags were still covered in the original storage oil in the plastic bags as they come packaged new. After cleaning the storage oil off and re-oiling with proper gun oil, I was the first person to shoot the pistol at that time other than the factory test. 

So this is a great opportunity to acquire what I believe is a better version of the famous P226 than is made now that is like new in the original packaging with the desirable German made frame and is offered complete with everything it came with new including the manuals, lock, tags, empty chamber indicator and even the ""Got Sig"" bumper sticker and finally, the 3 original Sig Sauer parkerized 12 rd. magazines, all for $650 FIRM. 

No trades. These retail for $1,085.00 now and that's with only 2 mags.

NO TRADES...Price is FIRM.

Before you knock my price, remember that the price of the gun new was $550 and TN taxes is 9.75% which puts the tax on this gun @ $53.63. In addition to that, you have FFL fees which are usually $50-$75 depending on where you buy it. Oh, and remember that you cannot buy this gun new anymore. So that's $653.63 - $678.53. retail.
