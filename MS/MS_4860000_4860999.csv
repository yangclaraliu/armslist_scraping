Purchased for wife a few years ago trying to get her into shooting. Took it out a few times and she never really took to it.  Less that 100 rounds through it. Original price is still on box for $399. Frame is pink but can easily be painted or cerakoted.

This gun is incredibly accurate but unfortunately I'm needing money more than I need it. The metal is in great condition. There is some slight rust on the screws for the scope mounting blocks but that's all I could find.  The wood has some dings but nothing serious and other than those few dings the wood is perfect. The trigger has been worked on and is a very safe 1.5-2# but it can be adjusted if a higher pull weight is desired. 

It has a Redfield front globe sight with interchangeable inserts and a Redfield rear peep sight that has very accurate repeatable adjustments. It will come with three magazines and you can have the option of purchasing some .22 ammo to go along with it. I have quite a variety so I'm sure I could find something you can use. 

I'm having trouble uploading pictures to the site but I'll try to fix that soon.  Feel free to text me asking for pictures.

A full-width locking bolt is set into the bottom of the standing breech face and this engages with a locking wedge recess machined into the monobloc breech below the bottom barrel; a conventional top lever operates the bolt. This arrangement is well established as being sound, efficient and reliable. Barrels are built using the monobloc method, the breech block sides nicely jewel-finished, and chambers bored for 3-inch cartridges. The two tubes are joined by ventilated side ribs for lighter weight, improved balance and heat dispersion; they have been polished before being well blacked. A brass front sight is also fitted.

In some shooting publication, I read about the advantages of this set-up by Safe Vision in Webster Groves, MO, and they had me sighting my AR-15 to determine the key point on the lens of my dominant eye to magnify for rear sight vision clarity, and ground the lenses to my prescription.

This rifle was purchased directly from TG International (the importer who distributed to various companies) was a hand picked rifle out of all of TG International stock and was kept by their owner in his personal safe until I purchased it.

This is their add when I purchased it:
Beautiful Hand Made Legion 30.06 Springfield Hunting rifle. They have exclusive rights to go into the Izhmash factory lines and pull the nicest examples to take back to their facility and accurize and polish and tune these rifles to be as good as they can be. The bolt action is silky smooth. Bore is mirror bright. These are the Kimbers of the Russian manufacturers. The owner of this company, kept it for his personal collection until now and is now available to you. 

This You can see the custom touches like the multi-wood stock, wood bolt knob and chromed bolt handle this has been worked over by Legion.

One of three ""prized"" firearms I own, I hate to part with it, but we are moving and where we are going we cannot take them with us.

The last 07 shot show legion that sold on GB was a .22 and brought over 1600. These are no longer imported (this was supposedly their 2007 SS high power display rifle).

They also performed several updates while they had it in the factory.

I'm selling my Mossberg 500, which I have cleaned once, but never fired. I need the money so I can get my kids a few things for Christmas. The shotgun comes with factory box, all manuals, Mossberg lock & pistol grip (with screws/allen wrench to install). I only took it out of the box to clean it. Otherwise, it has never been fired. PDX1 Home Defense rounds are very high quality, with 1in slug & 3 00 buck in them (Usually run over $20/box of 10 in stores). I paid $359 + tax for the gun, and about $23 + tax/box of 10 for the PDX1 rounds. I realize I won't get what money I put into this, but seeing as the gun is NEW, I would like to get $400 for the gun + rounds, if I can. Will consider any reasonable offer though. Please feel free to e-mail me with any questions, or if you'd like to make an offer. Thanks for looking!"

I began this AR Project some months ago and just have not been able to complete it.  All parts are nearly brand new and most items are high end.  I am willing to sell or trade what I have in multiple ways.  I will sell complete, trade complete, sell the upper or lower separately, trade the upper or lower separately, or I may even consider parting items out if the offer is right.

Here is what I have:
-Wilson Combat Lower with integrated trigger guard.  Comes with Lower Parts Kit and B5 systems grip
-Wilson Combat Upper
-Wilson Combat 18"" fluted 556 match barrel
-Geissele Mk4 MLok Rail
-Rebel Arms Enhanced Bolt Carrier Group
 -Note: picture is for reference of parts and an idea of what your project can look like with these parts.  Certain items are not included (such as muzzle device) or will be replaced before exchange is made.

As the project sits now it was fired with some spare parts I had for function check.  The rifle fired and cycled, but the bolt carrier is extremely tight.  May need a break in period or something may need replacing.  I am providing this info to be as honest and forthright as possible, as I am not out to swindle anyone.

Prices:
-total unfinished package: $1100
-every other combination of parts I am willing to sell/trade will be considered on an offer basis
Trades:
-make offers.  Trades must be in my favor.  Ammo (556/223 and 9mm brass cased factory sealed ammo) and cash would greatly interest me.
-Wilson Combat or Nighthawk 1911's may interest me
-feel free to make other offers but please make offers worth my time.  I am not interested in your 40s&w handgun, thanks anyway.

Any transaction will be at a safe place that I will choose, and all transactions will be in accordance with the law.  Thank you for your interest"

Through the genius of John M. Browning, many of these all-time favorites are forever a part of America’s history. When it came time to chase a band of outlaws out of town, blaze a trail across the Great Plains or face down a charging grizzly on a narrow trail in the High Rockies, the men whose legendary courage tamed the Wild West chose to arm themselves with a genuine Winchester rifle or carbine. It was the gun they carried with absolute confidence, knowing that their lives and livelihoods depended on it shooting straight and true every time they pulled the trigger.These magnificent historic rifles are limited production models and each one is crafted to the most exacting standards. This level of quality takes time and talent, and with so many classic variations in detail — like case colored receivers, different barrel lengths, deluxe and commemorative models in both rifles and carbines — it means that Winchester Repeating Arms will not have every historic model in the product line every year."

*** This has original full furniture with matching (serial #'s) furniture, bolt, and barrel. The magazine reflects F48 which matches the stamp on the barrel (F) and year (48). The symbol (Arrow stamp) is known as the “Broad Arrow“, there are many variations and it may be found with other markings. It denotes acceptance / issue as a military rifle into a specific country or it's own and the Fazakerley factory in Liverpool No.4 rifles had the # 2 or II / PF letter prefixes as this rifle reflects. The Lee–Enfield bolt-action, magazine-fed, repeating rifle was the main firearm used by the military forces of the British Empire and Commonwealth. It featured a ten-round box magazine which was loaded with the .303 British cartridge manually from the top, either one round at a time or by means of five-round chargers. The Lee–Enfield was the standard issue weapon to rifle companies of the British Army and other Commonwealth nations in both the First and Second World Wars (these Commonwealth nations included Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa, among others). It was the British Army's standard rifle from its official adoption in 1895 until 1957 and became known as  ""three-oh-three"". For the price, it is a great deal for a WWII rifle. ***
