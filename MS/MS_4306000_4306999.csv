I bought this as a potential carry but I've decided to go with something else. This gun is a safe queen and I have only shot 100-200 rounds over the 2 years I've had it. It also has a Hogue grip on it. What you see pictured is what you get. Case, manual, 2 13 round mags, magazine loader, and a cleaning rod and brush. 
I also have 50 hollow point rounds I'll throw in.


The price is firm at $500 but I would trade for a Glock 21 Gen 3 or 4 in .45

I had it customized a few years ago by KKM Precision out in Carson City, Nevada and they made a great revolver MUCH better. It was new when I sent it and was flawless out of the box but I had them de-horn it (get rid of the sharp edges and de-horn the hammer) so it wouldn't snag on clothing when drawing the weapon out of a holster. I also had them to smooth the (already great) trigger out some and lighten the pull by several pounds. They also did a BEAUTIFUL satin bead blast job on the finish. It came back so nice that I decided not to carry it. I replaced the original grips with Eagle Secret Service checkered grips. I shot two cylinders through it, (they also regulated the sights..it is dead on @ 15 yards with nice, tight groups) & cleaned it thoroughly and put it back into my safe and its been there for a few years....only getting it out on occasion to clean the outside with a silicon cloth. It has been a safe queen. If you notice the pictures, you can hardly even see the turn ring around the cylinder. The speed loader is not included. I have MUCH more in this revolver than I am asking. If you are a revolver aficionado or just love beautiful collectible, one of a kind firearms then dont let this one pass you by!
The ONLY reason that I am selling it is that, although it was a very comfortable carry in a good paddle holster, I probably wont ever carry it again. I only carried it a couple of times in a Galco paddle holster & it is immaculate...better than NEW! I still have the original box, manual and outer cardboard box. These pictures do not do this revolver justice. It is gorgeous with an awesome trigger pull! Thanks for looking"

I'm looking to sell or trade an awesome AR15 I recently put together. The parts list is as follows:

-Lower-
Mega Arms Forged Lower
Palmetto State Armory MOE Lower Parts Kit
Magpul ACS-L Mil Spec Stock
Standard Mil Spec 6 Position Buffer Kit
Troy Enhanced Trigger Guard

-Upper-
Mega Arms Forged Upper
Mega Arms 16"" 5.56/.223 Gov Profile Mid Length Barrel
AIM v2 Black Nitride .223/5.56/.300 BLACKOUT M16 C158 Bolt Carrier Group
Diamondhead Free Float VRS-T 13.5"" Handguard
BCM Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle
Griffin Armament M4SD II Flash Comp
Palmetto State Armory Aluminum Flip Up Sights
Wilson Combat Adjustable Low-Profile Gas Block
BCMGUNFIGHTER Kinesthetic Angled Grip (KAG)

Extras:
About 550 rounds of PMC Bronze .223 55gr FMJ
120 rounds of M855 5.56
Bushnell TRS-25 Red dot Sight
Plano All Weather Tactical Rifle case (terribly cut for the rifle and pmags haha)
5 Windowed PMAGS M2
Also have a UTG QD Vertical Grip if you want it.

And that's about it I think. I originally had a different barrel and bcg on this rifle and shot maybe 200 rounds though it before I took those off and replaced them with the Mega Arms barrel and Aim Nitride BCG. I wanted it to be all black and most of the main parts Mega (My favorite!). Haven't shot it since the change but plan on taking it out soon, maybe this weekend. So the rifle is basically new and I'd love to keep it, but I have a new hobby approaching and would like to fund a beginner motorcycle.. Or trade for one!

The individual parts for the rifle cost at least $1300, especially after any tax, fees, or shipping. Including the extra ammo and accessories, that's another $400 ish when bought new.

I will sell this all together for $1400. Or $1100 for the rifle and $300 for the ammo/accessories. 

OR

If you have a basic, affordable 250cc motorcycle, aka a Kawasaki Ninja, Honda CBR250, etc. and it's in great condition and ready to ride, I would love to trade! If it's nice enough and the value is there, I would throw in cash or if you are interested and I really want your bike, a Walther PPQ M2 9mm and maybe ammo could be thrown in as well. 

I'm desperate to start riding... But hey if you have a nice gun you want to trade I might be interested in that too. Haha.

Asking $710 for the package, but certainly open to offers. I am a pretty reasonable guy.

The only trades I interested I are single action revolvers (as in, cowboy guns, not double action modern revolvers) in 357 or 44 mag (vaqueros and Blackhawks at the top of the list), or conceal carry guns in 9mm Para or above. In most trade cases, I'd want cash I addition, but it never hurts to ask.

308,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4306308,For Sale/Trade:  Huldra Mark IV 5.45x39 flat top Carbine,"Appleton, Appleton, Wisconsin","$ 1,200","Listed On: Saturday, August 22, 2015",Rifles,no type,5.45x39mm                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Unfired.  Purchased from Fleet Farm then upgraded with a Midwest Industries Quad rail with UTG covers, fully adjustable iron sights, a forward sling mount and a sling mount on the Six position UTG stock. Comes with 3  - 30 round magazines. 
     Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder than hard chrome.
     The 5.45x39 caliber bullet matches high muzzle velocity with excellent sectional density, resulting in a flat trajectory and good penetration. The standard ball cartridge will penetrate 5mm of steel plate at a distance of 350 meters. The lowered recoil impulse of the 5.45mm cartridge (verses the 7.62x39mm) has a beneficial effect on accuracy. The 5.45x39mm cartridge is an excellent round that offers comparable penetration, accuracy and lethality to anything fielded by NATO. More importantly, 5.45x39 ammunition is less expensive to shoot! It has been designed to handle dirty and corrosive surplus ammunition. The bolt and bolt carrier have been protected by an ion-bond finish. These processes make the parts more corrosive resistant and harder than hard chrome. Now you have the ability to shoot the inexpensive corrosive mil-surplus ammo without the fear of the parts being unduly worn. Also comes with a Wolff Extra Power Hammer Spring to ignite the older hardened primers.
     The melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. They have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber."

I will not take less or split things up or sell individually, I want to sell everything for 200$ 

I have 8 Croatian bolt hold open magazines brand new, opened out of protective plastic which has been discarded. Fit and finish is superb better quality then surplus Yugoslavian magazines. The have been hand fit very snug to a rifle ever so slightly to a papm92 they did not even fit. They lock in super tight now, absolutley zero mag wobble. Never loaded never ran or kept stored with rounds. Only handfit with care.

These mags are 13$ a piece at centerfire and are a great deal.

I have a vest which costs 40$ on amazon. It's not the best but it could be fixed. If your a small frame person it may not work. I'm average sized and tightend as best it can it still has a lot of slack. Supposed to be one size fits all but obviously it was made for large people. 

It holds 8 magazines and as well as that it has two side pockets for extra gear. It has Velcro and push button flaps over all mag pockets and the two side extra storage pockets.

I have a Korean 75rnd 7.62x39 drum brand new in box in packaging. Was 69.99 at centerfire. Never even wound up or opened.  Has a piece of instructional paper with it that explains how it operates, it's a clamshell wind up design for the spring tension.

I have a Romanian 3 cell mag pouch, think I paid 15$ for it? Can't remember where. Came with a ak cleaning kit which it has a spare pouch that holds it and is included.

I have a tapco ribbed 30rnder in sealed bag brand new. They go for about 10$

I have a steel surplus Romanian magazine also.

Along with that I have three Yugoslavian bolt hold open mags, one of which is a highly worn battlefield pickup from the Balkan wars. It looks distinctly different than the other two. It was 29.99 
The other two bolt hold open mags are ones that came with a papm92 pistol. They are not the best. The finish is wearing and you can see what looked like light pitting on some of the steel. They go for about 20-25 bucks.  The only thing special about the other mag is, well that is highly collectible. It is a legit ament yugo Balkan war mag and if you seen it you could tell.

So as you can see I'm takeing quite aloss here if you've added this up and done the math. To be truthful this stuff has all been sitting for along time. I have no use for it.
Selling it all for 200$ for someone who can afford to get use out of all of this stuff.

Contact me by email, I can send photos of the lot if your interested. I will not take less than 200$ I have already significantly lowered the price from what I should be asking which is retail, because if you think about it most of these places cost 10-15$ to ship an order so go ahead and think about that if you added everything up and still try and lowball me because someone will jump on this deal in the next two days or I have people online I will sell it all to for more with alittle more effort and shipping involved."

The 4th Generation of the Glock Safe Action Pistol brings revolutionary design changes to the world's most popular pistol. Externally, what is immediately apparent is the multiple back strap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to small, standard and large frame hands. The surface of the frame is the Gen4Rough Textured frame scientifically designed, real world tested, Internally, the Gen4 Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system.

Featuring a forged aluminum frame with a silver CeraKote finish for extreme durability, and a blued finished slide to contrast nicely. Single-sided controls help to keep the gun profile slim, and an STI Recoil Master keeps you on target for fast follow up shots. Put one on your side for solid back up security.

Flat top receiver with dust cover, forward-assist and picatinny handguard (no plastic heat shields, wrap that bitch in a rag!). Comes with two CMMG brand 30 round magazines, and YHM brand BUIS. Sling not included. Only around 500 rounds old. Minor scuffs on finish, but in otherwise excellent shape!
___This particular model was from the first batch of these rifles I think, because CMMG has since put out an updated gas plug. It has two positions (two little notches) that you'll have to figure out, because each one works best for a particular ammunition. Screw the plug all the way in during assembly, and back it up to either the first or the second notch. If you're on the wrong setting, it will short cycle your first few rounds on a fresh 30.
___I smoothed out the feed ramps and added a spacer to the buffer spring for more reliable function. The weapon runs smoother than it did out of the factory now after a proper break in and the aforementioned adjustments. This is not amateur work, I used to fix guns in the military.
___As far as the piston system, it doesn't shoot carbon gas all over the moving parts. Most of the fouling deposits in the gas block, gas tube, and the bolt face, much like an AK-47. Very easy to clean after going to the range."

Are your buddy's laughing at you, claiming you have no fowl skills? Well i'm here to say it isn't your fault! You're not a bad shot, it's that damn gun you've been shooting. That's right, never blame yourself, it's your equipments fault. Now I know with this new revelation you have a lot to think about, even look for a new gun, I reccon you have a look at this duck sleighing beauty chambered in 3"". It will shoot the impossible shot, reach ducks out to 9 miles, it has a champion easy hit sporting sight, what color you ask? It's dead red, and that puppy glows bright whether it's clear or cloudy, it doesn't care if it's raining, snowing, or the rapture is upon us, it will shine straight and true. Yes my friends, I know you are wondering how it can get better then this? Well it does, it comes with 3 chokes, first it comes with the Remington Improved Cylinder of death, second the Carlsons Modified choke of doom, destruction, and death and in the caboose it is Pattern Master Long range black hole (of death). Did I mention this baby can take Heavy Mike Tyson rounds, Light Jimmeny Cricket rounds, and all forms of ass kicking inbetween. It screams Winner and after each shot, if you listen close, it plays you the star spangled banner. If you think you're American enough for this beauty, let me know. Fire 3 shots of buck shot into the air, I'll hear ya calling (or email me, probably the best way to reach me, especially if you live in a neighborhood, don't do the buck shot thing, cops will come and you wont be able to meet me for 3-5 business days or til the cops get drunk enough off of your latrine spodie that you can convince them to give you the keys)"
