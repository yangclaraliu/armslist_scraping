LEAD FLAT POINTS, box of 50 rounds. Recommended to me by shooters with ammo finickey rifles. I was lucky with my MARLIN 1894 in that it fed ANY shape bullet in .38 OR .357, even semi wadcutters !, so I never needed these. Cowboy action requires lead ammo, so if you have a Rossi, Puma, Winchester or other that doesn't feed smoothly, these might help you get in the game. If you have a Henry or RE-Marlin, GOOD LUCK. Available for local cash sale only as I can't do pictures of any kind. No shipping or trades. Price firm.

Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by Sig Sauer, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a full-size to a carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. With a partially pretensioned striker, it has a crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset. The P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. SigLite night sights are available on some models, and the reversible magazine release makes this pistol completely ambidextrous. Pistol ships with 2 magazines.

Excellent reviews online 

You could buy it for $109 but you will spend MORE and you will have to wait for it.

You must:
1) Have valid florida ID
2) Come to my house - I do not do firearm deals in a parking lot.
3) Sign a bill of sale

This is a fantastic deal.

I already have a line on a complete upper with 16"" barrel, 15"" floating rail, complete with bcg and charging handle for $315.  You can buy it (it is an auction I won).  If I dont sell it I will buy the upper - marry it - and sell the full weapon that I will only need to get $425 out of so please, do not try to lowball me.

$125 is good money - you cannot buy any other complete lower for less.

It is a complete ready to range rifle.  

This sale is for the ATI Omni Hybrid - with a polymer lower.  Right off the bat you are going to find a lot good and bad reviews on this rifle.  It is full mil-spec and works flawlessly.  This rifle cost me the following:

$477 rifle w/ one magpul pmag

$40 aftermarket quad rail to replace the smooth grips
$20 magpul vertical foregrip

$100 gunsmith service - cleaned, lubed, tested and preped the weapon
and PORTED the gas system for more reliable performance.  

$637.

The result is a really fun rifle.  With the PMag it works flawlessly with PMS or Federal .223 rounds.  I have run exactly 1 magazine through since the gunsmith finished breathing on it.  I like it.  My son however - who cut his teeth on an SKS - does not like it and wants an AK47 like you cannot imagine.

This is every bit as reliable and fun as any other AR15 - he just doesnt like the AR15.

So, I will trade this with 300 rounds of 223 for an AK47 of pretty much any design.

For sale $490 price is firm.  You cannot bet a rifle to replace this for anywhere near this money with less than 30 rounds through it.  IF you can - I don't want you to call me and tell me how you can.  Please, buy it before its gone ;)

You can buy the base rifle for $450 plus tax and replace the quad rail and add the foregrip and add the MBUS flip up sites (oops almost forgot those) yes MBUS flip up sites.  The rear site is od green and it is basically costing you nothing to be ready to range.

You will have to:
1) Have valid Florida ID
2) Come to my home - no longer will I sell guns in a parking lot - that is just too dangerous. 
3) Sign a bill of sale

If you are not prepared to do these three things that I believe are safety and honesty related then I wont sell this rifle to you.

$80 for 300 rounds of brass .223 - the ammo is for sale alone as well."

If you want a new one, Bi Mart sells these for $379. Of course be sure to keep in mind that a new one will also have a nice stiff action with a gritty trigger. This has been used mostly for Boy Scouts shooting clay, so the action and trigger are nice and smooth like a Wingmaster. You will also have to look high and low to try and find one of these with the high gloss walnut stocks.


Remington 870 Express youth 20 gauge magnum. Difficult to find high gloss walnut stocks, 21 inch vent rib barrel, 2 3/4 or 3 inch shells, screw in modified choke. This has a couple of use marks on the butt stock, otherwise is really clean. Let me know if you need more pictures. Perfect starter for a kid or smaller adult because the butt stock is also short.

I would also trade this one straight up for the same in a regular size 20ga in similar condition."

$190 — Manchester, New Hampshire
The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge.The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.
The P-32 has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.
This is a very nice gun Second GEN small marks holster wear. Rifling is great barrel is polished at the breach looking for $190.00 CASH MSRP is around $300.00 now most shops have them $239.99 great carry gun"
