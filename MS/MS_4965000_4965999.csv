The Ammo is currently still in the original boxes in sealed plastic to keep them perfect for long term storage,  these bullets were bought recently and aren't old,  I just sealed them up a few weeks ago but they can easily be unsealed in just a few seconds if you prefer and they are in their original 20 Round Boxes that I purchased them in.

4.) FEDERAL .45 ACP Law Enforcement Issue Ammo, I have a few 50 Round Boxes of these 230 grain Hollow Points. VERY ACCURATE AND EXCELLENT EXPANSION. Super Hard to find-no longer made-considered to be among the very best. I would never let them go before but want some 9mm Ammo of equal value or Sell for $40/box of 50 Rounds- I paid $46.50/box- the closest ammo that's in stores is $60 for 50 Rounds but normally only found in 20 Rd Boxes for $27-$28 but I'm not trying to make money or rip anyone off-just a honest, fair deal!

5.) Winchester Personal Defense .45 ACP 230 Grain Jacketed Hollow Points that shoot great and always expand reliably- this isn't the cheap stuff from Wal-Mart. I have (1) 50 Round Box I was Saving but Will Trade or Sell for Honest & Fair Price

6.) Federal/AE .40 S&W 165 Grain Ammunition- (1) 50 Round Box Available- Trade/Sell for Fair Price

7.) I am selling/trading a fully stocked U.S. Military Issue  Bandolier (Army Style Woodland Camo) in Excellent Condition with 6 Brand New 30 Round Magpul PMAG Magazines full of Brand New PMC Premium Brass Cased Ammunition which equals 180 .223  Bullets- this is a really convenient package for someone who wants to have some extra firepower ready to go at anytime- this setup would be very useful & convenient in many situations. ***If you have any questions about magazine fitment/compatibility please call your favorite gun shop or your firearm's manufacturer. AGAIN, I am willing to sell or trade this for the above mentioned items I am looking for. Cash Price will be $200 Firm because I am honestly losing $$$ @ $200 so please don't offer less- I prefer to trade but will sell & that's a fair price

8.) Brand New Glock .45  Magazines in Factory Glock Packaging for Full Size Glock 21(13 Round Capacity) & Compact Glock 30/30S/30SF(Flush Fitting 9 Round ideal for carry guns Magazines & 10 Round Magazines with the thicker baseplate) & I have Adapters to make the Compact G30 Accept the Longer G21 Magazine and have no gap between the bottom of the gun & the longer magazine from the full size Pistol for a seamless look while increasing the capacity of your G30 by 3-4 Rounds. The Adapters simply slip on the magazine and off just as easily- no tools or modifications required.

9.) I have Adapters to make full size magazines fit the smaller Sub-Compact Glock Model 26, 27, 29, 30, 33 Pistols in 9mm/10mm/.40/.45/ 357 Sig Pistols. This means you can increase your Glock 26 9mm Capacity from 10 Rounds to 17 Rounds,  the G27. 40 Capacity increases from 9 Rounds to 15 Rounds, G29 10mm Capacity increases from 10 rds to 15 Rounds,  the Glock 30 .45's Capacity increases by 3-4 depending on which clip you already have,  and the G33  .357 Sig's Capacity increases from 10 Rounds to 15 Rounds- this is very simply accomplished by simply sliding a X-Grip Adapter down over the Full Size Clip & Investing it into your Sub-Compact Pistol. This can easily be reversed by simply sliding the adapter off of the magazine and everything goes back to normal, you can switch back and forth several times in the same day if you find it necessary, I have switched back and forth in the same day a few times due to certain situations and it is very handy because when you insert the full size clip into the sub compact pistol you then have a full size grip and its just like holding a full size so really in a way it's like having two guns in one except for the barrel is shorter on the sub-compact pistols of course but that is the only difference physically in size, of course the larger grip allows you to have much better control over the gun and you can actually get a proper two handed grip just like with a full size pistol so I think these adapters are great and have some extras so I'm offering them for sale or trade as well, if interested just email me and we can figure something out.

10.) I have a brand new, wooden gun cabinet with a glass front door to display your guns,  there are several shelves inside of the cabinet and a locking you're at the bottom of the cabinet to keep pistols, ammunition, or other supplies in. The glass has a deer scene etched on the lower corner of the door, it looks really nice but it isn't huge and doesn't take up the whole glass section.  I ordered this from a local furniture company and it was not cheap because it is a high quality, well built cabinet but I do not have room for it and will take a big loss. And if anyone is interested I will give you a great deal, and once again I'm willing to sell or trade, just make me an offer on it.

EMAIL ME FOR A QUICK RESPONSE. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME AND READING MY AD- JUST CONTACT ME WITH YOUR INFO AND WHAT TYPE OF DEAL YOU'RE INTERESTED IN & WELL WORK IT OUT. THANKS AGAIN & HAPPY HOLIDAYS! THANKS AGAIN!!!"

The XDS currently has rubberized Talon Grips installed which can easily be removed if you prefer the feel of the factory grips. This hand gun is in great condition and shoots extremely well for its size. It has seen less than 250 rounds through it and its main function has been bed side table duty. The slim frame makes it extremely easy and comfortable to carry IWB. I have additional pictures if interested. I am not willing to sell the mags separately this is package deal and will be sold as such. I am not willing to ship this so a FTF transaction only, buyer must have a NC CCW or purchase permit and a valid NCDL. I will also require a bill of sale to be signed at time of sale.

These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system."

I am normally not one to post non-firearms related items, but with Christmas coming up, I figured someone might be interested in an iPad to trade for ammo.

This is an iPad Mini Wifi I bought a while ago, but decided to go to a full sized iPad Air. I have used this less than 2 hours total, and everything is there as new. It has always been in the case with a Tech Armor screen protector. Better than new. Full factory reset.

Included in the trade/sale is the iPad Mini, red case, installed Tech Armor screen protector, additional un-installed Tech Armor screen protector, and everything else that comes with the iPad from the factory. This will make a great gift. The recipient will never know this wasn't brand new."

 The most popular rifle sold by RWS, this German rifle will keep you shooting accurately and powerfully for decades. While it doesn't have some of the frills that more expensive guns have, it goes head-to-head where it really counts! The well-balanced hardwood stock makes it easy to hold and shoot the RWS 34. Quality is evident in other places, too: a two-stage adjustable trigger, fiber optic sights (fully adj. rear) and a finely rifled barrel. No need to worry about cocking difficulty, as that's where this rifle really shines (just 33 lbs., although our own tests showed just 30 lbs.). Both calibers are ideal for plinking, paper targets and spinners. Like to hunt? The .177 cal. should be your choice for small game and pests. If you're a serious airgunner on a budget, the RWS 34 was made for you!"

Comes with 1 16"" barrel - gas system, bolt less than 200 rds  and another 20"" barrel - unfired with new unfired gas system and bolt assembly.

CMAG and light NOT INCLUDED 
Pictured with a CA compliant non-pistol grip sleeve (removable with a tool for use in other states or with a bullet button)

This rifle, based on the Stoner 63 system is an excellent system that is a collector's item no longer in production. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Armament_M96_Expeditionary

This rifle comes with the long Picatinny rail that is removable as well as iron sights.  With the correct conversion kit, you can convert it to the Bren gun configuration for a top fed rifle.  

It accepts all AR type mags and is a novel, modular design.  Parts are rare and expensive, with less than 3500 units ever produced.  This one comes with two sets of gas systems, bolt assemblies and barrels.  One set of which is unfired and brand new.

The adjustable piston gas system is adjustable and can be dialed in for different ammo AND recoil characteristics.  A true pleasure to shoot as it has a very gentle recoil of the long stroke piston, adjustable gas AND a sweet two stage trigger.  

Although barrels are marked .223 Remington but are all chambered to accept 5.56 NATO (this is per the factory)

Cash only.  Local preferred through FFL dealer.   May trade for a .308 AR10 style, FAL, Bolt gun preferred plus cash
I may consider selling the spare barrel and parts separately but prefer to sell the entire system whole.

Only one cure for that: getting a fucking sick motorcycle. A 2001 Harley Davidson Sportster. This black lady will get you to work like a full-blown go hard, transport you and your shotgun through the zombie apocalypse, and give you a new platform for barreling down the boulevard with the wind tearing at your clothes screaming, ""I AM ALIVE!"" on the way to fucking bikram yoga.

Runs like corn through a goose. New plugs, wires and oil less than 500 miles ago. Good tires on the old girl, because you don't deprive a classy lady of classy shoes. I gave her a new belt because she needed some fucking jewelry. 

She also has new peanut tank, biltwell mini apes, straight pipes, cobra seat, air cleaner, taillight and a 21"" laced front rim. I also put on enclosed progressive shocks for that old school look. I changed a lot about this bike but have kept all the stock parts . 

Roughly 17k miles on her and she needs nothing. 

Electric start, push start, you name it.

I live in tacoma and if you need help getting this lady home you know I have a truck and ramps.


$3800 OBO gets you the Black Lady, extra parts, a helmet. shop manual, a quart of oil (plus all the oil that's up in her right now), a full tank of Gas, some links to my favorite YouTube videos, a short story about robots, a cup of coffee with me, and whatever kind of donut you want.

I would like to trade for an AK or AR rifle of equal value. I will consider other trades. The worst I can do is say no.

Cash is preferred but select trades are possible w the rest in cash.  

More details:

Decided to sell only 1 MUM which is  pictured below. In the past three weeks, I bought two MUMS from a doctor's estate, and a new Thermal so thought I would sell one of the MUMS. This is how it came to me before taking one off to sell. I am using the helmet and mount w the one I am keeping.






 If you are in central Ark, a Colt, Larue, or similar factory built mint AR is okay in trade up or down. I have a CHL and Ark DL as you should too. Otherwise a current G33 Eotech or IR lights, lasers IR illuminators plus cash is an idea. All cash is preferred. Pricing is firm as this is probably priced several hundred below its value.

If not gone soon, I will withdraw it so if interested, email.

Insight Technologies 3rd Generation Night Vision Mum

This came from a physician's estate.

Insight Technologies said two weeks ago that they will try to find original tube and system information for me and provide it, they have not done so to date and you should assume it will not come with a tube sheet. To my eye (having had about eight night vision units over the years, this is probably a 64 lp tube and is a good quality unit. It has a bright tube.

Looking ahead on a black night with tall trees and no light, where I could not see five feet in front of me, I could see easily down the winding dirt road (probably 100 yards before it turned) and clearly see deep in the forest on each side into the shadows. This was on a night with no visible moon, only starlight. 


This has a handful of dots  (5 or so) which are normal blemishes (visible as dots which are part of the normal manufacturing process and 2 thin hair marks, dust, or debris.

As you look through it, I  do not notice any normally, but in certain light and certain backgrounds, you can.

Here are pictures I took."

Runs like corn through a goose. New plugs, wires and oil less than 500 miles ago. Good tires on the old girl, because you don't deprive a classy lady of classy shoes. I gave her a new belt because she needed some fucking jewelry. 

She also has new peanut tank, biltwell mini apes, straight pipes, cobra seat, air cleaner, taillight and a 21"" laced front rim. I also put on enclosed progressive shocks for that old school look. I changed a lot about this bike but have kept all the stock parts . 

Roughly 17k miles on her and she needs nothing. 

Electric start, push start, you name it.

I live in tacoma and if you need help getting this lady home you know I have a truck and ramps.


$3800 OBO gets you the Black Lady, extra parts, a helmet. shop manual, a quart of oil (plus all the oil that's up in her right now), a full tank of Gas, some links to my favorite YouTube videos, a short story about robots, a cup of coffee with me, and whatever kind of donut you want.

The TP9SA is the next evolution of the popular TP series pistol. With a new trigger and frame assembly, the TP9SA has been redefined for the American shooter. The TP9SA features a striker decocker that allows for safer disassembly as the trigger does not need to be engaged to field strip the pistol. This feature gives the operator added reassurance of a safe platform. The added safety feature of not engaging the trigger is a huge benefit for the civilian and law enforcement market. The TP9SA also has a cold hammer forged barrel and the slide is cerakoted with 3-dot steel sights.The new frame design of the TP9SA contains several upgrades inspired by the feedback of military and law enforcement. The grip panels and front and rear grip have two different stippling styles to fully engage the shooters hand under any adverse condition. A longer trigger guard enables the operator to use the TP9SA while wearing hand protection. The grip design allows a slimmer feel while still containing an 18+1 capacity in 9mm.
