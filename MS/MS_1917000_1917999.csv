The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

This is not your off the shelf XD. This one has been to FailZero and the slide EXO Coated. See below for details. This is a proven technology that is seeing wide spread use in auto and semi-auto firearms. I'm asking $550.00 for this only because I want a new 1911 and have to sell this to make it happen. Email bharger at dragonmount.com  I'm in West Palm


FailZero parts are treated with  EXO Technology , a patented process that transforms a metal surface into a permanently dry-lubricious material that's harder than the substrate itself. It's dry-lubricious properties reduce friction so well, no wet lubrication is ever needed. And, EXO Technology dissipates heat so efficiently, operating parts run cleaner  and  cooler - a great benefit in semi-automatic and automatic weapons.


FailZero parts do require  cleaning , but at far less intervals then standard wet-lube parts. There is no lube to attract and hold grit, create crud and gunk, or thicken up.  FailZero parts will operate until too dirty to function.  Fouling can be brushed away with a steel brush with little effort. A normal cleaning schedule is suggested even with FailZero.


FailZero parts have been  thoroughly tested  by the U.S. Department of Defense, by law enforcement d epartments nationwide, by rigorous internal testing, and by tactical training centers . Much of the test data is proprietary under military secrecy provisions. FailZero parts are currently in use by SWAT teams, security agencies, and by military troops under battlefield conditions. Other EXO treated parts are used in military advanced weapons systems, mortar tubes and components, missile testing systems, and more. And, FailZero parts are guaranteed for life


Unlike films, conventional coatings and applied lubricants, it will never rub off, never flake off, never build up crud. EXO Technology eliminates wet-lubrication failures of critical components, giving you an “active weapon advantage” under all conditions. Proven by DoD tests, SWAT teams, tactical experts.


The patented EXOTM Technology used in FAILZERO upgrades has been thoroughly tested and proven effective by UCT Defense – a division of UCT Coatings and developer of EXO Technology – and by the U.S. Department of Defense. Test results include:


* 50,000 lube-free rounds on AR-15s. * 15,000 lube-free rounds on M9 pistols. * 18,000 lube-free rounds on carbine rifles. * 23,000 lube-free rounds on machine guns.

I bought these on-line back in April and paid $12.99 a box plus shipping and was happy to be able to get them. Since then I've sold several of my .22's so I have more ammo than I need for my personal use now.

Price for the 1000 rounds is $140, and I will not go any lower, so no need to ask. I will stash these in my safe for the future if I can't get what I have in them. This is a FTF transaction with pickup in the Valrico/Brandon area. I do not want to ship as it's a hassle these days. You must be at least 21 to purchase. Thanks for looking."

The rifle has only seen about 50 rounds down the barrel, so it is in excellent, like-new condition. It comes with 1 aluminum PTR brand 10rd mag, 3 polymer Thermold 20rd mags, and a hard case. The rifle is not your typical PTR with a skinny barrel. It is deadly accurate, and the recoil is softer than an SKS--It really is a light shooter for being a .308. It comes with the aluminum tactical handguard installed. If you are not familiar with PTR, they are an American company that produces HK-style rifles in house on real HK machines using HK blueprints. They are about as close to the real deal as you can get without dropping $3k for a collector's rifle.

The stock has been refinished (not by me) and looks beautiful.  The barrel is marked 1932, no date on the receiver tang.  The bore is frosty, but it has 90% or better rifling and a good crown.  Not counter-bored, and it passes the bullet test with ease.  I can't remember off hand if the bolt matches the receiver; I will have to check when I get off work tonight.  I gave it a trigger job (polish the friction surfaces and shimmed the sear spring) and the trigger is smooth and crisp.  I don't have a trigger pull gauge, but I would say it is in the 4 or 5 pound range.  MUCH better than any factory nagant.  There is some pitting on the barrel and receiver in a few places, but no active rust.  You can't see any of the pitting while the rifle is assembled.  It is not severe enough to effect the safety or accuracy of the rifle; just thought I would mention it.  It was re-arsenaled somewhere along the line and looks brand new; the blueing (looks more like parkerizing) is 95% or better.  I can text pics after I get home from work tonight.  FTF only, I will not ship it.  $150 takes it.  Text me at: 317-529-seven two nine nine"

Springfield Armory® has just introduced a new 1911 designed for
people interested in shooting competitively. It is called— The RO™,
“Range Officer™”. The RO™ is designed to give the shooter
exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to
create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of
shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he
likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy
Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result
in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model,
at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs.

The Colt Match Target M4 uses a traditional direct-gas-impingement operating system with a rotating bolt. A 16.1-inch barrel with the M4 government profile is used. Rifling is 1:7-inch versus the 1:9-inch twist found in most AR variants on the market. Out front is a fixed gas compensator, which vents gas at a rearward angle to the left and right. 

The stock on this particular carbine is an M4-style, fixed version. It looks like a retractable stock, but it is non-adjustable. There are two mounting points on the stock for a sling; the slot below the buffer tube and the more traditional sling loop found at the toe. A standard AR pistol grip is used. 

Colt took the time to install a quality trigger group. It is not a fragile, half-pound trigger, but a solid, well-built unit that breaks cleanly without creep or stacking. 

The carbine is well-built, has a solid trigger and is reliable, as you would expect from a Colt. The Colt Match Target M4 Carbine is a great rifle, and one that I highly recommend.

If you have always dreamed of owning a German MP5 but could not afford the $3000 plus to pay for it you now have an alternative !!
The 522 is a close rendition of the venerable Heckler & Koch MP5. 
These are Very Close to the Weight & Feel of the Real HK 94 MP 5 and are an Extremely Well Built German rifles.
You will have noticed the recent trend by gun manufacturers to offer Replicas of Military long guns chambered in .22 LR. 
These guns have flown off the shelves for two reasons. 
First, the economic double wham of skyrocketing ammo prices and a never-ending recession has left many shooters feeling the need to lower costs by switching to .22LR.
Second it gives shooters the opportunity to train on a Weapon that Looks and Feels like its Big-Brother AR, AK, Sig, or H&K. 
OK, there’s a third reason – they also Look Pretty Darn Cool!

One of the more interesting designs on the market is the 522 by German Sport Guns (“GSG”) 
They are backed up by a two year warranty, owners info, multi adjustment tool and cleaning rod. 
Very Accurate ...Very Well Built...German Engineering at its finest and is a Cool Looking Gun. 
If you want something Different that not many people have...Than this is the Gun for you!!!

Great for Inexpensive Plinking, Collecting or for Police dept Tactical Training.

The Gun just needs the stock screwed together. They do this for shipping reasons.

If you are unfamiliar with this product hopefully I am are able to shed some light on the quality.

These are the real deal, clamp on spout and lid (none of the comifornia/EPA compliant garbage). These aren’t cheap Chinese steel tack-welded knockoffs either, they have multilevel certifications for hazardous area, hazardous materials, and several types of liquid storage from several entities and on top they are NATO compliant.
The design and materials have undergone extensive third-party testing (brutal torture tests is probably more accurate) that surpass the requirement levels for a list of industries and applications. In short they are as near to indestructible as can be with materials and manufacturing currently available in the world market (this is not an exaggeration).

The cans are airtight and water proof. They have been used by us personally to transport both diesel and regular gasoline, in one instance with two full cans lying flat on their sides in the trunk of a car with no leaks, drips, or even a slight hint of a gas smell.

1.	Designed according to DIN 7274 standards the can is made from 0.9 mm steel.
2.	To prevent internal rusting the lining is coated with a petrol resistant alkyd-ammonia paint.
3.	Powder coating provides anti-corrosion protection with a smooth, clean finish. 
4.	The ventilation port enables a steady pour and the ability to empty a full can in less than 25 sec.

Every can comes with one spout and mounting hardware."

I bought this gun new about a year ago but need money for school now. I LOVE this gun. If you have ever shot an H&K, you know they are worth the money. It is extremely accurate and comfortable to shoot. I changed the base plates of the magazines so it's perfect as a conceal and carry gun. I have never had this gun malfunction. The recoil on this gun is amazing. It snaps back right on target. You won't believe how fast you can shoot this gun and still hit bulls-eyes. Super accurate. This is the standard issue pistol for U.S. Border Patrol and various paramilitary organizations around the world.

See a review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGQWRZ-s5pY

If you shoot with friends, you will be the envy of everyone in the group with this gun. One of the 13-round magazines is labeled ""Restricted law enforcement/government use only,"" but it's perfectly legal to own if you can legally own a gun.

This is a .357 Magnum Mark I pistol from 1985. It has a 6"" Magnaported barrel and Millet adjustable sights  (white outline rear and bright orange front). It comes with one stainless mag and one blued mag. Comes with the original box, literature, cleaning rod, brush and gas system scraping tool. The gun has a ""stainless' appearance and that's where the story gets interesting.

The Desert Eagle serial numbers began at ""3000."" The suffix ""S"" was used for ""stainless guns."" This pistol is one of the first 100 ""stainless"" Desert Eagles to enter this country. According to Magnum Research, these old guns that were catalogued as ""stainless"" were actually cast stainless steel frames along with Satin Nickel plated barrels and slides (made of chromoly steel). This one has black accents and it looks sharp. It handles screaming full-power .357 loads like a champ and recoils like a 9mm pistol. It's a ton of fun to shoot; nobody has shot it without having a huge smile on their face afterwards. Someone in the past 30 years ground down the sharp edge inside the trigger guard on the right side of the frame. If you're looking for a solid shooter that looks great, this is it!

It isn't very common to come across the ""stainless"" MKI in .357MAG, let alone one with the Millet sights and Magnaport factory upgrades. I think it's safe to call it ""rare"" but this one is a shooting piece, not a collector's piece.

I don't want to sell it, but I would consider trades, plus or minus cash for:"

If you have always Dreamed of Owning a German MP5 but could not afford the $3000 plus to pay for it you now have an alternative !!
The 522 is a close rendition of the venerable Heckler & Koch MP5. 
These are Very Close to the Weight & Feel of the Real HK 94 MP 5 and are an Extremely Well Built German rifles.
You will have noticed the recent trend by gun manufacturers to offer Replicas of Military long guns chambered in .22 LR. 
These guns have flown off the shelves for two reasons. 
First, the economic double wham of skyrocketing ammo prices and a never-ending recession has left many shooters feeling the need to lower costs by switching to .22LR.
Second it gives shooters the opportunity to train on a Weapon that Looks and Feels like its Big-Brother AR, AK, Sig, or H&K. 
OK, there’s a third reason – they also Look Pretty Darn Cool!

One of the more interesting designs on the market is the 522 by German Sport Guns (“GSG”) 
They are backed up by a two year warranty, owners info, multi adjustment tool and cleaning rod. 
They are Quality Inspected Over and Over again before they ship. “See Inspection Tag on box”
Very Accurate ...Very Well Built...German Engineering at its finest and is a Cool Looking Gun. 
If you want something Different that not many people have...Than this is the Gun for you!!!

Great for Inexpensive Plinking, Collecting or for Police dept Tactical Training.

I'll lower the average asking cost and offer mine for less.  Somebody has to put a stop to this madness.

I can meet in Ortonville or Wixom (when I am there for work). I will not drive anywhere else to meet to make it more convenient for you, I am not flexible on price. Take it or leave it. I don't need to sell these and will happily shoot them myself if nobody can benefit.

http://www.hornady.com/store/Lock-N-Load-AP/

The Lock-N-Load AP with NEW EZject system loads at a rate of up to 500 rounds per hour, and features the quickest change-over of any progressive press.

The Lock-N-Load AP is a professional-grade, auto-indexing, 5-station progressive press that features Our patented Lock-N-Load bushing system as well as a host of other features -- detailed below -- that make it much more attractive than other, more expensive presses, such as the Dillon XL650.

Features:

EZject™ System

The EZject system delivers 100% reliable ejection of every cartridge, every time, without any adjustments.

Priming System

The Lock-N-Load AP can be changed from large to small primers as easy as 1-2-3.

Change the primer seater punch.

Change the primer shuttle.

Change the primer feed tube.

Case Activated Powder Drop

Case activated powder drop will dispense a powder charge ONLY when there is a cartridge case present. No more messes.

Quick Change Metering Inserts

The Lock-N-Load powder measure uses quick-change metering inserts that allow you to switch from one powder to another with the push of a button. Add one to each dieset for the ULTIMATE quick change-over.

Quick Change Lock-N-Load® Bushing Systems

The Lock-N-Load AP has a 5 station quick change bushing system, which allows the Lock-N-Load AP to be changed very quickly; from 223 to 45 in less than 5 minutes. Compare that to any other popular progressive presses on the market.

Universal Case Retainer Spring

The Lock-N-Load AP has an ingenious case retainer spring that allows you to quickly and easily remove and replace a case at any point in the loading process AND they are universal. Compare that to ""other"" progressives... they are not so progressive.

Automatic Indexing

Each station moves 1/2 a stage on the upstroke and 1/2 a stage on the down stroke and the up stroke, making for ultra-smooth function. This process is much smoother than presses that do all their indexing on the down stroke.

Large Capacity Hopper

A large capacity hopper comes standard with the Lock-N-Load AP Press. An extra large capacity hopper is available as an option.

This product comes with a life time factory warranty."

The new M-A1 pistol line continues this tradition, while featuring many detailed innovations.   

The integrated Picatinny rail, in the front of the frame, is a modern and internationally applicable solution to mount quickly and easily a variety of laser-aiming, or illumination devices. With a total weight of only 766 g, (27oz) the new M-A1 pistol is extraordinarily light.  

The unique trapezoid sight offers a new dimension in rapid target acquisition. The sight's shape guides the eye onto the target, and thus the target is captured exactly and quickly 

The new innovative grip offers unsurpassed ergonomics, which results in a natural pointability. It optimally supports the natural posture of the wrist during shooting. Improved adhesion is provided by the special surface design.

It's an old beater gun that works. I've shot it many times. Very small and fits in your front pocket. Hangs up sometimes as all Jiminez .22's do. Depends alot on which kind of .22ammo you use. It doesn't love hollow points, it will shoot and cycle them but the points are a little flatter...it prefers solid round nose ammo.

Such a snubbie has gone to just about every location on Earth, save perhaps Mt. Everest and the Marianas Trench. And for good reason The performance-to-weight package of a lightweight snubbie makes it a valued tool in emergency situations. This one, the Charter Arms Pink Lady, is your basic five-shot snubbie with a twist. The frame is made of 7075 aluminum alloy, and the barrel, cylinder and moving parts are made of stainless steel. The result is a 12-ounce package that is rated for +P ammunition. The name is a big clue; the aluminum frame is anodized pink.

Now, the rage for women shooters of late is to make things pink. Handguns, rifles, grips, all various shades of pink, for fashion and to make a statement. Guys, pay attention The pink does not rub off. In fact, if anything, it is an aid to cleaning. Powder residue that would not show on a blued gun will stand out on a pink one, and you’ll be able to do a better job of maintenance."

Up for sale is my New Never Fired Custom COLT 6940 here is some info on it along with the upgrades 

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, a Tactical flip up backup sight and a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.

BE CAREFULL!

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.
