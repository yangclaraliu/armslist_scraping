Combining the best features from the Taurus 800 Series, 24/7 Series and 24/7 OSS™, the new 24/7 G2 offers the best of all worlds. Features include “Strike Two” capability for incredible reliability, contoured thumb rests, a new trigger safety and balanced spring pressure for extraordinarily fast shooting. Check out the revolutionary, next-generation performance of the 24/7 G2 Compact. Available in 9mm, .40 cal. and .45 ACP with the features, accuracy and reliability of big brother. 


Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.


New Unique SA/DA Trigger System
The PT24/7 Pro Trigger system solves the double action/single action dilemma once and for all. Figure 1 shows the trigger at full rest. When a round is chambered, the trigger sets in single action mode with the trigger traveling freely to the crisp break point shown in figure 2. The trigger resets to DA mode until another round is chambered.

 The Mini Thermal Monocular (MTM) is a handled thermal imaging device with an integrated Laser Pointer. The thermal imaging capability of the MTM allows observation and target identification under adverse conditions including light rain, smoke, light snow, and low light to total darkness. Th e unit will not allow the user to see through glass, water, or heavy snow/rain. The integrated Laser Pointer provides for active target acquisition. The IR Laser Pointer provide for target acquisition in low light or complete darkness when used in conjunction with night vision devices. With the installed integrated camera, the MTM allows for acquisition, storage, download, and recall of view thermal images. Thermal images may also be transferred to a personal computer with the Image Adapter Cable.

 Export of Thermal Imaging Equipment or related accessories (such as manuals) is strictly regulated by the US Department of State in accordance with the guidelines of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). It is a major crime to ship or carry US manufactured thermal imaging devices outside the borders of the United States, punishable by fines and prison sentences. Ignorance of these regulations will not hold up in court. By purchasing thermal imaging equipment from TNVC, you attest that you will not attempt to export or carry this thermal imaging equipment outside the borders of the United States. Also, it illegal to allow a non-US Citizen to look through US Thermal Imaging Equipment, even on US soil. Again, this is a crime punishable by fines and prison sentences.

It has a 20” barrel and has the a2 style butt stock and carry handle. 

It has a Knights Armament front end which retail for $350 new. I really like it because it’s tactical, and has the ability to simply slide one of the small covers off the front or the side of the rail to attach anything that would fit onto a pictiany rail. For example lights, lasers, grips, or lots of other attachments. I also like it because it’s a little different than every other standard A2 rail out there on the firing line.

It comes with 2 30 round magazines. One is a Windowed pmag, and the other is a Thermold, and is marked LEO and Govt use only.  It will also come with a Blackhawk Tactical sling, and a carry padded carry case.

I bought it to compete in High-power matches but never got around to it.

I was asking $1200 cash( but price drop it to 1000).

Adapted from our very accurate and successful 24"" Varminter, the Predator Upper Receiver/Barrel Assembly's 20"" Fluted Extra Heavy Barrel is button rifled 1 x 8"" to stabilize the heavier 69-77 grain bullets that a predator hunter/caller would choose for bigger varmints and predators. This superb barrel features fluting for increased cooling and weight reduction; an 11 degree competition crown; 1"" diameter heavy profile under the handguard; custom match hybrid chamber with a tighter SAAMI Spec headspace from the shoulder of the chamber to the bolt face, and longer chamber throat or ""Leade"". This chamber accommodates 5.56mm ammunition without developing higher pressures encountered when firing 5.56mm ammo in a .223 chamber with shorter ""Leade"" (both calibers can be used safely). This Upper is sold complete with Bolt, Bolt Carrier and Charging Handle to ensure positive lockup between bolt and barrel extension. The Predator Upper also features a Vented Tubular Aluminum Free-Floater Forend with Bipod Stud (free-floats the barrel from the barrel nut forward) and B.M.A.S"

I bought it a few months ago, shot it probably 100-200 times, and its been safe kept ever since. I have no use for it, and I'm in a tight spot financially.

The Burris Fullfield II scope is an enhanced model of the Fullfield version. It boasts a more forgiving sharpness and eye clarity for positioning fore and aft, and left and right. Using modern alloys and machining techniques the weight has been reduced by 20%-25% without affecting durability or optical performance.

Most scopes have three or four potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area. The Fullfield II has but two. These leak paths are sealed with special quad seals rather than low-tech O-rings. To change magnification, turn the entire eyepiece, which is now integral to the power ring. A European-style adjustable eyepiece is easy to use and requires no locking mechanism.

Burris has moved the adjustment system rearward to better accommodates mounting situations. Also, the eyepiece is shorter, allowing even more mounting flexibility.

The Fullfield II has also improved long-range marksmanship. The lower part of the crosshair has ballistic lines that compensate for bullet drop from 100 yards to 500 yards for many common hunting cartridges-it's called the Ballistic Plex.

This is one of the more popular scopes; it is extremely versatile and complements the finest rifles.

This pistol was set-up by its original owner to do NRA Bianchi Cup or Steel Challenge shoots. This thing was frighteningly clean when I got it - if it was shot more than a dozen times I'd be surprised. I got this on a trade for some other stuff several months back during the NYSafe Act chaos. While I would have an interest in NRA Action Shooting - we don't have any clubs that do that kind of shooting around here. In Central New York all we have are a handful of IDPA Clubs and the rest is all old men shooting Trap League. So what I have here is a revolver without a country. I'd say if you have an interest in NRA Action Shooting, hunting with a revolver or just want a blaster that has zero recoil with 38s for training folks this might be up your alley.

I have the same rifle I shoot and they are great for the money.  If you are headed to Afghanistan, spend twice the money and get a Colt, but if you are like me and a hobbyist that enjoys shooting and customizing and AR buy this one and spend the other $$ on ammo.  Gun is accurate and I have had no FTF.  Only reason I am selling this one is I bid on 3 and won 2 not thinking I would.  Just looking to get my money back out of it and pass a good deal along to someone else but will not take a loss, I'll keep it."

This is a very fair price vs. what ammunition is currently going for online and is close to retail price!!  If you're in need of this ammo then this saves you the hassle of the search.  I've accumulated this and more, that I have for sale if anyone is interested, by going to stores almost everyday in search for 22 ammunition, not to gouge prices!  The little mark up I do have on these is to cover my gas and time spent.

I'm selling an interesting Lee-Enfield sporter that I've had for a while. Details below:


- This gun is obviously a factory re-arsenal that was sold out of service in the 60's: the action and barrel have matching numbers, while the bolt, magazine, and rear sights all match each other. Some unit armorer obviously took donor parts from one gun and mated them to the action and barrel of another. This was very common in post-war, but it's unusual that there are only two different sets of serials. Most FTR's had parts pulled from bins. 

- This gun hasn't been irrevocably altered; the only thing modified beyond repair is the front forestock, when they chopped it down. Barrel's still there, sights, even the buttplate. The buttstock has a hole drilled for a sling swivel, easily filled in. 

- Chambered in .303 British. This is a British WW2 rifle, not a 69's or 70's 7.62 Ishapore. 

- At 150 yards, it's just point and click at that range for a bullseye. Whether you're hunting or target shooting, this gun works for you. Feeds and ejects spent casings very well, the extractor claw is perfect and the mag lips are in great shape. 

- This Enfield is perfect for hunting, target shooting, and would make an awesome project gun for someone wanting to get into Milsurp restoration. Enfields are notoriously easy to break down and re-assemble. No rust in this thing all. 

-Comes with WWII-correct oiler, two stripper clips,  cleaning pull-through, and sling. I'll throw in a nosecap and some front bands if you're wanting to restore it.

Willing to drive a reasonable distance from my home in Cleveland to make a deal. Face to face preferred, but I'll ship this to any FFL or C&R for a flat $20 on top of whatever price or agreement we come to. I'll take a decent cash offer, but would rather trade.

They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail. 7.62X51mm NATO (308 WIN), BARREL 16.25”, 6 GROOVE, 1:11 RIGHT HAND TWIST, PARKERIZED. 22 STAGE MILITARY TRIGGER, 5-6LBS. 1-5RD MAGAZINE.

Hard Cast Wadcutter (1,300 fps) - 20 Round Box","azusa, California, United States",$ 34,"Listed On: Friday, July 12, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=283

 This full profile wad cutter hard cast 44 magnum load was designed for the owners of 44 magnum firearms that choose to use those firearms for self defense against humans. This load is specifically designed to permanently and quickly disable humans. The big flat wad cutter nose crushes living tissue, unlike mushroomed bullets that are slightly rounded on the nose and tend to slip and slide through living tissue. The crushing action of the flat nose keeps penetration straight and when penetration is straight, it is generally very deep—deep enough to obtain full penetration on the largest human from any angle. The hard cast nose will not deform at these velocities so the nose profile remains constant (flat, with a sharp shoulder) along with bullet path and terminal damage. Noted NYPD “stake out” officer Jim Cirillo used full profile wad cutters in his 38 SPL revolvers because they incapacitated his human targets with certainty. See our item 20D. (38 SPL) The light weight bullet at moderate velocity aids in low recoil for fast follow-up shots.

Unlike our other Anti-Personnel 44 magnum loads, this one utilizes a hard cast bullet, which will not mushroom and the resulting penetration is very deep. Expect at least 24 inches of straight-line penetration in mammalian tissue, thus allowing this load to also serve well on small to medium sized game such as deer, black bear and even elk. This hard cast construction keeps your bore from being substantially lead fouled even after hundreds of rounds.

We’ve utilized a flash suppressed powder to the shooter will not be blinded by his/her own gunfire should you be required to drop the hammer in low light.

Note our real world velocities taken from stock over-the-counter firearms. We prefer to establish advertised velocities from real-world firearms and not from extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocities. You know what you are getting in the real world, where it matters, with Buffalo Bore ammunition."

The compensator consists of two longitudinal openings in the barrel and slide of the pistol arranged in ""V-position"". This minimizes front sight blackening through powder gases.The GLOCK 19 is ideal for versatile use through reduced dimensions compared with the standard pistol size. With the proven caliber of 9x19, it has found worldwide distribution in security services. In addition to being used as a conventional service weapon, it is suitable for concealed carry or as a backup weapon. For instance, many of the elite pilots of the USAF trust the GLOCK 19 for their efficient defense in emergency situations. The good thing about a compensated glock  is you can always make it a standard glock by just changing the barrel."

I even have womens vest for your wife, girlfriend, or sister.  





vests in lot include pointblank, second chance, safariland, and paca.





I also have brand new tactical outter carriers you can purchase and put them in for an additional $50.00. 





There were some vests that were beyond wear so i stripped them down to just the ballistic panels.  Put them in a backpack for additional protection for your child for school, put them in car door panels, walls, the possibilities are really endless. I have TONSSSSS of these panels so i can cut you a great deal.  Buy these panels and go purchase your own carriers and resell them to make some serious $$$. I have so many vests that I can sell them for extremely cheap meaning you can make money off of me!! $25.00 per panel. 





The problem with these vests is majority of people have heard of the 5 year manufacturing warranty.  This is SOLELY FOR LE PURPOSES and is an INSURANCE POLICY. armor DOES NOT GO BAD . i will provide examples of vests from the 1980's that i have taken to the range and shot with all types of calibers. they protect FLAWLESSLY and as intended.





these are just old vests.  i also have brand new vests for a higher price. we can discuss that if interested.

Product Information:
The Aimpoint PRO (Patrol Rifle Optic) was designed with the input of current and former professionals to create the most dynamic Red Dot sight available. Featuring band-pass lens coating, the PRO is compatible with every generation of night vision devices and provides a crystal clear 1x image for quick target acquisition in close quarter situations. The modular QRP2 mount securely attaches to standard picatinny rails and includes a removable spacer that provides optimal height for co-witness with iron sights on carbine style weapons. Additionally, the QRP2 incorporates a torque limiting knob to completely eliminate over tightening. You won't need to worry about turning the battery on and off with the PRO. The 3-year battery life allows you to turn the unit on out of the box and leave it on for an always ready sight. Other features include a see through ocular lens cap and standard objective flip-up lens cap that are both recessed to prevent impact damage, a rugged 30mm tube, threaded objective bell for use of ARD (Anti-Reflective Device), 4 Night vision settings and 6 daylight settings, battery and adjustment cap retainers to prevent them from being lost in the field, and a ten year personal use warranty.

Battery, allen wrenches for adjustment, pressure pad included in original box.  Had it mounted on .223.  Green laser is very bright and visible at 100yds in daylight.  It maintains zero pretty good......and the battery lasts a very long time.  I got a high dollar red dot sight so I'm shaving some weight off my carbine.  NCStar is sort of know for cheap imitations.  So be it.  I don't even know what I paid for it a few years ago but I figure it might be worth my asking price.  Make an offer.......try it out.

Built from premium parts kits, most with matching #’s. All have chrome lined barrels with excellent bores. Todays new made AK type rifles do not have the same quality as these military issue rifles. Because of barrel import bans modern AK’s are sold with ordinary steel barrels which wear & corrode faster than chrome barrels. Those with original European fire control parts require US magazine follower. Others I have with US triggers take any hi cap mag. Each gun supplied with 2 of the correct mags. Universal US made followers available @ $6ea. 
Available with or without forward pistol grip.

We can also build to suit  buyer’s preferences.
First buyers can select from among the 4 rifles.

We must receive a signed FFL from your dealer before we ship. You have 7 days to get the funds and the FFL to us. Buyer is responsible to ensure firearm is legal in area. Will accept Paypal or Money Order. Sorry no trades.
If you are buying an AK it is important to know what you are buying. ATF stopped import of certain parts of the AK, most importantly the barrels. Therefore most of your AK 47's today will have miss matched US made barrels, some chrome lined some not. These days it is hard to find an AK which is built right, IE:  with the correct high quality imported chrome lined barrels and euro trigger parts because the parts are all but gone."

3.	Upon contact via armslist, you respond typical from an outlook.com account (example is FT1 FT1 REDACTED) in which you STRIP OUT the armslist link and subsequently disable to the link so it can no longer be found in armslist.
4.	Your email responses are “canned” and repeated often
a.	Initial response:  Yes still available, where are you located?
b.	Upon letting you know a location within the state you mention in the initial post, you say “Oh, I’m in another state – like Pennsylvania or Texas”
c.	Final response – “Am in Pennsylvania, how would you like to proceed? price includes shipping to your FFL,do you have an FFL dealer that you  work with?  price is $1500”
5.	Upon asking for your phone number, you go silent – do you really get people to send you money???

TIPS:
ALWAYS recommend to go through a FFL for the transfer. make cashiers payable to seller and send to FFL doing transfer. Call FFL 1st and make sure on deal.


I hope you get caught and I’ll do my utmost to make that happen if I ever have a chance.  I’ll be posting your method in Armslist as a scam alert."
