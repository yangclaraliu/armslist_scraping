I can only post one image apologies i can send more if interested. 

I have a HiPoint in 40 S&W and a Ruger SR22 up for trade or  for sale if you have nothing to trade. Depending on the trade I could add cash. The Ruger SR22 was bought 2 years ago and I don't shoot it as much as I thought I would. Maybe 600 rounds of CCI minimags have been shot through it. It comes with 3 total magazines, a blackhawk nylon holster, and all of the items that came to with the pistol when new. As well as aprox 600 rounds of CCI minimags, the box with winchester on it was filled from a bulk container of CCI ammo. 

The Hi Point was a backup home defense gun for the wife while she was living up North for schooling. It filled that role well, and now we never shoot it and its taking up space in the safe. It comes with 2 magazines total and a holster thats not great but doable for the need of protecting the trigger guard while stowed. Will only sell to CCW holders or at an FFL at your cost."

And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol.

For those who don't know, these guns come with a lifetime warranty from the factory (which drew me to this one in the first place) and they make a good entry-level 1911. Please also check out the Imgur link, it has an album with more photos. http://imgur.com/a/jqPc5

The Specialist is one of the newest additions to the Dan Wesson stable. When police departments approached us to build them a more reliable, durable 1911 to replace the ones they had been carrying, we developed a model just for them. The additions that made it ideal for law enforcement also make it perfect for home defense, so we gladly offer it for sale to the public.

DW Specialist Black – .45 ACP
retail $2,012.00
 Built to satisfy the demands of law enforcement, the Specialist excels at defensive use.

A full-size 1911, the Specialist is chambered in .45 and loaded with features to satisfy a public servant’s special requirements. The forged stainless steel slide wears our popular Clark-style serrated rib with a single amber tritium dot in the rear sight and a green lamp with white target ring in front.

The frame sports an integral 1913 Picatinny, 25 LPI front strap checkering, undercut trigger guard and recessed slide stop to enable the installation of laser grips. Equipped with an ambidextrous thumb safety, extended magazine release and detachable two-piece magwell, the Specialist is operator-friendly. It is finished off with a set of G10 VZ Operator II grips that force the hand into the beavertail and hold it there.

The Specialist ships with two 8-round magazines with bump pads and is available in either a matte stainless finish or our Duty Black finish, which makes for an especially hardy pistol that scoffs at everyday wear and tear."

The medium grip strap has been stippled, otherwise nothing else has been messed around with.  It’s IDPA SSP legal, so it’s legal for just about any shooting sport.  The thing shoots great and never gave me any problems.   

Also included: 
(8) magazines in great shape and (2) that were in a moving box with a bottle of sonic cleaning solution that exploded on them.  I’m sure they still work, but they aren’t as pretty now.

(3) Comp-Tac single mag pouches
-Original case and whatever paperwork it came with.  
*Might possibly include a spare mainspring, trigger bar and fiber optic tube – If I can find the box those are packed away in.  


Looking at my records, I’ve got over $1300 into everything.  Cash only, no trades.  Must be legally able to purchase a firearm and willing to show valid WI ID.  If you’re interested, we can meet somewhere public so you can check it out.  Or I’ll bring it to a range for you to shoot it, if you pay the range fees and for my gas.  I’ll meet anywhere around the Green Bay area.  Been dicked around with too much by no-shows in the past to go beyond that.  

Hit me up with any questions.  If all you do is email me with a phone number and ask me to text you, you will be ignored.  If you send me lowball offers or other unwelcomed “advice”, you will be ignored.  Any good jokes or pictures of attractive (human) women will be carefully reviewed and appreciated."

I am relatively new to holster making but my customers from round one were all very satisfied.  Since I am trying to pack in experience and refine my skills, I am making custom holsters on the cheap.  The 380 Wallet holsters are $30, Inside the Waist with clip is $35, and prices vary from there depending on complexity, hardware, and amount of stitching.  

I use standard large or small clips, but if you can send me a URL to the clip you want, I can order it.  Custom means custom.  Send me a picture of a holster and any changes you want made to it and I will take a crack at it.   

I am set up with molds for the following sub-compacts:  Ruger LCP (w or wo CT), Glock 42, M&P Shield, Springfield XDs, and Kel-tec PF9 (w or wo CT). I am also taking pre-orders for Glock 43. My blue gun should be here by the end of next week. If you have a pistol that I do not have access to, I have a receipt form, you can drop your pistol off at my house or stop by for molding and come back when it is dried and sealed. 

Please note, I cannot make a proper template or do a proper job fitting and stitching without the pistol on hand.  I can come close but I can do much better work with the pistol.  Start to finish 3-4 days or wait while I mold 20 minutes and come back next day for the holster.

I don't typically mold the fine details to reduce friction but can certainly do so.  Again, custom means custom.

Please check out the link to my Google Drive to see more pictures of my work including a 4 position holster that I made for my CZ-07. 90, 77, and 60 degrees as well as 77 high and tight. Yes, I patted myself on the back for that one.

Thank you,

Yugoslavian PAP M59/66: Added 22 mm grenade launcher which appears visually like a flash suppressor or muzzle brake on the end of the barrel. Front sight has a fold-up ""ladder"" for use in grenade sighting. When the grenade sight is raised, the gas system is automatically blocked and the action must be manually cycled—rifle grenades must be fired with special blank cartridges, and this feature helps ensure that the gas pressure is not wasted on cycling the action. The gas system is not automatically unblocked when the sight is folded, however, and must be manually opened to again allow semi-automatic operation.[14] Barrel was not chrome-lined. Both the grenade launcher and grenade sight are NATO spec. Stock is typically made from beech wood."

I am relatively new to holster making but my customers from round one were all very satisfied.  Since I am trying to pack in experience and refine my skills, I am making custom holsters on the cheap.  The 380 Wallet holsters are $30, Inside the Waist with clip is $35, and prices vary from there depending on complexity, hardware, and amount of stitching.  

I use standard large or small clips, but if you can send me a URL to the clip you want, I can order it.  Custom means custom.  Send me a picture of a holster and any changes you want made to it and I will take a crack at it.   

I am set up with blue guns for the following sub-compacts:  Ruger LCP (w or wo CT), Glock 42, M&P Shield, Springfield XDs, and Kel-tec PF9 (w or wo CT). I am also taking pre-orders for Glock 43. My blue gun should be here by the end of next week.  If you have a pistol that I do not have access to, I have a receipt form, you can drop your pistol off at my house or stop by for molding and come back when it is dried and sealed. 

Please note, I cannot make a proper template or do a proper job fitting and stitching without the pistol on hand.  I can come close but I can do much better work with the pistol.  Start to finish 3-4 days or wait while I mold 20 minutes and come back next day for the holster.

I don't typically mold the fine details to reduce friction but can certainly do so.  Again, custom means custom. Located in Omaha North of Village Pointe.  I can ship for $5 if needed.

Please check out the link to my Google Drive to see more pictures of my work including a 4 position holster that I made for my CZ-07. 90, 77, and 60 degrees as well as 77 high and tight. Yes, I patted myself on the back for that one.

Thank you,

I have a TC Hawkins for sale for parts.  PARTS ONLY. The barrel is thrown in extra. The barrel around the nipple seems to be plugged, not sure.  To be safe, I dumped oil in the nipple hole to make the gun inert if there was a charge. 

The TC Hawkin parts (without barrel) alone are easily worth $200-250 looking at eBay. Especially the stock alone with brass storage in stock goes for $150+. This is a quality heavy duty factory TC Hawkins walnut stock too with nice grain pattern.

FTF in Allendale. I do not feel comfortable shipping this gun the way it is with the current barrel condition...unless you don't want the barrel, then I can ship everything else.

Thanks."

This firearm speaks for itself. 

If you are not familiar with S&W's short time spent producing all-metal firearms, the M645 is a handgun that is the dad to the M4506. The rarity is justified by all firearms manufacturers producing guns that have polymer (plastic) parts. You will not find any polymer on this gun. It is a double action modern take on the classic 1911. Grips and extended magazines are widely available for this firearm. Think of it as the Harley Davidson Fatboy motorcycle of the 1911 world. UNIQUE CHARACTER. I am selling to pay for eye surgery. 

If you purchase the firearm, you will also get a duty holster (faux leather which I believe to be Bianchi), 2 8 round steel factory magazines, a nylon double mag holster, a trigger lock, and a nylon case. This firearm was detail stripped and cleaned by an armorer and was not shot since. My asking price is 550$ OBO.

It is a neat gun and remains, to this day, my only bulls eye, via iron sights. Alas, I have made quite a few purchases over the past few weeks and the Swiss caliber (7.5x55mm) is the odd man out.

Selling a Chinese Norinco SVD Dragunov in 7.62x51. This rifle is numbers matching.The serial number on the scope matches the number on the scope can and on the left side of the buttstock as it should. The rifle is in excellent condition and has been very well cared for. I would say that this rifle may be brand new and only test fired at the factory. The minty bolt face and receiver rails tell me that no more than 10 rounds have been fired through this rifle. This will ship with the entire original package as it entered the country nearly 30 years ago (scope, scope can, TWO magazines, cleaning rod, oil bottle, scope screwdriver, sight tool, cleaning kit, scope accessories, Chinese sling, and hard case.) It should be noted that this comes with the original Chinese SVD sling that is VERY RARE. It is a copy of a Russian SVD sling but the hardware is painted over in olive drab. Anoother thing to note is that this is the original case these rifles came in. This is an investment quality, NIB or near NIB, Chinese Dragunov. Must ship to a local FFL dealer  for $40."

Selling a Chinese Norinco SVD Dragunov in 7.62x51. This rifle is numbers matching.The serial number on the scope matches the number on the scope can and on the left side of the buttstock as it should. The rifle is in excellent condition and has been very well cared for. I would say that this rifle may be brand new and only test fired at the factory. The minty bolt face and receiver rails tell me that no more than 10 rounds have been fired through this rifle. This will ship with the entire original package as it entered the country nearly 30 years ago (scope, scope can, TWO magazines, cleaning rod, oil bottle, scope screwdriver, sight tool, cleaning kit, scope accessories, Chinese sling, and hard case.) It should be noted that this comes with the original Chinese SVD sling that is VERY RARE. It is a copy of a Russian SVD sling but the hardware is painted over in olive drab. Anoother thing to note is that this is the original case these rifles came in. This is an investment quality, NIB or near NIB, Chinese Dragunov. Must ship to a local FFL dealer for $40."
