Please make sure the whole listing before taking any action.

Up for sale is an Advanced Armament Corporation (AAC) MPW rifle chambered in .300 AAC Blackout.  This rifle is used but in “like new” condition with less than 50 rounds fired through it since it was purchased.  

The MPW functions like any other 5.56/.223 AR-15 rifle.  Unlike those rifles, it is chambered for the .300 AAC Blackout round.  The barrel is 16” long with a 1 in 7 twist.  Conveniently, .300 AAC Blackout can be loaded in your standard AR-15 magazines, meaning you do not need to buy new magazines to use this rifle.

This rifle is a high-quality AR-15 pattern firearm with many quality parts that come standard.  This rifle is built with the following included:

-	AAC Blackout T51 flash suppressor
-	MagPul MOE+ rubberized pistol grip
-	MagPul Compact/Type Restricted (CTR) carbine stock
-	Knight’s Armament URX III free-float quad rail with integrated flip-up front sight, with three (3) Knight’s Armament rail covers included
-	Geissele Super Semi-Automatic Trigger (arguably the best AR-15 trigger on the market)
-	Nickel Boron Bolt Carrier Group

Additionally, I will throw in the Bravo Company short angled vertical fore-grip as an added bonus.  Rifle will come with one (1) 30-round MagPul PMag.  Rifle will come with original box and associated literature.  The rifle you see is the one listed here – it will be sold in the condition you see it in.  While it is like new, it is still a used rifle, so it is sold as-is (I guarantee it will function perfectly, it might just have a few scratches).

I am willing to do an in-person sale with New Hampshire residents.  If you live outside of New Hampshire (or in-state but would rather have the rifle shipped), the cost is $25.00 from my FFL to your FFL.  If this rifle is illegal to own in your jurisdiction, then it is your job to know that and not attempt to buy it.  I will not ship the rifle anywhere it is illegal. If the rifle needs to be shipped, I accept payment via money order only.

If you have any questions that are not answered here, please feel free to contact me.  I am willing to answer any legitimate questions.  That being said, please bear in mind the following: I will not accept an offer less than the starting/listed price (that IS my lowest price).  DO NOT OFFER TO TRADE ME ANYTHING UNLESS IT IS LISTED AT THE BOTTOM UNDER ""WANTS"" (I DEFINITELY do not want your old rusted snowmobile). Any e-mails/messages that make lowball offers or ask for nonsensical trades will be deleted without a reply given.

(2) mags, box w/ all papers, target, clean rod. This gun is very clean and near new looking. Manhurin actually built the post war German made Walthers up to mid1980's. Walther factories were destroyed during the war so they contracted Manhurin to build the post war ppks. When Contract was up Walther contracted with Interarms to build the ppk/s in the U.S.. Manhurin, upset to lose contract continued to build them under their own name for awhile until a settlement was agreed upon with Walther. These are better than both S&W & Interarms PPK/S guns.

I have a really nice 2007 Yamaha YZ450f in excellent condition. I purchased this bike from a friend that needed the money who put over 700 into rebuilding the motor last year. I already have 2 other bikes so i dont need 3. I want close to what i paid for it so I am willing to sell for $2800 or partial trade for a nice full size high end 1911 or winchester 30-30 lever action rifle.

-It has new head valves
-New timing chain
-New timing chain tensioner
-Both front and rear sprockets are new
-New chain
-The piston was inspected when taken apart and is in perfect condition. 
-black excel wheels
-tires have about 70-80% tread left
-I have black plastics on it now, but I also still have the blue set the bike came with when it was bought new. The blue set are in near perfect condition, besides a few scratches on one of the rear pieces. 

I am now the 3rd owner. I am pretty firm on the price but may consider a REASONABLE cash over. PLEASE NO LOW BALL OFFERS! I am not an idiot. I am in no rush to get rid of and I can wait until mid summer when I can easily get 3000 or more. The only trade I will consider is if you have a really nice, high end, full size 1911, 30-30 lever action or .308 AR10, otherwise no trades. And partial trades only, no straight across trades unless what you have is actually worth the same. I will pay for all transaction fees at a local dealer near me or in near the middle of where you live. Will deliver for an extra $50.

I've looked around and there are not many of these around at all. I believe this model to be a XV111A. It takes down just like a 1911 and it has both a grip safety and thumb safety the gun will not fire if the mag is not in which is another safety feature. There is also railing/ribs on top of the slide. The barell is threaded so it can accept attachments and so forth. Sights are adjustable. It comes with 1 mag that holds 8. The grips are made of a hard brown plastic with black streaks going through it, they look quite nice so I didnt have them replaced. Bluing is 95% and it was made in 1972 imported by stoeger. This gun is made of high quality pieces and guns made by Llama in the '60s-'70s were considered to be the best of Llama. This would make a great carry pistol or a nice piece to a Spanish collection. It comes with 300 rounds of Remington Viper. Due to the fact these are hard to find the price is firm."

 The Millennium action is striker-fired 
 and operates in double-action-only (DAO) mode,
 meaning that it fires only by a consistent
 and repeatable long pull on the trigger. 
 And, much to my applause, 
 the Millennium action requires no pre-loading
 of the firing mechanism. In other words, 
 the Millennium pistol does not require any 
 rearward movement of the slide to pre-set 
 the striker springs or sear. Thus the PT145
 has repeat-strike capability, allowing a second trigger pull
 against any misfire without having to manually 
 cycle the slide to reset the trigger action.  taurus pt 145

This AK has been fully converted to the true AK form as designed by Kalashnikov. 

Includes: Tapco G2 trigger conversion (moved forward with pistol grip where it should be behind the magazine). Conversion also now accepts all AK magazines. Trigger is great. Grip is a hogue. Sporter stock was replaced with a Tapco folding stock that has an added padded chin guard.

 Handguard is an Intrafusion Combat with all the rails for light, etc. Added is the foregrip with ejection bipod.

 Scope mount is one-piece detachable which detaches in seconds and firmly re-attaches holding the scope right where it was adjusted. Scope is a brand new UTG Accushot 1-4.5x30mm with 36 color option push-button adjustable display. It is zero'd in at 100 yards.

 4 magazines included: 30 rnd tapco, 2 30rnd steel and a 10 round plastic.

 Barrel and receiver are Russian mil-spec. Barrel is 16.3"" hammer forged, chrome-lined with 1:9 twist.

 Gun isn't even broken in yet with low round count as the internals and barrel are perfect and show so with a bore light. Ammo is cheap for these as it can be bought for $6 per 20 everywhere and buy it in bulk for way less. I can round up ammo for a buyer if wanted.

 Everything in the pictures included and I stil have the original stock and handguard.

 I'm sure I'm forgetting something. Any questions or for more pics/details, just ask.

 Will consider selling the rifle without the scope.

This firearm was bought brand new by myself about 4 months ago. It has not been fired and has sat in its box in my closet the entire time. As stated, this firearm is brand new so whoever buys will be getting a brand new firearm at lower price then retail. I actually do not want to sell it but need the funds more then the pistol right now. It comes with box, AR magwell adapter installed, muzzle brake and 1 tapco 30 round AR magazine. Mine came only shipped with 1 magazine and I did not feel like wasting time trying to get a second one from Century Arms. It has everything that comes with the pistol when bought brand new. This model is the M85 NP. Cheapest price that I can find for this pistol is in the low 500 dollar range. Buds gun shop has it for 515 right now. However, for close Pennsylvania buyers, it can be yours for 420 dollars since no shipping will be needed. I prefer PA residents and face to face transaction. However, I am open to shipping if need be but buyer will have to cover shipping. This is a handgun so transfer will be needed. This can be worked out afterwards between myself and buyer. For non PA residents who can legally own, price will be the same. However, take into account shipping and transfer fees as well. The picture shows the pistol with the SB47 stabilizing brace. The brace is NOT FOR SALE as of now. The brace was bought as an aftermarket add on by myself. However, if buyer wants brace then make me a fair offer and I may consider selling it. The brace runs between 120 and 140. The model that comes with the brace runs 600+ Thanks for looking. feel free to E mail with questions."

Here is what the manufacturer has to say about it:

The 9mm Range Officer® has the same quality forged national match frame and slide as the Trophy Match™ and TRP™ 1911s. It gets the same precision fit as these pistols, too.  Add in the same national match stainless steel barrel and bushing, and you have a pistol that shoots well beyond its price tag. The 9mm Range Officer® is topped with a fully-adjustable rear target sight, so you have maximum flexibility. The beavertail grip safety, extended lightweight trigger and flat mainspring housing allow the pistol to sit in your hand comfortably for long periods of time at the range. The single-sided thumb safety keeps things simple and functional. It all adds up to a pistol that will let you seriously compete in a variety of matches.

A 1911 chambered in 9mm makes for a very pleasurable shooting experience. An accurate 1911 in 9mm is even more enjoyable. If you want to get into the game and bring a gun that will surprise you with its performance, try the 9mm Range Officer®…Are You Ready?™

This firearm was bought brand new by myself about 4 months ago. It has not been fired and has sat in its box in my closet the entire time. As stated, this firearm is brand new so whoever buys will be getting a brand new firearm at lower price then retail. I actually do not want to sell it but need the funds more then the pistol right now. It comes with box, AR magwell adapter installed, muzzle brake and 1 tapco 30 round AR magazine. Mine came only shipped with 1 magazine and I did not feel like wasting time trying to get a second one from Century Arms. It has everything that comes with the pistol when bought brand new. This model is the M85 NP. Cheapest price that I can find for this pistol is in the low 500 dollar range. Buds gun shop has it for 515 right now. However, for close Pennsylvania buyers, it can be yours for 420 dollars since no shipping will be needed. I prefer PA residents and face to face transaction. However, I am open to shipping if need be but buyer will have to cover shipping. This is a handgun so transfer will be needed. This can be worked out afterwards between myself and buyer. For non PA residents who can legally own, price will be the same. However, take into account shipping and transfer fees as well. The picture shows the pistol with the SB47 stabilizing brace. The brace is NOT FOR SALE as of now. The brace was bought as an aftermarket add on by myself. However, if buyer wants brace then make me a fair offer and I may consider selling it. The brace runs between 120 and 140. The model that comes with the brace runs 600+ Thanks for looking. feel free to E mail with questions."
