Shoots great and I've run a box through it with no visible issues with the action or the stock repair. For those of you unfamiliar with this shotgun, you can use the power of your hand and adjust the choke manually in seconds which is why it was appealing to me as I could adjust the pattern depending on how far away chucky was.

No more keeping a bullet or other tool in your pocket. No more having your tool slip off your finger or squeeze it too hard. No more getting your leg wacked by a tool attached to a retractable chain. Most importantly, no more accidentally committing a felony by leaving your tool attached to your bullet button. 

The tool mounts to ""virtually any"" stamped aluminum or plastic magazine. The cap is made from plastic to help protect your AR-15 from scratches and it can be replaced if its damaged or wears out. This simple to use system is a ""MUST SEE"" for any bullet button AR user. 

All research done on the CA DOJ website, as well as feedback from gun shop owners, parts dealers, and contributors to previous Calguns.net threads, indicate that this tool complies with CA DOJ regulations. What makes it compliant is that once a modified magazine is inserted into the mag-well it becomes part of the rifle, rendering the tool ""unusable"". It still requires another modified magazine (or other tool) to remove the magazine from the rifle. However, it is not officially approved by CA DOJ.

Most importantly, no more accidentally committing a felony by leaving your tool attached to your bullet button. 

The tool mounts to ""virtually any"" stamped aluminum or plastic magazine. The cap is made from plastic to help protect your AR-15 from scratches and it can be replaced if its damaged or wears out. This simple to use system is a ""MUST SEE"" for any bullet button AR user. 

All research done on the CA DOJ website, as well as feedback from gun shop owners, parts dealers, and contributors to previous Calguns.net threads, indicate that this tool complies with CA DOJ regulations. What makes it compliant is that once a modified magazine is inserted into the mag-well it becomes part of the rifle, rendering the tool ""unusable"". It still requires another modified magazine (or other tool) to remove the magazine from the rifle. However, it is not officially approved by CA DOJ.

Please note, for those who are new at this, it is a well-established and well-known habit and practice of armlisters, or anyone for that matter, to accept that the cash value is less than equivalent trade value.  So if you have anything other than ammo to trade, the market value of your stuff needs to be more - $200, not the cash price of $150.  If you're trading ammo, the value of the ammo needs to be at least $180.  Thank you in advance  for learning how the bargaining world operates."

This is a proven game getting rig.  If you're not familiar, go to www.drawloc.com or go to youtube and search for Hickory Creek Inline Crossbow Draw-Loc.

This particular ""vertical crossbow"" / Draw-Loc rig is a 2011 manufacture ""23 Magnum"" bow, which is a 23"" ATA bow, with the newer more advanced bullpup draw-loc trigger system - it has an excellent trigger.

It is an 85 lb draw weight, according to Jerry at Hickory Creek, yet is very easy to cock and un-cock by hand - no need to use any kind of rope or crank to cock - even a teenage kid can easily do it.  

If you need to change ambush spots or when you're done hunting, no need to shoot a bolt or arrow - just un-cock by hand.  It has an anti-dry-fire device which I have disassembled and removed from the ""arm"" (in order to use FOBs) but I will put back on for you if you like, or simply ship it with the parts to later add it back on.  

This bow is tuned and uses regular arrows.  I've been using Easton FMJ 340s with it, at around 28"".  Arrows do not come with this bow, however.  It DOES come with a tuned G5 ""Expert"" fall-away rest, so you can use feathers or FOBs if you want.  It also comes with the shown rubbery stabilizer (pretty decent one).  Not many Draw-Loc rigs or crossbows have a working fall-away rest like this one.

The finish on the black riser is pretty nicked up, but doesn't affect function.  The camo limbs look great.  The string is pretty decent, but will need to be replaced before too long.  The string length is 74 & 3/4th"" and the cable length is 25 1/2"".  Could probably get at least a season or two more yet out of this string.

It has a 4-Pin I.Q. Bowsight with ""retina lock"". I have removed the built-in aluminum cocking stirrup that came on the 23 magnum.   But it's easy to simply place your feet against the riser to cock it, while sitting on the ground or in a chair - that's what I do.  The removal of this integral cocking stirrup saves weight, which is why I did it.  You can order a cocking stirrup from Hickory Creek if you really feel you need to cock it while standing for some reason.

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hickory+creek+draw-loc

I paid around $800 for this bow with the bullpup arm, not counting the accessories.  
Prices Shown INCLUDE shipping to your door anywhere in the lower 48, and reflect a discount due to removing the cocking stirrup:

--$495 with everything
--$385 if I keep the IQ sight.

Subtract $30 off these prices if you meet me locally in SW OKC.

Up for sale is a BNIB Armalite AR10 243 caliber w/ bull barrel. This is brand new unfired, in factory new box. I'm selling to help with unplanned medical expenses, but I'm not going to give it away. No haggling or ridiculous offers please, if you can find it in stock elsewhere cheaper congratulations & best of luck. Call or text Jason REDACTED if interested. Thanks & God Bless! MSRP $1639 stock gun (stock gun has fixed stock, hard polymer grip, no rings) w/o the extras this has.  The extras this has are a sling, scope rings (pictured in box), Magpul ACS stock, & rubberized Armalite grip (really nice grip!).  NO TRADES

    Action: Semi-Automatic
    Caliber: 243 Winchester
    Barrel Length: 20"" BBL
    OAL: 39.5""
    Weight: 9.4 lbs
    Metal Finish: Black

The AR10 chambered in .243 Winchester is a fabulous all purpose rifle in part because of the all purpose .243 Winchester Cartridge. The .243 Winchester is ultra accurate and outperforms some other types of ammunition. This round fits the AR10 platform with no alterations and has much less recoil than the 7.62 NATO.

Tactical flexibility was the innovative force behind the development of the AR-10 A4BF Special Purpose Rifle line.  Whether the rifle application dictates the need for iron sights, red dot or magnified scope, the SPR line is the efficient platform for all sighting options without sacrificing durability or accuracy.

And accuracy is the point, isn't it?  At Armalite, we believe it is, so we build all our A4 and A2 rifles with nothing less than a double-lapped barrel for accuracy and chrome line it for corrosion resistance.  In the Era of AR Innovation, we will not be outdone."

NO sales to ANY state/locally where this isn't legal. Payment is Post Office money order and shipping is $40 fully insured to your FFL. Please make sure your dealer will accept a firearm from an individual. It is perfectly legal for an individual to ship a firearm to an FFL, but some dealers like to make up their own rules. Private party transfers must go through DROS process and you pay all fees (I think $35 in CA)."

I've look at other options and it'll cost me $180.00 for the adaptor and new stock and I really don't want to drop another $180 into a $600 rifle.

Not really - I mean, this is probably the sweetest piece I've ever fired and will probably ever own. The weight, the recoil, the trigger, how it fits in my hand - it all just feels right. I bought it because I wanted to see what the big deal was concerning HK's. It used to boggle my damn mind... Why the hell would someone spend $1000+ on a single firearm? Now I know.
I shot 100 rounds through this piece once. It was the most accurate gun I've ever shot. Every round went exactly where I aimed, and I didn't have a single glitch or hiccup. Functions flawlessly.
The gun's only shortcoming is that its exterior is worn quite a bit. There's some heavy wear on the upper part of the pistol grip, some obvious holster wear on the slide - hell, even some wear on the magazine itself. The guy I bought the piece from thinks it was probably some officer's duty piece at some point. Still, none of this changes the fact that the pistol is mechanically sound.
As much as I like the HK45, I do prefer firearms that I can conceal carry on my person with ease. I'm putting this piece up for sale, but I'm also VERY open to trades. I wouldn't mind seeing how the HK VP9 handles. Feel free to make any handgun offers in 9mm and 45 ACP/Auto.  I'm also interested in AR-15's (5.56 caliber only).  You're also free to attempt to haggle the price; the most I'll do is accept or respectfully decline. Before selling/trading this pistol, I'll just need to see that GA Driver's license or GA weapon's permit. Thanks."

I could primarily use the money, but trades will be considered. Bought this 2.25"" SP101 brand new about 3 or 4 years ago, and only put 25 rounds of .357 through it. It had been my first time shooting this caliber and I must say, it packed more of a punch than I was expecting haha. I had plans to bring it back and put more down, I just never got around to it. Since then I got the Hogue grip to help ease the felt recoil, but never got to test it out. Long story short, it's in excellent condition with barely, if any at all, powder residue on the cylinder. I made sure I cleaned it as soon as I got back from the range because I know it can stain quite easily. I have 2 holsters for it, but never carried it. I also have 25 rounds of Hornady 125gr FTX JHP. So in short, it basically turned into a bedside gun. Comes with everything from factory including the case. So, bottom line here, my cash price is $475 firm. Most local places are currently selling this at about $580, even Buds is selling this for about $510 and that's the lowest I found on a quick search of the most popular sites. Places like Trops and Gun Broker go for over $525, so I'm not stepping down on my price. If you can find it cheaper somewhere else, then be my guest to grab that one.  I apologize in advance if it tales me a little while to respond, it's just that some emails go to spam and I keep forgetting to check that folder, but I'll try my best. Thanks and take care."
