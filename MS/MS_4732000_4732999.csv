For local face-to-face private party transfer sale at a local FFL only in the Redondo beach and adjacent South Bay L.A. areas (Hawthorne, Manhattan Beach, Torrance ...) 

All of the original Nazi Germany markings are there, and the 8-round magazine also has the Waffenamt code inspection mark.  The finish is so good I wonder if it's a reblue.  
This pistol has the original dark brown bakelite grips, fixed military sights, blued finish, rear notch and front post sight. The gun is in very nice shape. 

Comes with one 8-round detachable single-stack magazine, which has a waffenamt .
The P-38 frame, slide, and front of barrel serial numbers match, ser # 98XX z, and comes with one magazine.

Waffenamt inspection marks are light but visible. Mauser factory ""byf 44"" ""P38"" marked.

I can't find any import marks anywhere on the pistol.  If you're local come over, check it out, and prove me wrong.

Designed to replace the Wehrmacht's P08 Luger, this was the first double action combat handgun and has a de-cocker, firing pin block, & loaded chamber indicator, so it was safe to carry the pistol with a chambered round and the hammer down.  Spreewerk, Mauser, and Walther produced the pistol for Nazi Germany.

Face-to-face transfer only, off-list pistols can't ship in California.

If you're local and interested feel free to send an email to set up a meet.

I love this rifle, but need the cash at the moment.  This is the legendary scout rifle designed by Jeff Cooper.  Comes with two 5 round magazines.  The second magazine is stored under the buttstock.  3 point leather ""ching sling"" that helps you create a rock solid base for shooting from the standing position. 3 position tang safety.  2 position magazine allows you to load from the top even with a full magazine.  (i.e. drop mag to 2nd position and top load a FMJ when needed if you have a magazine of hollow points).  Leupold M8 IER (intermediate eye relief) scope.  If desired, you can mount a scope in the traditional location, as rifle has a picatinny rail over the rear receiver.  Manufactured in Austria and imported by GSI in Trussville, AL.  Pop-up integral backup sights.  6.6 lbs / 20"" fluted barrel / 39.6"" OAL.  These rifles are selling for a few hundred higher without sling and scope.  This is a great deal and I know I'll regret selling it!  I can meet at the Greeneville Walmart or downtown, whichever is closer for you.  If you're coming from a distance, I can adjust the meet location some but I'm not able to drive across the state.  Please call or text Matt @ (732)213-seven nine four six.  I may accept a trade for a Remingotn 673 Guide Rifle with ammo.  I may accept partial trades on the rifles listed below the description.  $1,100 FIRM for the rifle WITHOUT the Leupold scope.  $1,250 FIRM for the rifle as it sits in pictures. You won't find one cheaper in this condition on Gunbroker!

The gun has had about 100 rounds fired through it, and is in as-new condition, with the original box, soft case, and lock. It had some jamming issues, which might have to due with the ammo I was using or the new gun still being tight.  I would recommend having a gunsmith tune up for optimal operation.  Priced accordingly.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol. It has been developed
from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight
and size. The slide stop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity
reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking
dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy
are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for
plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry
by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the
P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The slide is lightly worn in places but has no scratches or damage that a simple recoat wouldn't make look brand new. In my opinion, it really doesn't need that either. It needs nothing. It's a great shooting, accurate, reliable handgun. I have never had any failures with this gun of any kind, I had a girlfriend that had two FTE's with it  due to her limp wristing the gun but the minute I pointed this out to her, it never happened again. If you own a G20 10mm or maybe even one of the other Glocks in 10mm, I would trade even if you bit off more than you can chew or you are simply looking for a trade to the 17. If yours is newer, I'd consider throwing in some cash as well. Lets talk about it. If this is up, I still have the gun.If you are interested in buying it outright, I'll entertain offers over $450."

Combined with the 5.7x28mm ammunition, the FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol is adapted to different types of close quarter defensive and training scenarios. Optimized to be used in any condition the operator may encounter.

Highly Accurate

The accuray and flat trajectory of the 5.7x28mm cartridge gives a high hit probability up to 50m.

Extremely low recoil results in quick and accurate firing.
High Capacity Magazine

The FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol can accept up to 20 rounds in the magazine.
Extremely Light and Ergonomic

The light weight of the slide and barrel, made possible by the 5.7mm calibre, and the reduced weight of the cartridge make the loaded weapon much lighter than traditional handguns.

Well-balanced, with smooth contours and no protruding parts, the FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol will instinctively be handled correctly and is extremely easy to use.
Fully Safe

The FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol features an ambidextrous manual safety that blocks the trigger mechanism and avoids any accidental firing."

When the situation demands fast shooting...and a big scope with a narrow field of view won't cut it, 
the StrikeFire red dot riflescope lets you shoot quickly with both eyes open! 
With unlimited field of view and eye relief—nothing gets you on target faster than this tough, shockproof and waterproof red dot scope.
Shockproof with rugged one-piece 30mm aluminum alloy tube.
High recoil caliber rating—tested with .375 H&H Magnum for 1000 rounds.
Included extra-high 30mm ring puts scope's bore center 40mm above the base height (lower 1/3 co-witness). 
Commonly used for mounting on a Flat Top rifle, providing lower 1/3 co-witness with iron sights.
OPTICAL FEATURES
Fully Multi-Coated Lenses	Increase light transmission with multiple anti-reflective coatings on all air-to-glass surfaces.
CONSTRUCTION FEATURES
30mm Tube	Allows greater windage and elevation adjustment travel along with greater strength compared to the one-inch tube.
One-Piece Tube	Rugged, aluminum alloy chassis maximizes strength and waterproofness.
Extra-high Ring Height	Puts scope's bore center 40mm above the base height. Commonly used for mounting with a Flat Top rifle, providing absolute co-witness. Mounting ring fits Weaver or Picatinny style base.
Waterproof	Optics are sealed with o-rings to prevent moisture, dust, and debris from getting inside the scope.
Fogproof	Nitrogen purged to inhibit internal fogging.
Shockproof	High recoil rating. Tested with .375 H&H Magnum for 1000 rounds.
Parallax Free	Allows for rapid shooting with both eyes open, without concern for parallax shooting error.

Red/Green Light Switch	Allows switching between red and green dot for optimum contrast with surroundings.

Night Vision Mode	Sets the brightness to the lowest possible level—an illumination level that generally is not seen without use of a night vision device.
2x Doubler	Screw-in doubler provides extra magnification for longer distance shooting.
Flip-up Lens Caps	The protective caps flip up from the lenses: 1.38 inches from the eyepiece and 1.75 inches from the objective lens.

Combined with the 5.7x28mm ammunition, the FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol is adapted to different types of close quarter defensive and training scenarios. Optimized to be used in any condition the operator may encounter.

Highly Accurate

The accuray and flat trajectory of the 5.7x28mm cartridge gives a high hit probability up to 50m.

Extremely low recoil results in quick and accurate firing.
High Capacity Magazine

The FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol can accept up to 20 rounds in the magazine.
Extremely Light and Ergonomic

The light weight of the slide and barrel, made possible by the 5.7mm calibre, and the reduced weight of the cartridge make the loaded weapon much lighter than traditional handguns.

Well-balanced, with smooth contours and no protruding parts, the FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol will instinctively be handled correctly and is extremely easy to use.
Fully Safe

The FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol features an ambidextrous manual safety that blocks the trigger mechanism and avoids any accidental firing."
