This is a hard to find leupold, made for the European market, it has the German #4 reticle, and was mounted in a Burris Pepr mount and shot at range once, otherwise it has sat in the safe since purchased.   Check out the specs online, but basically  it's  30mm scope without  AO, or side focus,  with a great hunting reticle.   Here's the deal, I'm looking for another decent scope, around the same magnification with a different reticle that fits my target shooting.  If you have something you would like to trade, shoot me a offer as long as it's gun related I will look at it, but another scope is at the  top of my list.....No low ball offers accepted,  I can and will send it in for a reticle change  before I dump it. If you want to make a cash offer go ahead but I prefer to trade, as it seems on this site trades are easier to keep in line value wise......no, rent is not due, and I'm not desperate for a few bucks. I will post pictures tonight."

The patented Stock Attachment Precision Rifle (S.A.P.R.) was developed by Battleline Industries to enhance the Magpul UBR, CTR, ACS, STR, MOE, and ACS-L collapsible stocks, giving them the capability to be used as a collapsible, lightweight precision rifle stock. It is fully adjustable regarding comb height, butt-pad vertical travel and 360 degrees of canting. The S.A.P.R. cheek piece also rotates 90 degrees left or right independently, allowing the user to transition between the adjusted comb height and original stock surface.

I DO NOT SELL FIREARMS AT THIS TIME. I AM NOT A ""DEALER"".

I have started a new Cerakote company, I can coat your FIREARMS, KNIVES, CAR PARTS HEADERS, PISTONS, EXHAUST. MOTORCYCLES PARTS, FLASHLIGHTS, SUN GLASSES. Basically if you can think of it then we can more than likely coat it. Cerakote is a ceramic based finish that can be applied to metals, plastics, polymers and wood. The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the forefront of the ceramic coatings market. Cerakote ceramic coatings utilize state-of-the-art technology to out-perform any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications.

I bought it several years ago with the intention of taking it to the range to shoot up but have lost interest. There are several projects people use this glass for. I've seen it cut into sections and then used as see through flooring.

Lexan glass comes in several thicknesses and this is the thickest they make at almost two inches thick. Should stop most handgun and rifle rounds. I've seen lots of youtube videos of guys shooting this and the only handgun round that penetrated was the 5.7mm x 28mm armor piercing round.  Larger rifle rounds such as .308 and larger may also penetrate it.

The sheet has two smaller circular holes cut in the middle which were the voice ports for the bank window.

It can be cut into sections with a circular saw.  I will not cut it and you will need a pickup truck to move it.

Located in Milwaukee near airport area - Howard and Howell.  I am open to trades. Let me know what you have.  No garbage or shotguns.

The American Bill of Rights is the defining anthem of Western Culture and the most enduring monument to its achievement. To remind us of the culture America's Founders intended to leave posterity, FMK stamps a paraphrase of this defining document on the slide of their pistols along with the words ""United States of America"" and ""In God We Trust."" The Model 91C G2 is a striker-fired, double-action pistol with doublestrike capability. The 9C1 is manufactured with a high-tech polymer frame that's corrosion-resistant, tougher than steel, and still 86% lighter. A snag-free design makes the 9C1 ideal for concealed carry, especially since the pistol weighs just 23.45 oz. unloaded. Its low-profile, white-dot sights are interchangeable and easy to use.

I DO NOT SELL FIREARMS AT THIS TIME. SO I AM NOT A ""DEALER""

I have started a new Cerakote company, I can coat your FIREARMS, KNIVES, CAR PARTS HEADERS, PISTONS, EXHAUST. MOTORCYCLES PARTS, FLASHLIGHTS, SUN GLASSES. Basically if you can think of it then we can more than likely coat it. Cerakote is a ceramic based finish that can be applied to metals, plastics, polymers and wood. The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the forefront of the ceramic coatings market. Cerakote ceramic coatings utilize state-of-the-art technology to out-perform any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications.

Hello,

I have a RARE TO FIND 550 round tin, UNOPENED, of Pre-Ban Chinese steel core. This is packaged with stripper clips, 10 rounds per clip, so 55 stripper clips total. These 55 stripper clips are worth $25 alone. The second picture shows what should be in the tin after opening it.

This tin was packaged in 1985 as the can denotes (85). This ammo was very accurate as most Chinese ammo is. And steel core ammo has been banned from importation since 1993. 

AK SKS ammo, copper washed, corr/berdan w/ a boat tail bullet. Excellent shooting ammo and no fail to fires.

Video showing performance against steel. https://youtu.be/hPucq_H73v8

$225 FTF west of Grand Rapids.

All components are present, needs to be repainted (I had planned on referbing it but never got to it) has a small dent in the shell but since it's perforated it will be an easy fix, just pull it out. I'm selling it as-is, if I referb it it will obviously cost more and now is the time for those who want an untouched original state to pick it up.
I'm guessing Viet Nam or Korea era. 
M368 Designates it as a practice / dummy round so it is and always was inert. 

Ammunition for the 106 mm rifle was issued as one-piece fixed cartridges. The term ""fixed"" means that the projectile and the cartridge case are crimped together. This ensures correct alignment of the projectile and the cartridge case. It also permits faster loading because the projectile and the cartridge case are loaded as one unit. The rear end of the cartridge case is perforated, to allow the propellant gas to escape through the vented breech, thus neutralizing recoil. Most projectiles (except HEAT) used are pre-engraved, that is, the rotating bands are cut to engage the rifled bore.

I believe I got them at $16 for 50 rounds at USA Liberty Arms so if you've got a pistol chambered in .32 ACP this is a good deal at $0.20 a round.

In late 2011, we started working on a new magwell design for what has now become our exclusive AR lower receiver.  The issue of being able to conduct a re-load under stress was identified by law enforcement and military operators and a new AR style magwell was conceived.  In early 2013, Viking Armament was founded and we began to put the collective ideas of many into production.  In the fall of 2013, Viking Armament had its first prototypes and started field testing. In early 2014, we started the patent process and by that spring we released the new design to the public. 

Today we have a full line of complete AR15 and AR10 style rifles.  

This is for the stripped AR Lower and ships with a single point sling"

The bluing is phenomenal on this rifle. The stock has a couple small dings from falling over in the safe but looks very good. The scope pictured is not included, but I will include a 4-16x50mm scope. Leupold one piece base and rings included.

I will also include some ammo if interested, I have several types available.

She is now retired and decided to go with a smaller less powerful gun, so she has upgraded to a Glock 43, 9mm, which is the perfect fit for her hands. She has cleaned this gun after every firing session and it's in great condition. The slight visible wear on the outside is due to leather holster rubbing, as she does carry concealed. The gun comes with (4) 9 round mags, each with a Pearce +2 pinkie extension for a total capacity of 11+ 1 in the chamber. The original magazine base plates are also included. A padded, lockable case with padlock and a separate gun cable lock are also included as well as a new Glock cleaning brush, rod and speed loader.

The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot.

Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years1.KEY FEATURES:26"" or 28"" vent-rib bead-sighted barrelStandard Express finish on barrel and receiverShoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shellsThe Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432www.LincolnPawnShop.com"
