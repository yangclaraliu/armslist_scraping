The CZ 85 Combat adds a fully adjustable rear sight, extended magazine release, drop-free magazine and overtravel adjustment on the trigger. The Combat designation comes from the lack of a firing pin block safety, allowing the replacement of the firing pin without tools.

Ambidextrous features include safety levers, slide stop levers and a reversible magazine release. The lack of a firing pin safety gives the 85 Combat a slight advantage in the trigger pull department, making it a long-time favorite of competition shooters.

This Tippmann 98 is really a ""reach out and touch someone"" style of marker. Not only does it come with a Flatline barrel for increased range, but also a Hammerhead Bangstikxx 5 fin kit for maximum accuracy. The only True modifications I have made to the marker is drilling the hole for the response trigger, and expanding the breach to accept the Tiberius Arms First Strike. I have also implemented a butterfly screw on the front of the marker so that you can take the Flatline Barrel off to clean in the field. The dogleg stock is great for the paintball sniper as it allows someone with a mask to get behind the ironsights (or red dot) and land 1 shot hits. Unfortunately, my supply of First Strike rounds are too old for me to comfortably sell.

553,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4405553,For Sale:  Wilson Combat CQB Tactical LE,"Gainesville, Gainesville, Florida","$ 2,500","Listed On: Sunday, June 7, 2015",Handguns,Wilson Combat                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Got a LNIB Wilson Combat CQB Tactical LE. This pistol was built and test fired in 2014, as shown on the paper work that comes with the gun from factory. I bought this from Shoot Straight 9 months ago, I am the first owner, paid $3150 out the door, got original invoice and receipt from Shoot Straight.

This pistol is completely stock, never changed a thing on there. Factory features of this pistol include bull barrel, light rail, magwell, 3 dot night sights (2 rear dots are yellow and front one is green which provides fast sight recognition). It has everything it came with from the factory, which includes Wilson Combat soft case, 2 brand new Wilson mags, all the paperwork such as build sheet that lists all the gunsmiths that were involved in building this pistol, all the test fire procedures with date before shipped out of the factory, Wilson Combat sticker, gun lock, Wilson Combat handbook, Wilson Combat cloth etc.

I have exactly 150 rounds shot through this gun (actually 150 rds, not the typical ""50 rds fired"" crap), because it's a Wilson Combat, I baby all my guns but definitely babied this one extra carefully. There is absolutely no wear/scratch/marks anywhere on this gun, no ""idiot mark"" by the mag release. This is my first and only Wilson Combat so I really took care of this pistol and took it out of the safe and played with it once in a while. I love this gun to death, always wanted a custom 1911 and finally found the perfect model from the perfect company and it truly hurts for me to sell. I've never seen a better 1911 anywhere, I would take this gun over any Ed Brown, Nighthawk or other Wilson models.

The Wilson Combat CQB Tactical LE is the best model that Wilson Combat makes in my opinion, it has the sickest look and function with all the tactical features on the gun such as the bull barrel, rail etc. I just bought a new truck for the family and rims tires lift kit got expansive, taking a loss and selling it cheap because of the truck. asking $2500 for a quick sale, this is absolutely the best deal for this gun around including online, this model is a higher end model from Wilson. If you are looking at this ad then you already know the quality of Wilson Combat, they make the best 1911s on earth hands down. 

I'm sorry but I can't take any trades at this time, need the money to help pay for the truck and accessories. Please check out this gun on Wilson Combat's website, my pictures don't do it justice.

Text me at REDACTED if interested, thanks for your interest and hope we can work something out :)

I have paid from .05 to .12 per round for this (mix of Federal, American Eagle, Remington, Sellier and Beloit, Winchester, etc.).  Great plinking ammo.  Some is repackaged into 50 round boxes from bulk ammo purchased, some is in 50 round and 100 round original boxes.  Just cleaning out my gun safe of .22LR.

.06 per round for all of it, not trying to gouge or make money on this.

I just inventoried my stash of ammo.  Here's some pictures of all of it.  I also have 400 rounds of CCI mini-mags, 300 of the 40 grain target, and 100 of the 36 grain Varmint.  I know those were about .12/round, though.  So what I have is 2275 rounds of misc. .22LR, and 400 rounds of the Mini-Mags, which are really hard to find now.

2275 x .06 = $136.50

400 x .06=$24.00

I'd sell the whole bundle for $150, including the mini-mags.  That's 2675 rounds, so it works out to be .056/round, which is really good.  I'd sell the .50cal ammo can they're stored in for $10, if you want.

If you just want 1500 rounds, then the .06 would work out at $90.

Description
MAG5-60
The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.


Features
•Compatible with all weapons that accept standard STANAG 4179 compliant magazines
•Reliable functioning due to mechanical simplicity and high-quality non-binding coil springs—no lubricants required
•Long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance
•Easily seated in weapon with bolt forward
•May be kept fully loaded for extended periods without spring fatigue
•Only 1.66"" thick, less than two 30-round magazines clipped together
•60-round magazine is approximately same length as two 30-round magazines clipped together
•60-round magazine fits in most dual-mag pouches"

I am selling a Barrett M107A1 sniper rifle to help fund my next firearms project.
I have a couple of them so I'm not desperate to sell so please don't think I will take some lowball offer

I have successfully shot steel targets at 1800+ yards with both 660gr & 760gr bullets and have found this setup to be consistently accurate.

I purchased the gun new and added the Nightforce scope and the Barrett BORS system.

The gun has been properly broke in according to manufacturers specifications.

My wife is 5'3"" 110lbs and she enjoys shooting this gun. There is minimal recoil.

The rifle itself retails for $14,000.00 the scope was over $2,000.00 and the BORS and mount was around $2,000.00 as well so the price is a good one for this setup.

I am willing to sell the rifle for $10,000.00 without the scope and BORS system or for $13,500.00 as shown. 

It also comes with 3 - 10 round mags and Pelican Case.

I have over 1300 rounds of ammo that I am willing to make a deal on as well. It will be much less than it costs in the store.

Barretts BORS Information


LEAVE NOTHING TO CHANCE.
The Barrett Optical Ranging System (BORS) is an integrated ballistics computer that mounts directly on the riflescope and couples to the elevation knob.

BORS instantly takes care of the data work by drawing from several tables and taking into account a number of real-time external factors so you can focus on the task of achieving first round hits.

After determining the range to target, simply turn the elevation knob until the BORS screen matches your target's distance. Internal sensors automatically calculate the ballistic solution. BORS compensates for temperature and barometric pressure, calculates angle cosine and displays rifle cant.

BORS
The BORS kit includes the proprietary Barrett Ballistic PC Software that's pre-programmed with a library selected by Barrett. BORS USB data cable allows the transfer of user programmable custom loads to BORS from his or her computer.

Designed primarily to withstand military operations, BORS is rugged and able to operate with a variety of scopes, calibers and rifles."

	Hey all, 
	I have available for trade/sale a sweet little Bullpup rifle. This is an EAA Appeal chambered in 2 Magnum. I love this rifle and would love to keep it, but another project has popped up and I really need to free up the funds. As such, im mainly looking for cash, but would consider trades if they were right. These are sweet little guns and are extremely compact. These are really hard to find and even harder to find in 22 magnum versus 22 long rifle. This shot great, but isn’t without its issues. It is missing both the front sight assembly and has had a picatinny type rail “creatively attached” to the rear area of the rifle. It isn’t the most glamorous installation, but it doesn’t look “bad” Either way, it could be removed if desired. This will come with the gun, the barrel extension/shroud, magazine, aftermarket rail, paperwork, and the factory case. The factory case is actually surprisingly nice
	These are awesome guns and are fully ambidextrous and can have the cocking lever and ejection port swapped to either side as desired. Would also consider most trades, but no BP’s, 22’s, or shotguns unless it is heavily in my favor. Other than that, just shoot me an offer,worst I can say is no. For any questions or offers, please shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on this if possible.

Thanks for looking and happy hunting!
JB"
