HEL-STAR 6™ is the latest in a series of purpose-built helmet mounted LED lights designed for airborne/MFF, tactical and other military operations.

HEL-STAR 6 combines the basic features of the earlier HEL-STAR 4® & HEL-STAR 5® multi-function marker lights into a compact, integrated design with enhanced omni-directional visibility, easy battery replacement, and waterproofness to 130 feet.

Improved sliding switches enhance tactile feel and provide positive, intuitive control between the two operating modes and four user-defined functions. Functions can be selected from virtually any combination of White, four different color options, and IR – either flashing or steady. Variable flash rates, intensities and coded signals provide expanded IFF capability.

Independent testing has confirmed that the HEL-STAR 6 exceeds the FAA’s 3 statute mile visibility requirement. HEL-STAR 6 is built on a platform that allows new technology to be incorporated as it becomes available. As mission demands shift and expand, HEL-STAR 6 can evolve with changing user needs."

Will not cycle the slide of semi-automatic handguns
Aguila packages these as Long Rifle ammunition, but they are in fact slightly shorter than a 22 Long cartridge

345,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1884345,For Sale:  308 Win. Match Grade Unprimed Brass - Box 50,"NE Heights, Albuquerque, New Mexico",$ 47,"Listed On: Monday, July 15, 2013",Ammo,Taurus,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"308 Winchester Match Grade Cases Packed per 50 - This is some of the best brass I have ever used. Excellent uniformity!

Hornady takes extra time and care in the creation of their cases, and produce them in smaller lots. This is the only way to ensure each case meets their strict quality standards. Hornady cases offer reloaders excellent uniformity in case wall thickness, case weight, internal capacity and in the primer pocket and flash hole. They measure for consistently tight wall concentricity, and even run their cases through a pressure calibration test to ensure uniform case expansion. Finally, each case is hand-inspected.

What does this mean to you? Proper seating of the bullet not only in the case, but in the barrel as well. Consistent charges and pressures. Ultimately, it means optimal velocity and repeatable accuracy.

The extra time and effort Hornady spends has another benefit you'll enjoy. They've built their cases so well, you'll be surprised how many more reloads you can get from them over most competitive cases. It's incentive to reload that case and try for an even more memorable shot next time around.

Some reloaders treat brass as a commodity; something to be bought in bulk at the cheapest price possible without regard to quality. At Hornady, they treat brass as the foundation for what could be the most memorable shot of your life. Reload with a case you can count on every time. Look for the Hornady headstamp.

I assembled it about a year ago and don't have much use for it. I can fire a shot and then it doesn't want to load the next round, or sticks shut. I don't know or care enough about AR-15s to fix it. I've fired it with a .22 LR bolt conversion and it ran 3 magazines without a hiccup. My coworker who has a lot of experiences with ARs said its probably the ammo I've used with it (cheap steel cased Russian stuff) but could be something wrong with the gas system. I'm sure its a relatively easy fix for someone who knows ARs better than I do. I sold my AK to fund this thing and now I'm trying to get another AK

""I have two Smith & Wesson revolvers for trade. They are both Pre Model 10 and both are in .38spl. They both lock up tight and are in perfect firing condition. The cylinder on the blued revolver sticks sometimes when you go to swing the cylinder out to load or unload, but it opens up and doesn't affect the shooting of the gun. I so have the original grips to both pistols and I'll include the aftermarket grips on the blued revolver. Both are fine revolvers and a cool collector's pieces to any Smith & Wesson fan. I can supply serial numbers if you're interested and want to do a look up on the date of production. I don't know an approximate date, but they're old enough that there aren't any dashes in the model number or serial number."""

The Standards
In 2001, Springfield Armory® set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. 
With the introduction of the XD® polymer pistol, they did just that….

Loaded Chamber Indicator The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.

Striker Status The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber. The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position.

USA Trigger System™ The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber. [The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. 

Grip Safety Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Design
Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.

(M)odel Countour Frame
The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. 
(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations
Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. New! 3.8 model with slip resistant slide serrations 

(M)odel Contour Frame
The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. 

(M)ega-Lock Texture
The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 
The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

Technology
Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. 
With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory®.

(M)atch Grade Barrel
Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

(M)elonite®
Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 
The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. 

(M)inimal Reset Trigger
The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Innovations
The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD® is now captured in the all new XD(M)® line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M)® series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.

M)aximum Reach Magazine Release
The modified contour of the new XD(M)® grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.

(M)inimal Error Disassembly
Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.

(M)ega Capacity Magazine
The new XD(M)® Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR™ Mag 
X-Tension™ (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)® is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the 
.40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.

Personalization
Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.

(M)agazine X-Tensions™ 
With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions™ , SPRINGFIELD ARMORY® has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)

(M)ould-Tru Backstraps
With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.

(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System™
A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position.

(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case
Your total XD(M)® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M)® it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M)® pistols.

I bought it from Brownells about 2 years ago (Paid 1800$) and I am building a new rifle in 6.5 and need money for rebarrel and want to put a higher mag scope on the rifle so this will pay for gunsmithing and put a dent in cost of the new glass. There is some ring marks as this scope was moved several times to other guns. It functions perfectly and I ran the scope through the box test just recently as well as ladder tests up to almost 18 mils, I have a 40 MOA base on the rifle I took it off of (.308 Win, where it spent most of its life) I have all the paperwork and box as you can see from the pics. Glass is spot on and if it was a NF 5.5-22 I would keep it. I just want more Mag. Hindsight is 20-20 I guess. I should have spent the extra 200$. Let me know if you have any questions. 
Scope sat in Badger Rings its whole life.

No! No! No!  Darien doesn't need an assault weapons ban, magazine capacity limit, or conceal carry limit!  

Illinois law currently requires a FOID card to purchase, own, or use a firearm or ammunition.

The FOID card is issued thru Illinois State Police. 

That is sufficient.

Adequate treatment of the mentally ill and enforcement of existing laws is what's lacking. 

Urge them not to be swayed by what is incorrectly being portrayed by the media as increasingly-frequent, rampant acts of violence being committed by isolated, mentally ill individuals who do not represent the 99.9% of law-abiding American citizens who enjoy shooting sports,"

Anyone familiar with the M&P knows the only shortcoming is the trigger.  This trigger kit almost eliminates the pretravel and over travel and greatly shortens the reset making it very similar to a 1911.  The kit also replaces the plastic trigger with a high quality aircraft grade aluminum trigger.  The new barrel has zero rounds through it and the original barrel has only 200 rounds through it.  The pistol comes with two S&W 17rd magazines and two Pro Mag 17rd magazines.  Call or text (912) 463-three519

 It is a real pleasure to shoot and accurate as can be. It can take any species in North America. The rifle is in very good shape and ready for deer, hog, elk, black bear, zombie bunnies, paper targets or whatever need shooting. 

 Includes 9 rounds of hunting ammo and a 3-9 x 40 Nikon BDC (Bullet Drop Compensator) scope zeroed at 100 yards. Scope mounted firmly on one piece picatinny/weaver rail. I have the box for the scope too. Also includes the Browning Carry Case for scoped rifles.

I have an absolutely incredible rifle for sale...It is Spikes Tactical's 10th anniversary edition SL-15 (Spikes limited 15). This rifle was developed over a period of 2 years and was released to a select group of retailers in late 2011. Only 100 completed SL-15's were ever built by Spikes, so this rifle is as rare as it is WICKED!! No detail was overlooked in terms of design and functionality! It has a fully fluted Lothar Walther barrel and a titanium Dynacomp flash suppressor, and the receiver and internals are coated with nickel boron (NP3) for superior protection and a constant state of lubricity...just to name a few of the many features.  It is truly an amazing piece of hardware that will only increase in value! When these were released about 1.5 years ago, they were sold for $2500...now that they are all but impossible to get...they have greatly risen in value...I am asking $2750 for mine...(which is exactly what I have in it, but feel free to make an offer). Mine is un-fired, which was very hard because this gun begs to be ran!! It comes with a large black soft molle case with spikes logo and the American flag embroidered on it...the manual and dog tags that come with the SL-15 are still sealed in the package. I have the orange tags from spikes indicating the name of builder as well as the date of build. I also have emails from the chief operating officer at spikes that show my SL-15 rifle (via serial #) is 1 of the 100 rifles made and built by spikes tactical for their 10th anniversary. I am including a link to a facebook page that is devoted to this rifle...there are a few paragraphs that contain great details on the gun itself as well as 20 or 30 really good pics...please contact me via email if you're interested...I will also take partial trade on a good .45acp handgun...thanks for looking.  copy and paste the link below into your browser for more info and great pics. You can also text 479-two36-four680

I have a NIB Smith and Wesson (S&W) Shield 9mm with extra magazines for sale.

I bought this gun a couple of months ago to switch to a more compact carry gun. I just never could get used to the feel and decided I needed to stick to the double stacks. 

This is as it would come from the factory. I bought it and started looking for magazines. While I waited, it sat in the safe and occasionally I would take it out and fondle it, but that was it. 

I also amassed an extra 5 (five) 8 round magazines and 2 (two) 7 round magazines. 

Each gun will include 1 (one) 7 round and 1 (one) 8 round magazine as it would from the factory. If you bought the gun and all magazines you would have a total of  7(seven) 8 round mags and 4 (four) 7 round mags. 

I have sold a couple of mags that the pictures show.  This ad represnets the true quantity available and the picture is a representation of actual ownership only.

Price is $450 for the gun and standard 1 7 round and 1 8 round magazine.
Price is $650 for the gun and all extra magazines."

The weapon is unique, it has the land and grooves barrel that is said to be more accurate than the hex barrels.

The lusterous blueing on the slide, barrel and other hard parts is nicely contrasted by the lovely walnut stocks with the carved S&W and Gunsite Raven logo's which is echoed in the Raven engraving on the receiver. The frame is made from Scandium. The sights are Novak low rise and make for a smooth, no snag draw from a holster (no front gold bead). The barrel is 4 1/4"" with a match grade barrel bushing. The trigger is adjustable. The gun comes in the factory lockable protective case with the original manual, barrel wrench, 2 S&W OEM ACT made, 8 round magazines and sealed packet containing the sample factory fired casing. 

I am the original owner and have fired this very accurate pistol less than 100 rounds of Federal and RP 45 ACP hardball. The earlier manufactured pistols like this one (SN FSP 0798) were completely hand fitted for maximum accuracy and reliability. The gun is in completely stock, unmodified condition since new. I will offer approximately 2 and 1/2 boxes of new RP (2 boxes of 50 rounds 230gr RN, approximately 1/2 box of Federal 230gr RN) to the buyer at my cost from about a year ago.

I play by the rules. For sale face to face only to bonafide Arkansas resident with proof of Ar residency, otherwise it has to go through (or sale to) an FFL. 

I also believe in describing an item accurately. Feel free to check my feedback on ebay (handle- achildofthesky )I am an individual (no sales tax!) and not a dealer or business and because of this, the gun is sold with out warranties of any type on my part and all sales are final. That said, if you have been looking for a truely nice example of these accurate and finely assembled and increasingly hard to find pistols you will not be dissapointed with this one. I have a couple of other high quality collectable guns I will be selling to help generate funds for a home purchase. 

Please note this offer expires on Friday evening as I am moving. Please, no ""tire kickers, Lookie Lou's or time wasters"", I am selling a exrtemely high quality,hand fitted handgun at a very attractive price. You will NEVER see another one in this area. Don't miss out. Regret sucks!

This is a pretty cool round, it is lead free, the bullet is made of powdered metal, so when it hits a hard surface (ie steel plate) it completly disperses it energy, so there is no worry of dangerous fragments flying around to cause an unnecessary injury.  

Also, this ammo would be excellent for home defense because it will not travel through many walls and be less likely to cause collateral damage, or for target practice bc of no risk of fragmentation.  On soft targets the bullet acts more like a hp round.  This round is optimized for use in 1:7 - 1:9 twist barrels, which is the majority of AR-15s.  I have shot these out of my Rock River and a custom rifle with a YHM barrel and have had excellent accuracy out of both (at 25 yards, both rifles leave ragged holes).
