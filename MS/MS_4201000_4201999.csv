Innovation & Added Functionality! The SB47 stabilizing brace is an awesome invention that secures AK style pistols to the forearm of the shooter and assists in firing the pistol the way it is intended - with one hand. Using the SB47 in this way, recoil is reduced significantly, resulting in more accurate shooting without compromising safety, comfort or control. Designed and made by a U.S. Military veteran with help from a top V.A. prosthetic specialist, the intent and design of the stabilizing brace is to help America's wounded veterans enjoy large frame handgun shooting again. The concept was to invent and create a device that would act as an extension of one's own arm - so it is like a part of your body. Well the SB47 did that - and more! Not only did it help our wounded heroes regain their confidence and handgun skills, it was wicked fun for anyone to use! BATF approved for everybody, the SB47 does not require any special permits, doctors notes or SBR tax stamp! Will fit PAP M92 PV, PAP M85 PV, Draco and C39 Pistols.
I bought it for $150 from Amazon, I already turned my Npap M92 to SBR so I am looking to sell it! Cash only!"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGDOTot2VU8

BARNETT GHOST350 WITH ROPE COCKING DEVICE.

I have used this crossbow 5 times, its in perfect condition. 
The Items listed below are all extra items I've purchased for this crossbow, an extreme complete set for any hunter. I have over $600 in accessories.

*  5 BLACKEYE EXECUTIONER CARBON ARROWS 22""
* 12 CARBON EXPRESS SURGE ARROWS 22""
*  2 STICKS OF WAX
* 43 RAZOR SHARP BROAD HEADS
* CROSS 3X32 SCOPE
* 2 COMPLETE SETS OF BRAND NEW CROSSWIRE CABLES
* HARD SHELL CROSSBOW STORAGE CASE WITH LOCKING CLIPS
* SLING
* QUIVER THAT HOLDS 4 ARROWS
* BIG GREEN TARGET CROSSBOW DISCHARGE BOX

The CRT Riser boasts an incredible 5 to 1 safety factor. The Ghost 350 also 
comes complete with CROSSWIRE Strings and Whiplash Cams which provide a 
smoother, faster, quieter and more precise shot in a compact fit. With the 
ADF (Anti-Dry Fire) MIM (Metal Injection Molding) trigger system and 350 FPS 
speed the Ghost CRT is the crossbow to own.

Accuracy And Power
The Ghost 350 has a draw weight of 175 lbs. with 12” worth of power stroke. 
It will fling your arrows off the rails at 350 fps with 109 ft. lbs. of 
kinetic energy. This sort of power proved to be enough to blast through my 
target and backstop so regularly that I had to put a second foam target 
behind the first to stop the arrows! From 20 yards, my bolts flew so fast 
that I couldn’t even see them hit the target.
The trigger pull is smooth and easy, which is a nice feature that helps keep 
the shooter from pulling down on the bow while pulling the trigger.
Once I had the Ghost 350 sighted in, I was able to accurately hit 3” 
groupings at 50 yards, and 1” groupings at 30 yards. This crossbow could 
easily drop a buck or an elk from 45 yards.

Cocking The Barnett Ghost 350 Crossbow
Barnett’s Ghost 350 has a draw force of 175 lbs., more than enough to stop 
all but the strongest of men to want to hand-pull the string. Fortunately, 
Barnett includes a rope cocking device that makes cocking the bow much, much 
easier. With the rope cocking device, you’re pulling only 87.5 pounds of draw 
weight, and the cams allow the weight to let off at just the right time. All 
in all, this crossbow is very smooth to cock, as long as you use a rope 
cocking device.	

The Crossbow Scope
The Barnett Ghost 350 ships with the same 3 x 32mm scope that seems to ship 
with other crossbows in the Ghost lineup. Made by Cross, a company owned and 
operated by Barnett, this scope is powered and provides illuminated reticles 
with markings up to 50 yards, in 10 yard increments."

I have an FNH FNS-9 9mm for sale.  Perfect condition, as new.  Comes with 3-17 round mags.  This is the model without the manual safety.  Before I fired it, the trigger was good, but not great.  After about 100 rounds, the trigger went from good to great.  Fired 350 flawless rounds and it is a great shooting gun, very accurate.  Fully loaded this only weighs 2 more ounces than a Glock 19, but you get 2 extra rounds.  I have had FNP and FNX's in the past and this is certainly a well built firearm.  You may or may not know, but FN manufactures about 70% of the military's weapons.  The controls are completely ambidextrous with the exception of the take down lever.  The grip texture, in my opinion, is little aggressive, so after a few hundred rounds at the range I started to notice.  BUT, I have a gen 4 Glock and have the same issue, so maybe it's just me.  I put talon grips on the Glock and if I end up keeping this, I'll probably do the same.  

If interested, please contact Don at REDACTED (text/call). Please be 21 or over with a current handgun permit and we can complete bill of sale. No permit, we can do transfer at FFL in Valparaiso. We can meet at the Bass Pro in Portage for transfer, so if you can't make it there, this probably isn't the gun for you. I can appreciate the need to try and haggle, because I do that myself, but please be respectful.  My price is very reasonable but if you can find it elsewhere for less, I encourage you to buy it there, but please don't try to use that as a bargaining tool.  I will entertain REASONABLE offers.

Thanks for looking and have a great day / night."

I am going off my research and my learning of this part.

This is the later version of the scope rings that has the preferred star nut and leaf spring attachment. 

This is for the non-adjustable scopes of the yesteryear. Before I was born.
What you see in the photo is what you get. This does not include the scope base, which I understand is where the adjustments are made.

Here is your opportunity to get this set of rings you don't come across every day. If you have the base and want the rings, there you go. If you have a 2nd scope you want to mount rings on, and be able to transfer the scope, there you go.

I am in Cranberry Township zip 16066. I am looking for 30 dollars shipped, anywhere east of the Mississippi. A bit extra for west of that.

The T3 is the smallest of our Timberlines, and is desingned for faster, lighter hunts, but with full overnight capabilities. Like its bigger brothers, it retains the same great features - built-in pockets, stay options and many lash points. The T3 is a narrow, stick-to-you pack that is extremely versatile when it comes to load hauling. A top loader with the rugged simplicity of a drawcord, it can be massively overloaded if needed. The over-the-top strap compesses contents vertically, and extra long lid straps let the T3's lid mushroom upwards. Bottom lash straps let you throw on even more."

Up for trade is an awesome arsenal sgl21. It's in good shape (I would rate 90%). There are a few marks but over all very very clean. For the enthusiast/collector my rifle has an earlier legion stamped rifle. For most this won't mean anything but from a collector stand point this is more sought after.  Has seen around 500rds. Super smooth trigger. A very nice rifle. Being these are rapidly gaining popularity because these Russian aks are longer being imported, I figured I would see if I can turn it into something else I have been looking for. I'm looking for around $1200 in value out of it. If you look for these rifles for sale gunbroker is about the only place around to find them and they are asking much much more than that for them.

Used - Excellent condition.  Solid rifle and very smooth action.  Very fun!!! 

Pick of the litter.  The gun shop I purchased this AK from had (6) C39 Sporter rifles and I picked out the best one.  No machining marks (several had ½” circular swirls in the lightening cuts on the side of the receiver).  Smoothest action unlike several I handled that were “crunchy”.  Safety fans lightly between Safe and Fire as an AK should.  Sight post is perfectly centered and a straight sight base (not canted).  Muzzle break comes up snug to the front sight base (a few had a gap which led to a real floppy muzzle break).
Comes with:
- (2) Tapco 30-round magazines – perfect condition.
- Instruction Manual
- Original box

Info from the Century Arms:

100% American Made!  No imported parts! 
Century is the only company making an all U.S. made AK!

The C39 Sporter’s milled receiver is machined from an 11 pound block of 4140 ordnance quality steel. Instead of adjusting for windage from the front sight like other similar rifles, the rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

Other features:
•	Include a buttstock that is 1 inch longer than military style stocks, for better comfort and handling. 
•	The upper and lower handguard have four Picatinny rails which can be used to accessorize the C39 with red dot sights, scopes, lights, lasers and a fore grip. 
•	Finger groove pistol grip for increased handling. 
•	Tapco G2 trigger, double-hook for a steadier pull.
•	Large paddle magazine release.
•	Equipped with a proprietary V shaped Chevron Compensator which reduces recoil and makes the rifle more controllable.
•	Barrel: 16.5” with a 1:10 twist, 
•	Overall length: 37.25”
•	Weight: 8.2 lbs.

I don't want, but I am needing to sell my Walther PK380.  It comes with the original box and paperwork, along with two (2) 8-round magazines, and 18 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense ammo.

I bought this new from a dealer in the Louisville area, so this is a single owner.  I have less than 200 rounds through and love it as a personal/conceal carry.  It has a very smooth action, and is surprisingly very accurate.  It fits a handful of holsters from other models with no issues.  I really love this gun, but again due to a recent family event I am needing some cash more than I need it.

Enjoy the pics, as the wife got a little creative taking them  :-)

I will be honest and say this P-01 has been my edc for 6 years and has been shot. It has been carried in a Theis IWB horsehide/Kydex holster. 

It does show a little wear on the frame rails and around the sear cage roll pin and firing pin retainer roll pin from being broken down and cleaned. It is not a safe queen but is not a boat anchor either. It is a used gun and has been carried.

All parts were purchased from CGW and were installed by myself with a smith friend looking over my shoulder. 

Trade value would be $900-$1000 range I think would be fair but am open to discussion. I'm looking for something really tempting."

The action is glass bedded forward and back, though the 10/22 is only a one screw system. The barrel is completely free float. Short length of pull due to lack of recoil. This is a very compact rifle.

I built this to be a 500 yd capable (dont laugh) target/mini tactical rifle. The 20 moa base and 50 ao scope can get you there. I had so much fun building this little rifle I want to do it again. It gobbles up every high velocity round ive thrown at it and shoots very, very well with nicer target ammo.

So for sale I have my original Sig Sauer SIG556 Patrol rifle. It has the original Swiss style hand guards, but you can add a rail to them very easily. This rifle is piston operated, and combines AR accuracy and ammo with AK operation and reliability. These are not in production by Sig, but still under warranty from the factory. Breaking down the rifle for cleaning is very AR like, with quick break down and easy cleaning thanks to gas not being blown back into the bolt. The safety is ambidextrous on the rifle, and it has a side folding stock that is also adjustable for length of pull. The rifle takes AR magazines, and I've only had the opportunity to put about 120 rounds through it. If you purchase the optics with the rifle, it is currently sighted in at 50 yards which should put the point of impact right in the center at 100 yards or so. The barrel is the quality you would expect from Sig, and has a 1 in 7 twist. The gas system on the rifle is also adjustable. The rifle is also equipped with a lower rail on the Swiss style hand guards, and a Sig 2/3 point adjustable sling is also included. Below are the details of the rifle package:

$1040 Sig Sauer SIG556 Patrol Rifle w/folding and adjustable stock and one Pmag.

This is a rifle made by Bushmaster they called the ""Assault Rifle"". Its design is a cross between an AK47 and an M16. It does have the stamped steel upper on the machined aluminum lower. If you know Bushmaster, you know how rare this gun is, especially with the folding stock. A 30 round aftermarket magazine is included. The fore end wood is painted black and we are assuming that it is factory paint. There are a few minor dings in the paint but there are no cracks or repairs in the wood. We have not fired the gun, but the action is smooth and strong. The bore looks good as does the bolt face. And yes, this gun is very shootable. Pictures tell the story."

I cannot provide any more information regarding the history on this rifle simply because I do not know anything about it.  This was the same type of rifle that Lee Harvey Oswald used in the JFK assassination.  I thought it would be a nice collectors piece but its just not my style.
