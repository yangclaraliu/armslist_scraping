Yes, I know these are banned but I still see them for sale regularly brand new online and in local stores for around/under $500, so if you're expecting $700 for a used rifle don't waste your time.  I don't want or need any extras, so you can keep your NCStar lasers, eBay reflex sights, and ""tactical"" bags and slings.  Just a base, basic Saiga.  Send me an e-mail with exactly what you have, how much use/abuse it has if used, what's included, and your asking price, or I won't respond.

I have cash, my CCW to prove I've passed a background check, and I'm perfectly willing to sign a bill of sale if you require one.  I'm willing to travel for the right deal.  

I am NOT willing to send you money so you can ship me one from another state.  I don't want a converted rifle, or any shotgun."

It's been a flawless and accurate pistol, but I no longer have a need for it.

As the pistol's second owner, I'm unsure of the total round count, but I've sent 1,200 rounds downrange with it, and experienced zero failures.  I bought it with a black Lone Wolf barrel installed.  This barrel has been 100%, and provides great casing support if you're saving brass for reloads.

The Hogue Handall grip sleeve is very snug, and rounds out the side straps.  It's a great grip and feel for medium-sized hands.  It can also be easily removed, and you're left with the standard Gen 3 frame - no mods.

I'm including 3 - 13 Rd magazines, Ghost Ultimate 3.5 lb trigger (not installed), and a spare Glock stock recoil spring assembly.

I'll also include the pictured 100 rd bag of ammo.  It's Military Ballistics re-loaded brass, and is solid range ammo.  If you don't want the ammo, I'll knock the price down to $375.

Colorado Laws apply.  Buyer pays transfer fee.  I know Gander Mountain in Thornton does FFL transfers for $17.

Edit:  Armslist only allows one photo.  I'll be happy to send photos of the barrel if you're interested."

TALO is an association of several firearms distributors, giving the group the buying power needed to have special versions of firearms built solely for distribution by the individual distributors in the association.

The Redhawk is offered by Ruger through any distributor with a 4.2, 5.5, or a 7.5 inch barrel, but this TALO exclusive wears a nominal 2.75 inch barrel. Also differentiating this TALO sixgun from the standard Redhawk is that this short-barreled version has a round butt grip, instead of the usual squared version, making this special edition easier to carry comfortably, and easier to conceal.

The detailed specifications of the Redhawk are listed in the chart below. All linear measurements are listed in inches, and the weight is listed in ounces. The trigger pulls are listed in pounds of resistance. SA is the single-action trigger pull. DA is the double-action trigger pull. Height includes the sights, set to the intermediate elevation position.

I would like to trade today!!! Any Glock, Springfield Armory, Beretta, AR-15 chambered in .22/.223-5.56/(AR-10) 7.62 NATO, CZ 75, Something that is at least a 3.7"" barrel but less than 5"" I will trade for. Today. Let's do it!!

I have a beautiful gun up for sale. This gun is a Ruger SP101 chambered in .357 MAG with a 2 1/4"" Barrel, Stainless Steel, and a brand new Hogue Grip. This gun is very accurate for a shorter barrel revolver. I have shot this gun at only an indoor range about a 100 rounds down the barrel, using high quality ammunition. If you plan to shoot .38 SPL out of this gun, there is very little recoil. .357 Mag has a little bit more kick, but it's very controllable. I am looking to sell this gun for $650 with 2 boxes (100 round) Fiocchi 147gr FMJ .357 Mag, 1 box of 50 rounds Fiocchi 124gr STJHP, and about 150-200 rounds of loose bulk rounds of good quality .357 Mag. The original box and all paperwork is included in the deal.

Purchased this stock kit for a build I'm working on but before it arrived I found a different kit I liked better.  As it is this kit is brand new and unused and ready to be installed. Comes with the buffer tube, spring, buffer, castle nut, and a mil spec carbine stock. Buffer tube is mil spec in dimension and the positions are laser engraved so you can see what position your stock is in by just looking at it.  Great choice if you're working on a build right now and it will screw into any lower receiver with standard threads.

I have no use for it so I'd like to sell it for $50, just looking to get what I have in it back out.  Would also consider trades for AR mags, optics of some kind, or a rear sight.

If interested feel free to call/text me at three 16 six 19 nine 853, texts preferred.

it the ""HAKIM"".  Very HIGH QUALITY, the Swedes are like the Swiss, everything must
be perfect.  Has a higher end variable powered EER scope.  Nice walnut finished stock. Excellent flash suppressor/muzzlebreak.  ALL FACTORY ORIGINAL AND MATCHING NO.'S.
