This rifle also has an original HK pre-ban flash hider, drum style fully adjustable rear sight, Navy type polymer trigger group, and 18"" match grade barrel. Comes with a nice hard case, all factory paperwork including manual, and gun lock. email collins at. (fredcollins532@yahoo.com)"

Hi all,

Up for sale is a like-new Savage 64 TR-SR (22LR). The TR-SR model builds upon the very popular Savage 64 line by adding a free-floating 16"" threaded bull barrel and a Boyd's tacticool stock which gives the rifle a very compact and tactical look. I purchased the rifle new a few months back and have only put about 50 rounds through it. The rifle runs perfectly with no issues and is very accurate. In the first 50 rounds I was shooting 1"" groups at 100yrds with no problems.

The rifle will include (2) 10rd savage mags and a Blackhawk bipod which I paid around $45 for.

Asking $250, buyer pays PPT fee. The Nikon Prostaff Rimfire 3-9 x 40 is not included with the sale however I will be offering the scope for $100 with the rifle or $120 on its own after the rifle is sold.

Please PM me if you have any questions, thank you."

ruger The LC380 is the perfect pairing of the LC9 pistol and the popular .380 Auto cartridge.

It has rugged construction with a blued, through-hardened alloy steel slide and a black, one-piece high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame. The checkered grip frame provides a secure and comfortable grip. Safety features include an internal lock, a manual safety, a magazine safety, and a loaded chamber indicator that provides visual and tactile indication that chamber is loaded. A dovetailed, high visibility 3-dot sight system with a windage-adjustable rear sight provides a clear, distinct targeting picture. Every LC380 comes with one 7-round magazine and soft case."

This helps mitigate recoil and control of the weapon, which facilitates faster, more accurate follow-up shots.All hardware necessary for attachment directly to M-LOK Slots on either aluminum or polymer hand guards and forends is included.Additional InformationWeight: 3 lbsColors: Black, Flat Dark Earth, Gray, Olive Drab Green"

Very open to trades, specifically for black guns, any trades that involve cash coming my way, and I would be more than happy to take a stock Glock plus cash

Grip undercutting of the trigger guard for both the shooting hand and supporting hand improve handling ergonomics, magwell and mag release reliefs to assist with reloads in addition to oversized mag release. Addition of front cocking serrations allows for press checking or any one of a million ways of loading the gun or manipulating the slide. Lightening window cuts and aesthetic relief channels provide a small reduction in slide weight and paired with tri color Cerakote highlights, make this Glock truly stand out for either competition or as a conversation piece. Guide rod housing, upgraded to stainless steel and weighted for the minor reduction in slide weight after machining. Hi viz sights installed, for quicker target acquisition and as an upgrade from standard polymer factory sights

Important note: barrel and trigger were left stock. If you're looking for a true competition ready glock, I would recommend upgrading those (although I did at least polish the feed ramp and install a Ghost connector for you). The reason I didn't upgrade them is because those are both true drop in parts and I built this as a project with the intention of selling it. I'm not going to drive up the price another $500 for the right barrel but the wrong trigger for one buyer and the right trigger but the wrong barrel for another buyer. If you would like, I can upgrade either one or both for you at your expense before pickup/delivery/shipping.

30 rounds test fired after work performed, no issues

Comes with three 15 round mags, one with a +2 baseplate (plus original baseplate), original and ghost connector, and hard case. Original guide rod assembly, factory sights, slide cover plate, and/or mag release can be included for extra. Can meet locally, drive to meet within 2 hours of Denver, or ship to your FFL"

Horus helps reduce sighting and holdover errors to hit targets at any range. 
We spared no effort for our toughest scope. Our steel Falcon has never failed in duty, and we are very proud of that record. Independent optical tests show that the Falcon performs right alongside the highest quality scopes on the market, in terms of light transmission and distortion free clarity, at almost half the price. 

scope includes 
larue 30mm rings
larue picitiny lever mounts
Horus vision angle and level indicator for incline and decline shots as well as shooting with the crosshairs level

had it on my Remington 700 and it was a blast to shoot with till I sold the rifle, there were maybe 30 rounds shot through the rifle with the scope on it. all in all I had about 1600 in it, I would like to see 1200 out of it but I am willing to budge on the price to make a sale.
willing to trade for anything interesting, let me know what you have. the worst I can say is no thank you.
if your out of state I would be willing to use paypal and ups shipping"

Like me, you can remember back some years to when Taurus wasn't a popular name brand and had some quality issues. Well, times have changed and so has Taurus. They've put quality and customer service as their keystone and have built a strong product and company. They build great weapons and they are all warranteed for life. They used to be based out of Brazil. While their manufacturing is still done in Brazil, their Head Quarters are in Miami,Florida, USA. Give Taurus a second look and I'm sure you'll be impressed. The Judge is a prime example. Taurus was one of the first 45LC/.410Ga revolvers out of the chute and they haven't looked back. If you want to be impressed by the Judge's firepower, take a look at the YouTube videos. I recommend the Judge, it's fun to shoot, but requires the shooter to be much more aware of his target and the surrounding. Besides destroying the target, it can cause much collateral damage, if you're not careful. God is Great, life is beautiful and beer is good.

The newer WASR 10s that century are building are made with US parts and U.S barrels, which are generally less durable than their commie counterparts. 

Bottom line, this rifle is a reliable AK that is straight as far as canted parts are concerned. Rifle is zero'd, hardly any mag wobble, rivets are greAt. As far as the stock set, I refinished it with pine tar and shellac as the Russians do on their sets, I just tinted the shellac red.

The TAPCO extension tube is not just made to Mil-Spec profile, all finishes and materials are as required by military specifications. A smooth action and snug fit of the stock body onto the tube can be attributed to new processes. Each stock body is machine qualified to the exact dimension of the tube, for a no-rattle fit. Each stock also features a metal sling swivel.All receiver extensions are not equal, and TAPCO's tube is second to none. The best Mil-Spec extension available today, our tube is impact extruded, producing a much stronger part. This is done using 7075 T6 Aluminum, the same material as most AR receivers. Each tube then has the threads rolled on, a Mil-Spec process superior to standard cutting of threads into metal.TAPCO didn't skip any steps on the finishing process either. The inside of the tube is coated with Mil-Spec dry film lubricant that not only keeps the action quieter it reduces metal-on-metal contact, extending the service life of your buffer.

Beretta/Wilson 92G BRIGADIER TACTICAL

Wilson Combat and Beretta USA have collaborated to produce the ultimate 92 Series Tactical Pistol.

The 92G Brigadier Tactical features the most sought after Beretta 92 features and all-steel Beretta and Wilson Combat custom parts right out of the box.

Some features of the limited production Wilson Combat/Beretta 92G Tactical include steel ambidextrous decocker-only levers (G model), enhanced Brigadier slide, a modified M9A1 style checkered frame with accessory rail and rounded trigger guard. This model also features enhanced accuracy with an ""Elite"" style match grade stainless barrel with recessed target crown, the action features a ""D"" hammer spring for lighter trigger pulls, and Trijicon dovetail tritium front sight and Wilson Combat rear sight.  Wilson Combat G-10 grips, Wilson Combat steel guide rod and numerous other features to enhance performance. The 92G Tactical is finished in Beretta black Bruniton and marked with the Wilson Combat logo and specially serialized to ensure its place in Beretta history.

Although the 92G Tactical has been optimized by Beretta to meet the needs of high round count tactical and competitive shooters, further customization and finish work is available through Wilson Combat.

""Being a serious Beretta collector, I have always considered the 92G SD the best model ever produced, but almost too expensive and rare to shoot. I feel fortunate to have been able to work with the fine people at Beretta USA to produce a pistol that, in my opinion, is an improved 92G SD. Having Beretta USA build my dream 92 series pistol is awesome and I’m very happy that a lot of people will be able to enjoy this fine pistol model."" -Bill Wilson

This model is exclusive to Wilson Combat and available direct from Wilson Combat or from Wilson Combat Premier dealers only.

It's a plinker that I bought for someone who ended up not being into guns. Less than 200 shots have been fired through it and it's as mint as I can imagine a used gun being.

I purchased this rifle from Bass Pro for ~$225 after taxes and paperwork. Also included is a padded soft case which was ~$40.

In all, you will get the 597 rifle, the padded case, a trigger lock, and generic safety glasses for $150. If you went to Bass Pro this would cost you over $250, days of waiting, and a lot of paperwork.

I had surgery on both ""CMC"" (thumb) joints, and I haven't been able to work my way back up to shooting larger caliber handguns. I buy many premium guns like this, but I don't intend to own those I can no longer shoot. 

The gun is packaged with all of the original accessories, paperwork, and a warranty still to be filed. I also have three extra mags (included). 

If interested, I also have a new RMR and Docter Red Dot (3.5 and 4 MOA). Both are fully compatible with the adaptor plates that come with this gun (sold separately, but I'm willing to package a deal). 

The FNX 
With a 16 round capacity, night sights, a light rail, and a red dot ready platform, this hand cannon is top rated for home defense and tactical applications (if you're not familiar, just search for the rave reviews!). 

Improving on the FNP™-45 Tactical, developed for the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 Tactical is the latest in technological advancements in handgun engineering, offering .45 ACP performance and a host of unique features that no other handgun can match. The checkered polymer frame is offered in Black and Flat Dark Earth and has a low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil and enhanced operator control. Two interchangeable backstraps come standard to quickly customize the grip feel. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous for ease of use. The 5.3″ cold hammer-forged, stainless steel barrel has a threaded muzzle to accept sound suppressors, compensators and other accessories. The stainless steel slide has high-profile combat night sights and includes two mounting bases to accept multiple styles of optional red-dot electronic sights.

If you have any concerns, check out the gun! You can easily see that it's just like new, without slide marks, nicks or any other signs of wear. Honestly, you won't beat this price. The gun was $1200 here when I purchased it late last year, and I priced it to hopefully move quickly to someone who can enjoy it. 

I also have a like new Springfield TRP .45 in Polished Stainless, that'll be sold along with a brand new pelican case and eight extra Springfield and Wilson Combat 1911 Mags."

I have discovered that people are reluctant to buy this weapon because they mistakenly believe that it has plastic parts. Plastic wasn't added to the mix until about two to three years after this model was produced, so all that it has is old-fashioned metal and wood, with the minor exception of the butt plate, which is made of a single piece of extremely durable plastic. Other than that, no plastic parts are incorporated into this weapon's production model. Plastic was added after s/n prefix 351, while my Ruger's s/n prefix is 258, which is clearly way before the years where plastic became the go-to material.

Read here for the whole story: http://www.gunblast.com/Ruger-1022.htm, and about how Ruger started incorporating plastic into the manufacturing process around the early part of 2009, which is far after I had purchased mky model in 2005-2006.
***END EDIT***

This rifle is in excellent condition. It was part of collection of Ruger models that I have recently sold on Armslist.com. It is the standard carbine configuration that has a receiver on the bottom, and takes all sorts of different clips/magazines. All offers will be considered, but I am asking a fair price for a firearm that is in superb condition. Please call REDACTED, or email REDACTED.

Since the serial number falls midway between these two groups, I assume that without a certificate from the manufacturer, it is impossible to tell exactly when this rifle was produced. Suffice it to say that it was probably manufactured sometime in 2005 or 2006."

Serial #227xx, This gun absolutely pristine. Shoots exactly to the point of aim and even have ammo and dies to go with. What makes this gun so rare is the characteristics of a 99B vs. other model 99's is full Octagonal barrel 26"" long. Straight grip with a ""Perch Belly"" Steel rifle butt that is curved, schnoble tip knife edge dovetail. As you can tell in the pictures this gun is beautiful. This gun has never been drilled and tapped..

Model 99b's are rare and in this condition its even more rare. Model 99's used a rotary magazine to hold the cartridges. The rotating magazine uses a spring-loaded spool with grooves to hold the cartridges. It also has a counter to indicate how many shots are left. This guns counter works perfect and functions flawless.

The rotating magazine design allowed the rifle to be one of the first lever-action rifles to use spitzer bullets. Previous lever-action rifles used tubular magazines, which placed cartridges of ammunition end to end. Another safety feature was that upon cocking the rifle, a small pin protrudes above the top receiver to indicate the rifle is cocked and ready to fire. This design was ahead of its time. This is a very early model 99.

This is a great deer rifle or collector piece in its current refurbished condition. This gun will not disappoint. Email or text if interested 918-four02-0854. FTF in tulsa area only."
