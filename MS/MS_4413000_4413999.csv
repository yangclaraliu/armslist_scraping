Using the hard-hitting 8mm Mauser caliber, the M24/47 is made of steel and wood, no plastic, aluminium or cheap metal parts here. The trench warfare of WWI had taught the factory what works and what doesn’t. Skillful peace-time production gives you a Superior Mauser with benefits like a smoother action, a tighter lockup, neatly fitted sling swivels and a full wood upper.

Weight - 18.1 oz.In August of 1976, Mark Hazen started his career as a custom knife maker. At that time, he could not afford to purchase a custom knife, so he decided to make his own. That's when it all began. Initially, Mark made knives for his friends and eventually, his creative talent was sought after by customers throughout the USA. After 30 years as a renowned knife maker, Mark decided to retire in 2007. On September 23, 2013, he received a call from Colonel Jack Tobin, president of The Special Forces Association at Fort Bragg, NC. While at an estate auction preview, Colonel Tobin saw a knife which he felt would be perfect for Special Forces active duty personnel, as well as the members of the association. Mark came out of retirement and began his journey by making a knife in honor of his fallen friend, MSG Robert Horrigan, a Special Forces Operator stationed at Fort Bragg, NC.Mark Hazen, who mastered the art of knife making over the past 30 years, is reintroducing classic old world craftsmanship in new and innovative designs. Each knife is hand made without the use of jigs. The blade and edge geometry has been engineered into each model to ensure optimum performance for its intended use. The ergonomically designed handles are specifically contoured to give a comfortable and confident grip. Each Hazen knife is uniquely crafted and well suited for all military and law enforcement personnel, sportsmen and the discriminating collector.All the knives produced at Hazen Knives go through a 3-phase testing process to ensure that each knife meets uncompromising quality standards. Each batch of steel is tested since all are not exactly the same. One knife is made from each new batch and is rigorously tested by chopping through a 2X4 piece of lumber and cleanly slicing through a piece of 20 lb. paper. If the hardness and edge retention meet the standards of phase one, the cutting test, then the testing continues to phase two, the comfort test and phase three, the fit and finish test."

An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel.Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms:Manual thumb safetyGrip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firingFiring pin blockCaliber 9mm Luger Parabellum (9x19mm)Action Semi-autoOperating System BlowbackMagazine Type IWI, SteelMagazine Capacity 1-20 round and 1-25 roundBarrel Type Cold hammer forged, CrMoVBarrel Length 4.5""Overall Length 9.5""Weight 3.66 lbs.Rifling Right Hand, 1:10 inch twistGrip Color BlackSights Adjustable Target Sights"

The gun was completely redone by Arizona response the premier HK guy in the US. He re-barreled it with a RCM cold hammer forged barrel with the correct flutes, welded a rail on top for an optic, leveled the sights, did the paddle mag release, and refinished the whole gun. Fit and finish are top notch. The break is a PWS and is pinned on as I used to live in NY (this could be removed pretty easily by any good gunsmith). There is an enlarged cocking handle on the gun as well. Also installed by Arizona. Bill Springfield did the trigger job and its clean and crisp but not super light 5-6 pounds. Furniture is all HK and comes with Bipod. Comes with ammo and mags will get a count here shortly. If someone just wants the gun I will split it up but will not sell ammo before hand.

The guns listed in this collection will be sold this Saturday in Blacklick, Ohio about 10 minutes Southeast of Columbus.  

1915 Colt hammerless .32.  This firearm is remarkable condition.  It has a 6-digit serial number which I looked up on Colt’s website and obtained the information that it is a 1915 Colt hammerless.  This gun is fully functional and I would rate it at 90%+.  Asking price $600

Winchester lever action 30-30.  This gun has a scope mount with a bushnell scope 3x8.  This firearm also has a 6-digit serial number.  On Winchester’s website it indicates the gun was manufactured in 1907.  This gun is also in remarkable condition for its age and was hard to grade because I am aware that adding the scope mount and scope actually devalued the firearm.  Asking price $575

SKS Poly Tech.  This SKS has the arsenal triangle stamp indicating that it is a type 56 military-grade weapon and is also stamped Poly Tech on the side.  This gun looks to be in unused new condition.  I would grade this gun at 95-100%.  Being a Poly Tech with an arsenal stamp, asking price $425

SKS Paratrooper.  This is the short SKS carbine rifle.  It also has the arsenal triangle stamp indicating it is a type 56 military-grade weapon.  It is in amazing condition and appears to be unfired.  Asking price $475

Ruger 1022 rifle with one 10-round magazine.  This looks to be a standard model Ruger 1022.  It is in great condition.  Asking price $175

S&W 12ga shotgun mod 3000.  This gun is still in its original box.  Did some research and it is one that was made in Japan.  Researched several online websites and pricing this shotgun at $250

Mossberg 500 12ga shotgun in real tree cammo.  This gun has two barrels with it an 18in and what looks to be a 22 or 24in barrel.  This firearm is in excellent+ condition.  Asking price $300


H&R 16ga Topper with 28in barrel single-shot.  This gun shows some wear.  It appears it was a hunting shotgun but is functional.  Asking price $50

Stevens single-shot 410 shotgun with 28in barrel.  This gun is in fair condition and does appear to have been a hunting gun that shows damage to the finish and slight to the frame.  Asking price $50

This bow has been gently used throughout the time I've owned it. It has been shot almost exclusively during hunting season and to tune it so it's not a beat up range bow. This bow would make an excellent package for a newbie to bow hunting that wants a nice starter bow. It's also made with the larger person in mind. I am not selling junk, nothing is wrong with the bow I am getting rid of it to get some money to put towards a Carbon Matrix for next season. The bow does not come with a string. I took it off last season to put a new one on but never got around to it but previously I had a Vapor Trail VTX on it and it worked great. I also had a Winners Choice. Both performed great on the bow. The cables were both replaced approximately 18 months ago and are in good shape. This is a great all around bow for everything from hunting to 3D.

The shorter grip radius produces a shockingly comfortable shooting experience. You have to shoot the EMP® to believe how controllable it is.

They used scraps for the lower part of the stock because of the wood shortage at the end of the war. This gun does seem to be all original and complete as a WWII ""LAST DITCH"" Japanese Arisaka. It seems to be shootable (Good bore with rifling and a tight bolt fit) but it's been a wall hanger for me. I'm not sure I would want to shoot any of the Japanese ""Last Ditch"" weapons.

There were only 15  pistols commissioned and built to their specs. These pistols were held to very tight accuracy and precision tolerances, like all Nighthawks, but with Nighthawk knowing these were intended to be used in the line of duty.   These came with a Heinie Rear Sight, Trijicon Front Sight, STI Tactical Railed Frame, 5"" Bull Barrel, one piece guide rod, Beveled Magazine Well, NIghthawk/VZ Gator Back Grips, and Special Serial number.  The slide and frame were matched and finished by Nighthawk and were engrave under the slide by them as seen in the pics.  In total there were only 15 of these ever made and this is number 2.   Eventually, politics got in the way and these were never received by them do to the city council not giving them funding since these were not approved by them.   As shown in the pics, there is wear by the front from holstering, by the rail from removing a light, left Thumb Safety, and a previous owner is guilty of the idiot mark for reinstalling the slide stop.

I'm selling my Smith and Wesson M&P22. It's the popular 22lr hand gun that is used for training off the M&P line (M&P9/M&P40). It's the fullsize model with the 4.1"" barrel. I ended up buying an extra magazine for it. I have really enjoyed it but have found I haven't taken it out in a long time. I bought it as a less expensive way to become familiar with the M&P line but found it is absolutely amazing for introducing new shooters to the hobby. Very fun, very accurate and best of all you can shoot until you are tired and bored and not break the bank."
