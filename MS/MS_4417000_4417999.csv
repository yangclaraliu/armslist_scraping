The Shadow platform has been known for accuracy and the new Accu-Shadow takes it to the next level. The Accu-Bushing system holds the barrel with much more precision, enabling us to cut group sizes nearly in half. In testing, the pistols returned groups substantially less than 3″ at 50 yards (using Fiocci 124 JHP). Add to that a full complement of custom work including competition hammer, lighter springs (11 lb. recoil, 13 lb. main), thin black aluminum grips, stainless steel guide rod and polished internals.

A short-reset disconnector is used to greatly reduce trigger reset between shots, making this SA/DA trigger reset like a nicely-tuned single-action only trigger. The Accu-Shadow is topped with a fiber optic front and HAJO serrated target rear (adjustable for height, also drift adjustable for windage)."

My price is firm as these run in worse condition on gunbroker anywhere from $560-650, depending on who's selling."

Not 100% sure of round count. I put 24 rds through it. I bought it used a couple of years ago for an elk hunt- dropped a 500lb cow from little over 225yds, one shot didn't take another step. So, if you are wanting a big game rifle or a long range shooter-here it is.

This is NOT one of the contracted by Remington made ones.   I'm not sure if this is called the Marauder model but might be.  It's in amazing condition and has the JM ""John Marlin"" proof mark as shown in the 3rd pic. This is a highly desired ""pre safety model"".  Plus the 35 caliber is the perfect hunting round and has an edge giving more stopping power and it performs best at short to medium ranges. Very rich classic blueing that the latter ones just don't have. This one is scope mounted with a Bushnell High Contrast Optics ""Unknown model"" scope which I believe is a 3x9x something. I am selling it with the newer Uncle Mikes Camo sling as well.  The original wood stock had a crack in it.  I just didn't want to sell it with that issue so I literally bought a brand new Champion Mossy Oak stockset for it and just installed it this week. The Mossy Oak ones by Champion are in short supply, are very desirable for hunters and command a premium over the black ones,  I paid 85 Bucks for it. This is a turn key Hunter, home defender, or just plain fun cowboy shooting rifle. I took apart the entire rifle when I had the stock off and meticulously cleaned the bleep out of everything with break free so you wont have to do a single thing with this rifle.  And for what it's worth I spent a lot of time doing that.  It's obvious this rifle has been barely shot for it's age. Optics are perfect as well.  Micro grooved barrel.  Rifle made in North Haven Conn. This ones gonna hurt to let go of. This is a hunters dream rifle. Please factor that this is is the more rare version than the gazillion 30-30's that were made and further reminder of No safety. No cheapezoids  as you'll be wasting your time and as for trade offers I know guns so don't try your tricks with me. No disrespect to the good guys/gals out there.
Face to face only, Va residents only, have proof of resident papers and or photo id's, bill of sale will be done, over 18, legally be able to purchase a firearm.
Sorry, but I have been crazy busy lately and can only sell close to the Arlington Area.
I will take offers but I'm not looking to go too much lower than my asking price.  There is an obvious no shipping/ transfer/tax thing here and my price is very fair with that considered.  I am open to trades but I prefer to sell for cash.  I will entertain trade offers though.  I am mainly interested in 32/380/38/357/9mm handguns or assault type semi rifles.  Please only quality trade offers Smith, Ruger, Sig, etc.  Hope to do business but I won't cry if I keep this Beauty either.
I apologize but my phone browser is flipping my pics upside down. But you can still see the rifle though.  The one close up  pic is evidence of the ""JM"" stamp by the mouth of the barrel where it meets the receiver."

Unlike many currently fielded 7.62x51mm rifles, controllability under recoil is a hallmark of the MK 17, allowing the operator to readily engage targets with multiple well-aimed rounds.

It has a cold hammer-forged, fully free-floating barrel capped with a 3-prong flash suppressor. The receiver-integrated MIL-STD 1913 optical rail plus three accessory rails enable mounting of a wide variety of tactical lights and lasers.

Like its 5.56 mm counterpart, the MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series, only in a semi-automatic rifle configuration developed for civilian users.

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons.

Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially.

The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components.

The MR762A1 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series including adjustable buttstocks, ergonomic pistol grips, mechanical sights, and the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard. This MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” type rail system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be removed without special tools by the user and ensures 100% return to zero when reinstalled.

Ambidextrous operating controls are standard on the MR762A1, including a convertible charging handle and an ambidextrous selector lever. The MR762A1 uses the same 10- and 20-round translucent polymer box magazines made for the HK417. MR762A1 rifles are well-suited for a variety of applications including law enforcement tactical, police patrol, general sporting, and hunting (a 5-round magazine is under development)."

Taking an essentially standard MR762A1 semi-automatic rifle, HK turns it into a more effective precision rifle by an astute addition of the right optics and accessories. A Leupold 3-9VX-R Patrol 3-9x40mm scope and mount, HK G28 adjustable cheekpiece buttstock, and LaRue Tactical BRM-S bipod are the primary add-ons that make the MR762A1 Long Rifle Package (LRP) more than a sum of parts. The MR762A1 LRP employs the same HK proprietary gas piston operating system found on current HK rifles and carbines, using a pusher rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. Shooters can expect a long-life barrel due to HK's famous cold hammer forging process. Additional accessories and add-ons for the LRP variant of the MR762A1 include an Ergo pistol grip, Blue Force Gear sling, and Otis cleaning kit. Rifle package, complete with one 20- and one 10-round magazine, is shipped ready to use with the scope attached in a compact 42-inch Model 1720 Pelican case."

The result? A new stock system that reduces felt recoil by as much as 48% over the competition! This stock was developed to take the sting out of 3 1/2-inch magnum loads –– you can imagine what it does with target ammo! What's even more important to the competitive shooter is that this revolutionary system reduces muzzle climb by 15% and allows the shooter to get back on target up to 69% faster than with other brand shotguns. That's right, you will be busting your second target before your opponent has recovered from his first! You'll smoke more clays with dense patterns thrown from Benelli's new Crio™ barrel. It puts as much as 13.2% more pellets on target than the competition! In most sporting clays tournaments, only one clay separates the winner from the losers. With Benelli's new SuperSport™ it is almost like having an unfair advantage. Extended CrioChokes™ reduce pellet deformation for better clay busting performance. The ported barrel combined with the ComforTech™ system almost eliminates muzzle climb for fast second target acquisition. A high-visibility red bar sight and 10mm to 8mm tapered stepped rib, preferred by competitive shooters, provides fast and consistent sight alignment. Extended CrioChoke™ tubes fit Sport II and SuperSport models"

A shotgun that feels and shoots like a Benelli from the moment you pick it up to the moment you break it open.
When innovation and inspiration collided the 828U was born–the first O/U worthy of the Benelli badge. With the strength of steel and the weight of aluminum, the 12-gauge 828U has redefined the category.
The 828U features a patented steel locking system and plate, which eliminates the transference of stress-causing shot pressure to the receiver and hinge pins. The compact, easily removable trigger group increases safety and reliability. A redesigned opening lever provides a smoother, more consistent opening action. From butt to barrel, there is nothing about the 828U that hasn’t been rethought and improved.
Progressive Comfort and the 828U.
The Progressive Comfort System is housed within the 828U walnut stock. The progressive nature of the system allows for a constant smooth level of recoil absorption, regardless of light or heavy load.

Steel locking plate.
At the heart of Benelli’s Steel Locking System is a solid steel breech block that locks directly to the rear of the barrel, keeping all pressure from the shot shell contained inside–preventing its transfer to the receiver and hinge pins.

Adjustable drop and cast.
Benelli has created the first O/U that allows for a custom fit stock. With 5 drop and 4 cast shims the 828U can be adjusted to one of 40 possible stock positions. The adjustable stock allows a shooter to find their natural alignment with the barrel and target, which translates into more broken targets.

Opening lever.
The 828U triggers reset when the top lever is unlocked instead of by opening the barrels as traditional O/U’s–creating a smoother, more consistent opening action.

Impulse activated ejectors.
The ejector system in the 828U is all contained on the barrel. When the shell is fired pressure activates the ejector. This innovative design eliminates the need for linkages between trigger group and the forend–allowing for a stronger, more streamlined ejection system.

Removable trigger group.
The compact and removable trigger group makes for easier cleaning and eliminates complicated linkage between forearm and trigger mechanism, significantly increasing reliability."

This a great rifle in like new condition; I hardly used it over the years because I was deployed so much.  This includes: hard case, mag, rail covers and an added mag pul single point attachment.  New they normally sold for $1400, MSRP was $1600.  They do not make this gen anymore.  S&W changed a lot of parts in the next generations, they went to a much cheaper internally built rail system instead of Troy.  They went from Troy sights that cost $200 to cheaper magpul sights.  The new rifles do not have a chrome barrel either.  Please do not email me comparing this rifle to the newer versions on pricing.

You are looking at a used in great condition Glock 30 gen4 with literally only 50 rounds down the pipe and put back in the safe. I was going to use this gun for off duty wespon, but it's just to heavy for me. In the package bundle you get a brand new serpa holster ($46 value), glock ($600 my cost), and 252 rounds of ammo ($145 added up over purchases). I will not separate anything from the package deal at this time. If you do not like my price let's not waist each others time because you will be respectively ignored and if continued to email me regarding that my price sucks and being disrespectful you will be reported thank you.

For whatever reason, I really am looking for a hammer fired pistol. I am wide open. Make an offer, per the usual... the worst I can say is no thanks!


I am looking to stay in 9mm; however, I have 200rds (4 boxes) of Winchester 124gr NATO and another 200rds(4 boxes) of 124gr Magtech bonded JHP coming in the mail, due on 6/12/15. If you want to swap ammo, I'm down.


If you want to make a cash offer, feel free to do that.


Side notes:
-My primary CCW is a G22, thus I have holsters that fit this G17 already, thus an expense I do not have to undertake. A super big bonus on your end would be the presence of a quality kydex OWB holster, but not a deal breaker.

-Furthermore, my G17 does not have night sights on it, so I do not expect NS on your pistol. That being said, if your pistol has some quality NS with lots of life left in them, great! Same thing applies to multiple magazines.

-I am looking for full/mid size fighting pistols. No sub compact or pocket guns...just not my thing. I'm a big boy, I can carry big guns comfortably...


I live near Cabela's, north of Fort Worth.

It's a newer Glock 17L so it's got the newer finish that shows wear very easily. Gun is perfect mechanically but has a few light handling and holster marks.

I'll want to peek at a permit to purchase/carry and ID. Also I'll provide a bill of sale to fill out with both of us getting copies. Google can show you pretty much anything you want to see or know. I'm pretty much firm on the price. If you can ever find one cheaper, congratulations. Buy that one, otherwise I really doubt you'll find a hen 3 that hasn't been shot and best to hell for this price. I can send more detailed photos (of the little nicks and marks here and there if you're really picky about that kind of stuff) upon request but right now AL won't let me upload more than one photo."

This gun has a unique history that relates to the limited time frame these guns were made. Additionally, it was revealed in today's news  ( Google: Colt bankruptcy) that this iconic American company is going to file for bankruptcy in the next few days which will likely drive it's value higher. I am not a gun collector but the few I have talked to tell me to expect a surge in sales of Colt products. This particular gun comes with original Colt rubber band gribs, minimal signs of wear, a speed loader with 6 Winchester hollow point .357's, good fitting leather holster, trigger locking mechanism and key, and water tight lock box.

This handgun has 9400 medium velocity target rounds through the pipe and has been meticulously cared for since its birth in 2008. This weapon has been cleaned after every firing and has only been lubed with the recommended Wilson Combat Ultimalube grease and oil which has superior lubricity qualities. At round count 7600 I had the armor tuff finish removed and the entire pistol coated in Ion Bond DLC, which has superior hardness and lubricity over many conventional finishes. Ion bond soaks up oil, making it an ideal finish for an all metal firearm such as this.

I don't know much about its history but from the looks of it, it has less than 100 rounds through it. It is a beautiful gun in pristine condition.  As it currently sits it is a bare rifle, meaning no red dot or telescoping fore grip as in the picture, it didn't even come with standard sights, but I could probably find some if you really wanted me to, I am willing to negotiate if the buyer wants them (red dot and fore-grip). I will also throw in a case and a p-mag or 2. I'm asking 1800 cash or somewhere around 2200 trade value. At the moment, it is just sitting in the safe not being used and I feel like someone should be shooting such a fine rifle. Feel free to message me any trade offers or any questions about the gun you may have. I can also txt you pictures of specifics if you wish. I am willing to trade for multiple guns but no crap. I also don't want archery(unless it's high end), no black powder, or anything reloading related.

The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014.Caliber: 9mmLength: 7.34 inchesHeight: 5.41 inchesWidth: 1.32 inchesBarrel Length: 4.09 inchesSight Radius: 6.38 inchesWeight Empty: 25.56 ozMagazine Capacity: 15+1Trigger Pull: 5.4 lbsTrigger Travel: .24 inchesReturn Travel: .12 inchesBarrel Profile/Twist: Polygonal, 6 Grooves, Right Hand Twist, 1 in 9.8 inches"
