This is a serious weather resistant Scout style rifle for the serious hunter and/or back packer. It comes up to a natural and fast sight acquisition.
Made with reasonable compactness thereby avoiding a long cumbersome barrel when climbing around and handy in various other environments it's intended for. Excellent for a black bear stand. Hence, this is a Scout style rifle and not a Mountain-Lite pencil barrel creation.
Lots of detailed pics to share upon request.
Professionally built with these features: 
* HS Precision Pro Series Stock - Desert Tan w/ black webbing. 
* Remington 700 long action - new and lapped.
* Trigger Job is awesome 3-lbs. - Absolutely crisp with zero creep or over travel.
* Bartlein stainless steel 20"" barrel - #4 Contour w/ crown. Delivery time on their      barrels average an anguishing 5 to 6 months but well worth the wait. Bartlein is the rage for custom builds. Quality and accuracy is second to none. 
* Matted finish to reduce glare.
* Duracoat black finish over the stainless steel.
* Seekins Precision 0-MOA Scope Base. Machined from 7075-T6 aluminum to the 1913 Picatinny Specification, it's a rock solid base. $99.99
* Extreme Hardcore Gear - Ranger 30mm Tactical Scope Rings: $149.99 (30mm scope tube gathers much more light in lower light conditions and dark timber.) 
I will provide a set of 1"" Warn steel rigs in lieu of the Ranger 30mm rings at buyers preference.
* Weight approximately 8lbs, 11ozs.
This rifle was crafted for a range of purposes and will shine when carrying on mountain backpack hunts, stalking in heavy timber, hiking/camping in bear country and all the while delivering a whole lot of terminal power.
The 35 Whelen cartridge will easily take, elk, moose, large bears, deer or other large game and serves as excellent bear protection when your game is on the ground. It's a hammer on deer size game with 185-grain and 200-grain projectiles.
 If you aren't familiar with the 35-Whelen, it is a 30.06 parent case necked out for .358 caliber bullets. It is an amazing round that's off the charts in terms of immediate incapacitation and terminal effects. Ask any experienced 35-Whelen owner and they will reaffirm its legendary big-game stopping power. Excellent record on big bears in Alaska as well.
The articles pretty much say it all:  
http://35whelen.blogspot.com/ 
http://www.northforkbullets.com/magento/blog/?p=373
Note: 
This rifle has had 12-rounds initially fired through it to season the barrel. Outside that, it has not seen range time or the hunting field. Solid 3/4-moa accuracy during break in, the rifle will be outstanding with custom hand loading. 35-Whelen is known for its inherit accuracy and is ""not finicky"" for reloaders. I expect the groups will tighten up even more with hand-loading.
Mixed emotions about selling this unique dreamed of rifle, but my daughter is now ready to chase elk with dad so it's time to outfit her with a good quality rifle that's more suited to her.
AMMUNITION: One (1ea.) 20-round box of ""original"" Federal 225-grain Trophy Bonded Bear Claw Nickle Cased Ammunition is included with the rifle. Two additional 20-round boxes will be available to the buyer for $40.00 per box. Good way to get a start on (60 ea.) nickel plated brass for reloading.
I am holding the ammunition until the rifle is sold. If successful buyer declines the extra ammunition, it will be listed for sale at $45.00 per box. TBBC is lethal and like gold, since it is no longer offered in 35 Whelen . . . too bad Federal dropped that line in 35-Whelen, but it appears not enough 35-Whelen demand to make it worth their efforts. 
Buyer pays actual shipping cost of ammunition since shipping ammunition with a firearm is prohibited. 
SHIPPING IS FREE FOR THE RIFLE
PRIVATE SELLER: Can only ship to an FFL holder if buyer resides outside the State of Montana. All FFL rules apply.

Started out as a base model Stag Mod 2 that has been added to.  All factory furniture has been replaced with magpul, grip, forend, and ACS stock.  Has a Vickers Tactical two point sling that I added Magpul MS3 hardware to so now it functions as a two point/one point convertible sling.  Has a BCM Gunfighter charging handle and a Surefire Procomp muzzle brake/compensator that does an excellent job at reducing recoil and muzzle rise.  Originally was running it with an optic but I have switched it back to iron sights and it is fairly light weight if that's important to you.  Will also come with a Condor Tactical chest rig that will hold ten magazines, multiple pistol mags, and a vertical universal pistol holster that will hold just about anything, even handguns with lights.  Will come with ten magazines, six magpul and four GI's, and about 300 rounds of Tula 223.

This has been an excellent, 100% reliable rifle for me with zero malfunctions of any kind, has had around a thousand rounds through it of mixed brass and steel, so it is not picky.  If you aren't familiar with STAG they make very high quality rifles and are a contract parts manufacturer for many of the big name AR producers on the market now.  Totally mil spec, chrome lined barrel, M4 feed ramps, MPI inspected BCG, and just about everything else you could want in an AR. Only thing I can say against it is that it has some scuffs on the left side of the receiver from rubbing against gear.

I'm looking to switch things up, so I would be interested in a partial trade for a quality AK47, primarily one of Yugo manufacture (absolutely no WASR's).  Would also be interested in partial trade for a quality 9mm, particularly a SIG P226 229 or M11, HK VP9, or Beretta 92.  might consider a commander length 1911.

If you'd prefer to buy I would sell for $1100, fairly firm on price, I have over $1400 in it.  Would consider multiple firearm trades as well.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

I won this bow at a banquet raffle in Kentucky. The only reason I'm selling it is because before I won this bow my wife purchased a New Hoyt as an early Christmas gift for me.

It sits in my closet now waiting to be purchased. It is in pristine condition and with absolutely nothing wrong with it. You are basically getting a bran new out of the box bow. 

The bow features a 28"" axle to axle, perfect for ground blinds and tree stands. This is the Black Crimson, one of Mathews custom colors. This bow will come loaded with the following accys:

Axion Archery stabilizer w/ 2 harmonic stabilizers inside
Wrist sling

Please feel free to text or email with any questions. Like I said before, I shot 15 arrows through it at Hoffman's archery shop just so they could tune it. You will not be disappointed in this biw. It's shoots fast and smooth, with a rock solid wall.

There is much info to be found online regarding this knife so I'll spare you the general details. Knife is about 25 years old. 

The Bianchi knife itself was made by Solingen, Germany. All parts of the original ""survival kit"" are present and accounted for. This was a rare variant in that it came with the military nylon sheath, polished blade, and green handle instead of tan or black handle, bead blasted finish and leather sheath. The nylon sheaths were pitched to the military to replace the leather pilots/survival knife sheath. When the government declined, Bianchi decided to sell the military sheaths with the early Nighthawk 2 knives until supplies were depleted. If you look at a Bianchi M9 holster the construction is identical. As only a couple hundred of the military sheaths were made most of these came with the leather type. Blade has some marks from sheath insertion but appears to have not been actually used or resharpened. Asking $350. Will deduct $175 for those wanting to buy just the knife. Will not sell sheath seperately.

I'm open to trades such as Colt 6450/6951/RO635 9mm AR-15 upper (just the complete upper-don't necessarily need bolt carrier assembly or charging handle), Remington 870 (any condition), .22lr, 9mm, .45, 5.56mm or 7.62mm ammo, Browning Hi Power mags, Glock 17, 19, 20, 22, 23 mags, Smith 4006 mags, Smith 645 or 4506 mags, H&K USP .40 mags, Sig P220 seven round mags with ""zipper back"", M14, Walther P5 or 1911 mags or whatever you have that may strike my fancy. If your trade is worth more I'd obviously add cash or other trade items on my end.

All deals will be in the quiet suburbs outside Baltimore.

I have several hundred feedback (all positive) between ebay, gunbroker, and many firearm and vehicle related forums. This said, I will see to it that everything on my end goes smoothly. The rest is up to you.

The only difference is the rear shelf is welded to the receiver, preventing a fully automatic setup.  All other parts are compatible, including as you see in the picture the authentic forearm.  These are no longer being made, no more of these will ever be imported.  I don't want to see it go, but I'm more in need of a new car than anything at this point.

As far as rounds through it, I'm estimating around 100.  Cleaned everytime after use.  It breaks down easily and cleans simple.  I've never had any kind of malfunction, this gun will eat anything you feed through it.  HP, FMJ, whatever you would choose.  You could apply for an SBR and put a stock on it, or AOW and put a vertical foregrip, or both.  Any way you want to go, this gun is accurate and will do what you need to do.

This comes with four or five mags, one original 30 rounder came with the gun, three or four KCI mags, and I have one Uncle Mike's submachine gun case, and the original case it came in.

I would prefer to do local sale only.  I'm not interested in any trades.  Price is firm."

The Ultimate Shooting Rest Caldwell's team of engineers has developed a series of rifle rests that incorporate their new ""Fire Control"" mechanism. ""Fire Control"" is an advanced alignment system that allows the shooter continual, one-hand adjustment of downrange crosshair alignment via a multi-directional control arm.   The Fire Control mechanism allows continuous adjustment of the front forend support by manipulating the control arm with your fingertips. Once the coarse adjustments have been made to position the rest, the control arm allows fluid movement for precise crosshair alignment without having to change shooting position to loosen or tighten rest components. The end result is unmatched control of crosshair alignment in a rock solid shooting platform which delivers better accuracy than any existing rest. Simply move the control arm in any direction to precisely align the crosshairs on your target.

This has the metal finish in very good comndition with some small area of brown patina. no rust and no bear metal. This one has a replaced stock that is not original to the rifle, but the stock is in excellent condition and fits the rifle perfect. Everything else seems to be original and in really good condition including the bolt, trigger group and guard, front and rear sights, and screws. The stock has a nice leather pad as you see in pictures. Some Winchester collector may want this rifle even with the replaced stock. There are very few left in this condition and rarely do they come on the market, and it is hard to put a price on them. I would like to get $450 plus shipping.

Because you requested it, Buffalo Bore is now producing two full power 357 Sig. loads. These loads are full power 357 Sig. Not the watered down stuff that other factories are already producing. Why is it that a new cartridge gets developed with touted ballistics in the media, only to have the ammo manufacturers ""water"" it down after a few years on the market? (The same thing happened with the original 10MM) The 357 Sig. was designed to blast a 125gr. bullet at 1,425 FPS out of a four inch carry gun barrel. (Not a much longer test barrel) So, that is what both our loadings do.

We use flash suppressed powder so that you wont be blinded by your own gun fire should you be required to drop the hammer in low light. Since over 90% of civilian shootings in America happen in low light, flash suppressed ammunition is a huge tactical advantage.

Item 25A utilizes the 125gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet. It is designed to open radically and penetrate roughly 12 to 14 inches in human tissue. Note my velocities from my real world pistol, (not a test barrel) below.

a. Sig. Mod. 229, 4 inch barrel - 1,430 fps (567 ft. lbs.)

Item 25B utilizes a 124gr. FMJ flat nose bullet at 1,425 fps. This bullet will smash through typical stick frame walls, car doors and a bears skull or shoulder bones. It is designed for those who need deep penetration. It should penetrate 24+ inches in human tissue. If I were carrying a 357 Sig. for defense, I would carry my pistol with our 125gr. JHC (jacketed hollow cavity) loaded in the chamber and the top 4 or 5 rounds in the magazine. The remaining rounds in the magazine would be these FMJ flat nose loads. Why? After the first few rounds are fired in a fight, most opponents will be dead or behind cover. The FMJ flat nose loads will penetrate many types of cover that would stop a hollow nose bullet. Note my velocities, from my real world pistol, (not a test barrel) below.

This rifle cycles all three .22 rounds, unlike most newer semi-autos.   .22 short has been easier for me to find lately, and this rifle is very accurate with them - PLUS, its a lot quieter using shorts as well.

Beautiful wood stock.  The receiver has some slight scratches on it, and the barrel has a tad bit of blueing wear...but it looks great for a 40 year old rifle.  AND its a genuine MADE-IN-THE-USA Winchester!

Manufacturer specs:

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, V5-300 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

They come equipped with Vickers Tactical sights, mag release, slide catch and magazine base plates. These GLOCK models will also have unique serial numbers (0000LAV- 4999LAV) for collectability and authenticity. Larry Vickers chose close industry partners Wilson Combat to create the sights and Tango Down who manufactured all other parts. When asked about the gun Larry said, “I’m proud to be working with Lipsey’s on a pair of GLOCK pistols that not only feature my parts, but are offered in a configuration never before available in the market. Serious GLOCK fans take note, these guns are a must have.” Thes are nolonger in stock at Lipseys or any other distributor. Supposedly there were 2000-2500 of these made. There are a few G17's left in stock but no G19's. I am selling this one for only $600.00. You will not find one cheaper anywhere. The price is firm and I am not interested in trades. I am located in Azle but can meet you in a reasonable distance. Call or text me at 817-714-11 one five. Thanks!"

This rifle has never been fired, which has been really tough for me, considering it’s the most bad ass sniper rifle I have ever put together. You need balls the size of church bells to carry this gun to the field. This rifle may not be for everyone, side effects may include higher testosterone levels, more chest hair, grilling raw meat on a wood fire, patriotism, lots of woman trying to crawl into your bedroom window, being promoted at work, freedom, pouring whiskey on your cereal, and witty James Bond one liners. You will, for the first time, begin to understand the Constitution of the United States and feel the hand of the founding fathers rest on your battle scarred shoulder in approval as the recoil from a .308 caliber hunk of lead greatness beats the wimp out of you, and blows through the engine block of that sissy Prius being driven by Michael Moore and his ISIS friends armed with their pathetic stamped steel abortion of a firearm. If you want precision, firepower, and pure testosterone wrapped a glorious blanket of aluminum perfection then look no further. If you would rather show up at the range sporting your pretty pink .380 that your wife taught you to shoot then just keep scrolling buddy because this masterpiece of modern engineering is too much for your tiny liberal brain to comprehend. You might as well go join your other vegan hippy friends at the democratic national convention. This rifle understands you, and as you take command of the custom aluminum forged Remington 700 bolt knob, you become more and more aligned as one with the patriots of old, the Marines of Tunn tavern, and Chesty Puller himself smiles down on you from heaven’s gates of pearl and concertina wire. You will piss napalm. You won't need to take protein shakes anymore because your muscles are already exploding from your new all-bacon diet cooked from the 800 lb wild boar that you just killed with your bare hands. The Magpul PRS stock is a sturdy adjustable polymer construction and the rubber Hogue grip on this black beauty ensures you get a firm grasp with your blood soaked fingers. Is it made of light weight recycled plastic? No, it’s heavy barrel, because you need to weed out the weak pansies on your hunting trips that whine about the “cold” weather or complain about the “land mines”. This marvel of American innovation eats terrorists for breakfast. If you'd rather a foreign made firearm then call me, and I will send you a bottle of pepper spray instead that you can carry inside your flower print panties. And forget conceal carrying. This gun was not meant to be pampered or concealed but rather to expose those lesser men at the range that have already succumbed to allowing their wives to make the purchasing decisions in their house. How sad. But you won't be one of those ""men"". You'll be the reincarnated Carlos Hathcock, back from the dead, honing his skills on wild bison of the Great Plains and amber waves of grain. Are you really going to let your wife stand in the way of your 2nd amendment rights that so many men died defending in World War II? Of course not. You and I understand that the smell of gunpowder in the morning gives you more of a kick than her mocha latte frappachino ever could. Buried deep with the primal instincts of every man's gut, lives a fire than cannot be quenched with a thousand video games and as you unleash your inner Rambo and bond your itchy trigger finger with her gorgeous display of USA craftsmanship forged from the Hammer of Thor himself, your man points increase 10 fold. The Harris engineering bipod will hold your death machine securely on atop your red white and blue zodiac vessel during nighttime amphibious assaults. The scope is not included because, well, you wouldn't want me telling your mistress what dress to wear now would you? However, if a 6-24x50 illuminated Rangefinder reticule satisfies your lust to reach out and touch that target at 1000 yards well then message me and I'm sure I can accommodate you. If you feel like you’re are interested in it, but aren't a serious buyer because you want to ""sleep on it"", then do me a favor and wait until your balls drop before you send me your pre-pubescent pleas to lower the price. The price is as firm as my... well its really firm, let’s just say that. You won't pay any extra taxes or fees on this rifle because I am not a communist. Shipping is free for my fellow marines. If you don't think that's fair then go write your liberal senator. If you require shipping then I will insure that this metal merchant of destruction is mailed to an FFL near to your house. If you do not have a gun store near your house, then you are likely a socialist PETA member from California and I cannot help you. I reside in Kennesaw, GA where the law requires that every male head of the household own a firearm. *bald eagle screeches in background*. Oorah. Yut. Echo 5 Romeo over and out.

The early ""AW"" series have a heavy Wilson target barrel that has 12 flutes, same as the original HK9112 and will shoot any surplus .308/7.62x51 ammo, which many of the newer PTR-91's won't shoot. Today PTR states that the PTR stands for Precision Tactical Rifle. Back when this was made in 2006 - PTR stood for Precision TARGET Rifle. 

The SN for this rifle is AW14XX. The bolt gap is within tolerance at .008. The bore is mint and the rifling is clear and crisp.  I installed the HK heavy recoil buffer and had the entire rifle has had a professional militec-1 dry lubricant treatment (same treatment the military uses for corrosion prevention). I will include a sight tool, removable HK/GI 3 point sling, and Pelican gun case with the foam cutouts for everything included. I will also include ten (Pre ban) 20round magazines, one 10 round mag and a box of Winchester RP .308 hunting rounds.

This thing will shoot. I bought it new and have only run 700 rounds through it. I know because I have 300 Left I am selling on this ad. Only selling because I am moving to Hawaii and this gun doesn’t get to come with me there. $1200 gets everything listed above.

I also am listing a can of .308 Argentinian surplus ball ammo. 300 rounds for $150. This is excellent ammo that has become very hard to find. It is noncorrosive, Berdan primed, safe, reliable, accurate, and clean burning. I will let the ammo go with the gun for an additional $150 or sell it separately for $200. 

This is priced to sell so please know that this is my bottom dollar pricing. Also unless you have a victory highball in your possession I am not interested in trades. 

I am not open to shipping or selling sight unseen. Also am not familiar with every states local law. Please do your research to prevent any issues. I do know this Isn't Mass compliant due to the threaded barrel and Flash suppressor. To be Mass compliant you would need to have a muzzle break pinned and welded to the barrel after purchase.

This is a Coharie Arms CA89 which is a truly remarkable MP5K variant. The Coharie is unique in that it does not require any modifications to accept any of the class 3 items so unlike the other clones these are the only ones that are more exact replicas. I am not certain but I was told they produced less than 500 of these total. It has been fired but is immaculate and spent most of its like as a safe queen (since 1998). Comes with factory hard case, 4 mags, and paperwork, oh and the front sight was swapped to a night sight.

I am really wanting a fde SCAR 17S, Tavor, FS2000, 5.7x28 combo or a Steyr Aug, but I am truly open to hear all offers. I would consider high end AR-15s or AR-10s. or multiple guns. Quality night vision is always a plus such as AN/PVS-22 , AN/PVS-18 , AN/PVS-14, AN/PVS-7 or similar. I am also specifically looking for thermal such as PAS/23, MTM-IR, UTM, Oasys, UTC, PAS/13G, or similar. I can add cash or other items, please look at my listings if interested and please do not be afraid to offer, if I am interested I will let you know, I don't blow smoke.

Please look these up before assuming value, the last one I saw sold online for over $3000 and didn't have the case or extra mags.

FTF or FFL to FFL only and yes I will ship.
Thanks 

Make any offer if interested, I want to move this, you never know Thanks
