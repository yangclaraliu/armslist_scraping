Here is some info onthe ak
One of the better AK builds you can buy, short of a Custom Job by Krebs. This is a Vector Arms model AUSA underfoler. It's an Armory USA receiver put together with a matching numbers Bulgarian parts kit, the exact same build that Krebs Custom uses for their underfolders. This isn't some pieced together crap build, AUSA receivers are 1.5 mil steel, whereas the standard AK runs a 1.0 mil receiver. As a point of comparison, the RPK Medium Machine Gun uses a 1.6 mil receiver for rigidity. The Bulgarian parts kits used by Vector are mint, all numbers matching.  stock is pretty tight for an underfolder. 

 If you're an AK fan, and you appreciate quality, then you'll know the difference between a Vector and a CAI pot luck gun. Please don't shoot me lowball offers, if you want a cheap AK, go buy one of those frankenguns. I'm open to reasonable offers though. If you want a quality rifle, one of the best AKs you can get your hands on, shoot me a message."

This is really a AWESOME PISTOL !!! the size, high capacity and 45 ACP makes this the perfect personal defense / carry pistol. The fact that its so rare makes it a very collectable pistol. Those facts combined together means that the value of this pistol will do nothing but keep going up. 
It shoots amazing, the ported barrel and slide GREATLY REDUCES the muzzle flip and recoil (its basically like shooting a 38, 380 or 9MM). The size makes it very concealable for carry. Not that you buy a pistol because its look cool, but this one Does and always gets a lot of attention. 
It comes with  3 - 10 rounds Springfield mags that work perfectly and 2 Para 12 rounds mags, one works great the other one ""not so much"", a hard case, and cleaning brush. The  grips and grip screws where customized and looks great on the pistol. The pistol is not perfect, but its is very good condition. The 1911 V10s single stacks are few and far between, BUT this is a 1911 V10 ULTRA COMPACT - ""HIGH CAPACITY / DOUBLE STACK"" IN STAINLESS with a 3 1/2"" Barrel. They are so RARE very hard to find, at the time of this posting I can't find another one for sail anywhere. Looking for offers, but not lowball ones, call or text if your interested 517-488-488zero"

I had a stainless steel trigger and grip screws professionally installed that cost another $100. I was trying to convince her to shoot but after 15 rounds she wanted nothing to do with it and she simply is not interested in shooting. I finished shooting the other 35 rounds that were in the box and that is all it has been fired. It is an amazing shooting and looking gun and it fired all 50 rounds flawlessly. Comes with the Sig night sights, ambi safety, one seven round magazine, owners manuals, case, and original trigger that was removed. This is the nicest shooting and looking compact 9mm handgun you will find.

This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands.  The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American."

-Eight Glock 19 mags (15 rounds each, one with pearce grip holds 17rds) two have Vickers tactical FDE base plates for much easier ripping out if an emergency occurs.

-Vickers U notch rear and tritium steel front site

-Streamlight TLR-1S with original box

-Extended FDE mag release

-Extended take down lever

-Extended slide release.

-Glockmeister frame/grip plug

-Also has all original parts if you would like to switch things back.

THIS IS A PACKAGE DEAL ONLY. I WILL NOT SELL THE STREAMLIGHT SEPARATE SO PLEASE DO NOT ASK.

The only thing I may consider is keeping the Streamlight myself and selling everything else.

These Glock are very, very difficult to come by and they are no longer made or ever will make anymore. Gun broker has them going for $679.99+ tax stock with two mags

My price for everything is $900 or best over. That’s including the $130 Streetlight and 6 extra mags that are easily $35 a piece. You’re welcome to do the math.

Or $825 Or best offer without the Streamlight

This is really a AWESOME PISTOL !!! the size, high capacity and 45 ACP makes this the perfect personal defense / carry pistol. The fact that its so rare makes it a very collectable pistol. Those facts combined together means that the value of this pistol will do nothing but keep going up. 
It shoots amazing, the ported barrel and slide GREATLY REDUCES the muzzle flip and recoil (its basically like shooting a 38, 380 or 9MM). The size makes it very concealable for carry. Not that you buy a pistol because its look cool, but this one Does and always gets a lot of attention. 
It comes with  3 - 10 rounds Springfield mags that work perfectly and 2 Para 12 rounds mags, one works great the other one ""not so much"", a hard case, and cleaning brush. The  grips and grip screws where customized and looks great on the pistol. The pistol is not perfect, but its is very good condition. The 1911 V10s single stacks are few and far between, BUT this is a 1911 V10 ULTRA COMPACT - ""HIGH CAPACITY / DOUBLE STACK"" IN STAINLESS with a 3 1/2"" Barrel. They are so RARE very hard to find, at the time of this posting I can't find another one for sail anywhere. Looking for offers, but not lowball ones, call or text if your interested 517-488-488zero"

Probably of mid 19th century Belgian origin, but again it is unmarked.

Screwing the barrel back on kept everything in place. The hammer cocks and the trigger drops the hammer, everything works as it should. Engraved frame. There is some pitting on the barrel, frame, hammer, and down in the bore. The checkered wood grip shows some wear and has a nice patina. There is an inlaid shield on the back of the grip but it is worn smooth: it may have been some kind of logo at one time. Asking 300.00 or best offer, firearm related trades considered.

This is really a AWESOME PISTOL !!! the size, high capacity and 45 ACP makes this the perfect personal defense / carry pistol. The fact that its so rare makes it a very collectable pistol. Those facts combined together means that the value of this pistol will do nothing but keep going up. 
It shoots amazing, the ported barrel and slide GREATLY REDUCES the muzzle flip and recoil (its basically like shooting a 38, 380 or 9MM). The size makes it very concealable for carry. Not that you buy a pistol because its look cool, but this one Does and always gets a lot of attention. 
It comes with 3 - 10 rounds Springfield mags that work perfectly and 2 Para 12 rounds mags, one works great the other one ""not so much"", a hard case, and cleaning brush. The grips and grip screws where customized and looks great on the pistol. The pistol is not perfect, but its is very good condition. The 1911 V10s single stacks are few and far between, BUT this is a 1911 V10 ULTRA COMPACT - ""HIGH CAPACITY / DOUBLE STACK"" IN STAINLESS with a 3 1/2"" Barrel. They are so RARE very hard to find, at the time of this posting I can't find another one for sail anywhere. Looking for offers, but not lowball ones, call or text if your interested 517-599-262zero"

I have a third generation Glock 26 for sale. It is LNIB and comes with original everything.  Absolutely no holster wear and the barrel smile is just starting to form. Less than 300 rounds and Hoppes 9, Safariland CLP, and Froglube right after. There have been some upgrades made. They are as listed.

1. The trigger has been upgraded by Glock Center. It now has a 3.5# NIB-X coated Lone Wolf Distributors (LWD) and the appropriate springs. The break is about 3#. I will also have the original parts.

2. There has been a rail milled into the frame. This was done by Joseph Bush, an armorer/gunsmith and competitive shooter. It looks nearly factory and will not affect performance at all (for reference, you can remove the entire front after the trigger group without effecting performance short of allowing sand, dirt, and other gunk from entering.

3. It will come with a pink Mic holster, a nylon holster, a 33 round Glock Magazine (NIB), a 33 round KCI magazine, magazine spacer for Glock 17 mags (this closes the gap), Streamlight TLR-3, and ammo if necessary.

I am in no rush to sell this. I would like to trade for something. Sigs (not the SP2022 or P320 or P250 or any of the lower end models), 1911s, and other modified Glocks go to the front. Otherwise, anything gun related is a plus."

The SAM7K PISTOL
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol.

Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Most of the parts have German waffenamts on them, but like typical Yugo refurbs, the receiver ring has been scrubbed and re-stamped with the Yugo crest and armory Preduzece 44.

Wood and metal finish are in good shape. The bore on this rifle is very good. The chamber headspaces properly and I have fired the rifle with no issues. I have a repro leather sling I can also throw in for $20 extra.

Yugo captured K98s provide the best opportunity to get a German made K98 without having to pay the ever increasing prices they are demanding.

I would prefer to meet FTF around Raleigh or northeastern Wake County. Please let me know if you have any questions or offers. I am willing to entertain trade offers for other Mausers, Enfields, Springfield, Marlin 45/70 rifles or possibly other iron sighted hunting rifles."

I am a certified Sig Sauer armorer and all the parts that were replaced came directly from the factory. This is the perfect pistol for someone wanting something that is easily concealable, but not too small. The P6 is a ""duty version"" of the P225 and was modified slightly to be carried by the German police. To be more specific, the differences consist of: 1) The P6 having a slot in the hammer to that would show if the pistol had been dropped on the hammer and also keep any damage from occurring should it happen, and 2) The feed ramps on the barrel were slightly modified to improve feeding reliability. The barrel has been polished, as have the feed ramps, to give the shooter a smoother operation cycle. The rest of the parts have been cerakoted, which is extremely hard and enhances the durability of the firearm. 

Something cool about the pistol is that it does actually have triple 7's on the barrel, slide, and frame--which I thought was pretty cool personally. I am selling in order to help pay for a home renovation project...

I have a few items that I don't need anymore. I have some very well maintained and excellent uppers for your AR-15 that you can use to finish your build or replace certain parts. 

1. 10.5"" Pistol or SBR Upper
Mil-Spec, Carbine length gas tube, Chrome Lined YHM 1:7 Twist Complete Upper with Charging handle and BCG, as well as A2 birdcage flashider I used this on my old pistol 300 Rounds or so... that I never shot because I didn't have a real purpose for this. It's a great upper, very rigid, Quad rails, T-Markings, all that you would expect from YHM. PSA M-16 Full Auto Bolt will be included. ALL NFA RULES APPLY! I will not be responsible for any legal problems you will encounter if you do not obey the law. If you are going to use this upper as an SBR, you must have a tax stamp and go through a Class III SOT FFL in order to do your paperwork. If you are going to mount this on a pistol lower, it's going to shoot great. I am looking to get $550 for the complete upper only. There is a Redfield CounterStrike 1x30mm Red Dot mounted on this upper as well as a Magpul AFG. If you want those items, I will sell the complete upper for $750. 

#2 I have another complete upper that I have not used in a long time. This upper is extremely lightweight and has been duracoated. The barrel is a PSA 1:7 Twist 16"" barrel with a 2 3/4"" muzzle break on it. Again probably another upper that has 3 to 4 hundred round down the pipe and has properly been broken in. Has a Seekins free float KeyMod 2 rail system which is extremely durable and tough. If you want the paint off of the upper, I will give you paint thinner to take it off and it will be extremely easy. Comes with a PSA charging handle and a PSA AR-15 parkerized/adonized AR-15 BCG. This upper is ready for sights or an optic, whichever you chose. $325. 

#3 
Bushnell AR-Optics 4.5-18x40mm with CCOP Mount. Exceptional glass for the price, I purchased two of these and I am selling one of them. Drop Zone BDC Reticle, Target Turrets, Parallax Focus, and the color is Matte black just like the mount. $130 for the Optic and the mount, complete with box. Part No is: AR945184 just in case you want to look it up. Optic is in superb condition. 

#4 I have 2000 Rounds of PMC Bronze 9mm Ammo in boxes of 50. I will throw in a few .30 Caliber cases for the ammo, I have maybe around 5-6? This ammo is all factory new, never has seen light and has always been in a dehumidified area. $700 takes 2 cases of PMC Bronze 9mm ammo.

I only fired 120 rounds through the gun total before I realized the AK platform just isn't for me, otherwise I would be keeping this gun.

I will include two magazines, the cleaning kit, a hard case, and a few other minor accessories with the rifle.

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.
