The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.

The two-tone version of this excellent carry firearm is no longer made and harder to find. This firearm is in like-new condition. These sell for $799+ but I'm offering it for $699 OBO because I need the cash for my wedding.

The ammo in the picture is sold separately.
From the HK website:

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.
Features & System Characteristics:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes

Up for trade is a very nice colt 1991A1. I got this in trade from the orginal owner. It's in very good shape an comes as you see it pictured. The mags are 1 colt and 2 cmc mags, and 59 rounds of ball ammo. This finish is tough to photograph but you won't be disappointed. I would say the finish is %95 consecutively. Very little wear. 

As far as trades I am open but below are a few specifics. 

Ak-47 or ak-74 must be a good quality gun. A wasr is fine but I'll need cash with it. 

H&k VP9 depending on what yours comes with I'll likely need some cash.

S&W 357 or 44 mag revolvers (no rugers unless it's a clean security six, service six) 

M&p shield 9mm plus cash. 

Glock 34

I'll consider othe but no hunting rifles, shotguns, Taurus, Rossi, etc. nothing wrong with them just not what I am interested in."

For those of you who are familiar with this rifle, you know what you are looking at. This particular rifle is used with exactly 260 rounds fired through it, all PMC Bronze 147grs FMJ.

The rifle is in excellent condition, the only negatives are a few marks on the upper receiver from a LaRue QD mount rubbing the finish on the pic rail. Currently the rifle has a Surefire open-end three prong flash hider mounted to the factory barrel. The original PWS factory break with castle nut is included. You will receive the original box, gun lock, and manual as well as four 20 round magazines. Three of the magazines are FDE and one is black. 

The lighting is a little off in the photographs but I can assure you this 17S is a nice FDE, it is not any shade of green as some rifles from FN tend to be. I will be more than happy to send any additional pictures or information at the request of serious inquiries. Price is firm and travel, within reason, is not a problem. Face to face deals only."

Other Features:	Beretta USA is well known for designing and manufacturing some of the most durable and reliable firearms for law enforcement, military, hunting, personal defense, and concealed carry. Beretta has a history steeped in tradition with their Competition Shotguns like the Beretta 692 and DT11, and Field Shotguns like their Beretta 686 and SV10. They also offer modern day firearms like their innovative and exciting Cx4 Storm Rifle, ARX Series Rifles, and their famous Beretta M92/96, and Nano. Beretta USA has something to offer every shooter on the planet regardless of skill level or venue. After all, everyone should own at least 1 Beretta in their collection. Finally, a training training in .22 caliber that looks, feels and shoots like Beretta's heralded ARX160 military assault rifle. Just like the military version, the ARX160 .22 LR is lightweight, user friendly, and an ergonomic masterpiece. This is a rifle full of cool features that will be a thrill to put its paces at the range. Beyond its striking physical and working similarities to the combat version, it also shares its ambidextrous advantages. The two-position safety, magazine release, and cocking handle can all be set to the right or left hand preference. Picatinny rails allow the user to build on anything they can dream, the rifle can be dissembled for cleaning easily without tools, allowing access to clean the barrel from the back round. There is also easy access to the bolt and trigger system, just like with a .223 Rem rifle. Constructed of reinforced polymer with flip up sights, the ARX160 .22 LR gives shooters the experience of shooting the world's preeminent military rifle at a price they can afford.

***EAA states so I will pass along: ""Kits sold as-is and 'with all faults' and these parts should only be installed by a qualified professional gunsmith.""*** 
These can be changed out in about 20 seconds. The most important thing to remember is to install the correct magazine to the barrel you intend to use.

Sink and shower with freshwater tank. AM/FM/CD stereo, interior accent lights, deck lights, two forward swivel seats, power trim. Includes canopy (with boot), anchor (and rope) and full boat cover. Life jackets and flotation throw also included. Dual axle trailer with new radial tires (as of 2013) and two spare. Electric winch (still have manual to include). I purchased this fall of 2013 for family fishing, used a total of eight days. Due to later family circumstances its intended use has fairly ended. Now, it is simply too big for only one physically able person to realistically use around here. It is rated at 11 people and believe me, you still won't be crowded. If you’ve never experienced a deck boat, imagine the room and stability of a pontoon on a hull that allows for speed and performance of a regular boat. At calm surface up to 1 foot waves, I have had this topped out at 32 mph. Remains very stable up to 2 foot waves (I know). Try that with a pontoon and a nasty T-storm headed your way!  Runs great and engine has been winterized.

Currently it is at Angler's Outpost and Marine just outside Danville/Lancaster at the corner of Hwys 34 and 27. This was the easiest way for interested people to see it.

Based on NADA, in excellent condition with options it is $28,735. While not showroom new, it has no major defects or problems. Parted out, it's worth more than I'm asking (just the engine is close to 8k) Folks, I may have lowered the price due to needs, that means that we can dawdle on price, it doesn't mean I give it away. Don't insult me or yourself by trying to low ball to a ridiculous offer.

BTW – I have pulled this to Florida twice with a Honda Pilot 6 cylinder with no problems but this is NOT for a baby truck with a 4 cyl. A six cylinder would be the minimum sized engine to pull this. It is a SOLID boat!

You will NOT find another boat like this in Kentucky or anywhere else for the price."

Has some cosmetic wear but in excellent mechanical condition, hasn't been fired much.  Will come with two 13 round magazines.

Fun gun to shoot but I picked up another compact handgun so I don't use it much.

I'd like to trade for a pocket gun of some kind, primarily interested in a snub nose 38 revolver of some kind, primarily a S&W J frame or maybe Lcr. Would also like a S&W Bodyguard or LC9s.  No Kel Tecs or Taurus please.
