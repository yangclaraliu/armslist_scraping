Heres the description from the manufacturer:

AR500 Armor® Level III Body Armor is manufactured from an extremely rugged ballistic grade steel core and coated with our PAXCON (a division of Line-X) spall and fragmentation protective coating. Our ballistic steel plate is unmatched in the industry and is formulated and treated specifically to our specifications for improved consistency, durability, and then tested to NIJ standards. Our ballistic core is stress fracture resistant, features an ultra-low profile ballistic core of only 0.26”, and is designed to handle extreme abuse in day to day use, training, and less than ideal storage conditions. AR500 Armor® body armor will outlast alternative armor solutions such as Ceramic, Dyneema, UHMWPE, and raw/uncoated steel trauma plates.
Level III Rating: AR500 Armor® body armor is Stand-Alone and Multi-Hit capable. Designed to defeat rifle threats up to 7.62x51 M80 NATO Ball (.308 Winchester) at velocities up to 2,780 feet per second and all pistol calibers.
Our 10” x 12” Advanced Shooters Cut (ASC) armor plates fit nearly all industry standard plate carriers and all plate carriers capable of accepting Medium and Large SAPI body armor plates. Our 10” x 12” ASC body armor offers adequate coverage of your vitals which include your heart, lungs, and surrounding blood vessels on most people. 10” x 12” is the most common size and fits the widest selection of plate carriers available on the market.
Featuring and ergonomic form, our curved 10"" x 12"" plate further improves ergonomics over standard flat body armor plates. The curve contours to your body and is recommended if you wear your body armor on a regular basis, or for duty use. A specific radius has been chosen for maximum comfort as a front or back plate for operators of varying height and weight; our curved 10"" x 12"" body armor can be used in either position in your plate carrier. To achieve the best ergonomics possible we recommend a curved front and back plate.

You want to know how trustworthy and reliable this scope is? 
From the Precision Rifle Blog website:
Of the top 50 shooters, Bushnell XRS and ERS scopes are in THE TOP 1/3 of popularity. 

If you add up all the shooters using...
- US Optics, 
- Premier,
- Nightforce,
- Kahles,
- Leupold, and
- Steiner,
...you just matched the number of shooters using BUSHNELL! 

In fact, FOUR of the top TEN shooters used BUSHNELL! Even more than both Vortex and Schmidt and Bender!

And 41% used ""Christmas tree"" style hold-off reticles similar to the trmr2.
--------------------------------------------------------
From Bushnell:
Precision delivery from the tightest quarters to the longest ranges, with a streamlined optical platform measuring only 13.2"" long. Crafted with a rock-solid, hammer-forged 34mm tube, locking turrets and zero stop.

The Ultimate Force Magnifiers

Make a high-performance tactical decision. We’re putting the most powerful optics in the world into the hands of those sworn to defend it. Elite Tactical. Designed alongside military and law enforcement experts, the optical superiority and unfailing reliability of this family has been further honed with a host of application-specific features. Like tactical turrets for precise, positive adjustments, blacked out finish for optimum concealment and sophisticated reticles for CQB and long range shooting.

Led by the versatile powerhouse 3.5-21x 50mm, and including our 8-40x 60mm spotting scope, these mission-driven designs are adapted to perform from the tightest quarters to the most extreme ranges. All for one purpose: So you can do what you do. To the warriors who selflessly protect our lives, you can always trust Bushnell. 

--------------------------------------------------------

I believe this Tremor2 reticle was designed with input from Todd Hodnett (Accuracy 1st) to incorporate holdover and wind holds. (If I remember right, he uses Bushnell scopes (and others) in the Art of the Precision Rifle, but this is Bushy's upper crust line. Above HDMR, XRS, and DMR, at DMR Price!) And to boot... it has phenomenally clear glass, a 6x magnification spread, sunshade, FDE color, and a lifetime warranty.

From website:
As one of the top riflescope innovators in the world, Bushnell has worked diligently with law enforcement and military experts nationwide to design, test and prove the finest family of tactical shooting instruments in the industry.

Each model in the Elite Tactical line uses the basic precepts of every riflescope built by Bushnell - unfailing reliability and optical precision - and takes them a step further with application-specific features, such as tactical turrets for rapid adjustment, blacked-out finish for optimum concealment and new reticles for CQB or long range shooting.
Bushnell has also equipped these scopes with Ultra Wide Band Coating to boost brightness at dusk and dawn, plus argon purging for absolute reliability whatever the conditions.

""The Z650 was considered the 'Son of Z1' having been designed by the Grand Master himself, Ben 'Mr Z1' Inamura. The Z650 had the agility of a 500 with the performance of a 750, and was considered by many to be the best Kawasaki so far.""

It's a very easy bike to ride, and if you're new to motorcycles it's a great one to start with. Seasoned riders will enjoy the power, handling and inexpensive maintenance! If you're into the bobber or café racer thing you're not going to find a better bike to start with. 

Let me know if you'd like to see it. Interested in trades (no other bikes (maybe a sport bike), projects or basket cases, though). Please check with your wife/ girlfriend/ boyfriend/ mommy/ etc. before replying to this ad. Let's not waste our time...

I have had this for a couple months now. It works great for hunting especially for spotting hogs and coyotes!!! Best tool I've had only second to my bow and rifle and the IR laser can be seen by your buddies if they have NVGs. This version does have the reticle for a weapon optic. I hate to part with it but I am not able to hunt due to work so I no longer have the use for it for now. Below is a description with all the specs on this unit. Shipping price includes insurance for $5,000 in case of shipping mishap.

Davidson's Lifetime Guarantee warranty. 
The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."

The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns — yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun.
The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more.
One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces."

I took the rear sight off and turned down the dove tails to make it more streamline. I added a Barska 6.5-20x50 scope to the rifle too. With tactical type scope rings. Added a rail under the rifle and bipod. I dura coated the rifle as well and the scope to give it more of a tactical look. I have 3 boxes of shells for it and 1 5 round magazine and 2 10 round magazines. This rifle is awesome to look at and even more fun to shoot. It turns heads at the range.

Stronger than most metals, polymer is temperature neutral, requires less maintenance, and most users report substantially less felt recoil than with metal frames.

“Safe Action”® System
The GLOCK “Safe Action”® System is made up of 3 independent, automatic safeties designed to ensure the pistol cannot fire unintentionally due to inertia or any impact. The trigger must be moved completely to the rear to deactivate these safeties. Once released, all 3 safety features reengage and the pistol is automatically secured again.

Barrel Design
GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

Nitrite Treatment
All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

Magazine
Often overlooked, the magazine is one of the most critical components of a pistol. The GLOCK precision-made, stagger-column, high-capacity device is designed to reliably feed all ammunition types.

For sale, .357 Mag from Smith & Wesson's Performance Center. This is their 8 shot tactical revolver. This is the model with the fixed rail. As typical with Performance Center's pieces, the design, workmanship, fit and finish and stellar. I have owned both the fixed and removable rail version, and liked this one better, but I have to sell. Scandium alloy, with stainless internals, trigger and hammer. I've owned in 8 months and purchased this new. Fired approx 70 rounds of only qualify ammo, and is in perfect working order. This has been well cared for and maintained, and used lightly at the range occasionally. There is a small scratch near the end of the muzzle that you can see in the picture, but other than that blemish, the weapon is flawless. It did not come with the metal case I have seen that come with earlier purchases, but I do have the receipt for purchase, and original case and lock. The R8 is light for its size, feels awesome in the hand, deadly accurate, fun to shoot, kind of unique, and comes with the stuff listed below.

I have owned this 5.11 Rush 72 Multicam backpack for less than a year and it is in excellent condition. The backpack is great for camping, hiking, adventure travel, but I have two and this one is not really necessary for me to keep.

I have used the pack twice, both times as an aircraft carry-on for my most recent deployment. Other than the maybe 4 hours in total I have carried it in my hand at any given point in time while traveling, it has been stored in an equipment locker either here in Fayetteville, or overseas.

The pack is in pristine condition, and really the only difference with this pack to a new pack is that it doesn't have the original product tags on it (and it has traveled to Afghanistan and back). I also had a name tape sewn onto it, which will be removed prior to the buyer taking possession.

Check out the specs for this pack here: http://www.511tactical.com/rush-72-backpack.html

All zippers are working, all enclosures are in perfect condition, all clips work and are in perfect order, all fast ties are in original condition, the back support padding is not worn (because it has never been worn) and all three original drainage grommets (2 on the bottom of the pack, and 1 between the lower back support pads) are in place.

Email me a very detailed description of your firearm or if you have more than one email a list with a detailed description and pricing or an idea of how much you need to get out of your trade or trades. Please do not be afraid to tell me about your trade and all you have with it, remember I only know what you tell me. Include a price and photos if possible.

The Glock 23 and its larger sibling, the Glock 22, are by far the most popular pistols with today’s local state and federal law enforcement agencies. The compact G23 version generally sees the majority of service as a plainclothes or undercover pistol, while the G22 is a uniform duty gun.

Quite naturally, the Glock 23 Gen4 version shares many attributes and features of the original model. The pistol uses Glock’s “Safe-Action” striker-fired system with three safety mechanisms. A 64 HRC dark coating is applied to the steel slide and the frame is constructed of high-strength polymer.

Great bore and crown, very accurate given its age and low cost of shooting. I'm not the best shooter, but at 100 yards I was able to get groupings of under 2 inches using Russian Surplus 147gr steel core ammunition and the stock trigger (~6-8 lbs of pull). With a Timney trigger ($100 and 3lbs break), you can definitely achieve sub-MOA accuracy. Customize it further with a new barrel (~$200-300 depending on length and material) and shoot match grade ammunition, and the possibilities will be endless. The biggest appeal for me with this rifle is its high power, low maintenance requirements, availability of parts, and it will practically pay itself off with its easily available and low cost ammunition ($0.18 a round instead of $1+ for .308/7.62x51)

Gun is a rock solid reliable shooter, it is not in pristine safe queen condition but is one of those guns that will be your best friend in a bad situation.ill just start by listing what is on it and what comes with it. 

Remington 870 express 20"" barrel I believe I need to measure it though it could be an 18.5"".

2 Mesa technologies side saddle shell carriers  one on the buttstock one mounted on receiver (run like 70 dollars each)

Choate pistol grip stock

Scattergun technology +2 magazine tube extension with left side 2 point sling attachment

High performance spring and high visibility 
green follower for scattergun mag extension. 
Really nice Single point harness and attachment to bottom of pistol grip.

Nice spiker door breacher/crowd control attachment on mag extension (have to double check the brand but high quality)

Ported heat shield on barrel

Large tactical gear bag (once again can't remember brand atm but it's high quality and they run around 80 some dollars) new ruger padlock with 2 keys included.

Ammo bandoleer with buckle loaded with multiple types and sizes of 12g loads

2 boxes of federal target shells

About 20 or so specialty shells (2 inch mini bucks and pumpkinhead loads a slug with 5 38 cal balls behind it in multiple sizes, gun will hold 8 or 9 2 inch shells  if you include one in the pipe along w the magazine tube loadout) I'd have to double check exactly how many 2 3/4"" shells or 3"" shells it would hold. Also have a few more assorted shells included.

High visibility bright green tritium coated (I think) brass bead sight but about half the green coating has worn off.

May have oversized aftermarket safety as well not postive on that one though.

That is all I can think of on it at the moment I may have forgotten a part or two though. I would rate gun in nra good condition,  it has a good amount of wear and is a shooter like I said. I would like to trade it for a nice AK47/74. Preferably chinese built postban or another foreign type AK. Will also consider nice quality AK pistols. Feel free to offer other guns as well I would love a used ptr91 or other good quality h&k g3 clone as well. This is a really nice well built shotguns. It probably won't win a beauty contest but will win a HD shootout lol. Not desperate for money or a trade as I really like this shotgun but would definitely be open to the right one. Would rather trade than sell. Thanks and God bless."

For sale is a Glock 19 9MM handgun. I purchased this Glock in 2011 for my fiancé but she thought it was too heavy and big. I then used it for the first time in the spring of 2013 for a handgun carry permit class and shot around 40 rounds through it. It was cleaned that day and properly maintained since then. I clean it every year with the intentions of shooting, but I never get around to it. Long story short, it has only been shot 40 times in the past 5 years, so it's basically brand new. 

Heres a list of what I'm selling as a bundle

Glock 19 with Original Paperwork and Hard Case
Bagmaster Travel Case
3 Magazines (Original)
410 rounds of 9mm ammo. (Federal)
20 Rounds of Federal Premium Personal Defense ammo.
Extra grips for preference
Travel Lock with both keys

I am asking $700 obo. I know these guns are ~550.00 new and I'm adding over $200.00 worth of ammo as well. I have sold guns on this site before and am very professional. I will bring a bill of sale for the transaction, all you will need is your drivers license/form of identification. If interested, please don't hesitate to reply. 

Will consider trade for revolvers
