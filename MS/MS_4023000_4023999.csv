***Manufacture description- The Anderson AM15M416 rifle, in addition to the rigid quality controls of manufacturing, the feature that sets the Anderson AM15 Rifles apart from the masses is the proprietary RF85 treatment allowing Anderson weapon systems to operate efficiently without 'Wet' lubricant.

Also featuring Forged 7075-T6 aluminum receiver, optic ready front sights, Magpul 6 position stock, Magpul MOE grip, and free float Modular 8"" forearm.

**ADDITIONAL BARREL & UPPER INFORMATION FROM PALMETTO STATE ARMORY'S WEBSITE:
Barrel:  Made for Palmetto State Armory by FN Manufacturing using their proprietary blend of hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feedramps, and a carbine gas system.   The barrel has an A2 style profile, is mil-spec phosphate coated, and MP/HP tested.  The upper is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, and an A2 flash hider.  

Upper:  Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.
Each upper is assembled to order with care, and test fired.

would like to know any color perspective customers may want. Prices are set low to get the name rolling, so get it while it's at a discount. Parital price list 

partial prices listed HERE! 
 a upper or lower pistol of normal size would be $45 each on normal colors -$5 if doing a pair total. (complete pistol)
Turn around on special colors would be about 2 weeks since it takes extra time to receive the colors and would charge a extra $10 per specific special color order (separate shipping charge).
 example: complete pistol, upper and frame. $85. pistol upper or frame $45 each.  

Most pricing will be a  specific case by case, at the moment only going to offer coating on (mostly) fully dissembled parts, $25 minium charge for detail stripping. obviously start up will be expensive until I can acquire some colors in stock. pistol slide/frame/ar lower will be at $45 each, rifle legnths/barrel/uppers will be $100 for single colors. +$35 for a second color, around $25 for parts/accessories sets. No camo or multi color schemes offered yet, will need to perfect that on my own or friends sponsored

It has Arsenal/KVAR OD Green furniture, 2 x 30 round mags, and a bolt buffer installed.  I currently have the Arsenal 2-stage trigger installed, but it would not be difficult to swap it for the standard G2.  This rifle does have the standard optics rail, but the barrel is not threaded.  Barrel threading can be achieved somewhat easily with a few parts from CNC Warrior.  All Russian arms have been banned from import into the US through the US sanctions on Russia over the trouble they're causing in Ukraine.

It had an Ace folding stock installed, but I am keeping that for another project.  It is in the photo purely for illustrative purposes.  It Is Not Included.  I'm hoping to sell the rifle as it is, and just let the new owner choose/install the type of stock they prefer.  I can install the receiver adapter for an Ace stock or an AR type stock, but then I'd have to bump the price up.

I have a stash of 7n6 ammo, and will offer the buyer an opportunity to buy up to 1080 rounds at $0.175/round.  It is also banned from import."

If you are not familiar with Benelli handguns, this model is an olympic competition format handgun, is comparable in quality and accuracy to the legendary S&W 17 as well as Pardini's and others of the class. Adjustable trigger, forward mounted magazine and excellent weighting. It is a beautiful firearm that can be used at the range, for competition or plinking. It is remarkably accurate and has an excellent trigger. It is also an excellent tool to improve your shooting skills and do so very inexpensively.
I have put 250 rounds through it over the years as it is my 'backup' model. I have another one that I use more frequently.
This is classified as an Olympic/competitive firearm here in CA by the DOJ and thus is exempt from restrictions of the CA DOJ list.
Two magazines and the original case included.
Also included in the sale price is a scope mount from Larry's Guns. Larry's is currently the sole importer of MP95's (as well as MP90's and other high-end competition .22LR's). Good folks and they stock any replacement parts that you might ever need. The only mod I've made to the gun is to replace the original recoil buffer pad with a more modern one as well as to add the (removable) scope mount. Though there is a very short rail for mounting an optic on the MP95, the scope mount provides a solid and long Picatinny rail for mounting most any pistol optic. Both gun and scope adapter are in perfect as-new condition.

For your consideration is a Springfield XD-9 with four magazines. One 16-round magazine and three 10-round magazines. This pistol also comes with a Lasermax guide rod laser that needs a bit of tuning up and a new battery. It is a $250 laser, but since it needs the tune up and battery, I will throw it in for free.

I am the second owner of it, and the original owner is my friend. I just don't want it anymore, as I found it as a redundant addition to my polymer 9mm collection.

A complete takedown and cleaning has been done as of yesterday (yes, even the notoriously-hard-to-reassemble mag release, which led to lots of sailor language).

Fixed white-dot sights.

FTF ONLY with an impromptu BOS will be required. CHL holders will be given top priority. Must be an Oregon resident of legal age. Pistol is functional and sold as is. I am not responsible if you decide to do something stupid with it. Lowballers will be ignored. Meth-heads will also be ignored. If you look meth-y or shady in any way when we meet FTF, you will be--again--ignored. Etc., etc., ad nauseum.

The Most Concealable .380 for Personal Defense and Home Protection

At only 18mm wide, the Pico is the thinnest .380 semiauto handgun on the market, making it a best in class for concealed carry and home defense.

Comfortable to Conceal and Carry

Weighing only 11.5oz unloaded, this double-action-only (DAO) pistol is comfortable and unobtrusive to carry, no matter your preferred mode. The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts.

 Soft-recoiling and Absolutely ReliableSoft-recoiling

The Pico is soft-recoiling and makes target recovery lightning-quick after every shot, thanks to its minimal barrel tilt. This feature also makes feeding utterly reliable, even with more open hollowpoint designs or the hotter .380 commercial loads. This means that when you need it for concealed carry or home protection, the Pico will always deliver the performance you expect of a Beretta.

Easy to Disassemble and Customize, Loaded with Features, Made in USA

Like its slightly bigger brother the Nano, the Pico is engineered to be easy and intuitive to take apart and reassemble. Its heart is a serialized modular chassis, meaning that the frame can be easily swapped to accommodate the user's preferences. Shipped with a storage case and two 6+1 stainless steel magazines (one flush, one with grip extension), the Pico features adjustable, quick-change sights with no gunsmithing required. It also offers ambidextrous magazine release, as well as a super-low-profile slide-release lever to keep the slide open when desired. The Pico is made in USA and brings all the reliability and quality of Beretta as the leader of a new generation of concealed-carry firearms.

 The Millennium action is striker-fired 
 and operates in double-action-only (DAO) mode,
 meaning that it fires only by a consistent
 and repeatable long pull on the trigger. 
 And, much to my applause, 
 the Millennium action requires no pre-loading
 of the firing mechanism. In other words, 
 the Millennium pistol does not require any 
 rearward movement of the slide to pre-set 
 the striker springs or sear. Thus the PT145
 has repeat-strike capability, allowing a second trigger pull
 against any misfire without having to manually 
 cycle the slide to reset the trigger action."

The AR-50A1 National Match is similar to our standard AR-50A1 with some VERY important differences. The AR-50A1 NM is produced from selected components: The National Match’s 33 inch barrel is three inches longer than the standard AR-50A1’s barrel. The barrel has eight flutes. The flutes help with cooling and reduce unnecessary weight while maintaining accuracy-enhancing stiffness. The barrel has a 50 BMG chamber. ArmaLite has also developed a “Skid System” for the AR-50A1 National Match. It’s meant for serious match use and comes standard, NOT as an expensive add-on. The ArmaLite Skid System provides parallel rests on the rifle that are parallel with the bore of the rifle so when it recoils it will recoil straight back. This has been requested by match shooters, some of whom have made their own. The front skid attaches to the slot in the forestock similar to the way bipod rails are attached. The rear skid attaches to the buttstock. Armalite developed the Skid System without modification to the AR-50A1’s original parts so the system can be used by shooters who already own an AR-50A1 and want to use their original stock with NO MODIFICATIONS. The heart of the rifle is its metallic stock-to-action interface. The patented V-Lock™ Bedding Wedge and V-Block Stock assure absolute strength and repeatability for superb accuracy. The aluminum stock reinforces the receiver like a bench-rest sleeve. It’s not just the bedding that improves accuracy. Independent testing has proven the AR-50A1 muzzle brake to be the best in the industry for both recoil control and accuracy. It scrapes away turbulent muzzle gasses and lets the bullet break into clean air for amazing accuracy.

Creating a hard-use tactical rifle by combining the principles of modularity, simplicity, and reliability was what Beretta set out to accomplish. Beretta made short work of this concept and thus, the ARX100 was born. Fully ambidextrous controls, replaceable barrels, and countless accessories, make the ARX100 a perfect fit for multi-mission roles. Now you can earn a piece of innovation without breaking your wallet. The Beretta ARX160 in.22 L.R. is a faithful replica of the battle tested ARX160 serving with the Italian Military. The weight, balance, look, feel and most of the controls’ placement and operation are just like the 5.56mmx45 NATO rifle. It is the perfect platform for training purposes and also makes a fun, reliable target rifle.

The North Carolina Concealed Carry Handgun Permit course is coupled with the NRA Basic Pistol Course and is designed for law abiding citizens, who wishes or needs to carry a concealed handgun for their personal, business or family’s safety.

This handgun course teaches the basic knowledge, skills, and attitude for owning and operating a pistol safely.  This is a 9 hour course which includes both classroom instruction and range time.  Approximately 35% of the course is hands on instruction. Instruction methods include Lecture, PowerPoint, and DVD’s, “hands-on” and live pertinent discussion. Both experienced and inexperienced shooters will benefit from this course.

Info on SBE 2 from Benelli:

A favorite among Benelli shotguns, the Benelli Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.

The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech® system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The ComforTech® system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever."

908,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4023908,For Sale/Trade:  Barnett Raptor FX crossbow,"South Lyon / Dearborn, Michigan, United States",$ 350,"Listed On: Thursday, February 12, 2015",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Bought this to bow hunt last year since I couldn't pull my compound.  I'm now able to pull my compound again, so this has to go.

this crossbow does NOT have the crank style cocking device that most people give it poor reviews for.  This crossbow just has a rope and you can very quickly and easily manually cock the crossbow.

This is one of Barnett's newest model, it is very compact and light compared to most crossbows. The compact frame fits me well, but I would imagine that if you are over 5'10"" or so, you will find the frame too small. It is also much quieter than most.  Shoots 330 FPS, easy to cock, with some practice you can hold 3"" at 45 yards.  It really falls off the table at 40 yards though.  Currently sighted in at 20/25/30/35 yards.  You can hold an inch at 25 yards.  I've ruined plenty of bolts in target practice by hitting the first bolt with the second.

Took a buck at 20 yards and coyote at 28 yards with it this year.  Bolt passed 100% through on both cases.  Comes with 4 or 6 bolts, not sure on exact count.  No broadheads included.

Manufacturer is Taurus Held Amadeo Rossi S.A. of Sao Leopoldo, Brazil. Importer and warrantor is Braztech of Miami. Its only departure from the classic 1892 design is a hammer block safety, mounted unobtrusively on top of the bolt just forward of the hammer. The 92 does not have a lever safety like its later 1894 descendants did. Metal is entirely blue steel. Barrel is 16 inch, 1:30 right hand six groove, chambered in .38 Smith & Wesson Special and .357 Remington Magnum calibers interchangeably. Magazine tube is full length, capacity is 8+1 rounds of .357 Magnum or .38 Special. Sights are dovetailed brass tipped blade front with step elevator adjustable buckhorn type rear, drift adjustable only for windage. Trigger is .275 smooth faced steel, with a .350 serrated curved spur hammer. Photo specimen pulled at 4 5/8 pounds, with minimal to moderate felt creep. Forend and buttstock are walnut stained Brazilian hardwood. Buttplate is blue steel as well. Length of pull is 12 5/8 inches from the trigger face to the center of the butt plate. Weight empty is only 6 pounds, with center of gravity at the front of the loading gate; and overall length is a compact 34 3/8 inches.

Here are some facts about this awesome little pistol:

Super thin, ultra conceable, and easy to configure, the Beretta Pico sets a new standard for the micro compact carry pistol. The Pico is the thinnest .380 auto made by a millimeter. The Pico's snag-free slide and frame is a true 18 mm at the widest point. The grip frame, sights, and caliber are all simple to modify. (It can go from a .380 to a .32ACP by changing the barrel.) Extremely soft shooting with a double action trigger, the Pico is easy to control with its smooth, tip-to-parallel, straight line action. The removable, serialized sub-chassis and modular frame feature simple disassembly for easy cleaning and customizing. The dovetail quick-change sights can be adjusted or replaced by the user. Light, durable, and easy to draw from concealment, the Pico brings all the reliability and quality of a Beretta to bear on its standing as the leader of a new generation of concealed carry firearms.

 the Millennium pistol does not require any 
 rearward movement of the slide to pre-set
