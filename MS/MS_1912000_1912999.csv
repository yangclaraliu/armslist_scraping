I bought this pistol used last year. She's no safe queen but shoots accurately and reliably. I hate to get rid of it but I'm thinning out the stuff I don't shoot often. I have highlighted the most notable blemishes in the photos. The serial number marks this as a gun built in 1984. It really looks pretty good for a 30-year-old gun that's probably seen a lot of use. Please see the photos. It's got a surprisingly nice trigger for having factory parts. The barrel/receiver to grip frame fit is nice and tight.

Included:
- Pistol as photographed
- One 10-round Ruger factory magazine as photographed
- Leather holster in the photos

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer

A 16.1-inch barrel with the M4 government profile is used. Rifling is 1:7-inch versus the 1:9-inch twist found in most AR variants on the market. Out front is a fixed gas compensator, which vents gas at a rearward angle to the left and right. 

The stock on this particular carbine is an M4-style, fixed version. It looks like a retractable stock, but it is non-adjustable. There are two mounting points on the stock for a sling; the slot below the buffer tube and the more traditional sling loop found at the toe. A standard AR pistol grip is used. 

Colt took the time to install a quality trigger group. It is not a fragile, half-pound trigger, but a solid, well-built unit that breaks cleanly without creep or stacking. 

The carbine is well-built, has a solid trigger and is reliable, as you would expect from a Colt. The Colt Match Target M4 Carbine is a great rifle, and one that I highly recommend.

This is some of the finest work ever done by master engraver Joe Fuggar, who worked in house for G&H in the 1950s and apprenticed with noted engraver Rudolph Kornbrath. The action and barrel have been embellished with beautifully executed, deep relief acanthus scroll around the ejection port, firing chamber, front sight base, on the front sling swivel band and on the scope mount bases. This scroll continues to the grip cap, butt plate, trigger guard and around the floor plate. The center of the floor plate is deep relief engraved with a pair of grizzly bears on the left, the gold inlaid initials ""WSH"" in the center and a bull & cow moose on the right. The center of the grip cap shows a pair of big horn sheep.  

The classic style stock is finely marbeled, dark colored European walnut with a superb oil finish. A pistol grip, a shadowline cheekpiece and a horn forend tip are some of the features. The grip surfaces are covered with multipoint checkering with mullered borders and the toeline has an inset gold oval with the initials ""JEP"".

This is some of the finest work ever done by master engraver Joe Fuggar, who worked in house for G&H in the 1950s and apprenticed with noted engraver Rudolph Kornbrath. The action and barrel have been embellished with beautifully executed, deep relief acanthus scroll around the ejection port, firing chamber, front sight base, on the front sling swivel band and on the scope mount bases. This scroll continues to the grip cap, butt plate, trigger guard and around the floor plate. The center of the floor plate is deep relief engraved with a pair of grizzly bears on the left, the gold inlaid initials ""WSH"" in the center and a bull & cow moose on the right. The center of the grip cap shows a pair of big horn sheep.  

The classic style stock is finely marbeled, dark colored European walnut with a superb oil finish. A pistol grip, a shadowline cheekpiece and a horn forend tip are some of the features. The grip surfaces are covered with multipoint checkering with mullered borders and the toeline has an inset gold oval with the initials ""JEP"". This gun comes with a Redfield 4X 'Bear Cub' scope with post & crosshair reticle and G&H aluminum mounts.

The bore is flawless, action is crisp, barrel and stock condition is excellent and the optics are crystal clear."

I have decided to pick up one or two ""plinkers"" for having around the house and taking to the range. I am looking for either another 9mm or 22 lr or another small caliber. I could do a pistol or rifle. But would prefer pistol. I am looking for pretty cheap as I am getting it as an second gun of that caliber. Also, I do have some 9mm ammo and 22 ammo I could be able to trade for the right one if you need it. I do check around on prices a lot so please don't shoot a inflated price to me, this is not a ""needed"" gun, so if the price is inflated harshly or overpriced I will just ignore it.Shoot any offers to REDACTED and we can see if we can make a deal. Also, if you are looking to get 200+ for what you have then you are wasting your time contacting me I don't mean to come off crass but the last time I posted about wanting a certain price range people with double the price were contacting me.

My AR has the following, and I have two different offers for the Colt LE901.

The AR has around 400 rounds through it of M885 and had a proper barrel brake in with frog lube and solvent per CEO's recommendation. The upper has blue paint marker on it, can be taken off real easy with a drop of paint thinner or acetone.  The rifle has been a tack driver for me, but would rather have a LE901.


First option:

KAC Lower with the following changes:
-Swapped out KAC trigger with a Giessele SSA (IMO its smoother)
-Swapped LMT SOPMOD for a B5 SOPMOD because I got the lower used and original owner kept the LMT...
-Ergo rubber pistol grip with storage cover
-Rest of KAC lower is un molested

LMT Upper 14.5"" with pinned Surefire flash hider (new gen flash hider) and FSP
-KAC M4 RAS
-Matech Rear sight
-DD F/A BCG
-Vltor Charging handle

SECOND OPTION 

Generic Aluminum lower, have to go through what I have and see, maybe LMT, LAR grizz, etc...  No crappy polymer or off brands
-Geissele SSA
-B5 SOPMOD or STR (tan)
-ASAP plate or regular
-BAD lever
-A2 pistol

LMT Upper 14.5"" with pinned Surefire flash hider (new gen flash hider) and FSP
-KAC M4 RAS
-Matech Rear sight
-DD F/A BCG
-Vltor Charging handle

Optic:
-ACOG TA31 (red donut) in larue mount (dont have a larue wrench, lost it) Acog has been used for awhile, but tritium and glass are excellent, and in good working condition.  Mount is almost brand new. 

Either option will also include black GRIP POD with metal reinforcement, 4 PMAGS (30rds) tan or black.  Will not ship to banned states, sorry. NSUREFIRE LIGHT NOT INCLUDED IN SALE OR TRADE!!  Might be willing to throw it in if you trade a harris bipod and mount for it.

Sorry for the crap photos, only have the ones I took with my camera phone.  I can get better ones for those interested.

Although I am looking for a colt 901, might be interested in other 308's.  Bolt or Gas, leaning more towards Gas( could add the optic and KAC rifle for the right trade, like Larue OBR, GAP 10, SR-25 (ill add for it), LWRC REPR, LMT, etc... Only bolt guns I'd be interested in are GAP built 308's.

I have a GENTLY USED complete set of Trijicon GL01 Glock Bright & Tough 3-Dot Iron Green Lamp night sights for sale that were manufactured in 2012. Front sight has a yellow outline that glows for easy on target acquirement similar to the Trijicon HD night sight set. Fits Glock Models: 17, 17L, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, & 39.

Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Night Sights are three-dot iron sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock-resistant design. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. Professional installation recommended. These retail for $109.00 plus tax brand new. Price is $100.00 cash OBO or Best Offer.

Both the Hakim rifles and bayonets were produced only in Egypt. Nasser wanted to develop Egypt's capacity to manufacture its own arms and bought the Ljungmann production tooling and some M1896 bayonet tooling, delivered and set up in Egypt by the Swedes. The long, heavy Hakim was not ideal for the short-statured Egyptian soldiers, but it was a turn-key operation. Hakim means ""first born"", which is appropriate for Egypt's first home-produced small arm.

I would like to sell or trade this. I am interested in .45 ACP, .30-06, 223 REM/556 and .357 MAG. I am also looking for a good dagger.

Noveske is one of the premier manufacturers of AR-15 pattern rifles and this is a perfect example. This rifle features a 14.5"" Stainless Steel barrel with a 1:7"" twist rate and Polygonal rifling. Polygonal rifling is an innovative alternative to conventional rifling, boasting increased velocity and accuracy, and significantly easier cleaning. The smooth bore profile provides an improved gas seal, decreases deformation of bullet jackets, and has no sharply angled grooves to hold deposits of fouling. An AAC flash hider is pinned to the barrel making this rifle legal without a SBR stamp. Noveske's Stainless Steel barrels are made to fill a precision role while retaining flawless function. Retaining accuracy and reliability is a complicated balance in that the chamber needs to be slightly modified from the NATO to improve bullet hook-up in the throat, while keeping to functional properties of the NATO body dimensions. The result is a proprietary Noveske chambering. The steel used is a type of 416R and hardened to about 30 HRC prior to any machining. These barrels are button rifled with Noveske's proprietary 7 PT button. This design and the type of stainless used helps the lead edge of the rifling from eroding as fast as it might with conventional rifling, and the barrels tend to outlast others. The barrel has a bead blasted finish for a matte appearance. A mid-length gas system is used, decreasing heat related wear to critical internal componentry, and reducing felt recoil to the operator. For use in any precision application, Noveske recommends a Stainless Steel barrel for its edge in accuracy and excellent reliability."

These two hunting rifles are Browning and one is a 1885 High Wall 45-70 and the other is a Low Wall Hornet 22.  Both are Grade VI stocks, top end wood and grain.



The High Wall comes with a brand new scope, Leopold VX 3L 4.5x50mm ($998.00).  The cheapest I could find online for this highwall version is $1,385 (without any scope) and it was a bit beat up.



The Low Wall Hornet is even harder to find.  It has a simple Trasco scope and is my perfect varmint rifle.  The only thing I could find online for it was $1,500 without scope and Grade II wood stock.



I’m selling the set for $3,100.  I’ll throw in the stainless travel case from Cabellas and the boxes of ammo I have left. (over $200 value.)  It’s stainless steel and locks for travel or storage.

The XDM is one of the most popular handguns out right now for people looking for a conceal/open carry gun. Most all XD’s have a few amazing features such as: the cocked indicator, it has a loaded chamber indicator, has a grip safety and a trigger safety. This handgun is very reliable, accurate, cool looking and has a very nice feel to it. This gun is personally one of my favorites. I have an XD and love mine and would recommend this gun to anyone!

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.

XDM Features:

XDM DESIGN

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.

Model Contour Frame: The ideal grip angle of the XD has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.

Major Grasp Slide Serrations: Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.

Mega-Lock Texture: The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

XDM TECHNOLOGY: Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.

(M)elonite: Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M)is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

(M)atch Grade Barrel: Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry

(M)inimal Reset Trigger: The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

XDM INNOVATIONS: The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD is now captured in the all new XD(M) line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M) series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.

(M)inimal Error Disassembly: Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.

(M)aximum Reach Mag Release: The modified contour of the new XD(M)grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.

(M)ega Capacity Magazine:The new XD(M) Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR Mag

X-Tension (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the .40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.

XDM PERSONALIZATION: Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M), you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.

(M)ould-Tru Backstraps: With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.

(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System: A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position.

(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case:Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.

(M)agazine X-Tensions: With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions, SPRINGFIELD ARMORYhas added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)

XDM STANDARDS: In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XD polymer pistol, they did just that.

Loaded Chamber Indicator: The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.

Striker Status Indicator: The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position.

USA Trigger System: The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

Grip Safety: Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

The bore is bright and shinny and there is no rust or abuse anywhere. the sling is original to the rifle and the rifle caliber is 8mm, the stock appears to be lamented and it is serial numbered to the gun. The internet states: 1941 changes included the use of the letter code “ar”, a change from a full four-digit receiver date to a two digit date, and the use of a cupped buttplate (to keep rifle stock butts from delaminating). “ar” 41 rifles are essentially the same as contemporary production from other plants. if you have been wanting a great K98 WWII Rifle for your collection, you could not want for a better one."

I mean I will not accept mausers, enfields, 03-A3's etc with full #'s, however mosins, steyers, and many other rifles hold little value even with matching #'s.

Guns do need to function near 100% i.e. safe to shoot.

These guns are for parts, and research into various rechamberings, stock configurations,  action adjustments etc.  Therfore, appearances mean nothing to me, I would prefer them rough if anything.   Which is the condition alot of these guns are found in.  

One thing I do ask is that no guns be offered with bores that have been either shot out or rusted away do to corrosive ammo negligence.  Even though one might be rechambered that particular action may not be on our ""rechambering list"" if quantity is not available.

I will also refrain from taking more desirble guns that are in overall very good or better shape, even without matching #'s I do not feel that I should take away the opportunity for a person to own or shoot one of these rifles strictly because it is not truly ""collectible"", but again mosins, certain steyrs and others hold no value regardless.  I will accept these.

2 nine round mags and everything from factory.
I will include two 15 round mag spacers and one 13 round spacer.
I will swap the sights with factory ones if your trade doesn't have them.
I'd like to trade or sell my 27. Went to the range and shot 100 rounds and love the feel. But I can't place the rounds where I want them on the target.
Gun shop didn't offer enough for me to trade for a used Glock 23. 
They have a used G23 gen 4 three yrs old for $495 and offered me $250 towards a trade.
So I'm going to try to trade here. I had a 23 and after shooting the 27 realize the 23 is a better fit
It feels as if the 27 has less punch. I think because of the dual spring.
I can't get one shot at a small target at 15 yards with the 27 but can hit the target all day with the 22 and 23. Plus I can't effectively hit a target at 10 yards with one hand like I could with the 23 which has more recoil. 
I think it's because the 27 grip is too short.
The reason the price is high is I really want to trade for a Glock23 gen4 or have enough cash to purchase a new one. If I can't find a good trade then I have to practice til I can hit a target at 15 yards.
