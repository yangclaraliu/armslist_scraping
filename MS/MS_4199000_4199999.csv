It has only had about 3 boxes of ammo put through it and to be honest, I've never had a single malfunction. I have several Sig Sauer hand guns and like shooting the Walther more due to the accuracy and the extremely comfortable ergonomics. It is a must have for someone looking for a concealed carry firearm due to it's slim frame and extreme consistency. The only reason I am getting rid of it is because I have so much training with my P226, it is hard to adapt to the striker fired platform, so I am offering it up for sale. 

Comes with two mags, the firearm, all the original paperwork, and a Walther hard case specifically for the ppq, which also has a cutout for if you have a light attachment mounted. Maintenance is a breeze--takes down just like a Glock, but is easier because the take down tabs are larger and more accessible for when it is time to clean.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

FTF in South Bend / Mishawaka or shipped USPS Priority

Vortex Diamondback HP 2-8x32 w/ BDC reticle

This scope has a little wear (as can be seen in the pics) but is in good shape overall. The glass is good and it has worked well for me at the range, but I have an upgrade coming in so it no longer has a home. The SF and 4x magnification range on these would go great with a .22lr (particularly for an Appleseed) and at this price it's really not much more than the Crossfire II 2-7x32 RF. Being a Diamondback, though, it is also more than tough enough to go on a muzzleloader or medium caliber hunting rifle.

I have the box, but not all of the contents are there. Particularly, the scope covers that came with this batch of Diamondback HPs did not have the plastic lenses, so I got rid of them. The lens cloth is not there, either.

It's been used very gently and is in excellent condition.  Very accurate & very consistent accuracy, and quite powerful.  Perfect for small game hunting.

Comes with an RWS 3-9x40 A.O. airgun scope, an RWS one-piece droop-compensating airgun scope mount, a new soft case, new cleaning kit, new bottle of chamber oil, a scope bikini, a slip-on butt pad (to protect the stock if you set the rifle on the ground), a steel self-resetting airgun target, and six new 500-round tins of .177 Crosman pellets, various styles (hollow point, target, pointed, and extra-heavy -- 3000 rounds total).

This is the complete package.  It has everything needed for airgunning, and has the quality to last a lifetime.  $500 invested.

$225 for everything.

NOTE:  The picture with the box is not the actual gun I'm selling--it's the exact same type, though, and has all the same stuff (except the scope it shows is a fixed 4x, whereas mine is a 3-9x... and my gun doesn't have the box).  It's just a better picture than I could take that I found online."

Excellent conceal carry weapon! .91"" W x 6"" L x 4.5"" H
Comes with 1 magazine and 100 rds ammo.

It's hammer fired, has an external safety that is made so that you can safely use it or avoid using it if you don't like it. The chamber indicator is an added safety feature. It does lock the trigger if you release the magazine, so keep that in mind -- it won't fire without a magazine (another safety feature in case someone is trying to wrestle your gun from you -- push the mag button to drop the mag and they can't fire it).

The trigger is somewhat heavy, and has a very long pull. This is also a sort of safety feature to keep you from accidentally firing it in your pants and shooting yourself. 

Probably 100-150 rds through.  Had for 2 years, looking for larger caliber.  All around fine compact pistol.

11595E Barrel steel, Manganese Phosphate finish, F-Marked Front sight base.  
This 5.56mm cal barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length M4 cool tunnel handguards, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function in full or semi auto. 
The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate the heat of full auto fire. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights.
The barrel is mounted on a FORGED A2 upper receiver with built in carry handle made from certified 7075T6.511 alloy forgings, hardcoat anodized IAW Mil Spec A8625, Type III, Class II, black per No. 37038, Table IX with nickel acetate seal, as per the Mil-spec. This upper has the newest Mil-spec A2 adjustable sights that feature finger adjustable elevation to 800 meters and more than 30 minutes of windage adjustment at 1/2 MOA per click. The upper features a forward assist and hinged ejection port cover.

The Crossbreed holster has only been used a couple of times and looks like new. 3 of the magazines have Pearse pinky extensions for added comfort. The ammo is a mixture of range and self defense ammo. I'll let everything go, including the ammo can, for $595.00 firm. Absolutely NO TRADES. Do some price checking and you'll see that this is a great deal. These Glock 42's usually require break-in period of 300 rounds or so. This one was broken in properly and cleaned after every range session. You can carry this one with confidence! Call/Text 817-714-11 one five. Thanks

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

You may have the idea that these are just rip off Berettas, but here is a little history on Taurus:

""...Beretta had won a huge contract in 1974 to produce small arms for the army of Brazil. Part of the deal was that Beretta construct a Brazilian factory and use Brazilian labor. This they did, in the southwestern coastal city of Sao Paulo. When the contract ran out in 1980, Beretta sold the plant, literally ""lock, stock and barrel,"" to Taurus. Taurus now owned everything that once belonged to Beretta, including drawings, tooling, machinery, and a very experienced work force. Taurus was in the pistol business, and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus PT-92 and PT-99 9mm pistols.""

I have also had a metal trigger put on this gun to offset the cheaper feel of the stock plastic trigger. On a gun of this quality, I believe Sig should have made the trigger metal stock from factory. This gun is in great condition with a couple scratches near where the pin to take out the trigger is located (my gunsmith had a hard time removing the pin at first). But other than that, this gun is in pristine condition and has only had around 250 rounds through it. I am looking to get around $650 for this gun, but I will entertain other offers.  Thank you for your interest"

The Yugo 59/66A1 fires 7.62x39mm rifle ammunition and has a muzzle attachment and specialized gas system to fire 29mm NATO rifle grenades(which are NFA regulated and probably impossible to get. I have never tried and I don't know the law, but it is probably illegal to have them). It has a Tapco intrafuse stock system with a custom ""woodland camo"" paint job. The Tapco stock system has a T6 M4 style 6 position butt stock with sling attachment, a SAW style pistol grip, an upper/lower rail system for optics/accessories(optics pictured are NOT included)and an additional single point sling attachment(sling pictured NOT included). There is a detachable forward grip on the lower rail and an added picatinny side rail. The rifle also comes with two Tapco 20 round polymer duck billed magazines(with ""woodland camo"" paint job), a 30 round stainless duck billed magazine, and the original stripper clip magazine/magazine cover. There are also 3 different receivers included. There is the original stock receiver and 2 other receivers with rails for adding scopes/optics. One is a stealth black steel see through receiver with tactical high profile rail system, and the other is a NcStar receiver with Tri rail weaver scope mount base(this is the receiver on the rifle in the photos). The rifle also comes with a removable NcStar AK/SKS shell deflector, a UTG ergonomic AK/SKS sighting tool, an ultimate arms gear bayonet lug mounted folding adjustable height bipod, and an ultimate arms gear model VZ58 steel 6 prong impact defense muzzle break. I replaced the grenade launcher muzzle break with VZ58 muzzle break, but I still have the grenade launcher muzzle break and it will come with the rifle. The rifle still has the original sights including the folding grenade launcher siting system. I do NOT have the original stock for the rifle. It was already gone when I first purchased it. I will NOT sell the rifle without all the accessories I mentioned. It is a package deal. The accessories are specifically made for an SKS and after I sell the rifle, I will have no use for them. I will also include, at no extra charge, an Ultimate Arms Gear Tactical SKS 4x30 mm Illuminated Red Mil Dot Rangefinder Reticle Hunting Sniper Rifle Scope with See Thru Lens Caps & Lithium Battery. Once again, the rifle with come with everything I mentioned above, but will NOT come with the optics that are pictured on the rifle. The rifle is in good condition and I have only fired about 200 rounds with it in 2 years with no problems. Buyer must be willing to sign a sales receipt with name and DL number. I am a private seller and I don't want to be responsible if the rifle is used in an illegal manner buy the purchaser. The price of SKS rifles these days is anywhere from $300-$1000, and the price is only going up due to demand. The government is actively pursuing new assault rifle bans and they will be increasingly more difficult to obtain. I have also put at least $300 into the rifle with accessories, parts, etc. Obviously I will not ask a  buyer to pay for everything I put into the rifle, but I am not going to take a huge loss either. There is a middle ground. So, if you think the price is too high then make me a reasonable offer and I will consider it."
