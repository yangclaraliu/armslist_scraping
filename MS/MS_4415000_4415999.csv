This first edition will only climb in value...no matter what the outcome is.

Guns and Ammo sourced:
First, the XSP is all black, but it won’t rust in your pocket. The slide and barrel are machined out of solid stainless steel bar stock, then given a blackened finish. Next, even the serrations on the slide have been improved when compared with the original Mustangs. The serrations are wider and deeper, providing a more aggressive gripping surface. In case you’re wondering what “XSP” stands for Colt explained; “XSP is sort of a carry-over from our XSE series of pistols. The XSE line is a line with many upgrades from our standard line, such as dovetailed front and rear sights, ambidextrous safeties, undercut triggerguard, etc. We changed the ‘E’ to a ‘P’ simply because the new Mustang has a polymer grip frame. This machined parts have the finest tolerances we produce...as you say, ""The slide moves like glass.""

The scope tracks very well and has decent low light clarity. Also included is the two cheek pieces that can be easily swapped for your specific use and preferences. Along with the gun, a total of 6 boxes of 20 gauge slugs are included, 4 of which are Winchester slugs that this gun prefers the best.

Adjustable rear sight, fiber optic front sight, and a tight frame to slide very nicely blended. Something you see on much more expensive 1911s.  $700 or I'm looking for a Browning Hi Power St. Louis stamped. I'd really like to keep her but if I can get a STL Hi Power I'm willing to leverage the STI. I've wanted an STL Hi Power for a very long time and now it's time. The Spartan V really is a great gun if your looking to get into competitive shooting or just looking for a really nice 1911. You get A LOT for the money with an STI. The STI has a lot of the same features as my TRP 1911 and it cost three times as much. Long story short you need at least one 1911 and if you have an STI you'll only need one."

I have included a write-up of the model 65-3. 

The Smith and Wesson model 65 revolver was introduced in 1973. It was one of several .357 magnum variations of the extremely popular model 10. It is built on the medium sized K frame, making it one of Smith and Wesson's medium-weight models. 

The model 65 was produced from 1973 to 1999, then some minor changes were made. It continued to be produced until 2004. 

The model 65 was always a popular gun with law enforcement officers, as it could handle full-power .357 magnum or .38 +P loads without a problem, and had very good balance and handling characteristics.

The model 65 is no longer produced, but can be readily found used or as new in box. While it's not a collectors item (yet), it is a very desirable revolver.

This rifle is in excellent condition inside and out. There is no rust, pitting, or wear on any steel, and the furniture is in great shape with the exception of two blemishes on the foregrip. Comes with the 75 round drum magazine pictured.

Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches. Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or Chinese-made AKM, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62x39mm ammunition.

It should be a REAL shooter as Howa 1500s have a great reputation.  Of course it has adjustable trigger which right now is set at 2.5lbs.  Wonderful rifle for someone.  I just don't shoot .243 or reload for it.
Now for trading purposes I want a TC possibly a CVA pistol in one of the following calibers, .22 hornet,  .223, .222, something light with high velocity. Dies for reloading any of these loads would be a plus.  I would also greatly consider a TC or CVA rifle in 6.5x55 as I shoot that load for target.  More pics if interested.  Just request them and what kind of shot you want.  I would be willing to include extra funds for the right trade.  
NOTE: Scope and Burris rings not included in this trade.  They can be part for the right firearm. Again I will add funds if necessary for the kind of deal Im looking for if necessary..

I will only conduct trades that require the owner me and the person wanting to trade Both use an ffl."

This pistol was produced sometime in the mid-late 1990s in Little Rock, AR by the LaserAim company to serve as a dedicated host for their laser module products. From what I can tell it's a fairly rare gun, and it seems to be well made. The grip is very similar in shape to a CZ or Tanfoglio, but is much more slim due to being a single-stack. Overall the design of the gun seems to be heavily inspired by but not necessarily an exact clone of the 1911, although it does take 1911 mags. It comes with the original laser module but according to the owner it no longer works, this was apparently not uncommon judging by posts I've found from other owners of this model handgun.

This comes with two 7"" 10mm and .45ACP barrels, both of which were cut with compensator ports at the factory. Owner is looking for cash, he's unfortunately got no use for trades. This would be a great piece for collectors of 10mm pistols or uncommon handguns."
