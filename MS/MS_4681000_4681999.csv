Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-holster price, and with no additional shipping charges. Here are surplus police cases to hold standard 4 ounce chemical aerosol defensive spray bottles, we old heads still call it Mace. They will also work admirably for most any single line pistol magazine like the Colt Government model, and for most double staggered magazines that hold 9mm or .40 S&W caliber ammunition. Manufacturer is Gould & Goodrich, always one of the top ten quality leather and police equipment producers. Model stamping is FRG 4046. Construction is what G&G calls High Gloss laminate, or what we call hard patent Clarino surfaces laminated over genuine leather bodies, and close stitched for composure. Internal dimensions of the interior are 1.25 inch circumference with a depth of 4 1/2 inches closed, precisely the size for standard 4 ounce police sprays like Freeze or Punch. The Smith & Wesson MP40 and MP45 Magazines showing are not included; the MP40 Magazine, same dimensions as its 9mm counterpart, has an outside width of .855 and horizontal back-to-front length of 1.27 inches, with a height of 4 3/4 inches; it is a good fit.  The MP45 magazine measures .865 by 1.375, and it will take some stretch time, 2 or 3 weeks, before a magazine that large works. This case, then, will easily accommodate most double stacked 9mm or .40 caliber magazines, but .45 and 10mm double stacks are literally a bit of a stretch. The cases in the photos came to us as surplus from a police trade in Smith & Wesson’s home town. Surface detractions are minimal to negligible, most of these cases were never issued. Replacement pricing on these cases is upwards of $50 apiece in our area, and a person can’t find them outside of Memphis.

The weapon has a ton of features and a low round count. It will come with the factory box and 2 magazines. Some of the ZEV features include:

GZEV Fulcrum Drop In Trigger - billet aluminum trigger system adjustable for trigger movement and pull weight. Match grade trigger for fast precision shooting.

ZEV Combat Iron Sights - stainless steel corrosion resistant design with a durable black coating. Thin .100-inch wide front sight matches well with wide .140-inch notched rear sight for a great sight picture. 

ZEV CCW Magazine Release - short bullet aluminum magazine releases with reduced spring tension. Allows easier on handed manipulation without shifting grip. Short factory length is well suited for concealed carry. 

A45 Slide cut - straight cocking serrations for easier manipulation of the pistol. 45-degree radius cut to remove weight. 

Custom Stipple Grip Job - pistol frame is reshaped and textured for a more positive grip and improved index. High single undercut allows a higher grip giving more mechanical leverage to counteract muzzle flip. Reduced backstrap hump makes the gun less grip sensitive and points more naturally.

I prefer to sell to someone who has a Conceal Carry Permit. It's a great gun and it will make someone very happy with how well it performs."

For an additional $100 I will throw in the scope. It is is a Nitrex TR-1 3-9x40 with a ballistic drop reticle.

Ruger® M77® Mark II Target rifles are time-tested, bolt-action, special-application rifles at a great value. These rifles feature a matte stainless steel finish that resists corrosion. The heavy contour, hammer-forged barrel with target crown provides long-range accuracy shot after shot. The wide, target forend gives stability on sandbags or other support surfaces.

With a one-piece bolt that has proven to be one of the strongest on the market, integral scope bases which can never shoot loose, and a diagonally angled forend screw that adds accuracy by securely pulling the barreled action down into the handsome, black laminate stock for accurate shooting, the M77 Mark II Target rifle proves its value as a workhorse in the field and at the range.  We are here to help!

Please research the holsters before you ask questions. I will send pictures to anyone interested. 
1)  Gould & Goodrich BootLock Ankle Holster

Model# B716 42LH

Almost new leather ankle holster. Shows little(if any) signs of use. I think I may have carried it 5 times before I switched pistols. Don't confuse this with the cheaper fabric model. This is the leather model that has a MSRP of $126.31. Fits 2"" revolvers(s&w j-frame, taurus, charter and others). 


2) Cobra Gunskin OWB Holster 

Model: John Parlante

This is a custom OWB leather holster for 2"" revolvers Smith & Wesson J Frame and Taurus 85. It is a double stitched and hand molded. And has a side/sweat guard. The holster is in ""like new"" condition. I think I have carried it a total of 3 days before I switched back-up pistols. The MSRP on this holster is $99.95. And you can tell by the quality that it's worth every penny. 

3) Bell Charter Oak ""Cutdown Pocket Rocket"" Sharkskin Revolver Holster

This is a pocket holster made by Lefty Lewis. For 2"" revolvers (Smith & Wesson or Taurus). If your looking at this you know that there is at least a 4 month waiting period for his handmade holsters. This one is extra special because it is made of the last bit of sharkskin that's is commercially available. Not only is the sharkskin visually stunning but it's also much more durable than the highest grade cow/horse hide.  I bought this holster last year and had to wait 4+ months for it to be made. During that time I had to change back-up/off-duty pistols. So this holster has never been used. Hate to get rid of it but it's just sitting in my safe. My loss is your gain....I just paid $131.50 for this holster."

Product Description
hecklerkoch The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact uses a slim-line grip profile, but otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45. The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance. Using HK's unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. The HK45 also uses an improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever that's frame-mounted and easily accessible. An integral Picatinny rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover allows for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories. Each HK45 Compact comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter's hand. PLUS the HOGUE Grip that's already on it!!"

I've waited months for these things to come out and I do like it but I don't feel that it's practical on my SBR as it doesn't make it much smaller than it already is.

Anyway I put this on last week, only tools few minutes to install. Very easy to install, only requires a stock wrench and some Allen keys, everything else is included with pictures and directions.

Put about 200 rounds through my SBR with this attached. About 100 with a supressor and 100 without and it functioned flawless."

But it doesn't stop there. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 0.2"" thicker than single-stack sub-compacts. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore-greatly reducing the pistol's felt recoil.

And there is no better shotgun to have for the season than the mossberg turkey thug.  Camo pattern helps disguise you and helps break up the pattern of the gun so it doesn't give you away to that big Tom.  The recoil of the 20 is alot less than that of a 12 gauge so you can feel comfortable that you have plenty of knock down power but it isn't going to move your shoulder to the next county when it goes off. There has only been 3 shells put through this gun. Comes with two almost full boxes of 7.5 shot ammo (the three fired through this shotgun is what is missing out of these boxes).  Priced to move quick so don't wait, I don't expect this one to last long with the season right around the corner."

After purchase, redeem here for offer: http://blog.springfield-armory.com/gearupandgoIf you’re looking for a versatile carry pistol that is packed with features, has amazing capacity, and performs flawlessly, look no farther than the XD(M) 3.8” Compact. The XD(M) 3.8” Compact is the smallest of the XD(M) line, but it’s by no means the least. It boasts the same superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make larger XD(M)’s easy and intuitive to use in a slightly abbreviated package. And you’ll be amazed at how fun it is to shoot. The XD has taken on another design in the XDM Compact. The ""M"" stands for a Model contour frame, Major grasp slide serrations, Match-grade barrel, and Minimal reset trigger. The XDM has a whole other level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches specification and precision engineering like Springfield Armory. The XD(M) 3.8” Compact has a 3.8 inch barrel mated with a shortened compact frame. Put in an X-Tension magazine, and you have a 19 round full-sized 9mm pistol. Use the flush-fitting 13 round magazine, and you have a Compact. Like all XD(M)’s, Compact comes with three interchangeable backstraps, dovetail sights, mega-lock frame texturing, an ambidextrous magazine release, a multi-position frame rail, and a match grade barrel. You’ll also find all the safety features that make the XD(M) a safe pistol in responsible hands. If you want a gun for daily carry as well as a trip to the range, but you only want to buy one gun, try the XD(M) 3.8” Compact. You’ll be amazed at how controllable it is to shoot and how easy it is to conceal. It’s two guns in one."

My wife just HAD TO HAVE this handgun and then after 52 rounds she decided that even the COMPACT grip was too big for her petite hands, which maybe it is (she's very much used to a subcompact 9mm).  But, why was she unable to hear me tell her that BEFORE she had to get it and had to fire it?

My loss is your gain as I'm selling it AT THE RIGHT PRICE and INCLUDING AMMO.

It COMES WITH 200 ROUNDS WINCHESTER AMMO, 40 S&W, 165 grain, FMJ - There's an easy $60.00 or more in value in AMMO alone (see pics)

It COMES WITH the polymer holster (see pics).
SIG SAUER® P250 Wins Two NRA Golden Bullseye Awards

SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year. 

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will . . .

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size; (subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

I can email you pictures of the gun.  For some reason the photos uploaded here are just looking awful.  But I have high res pictures I can share with you.  The gun has been used in the 70 years.  I still take it out to shoot sporting clays from time to time.  Great gun but as you can tell it from the wood, that it has been out in the field.
A lot of people think that Remington copied the Browning A5 shotgun. The reality is that when John Browning went to sell the gun design he only got interest from Remington but the president of Remington died of a heart attack as John was waiting to introduce the gun to them. John Browning went to FN and they went into production in 1902. Browning wanted to see the gun produced in the US so Remington licensed it in 1905 and the Model 11 became the first US produced semi-auto shotgun. The gun offered here has had some honest use and it shows it and it works great and has been well maintained."

The FN F2000 is a 5.56×45mm NATO bullpup assault rifle, designed by FN Herstal in Belgium.[5] The F2000 made its debut in March 2001 at the IDEX defence exhibition held in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates.

Design details	

The F2000 is a modular weapon system; its principal component is a compact 5.56×45mm NATO-caliber assault rifle configured in a bullpup layout. The F2000 is a selective fire weapon operating from a closed bolt.

The rifle consists of two main assemblies: the barreled receiver group and the frame, coupled together by means of an axis pin located above the trigger guard. The barrel group has an integral MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail used to mount optical sights. The frame or lower receiver contains the trigger group, the bolt and bolt carrier assembly, return mechanism and magazine well. A removable handguard is installed in front of the trigger which completes and encloses the trigger guard.

Features	
The F2000 is a gas operated, fully automatic and ambidextrous bullpup rifle. Both the safety system and trigger mechanism were adopted from the P90 personal defense weapon; the selector toggle is a rotating disc located below the trigger. The fire selector doubles as the weapon’s manual safety and secures the firearm against accidental discharge (the selector/safety disc has 3 settings: ""S""—safe, ""1""—semi-automatic mode, ""A""—fully automatic fire). The ""safe"" setting disables the trigger. The hammers, group pins, and springs are steel while all other components are nylon injection molding. The shell of the rifle is made of composite materials.

The F2000 is fed from standard NATO box magazines (STANAG 4179) with a 30-round cartridge capacity using 5.56×45mm ammunition. The magazine catch/release button is installed symmetrically in the pistol grip, in front of the magazine; the magazine catch is operated by an oversized actuator useful when wearing NBC gloves. The F2000 is not configured from the factory to have a drop-free magazine system due to the friction from the removable dust gaskets. The magazine needs to be pulled out manually.

The rifle does not have a hold-open device; the bolt does not stay back after the last round is fired. The cocking handle is placed on the left side of the receiver, just above the handguard, and can be operated by left-handed shooters. There are no access points for the possible ingress of dirt or debris; the cocking handle slot is sealed.

The weapon’s primary sight is a telescopic sight with a fixed 1.6× magnification (the reticle also enables use in low-light conditions) contained in a plastic housing above the receiver (mounted on the MIL-STD-1913 rail), the secondary sight is a non-adjustable fixed notch and front blade, molded into the optical sight housing cover. The sight cover and sight module can be quickly removed to reveal the Picatinny rail.

The rifle’s chromed hammer-forged steel barrel is stated to retain accuracy after 20,000 normal (non-sustained) rounds. The barrel also features a flash suppressor with an angled cut at the tip which directs the muzzle blast upward, compensating for muzzle rise. The F2000 has an optional bayonet lug mounted near the muzzle, and an adjustable gas regulator with two settings: ""normal"" for standard ammunition meeting NATO specifications, and ""adverse""—used to send an increased volume of gas into the system to ensure proper functioning when fouled or when using low pressure ammunition.

Operating mechanism
This selective fire weapon is a gas-operated design utilizing a short-stroke piston system driven by propellant gases diverted into the gas cylinder through a port in the barrel; it fires from a closed bolt position. The weapon is locked with a rotating bolt which features 6 radial locking lugs, a spring-powered extractor and ejector. The chamber, bolt, and ejector mechanism can be accessed by flipping up a hinged inspection cover in the receiver, behind the optical sight housing.


Partial disassembly (cartridge on bolt face).

Peruvian Marines armed with standard configuration F2000s in July 2010.
The F2000 uses a unique ejection system, ejecting spent cartridge casings forward and to the right side of the weapon—through a tube running above the barrel. This method of ejection provides for fully ambidextrous operation; the rifle can be used without any modification by both right and left-handed shooters. This ejection pattern was achieved by using a swiveling polymer tray, which intercepts the empty casing from the bolt face immediately after disengaging from the extractor. As the empty casing is extracted it is held while the rocker assembly tilts to lift it above and clear of the feed path as the next round is stripped from the magazine by the bolt head. The casing is fed into the tray located in a cavity in the receiver wall, which then pivots the cartridge case and directs it into a chute (above the barrel); the case is discarded from the tilting tray by being impacted by a pin on the moving bolt carrier upon its forward return. Only when the ejection tube contains more than five cases is the first of them ejected forward through a port just behind and to the right of the muzzle. This is continued; every fifth round fired, all five shells are ejected in a burst, until the magazine is empty. Thus a 30-round magazine will be ejected in six bursts of five shells.

This system is patent protected (patent number 5675924 dated 14 October 1997 by René Predazzer[6] and patent 6389725 from February 25, 2000, author – Charles Denuit).[7] The ambidexterity provided by forward ejection is its most obvious benefit, and removes many of the tactical and user difficulties (such as lack of ambidexterity, and gas and debris released in close proximity to the shooter’s face—see the IMI Tavor TAR-21) that bullpup designs usually create.

Grenade launcher
One of the modules developed for the F2000 system is a proprietary lightweight 40 mm under-slung GL1 grenade launcher (empty weight—1 kg) that uses standard low-velocity 40×46mm grenades.[8] The launcher is a single-shot breech-loaded reverse pump-action weapon with a barrel that slides forward for loading and unloading (like the M203 grenade launcher), locked by axial rotation of the barrel.[9]

The grenade launcher's trigger is installed directly under the F2000's trigger so that it can be manipulated without removing the shooting hand from the rifle’s pistol grip.[10] The double-action trigger lets the operator ""try again"" if the grenade's percussion type primer doesn't ignite. The breech release button is found on the left side of the launcher body, like on the M203. The grenade launcher comes with a basic flip-up ladder sight, but it was intended to be used with a specially designed optoelectronic fire control system designated FCS, developed in cooperation with the Finnish company Noptel.

The aiming module is installed in place of the standard optical sight and becomes the weapon’s primary sight when mounted, but its main purpose is to accurately determine and indicate the range of a grenade target. The module is powered by a 9 V battery pack, installed in the stock, behind the magazine well. The power pack is also intended to power any other tactical accessories or systems that could be introduced. The FCS integrates a low-power laser rangefinder (precise to within ± 1 m), a day-time aiming channel with an electronically projected reticle, a measured range display reading and a diode elevation adjustment indicator.

The fire control system calculates a firing solution manifested by the barrel’s angle of elevation using target range information from the laser rangefinder (the rangefinder is activated by pushing a button on the pistol grip, below the trigger), corrected manually by the shooter through a push-button interface (add/subtract buttons) on the FCS top cover to take account for head or tail winds that could affect the desired range. The F2000 FCS also contains software with the ballistic properties of up to six types of 40 mm grenades and can be reprogrammed to take advantage of future munition improvements. Batteries for the FCS are located in the bottom of the buttstock.

After obtaining a range measurement, the distance to the target is displayed on a liquid crystal screen and the elevation diode flashes red. Once a correct elevation has been achieved by tilting the rifle, the diode changes color to green indicating the weapon is ready to fire.
