This handgun has been through a pistol class, 415 rounds in one day.  There were no problems, ran flawlessly.  Lubed with lithium grease in the appropriate areas, absolutely no grease nor oil in the striker housing ( I know better ).  
It has had around 630 rounds total through it with no problems.  It is not a safe queen, it begs to be shot.  Rang steel at 85 yards no problem.  
It is used, but just enough to prove it works.  I understand and accept that we all want a new shiny handgun, and that is reflected in the price, but it has already been put through its paces and there are no issues.  It is excellent for defending your life should you need it.
Holster was made by David De La Rosa of delarosatacticalholsters.com.  I have several of his holsters and always use them for training, they are tough and last, I have not broken one yet.  This was also taken through the pistol class.

Only glock factory mags, i don't use the cheap crap.  Capacity is 13 each, but easier to insert with slide in battery if only loaded to 12.

Please have a valid NC pistol permit or a concealed carry permit for purchase to comply with NC law.



Price includes:
Glock 21 Gen 4 with original box and everything that comes in the box
5 glock factory magazines
1 kydex holster with 1.5"" and 1.75"" belt loops

I also have quality 45acp training and self defense ammo (Corbon) I can throw in as well.  Factory ammo, no reloads or re manufactured stuff.

Best offer with required documentation gets it, so price is negotiable.  Do some research to find out what it would cost (in time and $$) to get all this gear in your hand (price out the door, taxes, shipping, etc).  Price has a small amount of buffer to divert the fly-by's."

Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

I purchased all equipment that was highly rated and the best in class for each caliber. Unfortunately I just don’t go to the range at all which completely defeated the purpose of getting into reloading. I will break everything down into content sections to be as thorough as possible. 
Contents:
1)	Hornady Lock-N-Load Classic Kit [$383.06] - This is everything that will get you started for the reloading process. Below is a list of the included items.
a-	Lock-N-Load Classic Single-Stage Press w/ piece of priming large and small primers. (This is separate from the actual hand-held primer that is included as well. It is just another way I found that I like to prime cases.) Also includes a little primer catcher that attaches to the inside of the press to catch primers as you deprime your cases.
b-	Lock-N-Load Powder measure - This is actually brand new and never used. Never got around to needing it since I didn’t load but a couple hundred cases of different calibers.
c-	Electronic Scale – Reviews aren’t great but I didn’t have any issues with this. Took excellent care of it and found that if you do the “CAL” and the “tear” after every 10-15 cases is it fairly precise, even for .308 Precision long range loading.
d-	9th Edition (and most recent) Hornady Reloading Manual
e-	Three Lock-N-Load Die Bushings – I actually purchased a LOT more of these for every single one of my dies. These quick change bushings are amazing and this is what makes the Hornady Press one of the best on the market. With a couple seconds you are able to change out a die while keeping the same settings from die to die.
f-	Hand-Held Priming Tool.
g-	Universal Reloading Block – I purchased an extra one of these so I could finish a step and move the case to the other block. This keeps you organized and efficient/proficient.
h-	Chamfering/Deburring Tool.
i-	Primer Turning Plate – This helps you put primers and shake them to turn them right side up to use the hand-held primer tool.
j-	Powder Funnel – Used when hand powder charging a case. Works great and I haven’t had any issues with powder sticking to the inside due to static electricity.
k-	Powder Trickler – Great when you are trying to get a precise load. It will trickle out a couple grains of powder very slowly.

2)	Reloading Die Sets:
a-	9mm – Lyman 9mm Lugar Carbide 4-Die Set. [$67.99] – VERY highly rated. I like this because unlike most kits this comes with a separate taper crimp die. Perfect set and worked amazing for the few 9mm cases that I reloaded. Worked flawless for an FNX-9, XD-9, Glock 23 w/ conversion 9mm barrel.
b-	.223/5.56 – RCBS Small Base Die Set [$39.99] w/ the Lee Precision .223/5.56 Factory Crimp Die [$12.99] – The small base kit is perfect for reloading for an AR-15 semi-auto platform or a .223/5.56 bolt action rifle. This is one of the most used/highest rated sets on the market. The Lee FCD is one of the only tools that every reloader typically uses for crimping their AR-15 rounds to be used in a magazine. 
c-	.308 - Forster Full Length Sizer & Bench Rest Seater Die Set [$82.99] – This is the highest rated die set for high precision .308 reloading on the market (just check out MidwayUSA ratings). This usually sells out at most online stores. Forster is well known for their precision parts in the reloading circles. A large portion of competition and long range shooters use these dies exclusively.

3)	Extra Reloading Accessories:
a-	Lyman Case Prep Xpress 110v System [$129.99] – Fully automatic case prepping made easy! Includes accessories to chamfer/deburr/ream military 308 & 5.56 primed brass pockets/brush/clean primer pockets. This is for large and small primer pocket cases. One of the best investments if you plan on doing a lot of reloading. I also recent had Lyman send me another chamfer which is unused for chamfering case mouths. 
b-	Lee Decapping Die [$11.89] – Used to decap/deprime once fired brass (any size). I like using this before cleaning brass. A lot of people use the deprimer in the sizing die but cleaning your brass without the primer in it is optimal.
c-	.30 CAL RCBS Flash Hole Deburring Tool with Pilot Case Stop [$12.49]
d-	.22 CAL RCBS Flash Hole Deburring Tool with Pilot Case Stop [$12.49]
e-	Lee Case Trimmer [$20.00] – Includes the pilot/trimmer/shell holder for a .308 & the pilot/trimmer/shell holder for .223/5.56.
f-	Hornady Shell Holders [In Total Approx. $13.00] - #1/8/16 – This will cover most the major calibers. Will work for the 9mm Lugar/.308 WIN/.223-5.56 REM.
g-	Hornady Universal Reloading Tray [$8.99] – This is extra one that I purchased. It is the same as the one that comes with the Reloading Kit. Better to have multiples of these. This tray is highly rated and very easy to use for multiple calibers.
h-	EGW 4-Hole Chamber Checker Max Cartridge Gage (9mm Luger, 38 Super, 40 S&W, 45 ACP) [$19.99] – I used this to check my cases and ammo after I was done reloading. This helps you determine if your ammo will fit in the tightest chambers.
i-	L.E. Wilson Case Length Headspace Gage .223-5.56 Remington [$26.99] – Highest rated chamber checker for your reloaded rounds. This is a must if you are reloading for an AR-15. Just slide each loaded round in this real quick and it’ll show you if it’s too short/long/tight/loose and etc. This is a must!
j-	iGaging ABSOLUTE ORIGIN 0-6"" Digital Electronic Caliper [$39.95] – Watched a LOT of videos online and read a lot of reviews for Digital Calipers. This is one of the most affordable but one of the most reliable. The repeatability and accuracy is amazing. This is needed for case trimming/bullet seating if not for a lot of other reloading aspects. Helps in setting up dies as well.
k-	Hornady Quick Change Lock-N-Load Die Bushings [$50.00] - x13
l-	x4 MTM 9mm 100 round Ammo Cases [$16.00] – Green See-through tops with black bottoms. Purchased these for my 9mm reloads. Nice cases.


Condition:
Everything is in pristine condition. Unlike a lot of people who just get into reloading for the heck of it and don’t take care of their stuff, I do. The first thing I did when I purchased everything is degrease EVERYTHING including the press, the dies, and accessories. Then lubed/cleaned them very well with Hornady One Shot Dry Lube. This stuff is amazing and I highly suggest you use this. I broke down every piece on the dies and wiped them down and lubed them with the Hornady One Shot Dry Lube. This is highly recommended with new dies. I kept everything highly organized. I went to the craft section if Walmart and purchased heavy duty plastic containers to organize all my dies. I made sure everything fit precisely in it and everything made sense. After cleaning every die I screwed on a Lock-N-Load Die Bushing to make sure every die had a quick change bushing. These bushings are what make Hornady’s reloading press so extremely popular and precise. Unless you get the conversion kit for other presses this is the only one that lets change out dies without having to readjust them every time. This made reloading for 9mm so easy. I would seat about 15-20 at a time then switch to crimping them. Then immediately switch back. The seater die stayed right at 1.100” when I twisted it back into place. Just look up the YouTube Videos or read reviews.

Other Thoughts:
	I put a lot of thought into this entire set for a significant amount of time. I’ve been into reloading for some time. Unfornately, I am no long able to go to the range as much as I used to go. This defeats the purpose of reloading to me. I handpicked every item after a lot of consideration. I also spent hours upon hours on forums like Sniperhide, THR, AR15.com, and several other reloading forums to find the best items. I spent a good chuck of money but I made sure I only had to buy once for 9mm/.308/.223-5.56 reloading. I’ve known a LOT of people who upgrade and upgrade to just get to the items that I considered and they ended up spending 3 times as much because they kept changing their mind. Check out the reviews on OpticPlanet, Amazon, Cabellas, MidwayUSA, Brownells & other places for each item that I am offering. I guarantee you that every one of them is 4.5 stars or higher. I made sure EVERYTHING I purchased was thoroughly reviewed and highly rated.
	I have highly detailed excel sheets that I put together for each and every round/component that was purchased or loaded. Very easy to use if I email them to you. The .308 rounds are ready to go to find your Optimal Charge Weight for high precision shooting (that is why 44 have been loaded). I'm a scientist at heart, so I usually work like I am at my lab, efficient, organized and thorough."

Creek runs thru the property north to south. There is a small lake for fishing and a camp site (nice but no electric).
This is a new venture so you will be in on the ground floor. We will develop as we go. Rules are simple: obey Georgia Laws (except 3 does per season) and treat the other hunters like you want to be treated. Remember this is going to be FAMILY FRIENDLY.
10 members will be $1000 each.  I am paying full price as well.
Still hunt only, Georgia State rules for now. Plenty of Deer, hogs are starting to show up and a few bear are on the property. Small game and fishing.
Only charging enough to cover lease. Once established, we can decide on food plots, club stands (or not) etc. It will be family friendly. This should go quickly, so dont put off making the contact.
This is really a nice piece of land and will take very little effort to hunt it as is. Any modifications (food plots, club stands etc) would be easy and only add to the quality of the hunting experience. 
If you are interested, please contact me by email and we can set up a time for viewing. I am retired so any day of the week is good for me.

1: Leupold VX3 Tactical. It's just like a mark 4. It's a 3.5x10x40 30mm tube with a Mildot reticle. It has the M3 turrets. It comes with all 3 turrets it would have from the factory. 300 win mag 308 win and a 223. Also has a leupold ARD and flip up caps that were painted green at one time but is flaking off. It has some ring marks but the glass is perfect. $700
2: Blackhawk 3x9x40 with a 1"" tube. Mildot reticle Mil adjustments. These are not made any more. They were made in Japan with some very nice glass. Word on the street is they are made by Weaver for Blackhawk. It is like new and comes with the box and all the papers and an Allen to reset the turrets. This would be a good all around tactical scope. $200
3: SOLD. 

4: Center Point 4x16x40 1"" tube AO illuminated Mildot reticle. Comes with rings and flip up caps. It's in great shape. Needs a battery. $60
5:pursuit 3x9x32 22LR scope. Has a set of rimfire rings. In good used shape. It has a 22 LR bullet drop turret that goes up to 150 yards. $40
6: Redhead 3x9x40 comes with rings. It's well used. There are some slight scratches on the rear lens. You can't tell when looking through it. It has a standard duplex. Would be good for a truck gun. $35
7: Simmons 2.5x20 ""shotgun"" scope. Not sure why they call it a shotgun scope. It has a really long eye relief like a scout scope. It's in very good shape. Duplex reticle. $40
8: Tasco RedDot. Pretty standard little red dot. In good shape the illumination turret has some nice rubber gripie thing on it. Also has lens caps. $35
9: ClearView 4x32 ""MiniMildot"" reticle. Not sure what the difference is. It looks like it's a fairly standard Mildot. Comes new in box. Caps cloth papers.  It's a cool little tactical fixed 4 power. It would be right at home on a AR22. $30

If you love the P7, then you will certainly appreciate this gun. Packaged as it came new from the dealer. This is your chance to grab a rare gun that does not come up for sale very often."

If you don't like the safety it can easily be converted to decocker only on the usp. I have separate listings for each also. 


These two are compatible with each other as in the p2000sk will take the larger usp mags and they both will take the larger 15 rd p30/vp9 mags 


Would like to trade both for another HK. Not looking to trade my 2 for 1 straight up but something worth more than one of mine or something in .45 where there would be some cash on top of your one gun to even out for both of mine. I am looking first and foremost trade wise for a compact HK chambered in .45 like a usp 45 compact, HK 45 compacts, compact tactical models, maybe a usp 9 sd tactical. 

Will entertain cash offers but no I will not sell for what a couple glocks or m&ps would go for. Don't need te money just want something else and don't want to spend the money to outright buy something else on top of what I have right now. 

I am no longer looking to trade the vp9 also in the picture as I love how this gun shoots too much. 


Contact Jon at REDACTED. Thank you for looking.

I bought it in December and love it, but I have another CZ-75 and it's time for this one to move and make way for another gun. This pistol is a typical CZ-75 with a slightly shortened slide and grip to make it more compact. Think Glock 19 if it were steel/alloy and felt better in your hand. The rubber grips on this thing make it probably the nicest feeling 9mm I have--better than my full size 75. It holds 14+1 rounds of 9mm and has been nothing but reliable. The gun has been taken to the range a handful of times--maybe five or six--with somewhere in the neighborhood of 400-500 rounds through it. Still, it looks immaculate and does not have a single scratch on it.

The gun comes with everything that it did when new: hard plastic box, cleaning rod/brush, manual, lock, two magazines. Any CZ-75 magazine will work with it too. I require that we transfer ownership at an FFL and we will split the fee."

Texture works well in the wet, unlike rubber grips and under normal use won't need to be redone every couple of months. Stippling adds loads of grip to subcompact handguns and can increase accuracy.

I can't really tell you much about it. It's a cowboy styled 1894 in .44 rem mag. There is leaf styled sights on it, and it is pre-safety. This has the Microgroove barrel. The condition on it is excellent. There are a few tiny handling nicks in the bluing I'd be happy to take pictures of. If it shoots anything like my 1894 in .357, then you are going to love it. The action on it is oiled and clean, and throws correctly. This is a JM marked Marlin, I.E. pre-remington abuse of the good Marlin name. 

I'm in Leesburg, and work in Sterling. Prefer local meet, but I'm happy to ship as well. 

Trade offers welcome, but I don't really have a place in my heart for Tauruses, Kahrs, or Kel-tecs. I don't have cash to add right now, and would prefer to sell."

This totals to $3545. I did not include the cost of the cerakote job or any gunsmithing costs, because many people may not like the cerakote job and many people do their own gunsmith work. I also have a practically brand new NiB BCG (~50 rounds shot with it) that I can swap out for the WMD if you prefer. The WMD is higher quality, but isn't brand new. It is your call, you can have either BCG. The EOtech in the picture is not included.


I'd like to get $2200 cash or $2400 trade. If you want the rifle bundle without ammo, price is $2000 cash or $2200 trade. If you'd like the bundle with the ammo but without the optic, price is $2000 cash or $2200 trade. If you'd like the bundle without the ammo or the optic, price is $1800 cash or $2000 trade.

The shop ads and retail prices are killing our website. This site was created because craigslist wouldn't allow private party sale of firearms. Its not here to fill up with your inventory. A once a day post saying come check us out would be more than acceptable. But to list everything in your shops inventory and fill page after page with what mags you have in stock ... come on. We are here because we like buying selling and trading what we already have. I go to shops to purchase when I want something new. Or I look for a deal on here haha. All I'm saying is we don't want to read ad after ad about your shop. If you can't advertise without pissing people off maybe your in the wrong line of work. Nobody looks at your ads. You're wasting your time. At least the people I talk to. Just hit the private party trade/sale filters. quit ruining a good thing. My mid night rant is over I wonder how long it will take to get flagged hahaha

I also can't sell the one magazine that came with it on Ebay (but have it reserved for the Ebay buyer to buy from this site). Unfortunately, (for me at least) I ordered another FS 17 round 9mm magazine in addition. That magazine is for sale. These are the Mec-Gar magazines, the same as Sig sells with their P320's. So, while I would love a 15 round compact 9mm p320 magazine (I have a x grip extension for my subcompact, but no magazine yet), a 17 round FS I can't use. So: I will trade the 17 round FS for a Compact P320 (or new style P250) 15 round magazine. I will just as gladly sell the magazine. I will list it at $35 and if you can get it for less, I'd love to know where that is. With shipping from a website they're generally $45. I will not go below $35 and at that price I won't drive more than 10 or 15 minutes. I want to sell it (or trade) and don't want to haggle, but I won't go below $35. I also have some X grips I mistakenly bought meant for Compacts (new style P250C or P320C) to fit FS magazines (I.E., 9mm compact that usually is 15 capacity, will now accept the full 17 round mags and will give a fuller complete grip). I have 1 of these, still in the packages and will sell at $12, no haggling either. If you want to make an offer on a package deal, trade SC x grips for my Compact x grips or something of that nature, feel welcome to throw an offer out there. For single items though, I think the prices are fair. Ebay buyers, if you buy the x-change kit on Ebay, I will give a special $30 price for each magazine if both are still available ($60 for 2 $40 magazines), or if one sells before then, $30 on one and if you inform me at the time of the kit sale, I will include it with the kit, so you just have one single shipping cost. This price is ONLY for the Ebay x-change kit buyer. You can message me or call at REDACTED if you have any questions."
