Many customers especially expressed thanks for the heavy duty back loop system providing additional, hands-free carry options for gear and tools sometimes not anticipated.

Vest material is breathable, well-ventilated, and dries quickly keeping moisture to a minimum and allows for comfortable prolonged wear. Housed within the breathable and well ventilated mesh system are 2 large zippered internal map/document pouches ideal for storing hunting tags, licenses, identification, and other valuables.

The Rescue Drag Handle on the back of the vest provides maximum strength for critical field operations. It went through painstaking efforts in design and testing to guarantee the highest dependability when you need it in any rescue situation.

Interchangeable Mag Pouch and Holster

The vest includes a hook-and-loop attachable modular double-mag pouch as well as a right-handed holster. They are interchangeable to meet demands of different missions.

Now first off, I'm not a part of the military; however, I have military friends who have served, some in Vietnam, some in the first Gulf War, some currently in Iraq or Afghanistan. When I go to the range with them they like to occasionally gear up and I noticed that they like to practice shooting primary with 3 things on them: gloves, goggles/glasses, and THE VEST. They emphasize these 3 because gloves affect trigger and grip; goggles/glasses affect sight; and the vest determines the flow of ammunition (from vest to firearm) along with the convenience of life-saving equipment!

my military friends actually loved this vest. They said that it feels better than the FLC (Fighting Load Carrier) over their IBAs (Interceptor Body Armor) that they use (although not very customizable). It's a fraction of the cost of other competition such as BLACKHAWK! gear and it is actually is very similar in quality. I don't think UTG's intention was really for military or law enforcement (more for airsofting), BUT it most certainly can be used for those purposes (also a great survival gear option)! Because I got this, my friends want to buy the same thing and take it with them on another tour (year) if needed.

- Surprisingly tough stuff! (Not flimsy mesh material, but heavy duty and thick)
- Lots of pockets (FOUR .223/5.56mm magazine pockets and THREE pistol magazine pockets with Velcro fastening)
- Gives two options of either using a pistol holster (fits Glock 17, M1911, and P220 just fine) or an TWO additional magazine pockets bringing you a total of SIX rifle magazine pockets
- Has a walkie-talkie pocket at the left collar bone
- Macho belt with 2 slim pockets
- Vest has THREE very very large internal pockets/pouches (2 on each side of the front and 1 at the back to hold a plate or a water pouch)
- Does come with a Velcro'ed-on 6-shotgun-shell-holder (mainly for switching to specialty shells such as breaching shells); you may also choose to take this off and put a name patch on instead (when using the shell holder, Velcro may not be strong enough to keep it fastened)"

The front of the buggy has working air shocks and the rear has gas shocks it also sits on leaf springs and coils. the four wheel drive does work and has locking front hubs and the steering gear was just replaced with a new one. The buggy does not have a title due to the fact that I built it and never took it in to get a title because we just used it on our big farm.

Over ninety five percent. 
This is the super rarre 4 5/8 inch barrel.

Age date 1974

This is one that does not have thr ruger roll mark under the barrel for the safety information.

I piped 18 rounds of magnum and 60 rounds of 22 through it. Very smooth and fun.

This copy is very very nice. I bought it just a few days ago. I really really like this.  This is the most rare and hard to find barrel length
I will even put 100 rds 22 with it
no box

Come with both cylinders. Email any thoughts

I demoed this over the weekend. It locks up tight and shoots great. 

I also have some .22 for sale but not too many I want to let go if. You can buy some with the pistol

The cosmetic if this is excellent with for its age of 1974 is super fine.  Jeff at scheels  put it at 95.  I reviewed it in bright light and agree. It's at least 95 for its age.  An excellent copy

I have seen them on gunbroker for around this in not as good of shape. If you want a rare pistol hard to find length this is it. I took it to the Columbus gun show and showed it around. Many interests but I wasn't selling it that day as I just wanted to show it around.

(Revolver)..looked like someone took a small file to the inside where the guns locked..took to bass pro and they got a rag and rubbed nothing but black powder out of barrel and cylinder.and still claimed guns come from factory like that..that's bs ...I own many revolvers so I know how much it has to be shoot to get that wear..so I asked them to show me more guns in the case and what a suprise no other revolver had anything like that on it..even the same exact copy of the gun i bought.but they still claim it came from factory like that..well we all know that was bull.so to top it off they won't even give your money back..they put it on a gift card.so they got me twice..so check your guns very well before u buy it.and I'm not the first person to bring there weapon back up here for same reason..lady at return counter told us that...so I have a  bass pro shop card I'll sell someone..lol..they lost my business for good.  Update....she talked me into going back so she could buy another gun since we already had they money in gift card..she found her gun and went to pay for it .get this ..i handed her our check card to pay for it.. we have a join checking account..they lady who we argued with for a hour earlier told her she wouldn't sell her a gun now because I handed her our check card and said that whom ever money it is had to do the background check.well it's a join checking account..wtf...so I'm confused at this point and lost my temper..that was the stupidest thing I ever heard..so make sure u don't get money from anyone to pay for your gun..lol.the day before she used same card and I handed it to her and she bought a gun..anyone ever heard of this stupid thing.i guess we mad them mad and called them out so the didn't want to sell to us again.lol..oh well..

The Millennium action is striker-fired 
and operates in double-action-only (DAO) mode,
meaning that it fires only by a consistent
and repeatable long pull on the trigger. 
And, much to my applause, 
the Millennium action requires no pre-loading
of the firing mechanism. In other words, 
the Millennium pistol does not require any 
rearward movement of the slide to pre-set 
the striker springs or sear. Thus the PT140 PRO
has repeat-strike capability, allowing a second trigger pull
against any misfire without having to manually 
cycle the slide to reset the trigger action.

Mil-Spec M16/M4 Heat treated and chrome lined carrier.

HPT/MPI tested Bolt.
Drop-in BCG, ready to shoot.
Finish: Standard black phosphate coating.

***There has been a lot of talk about the pros and cons of staking the gas key on the carrier. Here is our opinion and why we do not stake keys. The US Mil Spec. assembly drawing requires the carrier key to be staked. Contrary to some popular opinions staking does not “SEAL” the gas key. Staking keeps the screws from backing out Period.

If you do not properly torque the screws to 56 inch pounds you will be staking a screw that is loose or one that is over torqued and prone to breakage. We have seen plenty of staked screws that are loose or broken.

The Mil Spec. also calls for the gas key bottom surface to be“SEALED"" with Permatex gasket sealer. Something no one does to our knowledge. Here is our procedure for installing a gas key. First clean the oil from the gas key and the mating surface on the carrier. Then clean the oil from the screw threads. We use Acetone for this. Next use a very light coating of Permatex high strength thread locker gel on the bottom of the key. PN 27010. This is much easier to use than the Permatex gasket sealer. It comes in a plastic twist dispenser. Make sure you don't use so much that it squishes into the gas port hole. The cure rate is 60 minutes. Next coat the screw threads with the same gel. Install the key and torque the screws to 56 inch pounds.

I picked this up brand new and it has just sat in my safe. Less than 40 rounds fired through it when purchased. It is in excellent condition, with the exception of maybe a little dust. The BX mags were removed from the packaging for storage in a pouch, but have never been fired. I am pricing this rifle to move, as it is just taking up safe space, however I doubt you will find a better deal out there. 

Lowball offers and silly trades will be ignored. Buyer will provide valid drivers license at time of purchase, and sign a bill of sale. Or pay for the transfer fee at a local gun shop. 
Will trade for: Aimpoint RDS, I will consider other trades as well."

This rifle's 1893 style action was originally chambered for 7mm mauser, but was rechambered after the second world war for 7.62x51 Nato. There is a very good chance that this rifle saw use in the Spanish Civil War. The receiver ring has a very well defined crest of the Guardia Civil. This rifle is in Good to Very Good condition. The stock is in good condition but has the normal dings of most military rifles of the period. The bore is good with no pitting. There is no corrosion on the rifle. The vast majority of the bluing is still in good shape, but the steel is in the white around some of the edges. The bolt rides very smoothly as a Mauser bolt should. The bolt's safety lever is smooth to operate, and not at all too tight, like those of some Mausers. The bolt serial matches the receiver. I'll include 40 rounds of 7.62x51 Spanish 1977 production surplus ammo. Need to move this beauty as I'm funding an AR build. - $190 Get it before it's gone! My name is Leif.

The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40 Cal, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments. Trijicon Night Sights Installed.

The ergonomics of this gun are amazing. I doubt you will find a stock compact pistol that feels as good in your hand. Capacity is 8+1. Bought an extra magazine so there are 2 total. Pistol is DA/SA. The only thing that I thought was weird while owning this pistol is there is no slide lock/release lever. However, once you get to the range and are loading/firing like normal it does not make a difference. Only time it makes a difference is when you are messing around with the gun, but even then not hard to deal with. Not in a rush to sell, just like to try new handguns every now and again.

For those who dont know these are very rare rifles, and were imported before norinco and polytech and were used as movie prop guns. Rifle was painted at some some point, green. Some paint still left on the inside of the underfolder. Paint is easily removable without damaging the bluing, as you can see there is no damage as 99 percent has already been removed. I did not want to alter rifle from how I received it so I have not removed anything, but I can easily clean up the remaining paint if buyer wishes. Rifle also has some red plasticy stuff where the cleaning rod would contact the gb, and also between the selector and receiver. Easily removable. My guess is it was to stop the gun form making noise during a movie. Just a guess tho. I did speak with several companies that supply guns for movies and they said that if it was used in a movie it would have been a very low budget movie since its still a operational rifle. One chinese 30 round mag included. Please see pictures. Pm with questions. Price is 1400 shipped, no trades. 

NHM91, has muzzle break and proper chinese rpk style buttstock. someone mounted a sling attachment to buttstock so it has to drill holes. Gun is matching numbers and shoots great, In great condition. I doubt you'll see another one with flash hider and proper buttstock. Polytech drum included, 1100 shipped, 950 without drum

This is a BRAND NEW, never fired, A.A. Arms Pistol, model AP-9, manufactured from 1991 until 2001 in Mint Hill, North Carolina. It is a direct descendant and copy of the notorious Intratec KG-9 from the late 1970s. This was, to the best of our knowledge, the final clone of the KG-9. The KG-9 stirred up some action and warnings from the BATF, an agency that has always been more patient than many of us give them credit for, because that pistol fired from an open bolt. The KG-99 and this pistol, the AP-9, will release the sear from a bolt position that is only about halfway open. While the Intratecs had aluminum alloy lower frames, this one has a rough textured polymer lower frame. It is more ornage than its predecessor, with larger sights and a grooved muzzle barrel instead of a threaded barrel. Weight empty is about 3 1/2 pounds. Barrel length is 5 inches, and the included magazine holds 20 rounds. Magazines for these range from 5 rounds to 32 rounds capacity, and there are a lot of them out there, we just don't know exactly where.

This weapon is by far the most amazing beretta I've owned, and a great piece to carry. If you enjoy the full-size Beretta, you should definitely take a look at this compact. The weapon includes two magazines with aluminum pinky shelf extensions, as well as brand-new houge G 10 Extreme series grips. The weapon is brand-new in box, and has never been fired. I have had the trigger tuned, a brand-new steel guide rod installed, as well as the improved spring package from Wilson combat installed. There is over $150 of work in parts alone. This is the Beretta model M9A1 compact, and because of that it features the integrated accessory rail.

I am in no hurry to move this weapon, and will disregard any lowball offers. I have a few things in mind that I am looking for, and will not respond to offers that are not fair and even. I have ran into some very rude people on arms list lately, so if you feel as though you're going to be rude please do not respond to this thread.

The weapon is new in box and is unfired, in factory new condition. These weapons are not as easy to find as the 92 FS, and I paid $650 for the pistol before I did any modifications. All modifications were done by a local gunsmith who is trusted in his craft.

All factory components, original grips, as well as a holster and perhaps some ammunition will be included in the trade. I may be able to add extras if balance is needed."
