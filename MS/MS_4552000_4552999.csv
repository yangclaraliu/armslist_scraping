In case you are new to Browe Optics, Browe was started by an ex Trijicon employee who played a major part in most of their recent developments of the ACOG the past 15 years. 

The 4x32 BROWE SPORT Optic (BSO) with .223 Crosshair Reticle is a purpose designed and built optic ideal for AR style rifles and well suited for sportsmen, police, and military.  It’s designed and built from high quality precision grade materials and features housing machined from solid Billet 6061-T6 Aluminum, SCHOTT Glass, and FLIR etched mirror reticle.  The BSO is designed to be a light weight and versatile optic.  The BSO is waterproof, fog proof, and military tough enhancing its ability to survive the rigors of field abuse under the most severe environmental conditions.

The BSO features an evolutionary, battery free, Rechargeable Illumination Technology (RIT), which is environmentally friendly and non toxic.   Simply charge the RIT illumination with ANY light source and get hours of low light reticle illumination.  A brief 15 second charge from a high intensity flashlight provides hours of reticle illumination, ideal for those low light situations.  The images below represent the BSO Crosshair reticle daytime black reticle vs. charged RIT illuminated reticle in low light (Green & Blue):

Upgraded trigger and magazine release and other internals.  Upgraded tactical buttstock to make the gun lighter and shorter for tactical use.  Professionally Cerakoted for protection and also comes with seven 5 round mags and mag pouch and brand new case. The trooper could only use 5 round mags that is why he purchased 7.  He only shot the gun at the range twice with a total of 70 rounds.   I've shot only 5 rounds through gun.  He had over $1500 in gun.   Very sharp looking gun and shoots flawlessly.  I have no need for this gun so it just sits in my safe.   I have lowered my price to $900 cash or trade."

Descriptive from the Sphinx website:  
The SPHINX SDP Compact is the multirole pistol that excels in self-defense, tactical duty use, and competition.  One tool, any job.

The SPHINX SDP Compact Alpha is a duty-sized pistol that can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Alpha is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame.  The polymer pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control.  Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Alpha. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight.  Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.

Info from Sphinx USA: 

The SPHINX SDP Subcompact is a lightweight concealed carry, or back up, pistol with design roots from the competition circuit.  Carry with ease, draw with confidence, fire with precision.

The SPHINX SDP Subcompact Alpha is the smallest and lightest of the SDP line up of pistols. The Subcompact Alpha is the perfect choice for concealed carry, or professional duty use, with an overall weight just under 25oz and an overall height and width at 4.9” and 1.2” respectively.  Though the SDP Subcompact Alpha is small in stature it does not sacrifice in quality or performance.Through precision machining and hand fitting by a master gunsmith, the SDP Subcompact Alpha can achieve similar groupings to that of its larger counterpart, the Compact Alpha.The Subcompact Alpha shares more than just high performance figures with the larger pistols in the Alpha line.It also features a steel slide machined from billet.The upper frame, machined from billet aluminum, features full length internal guide rails which provide very smooth slide operation as well as solid barrel lock up.The pistol grip is polymer and textured for maximum ergonomics and grip.The pistol grip is also contoured to offer high hand placement to compliment the low bore axis, which assist the shooter with managing recoil.  Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side.The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Subcompact Alpha.The white dot front sight is easy to see in contrast to the black rear sight.The competition inspired trigger is very smooth, in both double and single action mode, with a clean break and short, crisp, reset.Every component of the SDP Subcompact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight.Defined by precision, the Subcompact Alpha is the only choice for discerning shooters that demand the utmost in build quality and performance."

I want shooters, and will pay appropriately and fairly.  I am not interested in $400 plain vanilla commonplace wartime guns, nor am I interested in anything with an archangel stock you're asking more than a rem 700, overpriced Mitchell's PU sniper remakes you're trying to pass off at 1500, etc.  I don't care if you have Uncle Joe Stalins personal gold plated unicorn killing triple date stamped nazi captured boomstick complete with a letter of authenticity from his mother, I want shooters as defined above. Expect offers to range from $200 for unfired barrels, down to $50 for parts guns, to GTFO for anything with a timney trigger.

This shotgun features a shortened barrel with a Tromix Shark muzzle-brake permanently installed, a Choate magazine extension (8 rounds capacity) and a buttstock that has been shortened into a ""bird's head"" configuration.  The 5500 has a short recoil system that didn't go far back into the buttstock, so the action itself is completely unmodified, and the top-mounted safety is more ergonomic for this grip than button-type safeties are.  This gun shoots great from the hip or from eye level (I've shot in one-handed but wouldn't recommend it to the weak of heart or wrist).

I was in Dick's last Friday and grabbed a box of it, I got to the register and the manager said it went up to $34.95+ tax that comes to $37.57 the manager informed me that it was going up again around the end of July, Im telling you that the Manufacturer's have us by the BALL'S, they know exactly whats going on, they know that they can just about name there price and you will have to pay it if you want to shoot your .22  The manufacturer's are just as bad as the Sorry Ass Gouger's on Armslist, next thing you know it will be over .15 a round... A lot different from when my Grandfather bought me my first Ruger 10/22 in 1964, a box of Winchester Wildcat's was .50 cents... Every one should just stop buying the overpriced crap for a while and send the manufacturers a message, If everyone stops buying it for a while they will drop the prices back down to reality, the pricing has gotten way out of hand and there is no one to blame but the manufacturer's not the Consumer's"

Rail is new and never installed. These things are impossible to find now and the price is going up if you can find one. The AK Adaptive Rail System—AKARS™—is a weapon upgrade that replaces the rear sight leaf and the receiver’s top cover on the Kalashnikov assault rifle, 1947 & 1974 models (AK-47/74) and its variants. While retaining the durability and ruggedness of the AK models, the AKARS™ upgrade allows effective neutralization for many of the AK weapon system's traditional limitations and brings it in direct competition with long recognized weapon systems known for better accuracy—such as the original AR- 10/15 design and its variants, the M16 / M4 models.
Like the AK variants, the installed AKARS™ mounting system works in any environment from casual and competitive to battlefield condition."

Product Description from Manufacturer
ruger The SR-556 offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. The SR-556 employs a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art. The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants.

Every SR-556 is built with a cold hammer-forged, mil-spec 41V45 barrel ensures accuracy and longevity. The smooth, trim, lightweight ergonomic handguard features a flattop receiver with a Picatinny Rail. A 6-position telescoping M4-style buttstock is mounted on a mil-spec diameter tube. Each SR-556SE comes with one Magpul PMag 30-round magazine and a soft-sided case.

This is my Mk25, I've had it for several years and while it's great, I just don't shoot it enough. It's very accurate, 100% reliable for the time I've had it, and has less than 500 rounds through it. There is no holster wear and the finish is perfect on the gun itself. The magazines have some mild wear. It has the standard 4.4"" barrel, non threaded, tritium night sights, and phosphate coated internals and magazine to protect against corrosion. I'm looking for $675, probably not interested in any trades. I will need to take down your information for my records.
