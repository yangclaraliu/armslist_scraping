Lighting Technology


2x CREE XM-L2 (U2) LED


The XT20 is unique in that it not only has two bezels with an XM-L2 LED in each, but this light can offer both a stunning flood beam and a brilliant spot beam. Get both long range and short range illumination at your finger tips. Utilizing the 1st generation tactical mode switch, select from a variety of output levels including the outstanding 1550 lumen High mode which can run for 2.75 hours, 463 lumen Medium mode which can run for 7.25 hours, 30 lumen Low mode which runs for 93 hours, and the 1550 Strobe mode which can last for over 5 hours! If this light isn't versatile enough for you, then check out the extra tactical features that Klarus added into it which come standard with XT series flashlights.



The Tactical Edge


Made For Demanding Tasks


Klarus incorporated its premier technology into the XT20 to make it a truly remarkable light. Not only does it come with an anti-roll tactical ring, a holster, spare O-rings, and a rubber boot cover, but the design of the body itself has been engineered to precise standards. Heat dissipating fins cover the hottest parts of the light and improve overall performance. The handy tactical tail power and mode switches allow for fast operations, and the precision knurling around the mid section allow for a comfortable, non-slip grip when either using the light or unscrewing the tail cap to replace the batteries. Of course, Klarus crafted the XT20 to be in accordance with IPX-8 dust and waterproof resistance standards, so you can dunk it in up to 2 meters of water for a half hour and it will still continue to operate.

The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally new trigger system. The new Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever(installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a new sleek slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry."

I have put less than 1000 rounds through it, cleaned it after each range visit, and upgraded quite a few items.  I added a Tapco muzzle brake to reduce muzzle rise that Colonial Shooting Academy put on for me.  I added a Daniel Defence forward grip, Tapco 6 position adj stock, Tech Sites rear peep site (which is awesome!), I will include 3 mags, one laser bore sighter, original Razor Flash suppressor, original stock, Magpul wedge, Magpul rail ladders and over 700 rounds of ammo.  Included are all original items including RPK windage and distance adjustable leaf site.

Absolutely nothing wrong with it, I just need the money, two kids will do that to you!  This is drastically underpriced with the limited use, all documentation, and numerous upgrades mentioned.  

I have lots of pictures if you would like to see them.

This is a used pistol -- it is NOT an ""OMG LNIB NEVER FIRED RARE"" firearm like you see a lot of on this website. That said, it IS in excellent shape with only normal wear on the barrel. It's had probably 400-500 rounds through it without a hiccup of any kind.

Includes 1 5-round flush-fit mag, 1 5-round mag with pinky extension, 2 7-round extended mags. Also includes additional pinky extension floor plate, medium and large backstraps AND extended mag sleeves, fiber optic inserts for the front sight. Also includes all the XD-S gear that nobody ever uses, but it's all there nonetheless.

Powder River Precision Trigger Spring Kit installed resulting in a smooth 5.5 lb trigger pull. Original springs included if you want 'em.

Comes with detachable box magazine (have a 5 and 10 round mag), 26"" Heavy Barrel with porting and muzzleBrake, blued finish, TacOps Bolt Knob, Mk1 stock in black with gray webbing, Harris Bipod 9-13"", Bushnell Elite 10x40mm Tactical Scope, Factory XMarkPro Trigger, EGW Base, Burris XTR Rings, Zeroed rifle at 100 yards, and inlcudes Plano Double Rifle Case.  Rifle has been fired once by the builder and 20 rounds by me.  I have worked the action many more times to help smooth it out.  Rifle shoots fantastic with very little recoil due to the Mk1's recoil pad.

The stock has an aluminum bedding block and the barrel is free floated and the rifle can be fired right or left handed and is the lightest of the B&C tactical stocks.  

Muzzlebrake - Snowy Mountain Rifle tactical muzzlebrake. This brake significantly reduces felt recoil, by as much as 60-70%. It is designed with no ports or chambers directed down to prevent stirring up dust and to help control muzzle flip. The brake is attached to standard 5/8""-24 threading so it can be removed to allow the use of a suppressor.

Scope - This is the Bushnell Elite 10x40mm Tactical scope with mildot reticle and .25 moa knobs. The scope has a 1"" tube and large tactical knobs with plenty of elevation adjustment. Mounted with a 20 MOA base

Rings and base - This is a Nightforce Standard Duty 20 MOA aluminum rail with Burris XTR Aluminum 6-screw tactical rings.

If you are local, I can arrange for you to shoot it.

Over $2000 invested.  GREAT deal at $1100, I dare you to try and build or find a better gun the price.  Cash only, no trades no I will not sell without the scope, this is a package deal."

Selling a custom built 338-300 WSM long range rifle. No expense was spared in the construction of this rifle. It is a Stiller Precision Predator Long Action with a 20 MOA rail. It is fitted with a 27 inch Shilen 1-9 ratchet twist Select Match #6 contour barrel. It is fitted with an American Precision Little Bastard muzzle Break. The scope is a Vortex Viper 6-24x50 PST FFP MILRAD scope with Vortex precision matched rings and bubble level. The trigger is a Timney adjustable flat blade trigger. The whole thing sits in a Bell and Carlson M40A3 Varmint stock with full length aluminium bedding block and is fitted with Wyatt's bottom metal and extended detachable box magazine.  This rifle will magazine feed with even the longest VLD solid projectiles seated to the lands.

 Being a wildcat the reloading equipment goes with it. Case forming is as easy as taking 325 WSM brass and necking it up to 338 cal. Velocities run about 2800 fps with 250 gr bullets, 2900 fps with 225 gr bullets and close to 3300 fps with 180 gr bullets. It is a very efficient performer. Recoil is very mild and not much more than a 243 win. Total weight is about 12 lbs. You are getting very close to 338 Lapua performance burning 30% less powder in a much lighter platform. 

This rifle has about 100 rounds through it to work up load data for it. With select handloads, it routinely shoots sub 1/2 inch groups at 200 yards. I shot it at 400 yards and it easily out shoots me. I have over $3500 in this rifle. I hate to let it go so cheap but now have other priorities and need to liquidate some inventory. Full build can be viewed here.

Testing the waters to see if there is any interest. This is a Colt Wiley Clapp Commander aluminum frame (4 1/4 barrel). I have owned it for 3 years and am the second owner. I still have the original grips but have replaced them with Wilson Combat grips to keep the originals from getting dinged up. I also installed the Wilson mag well. This gun also has the original sights and has Novak trijicon sights which are still very bright. I know the gun has 700-750 rounds through it. Also with it is the original case, and a galco IWB leather holster. Would prefer to keep my magwell and grips but all that is negotiable as well as the price. Also very interested in a trade plus cash for a Colt Defender or any other Colt auto especially a gold cup. Thanks and feel free to ask any questions."

Has had less than 20 rds down the chamber. One of the most powerful semi auto handguns made the Desert Eagle, IMI 50AE , its in Pristine condition. Satin Nickel brushed stainless finish is the rarest and hardest to find. 1 magazine has the same finish for its baseplate which Desert Eagle doesn't offer anymore. Made in Israel. Not the US models. Much more desirable.  Not to be mistaken for the chrome plated finish.  This finish will last if you decide to shoot it a lot and not just use as a coffee table piece. Will come with over $200 worth of Hornady XTP ammo. $1350 cash for package  firm on that, trade value to me would be 1650.00 easy with being made in Israel, the brushed Satin Nickel finish, excellent condition. $200 worth of ammo included custom grips, and the value of the older models from Israel rising. Very accurate. Have 2 of them so selling the nice one. Can customize it for hunting or just a BA shooter. 
Had some things come up so need to sell the gun. Pricedto sale fast. $200 in ammo with pistol. Shoot it and if you can wait to sell it make some money. Has custom hand grips $160. Different engraving each side Text or email if interested 719-237 one one one 6, can send more pics as well. 

Only traded I would even possibly consider are handguns. Higher end ones HK, Sig, rarer Glocks 2 for 1 or customized ones, plus cash. Full size only as I have gorilla mitts haha.

THE MODEL 92 WAS DESIGNED IN 1972 AND PRODUCTION OF MANY VARIANTS IN DIFFERENT CALIBERS CONTINUES TODAY. THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES REPLACED THE MODEL 1911A1 .45 ACP PISTOL IN 1985 WITH THE MILITARY SPEC BERETTA 92F, THE M9.

THE BERETTA 92'S OPEN SLIDE DESIGN ENSURES SMOOTH FEEDING AND EJECTION OF AMMUNITION AND ALLOWS EASY CLEARING OF OBSTRUCTIONS. THE HARD-CHROMED BARREL BORE REDUCES BARREL WEAR AND PROTECTS IT FROM CORROSION. THE FALLING LOCKING BLOCK DESIGN PROVIDES GOOD ACCURACY AND OPERABILITY WITH SUPPRESSORS DUE TO THE IN-LINE TRAVEL OF THE BARREL. THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO THE COMPLEX TRAVEL OF BROWNING DESIGNED BARRELS. THE MAGAZINE RELEASE BUTTON IS REVERSIBLE WITH SIMPLE FIELD TOOLS. REVERSING THE MAGAZINE RELEASE MAKES LEFT-HANDED OPERATION MUCH EASIER.

A mag full of buckshot contains 50 36 cal projectiles that can be sent downrange very quickly and is a force to be reckoned with by any home invader(s). Hate to let it go this cheap but I gotta put a transmission in my truck so I gotta liquidate some inventory. Dont let this one pass you up! Text me at REDACTED"

This rifle wears a 25 inch magnum contour barrel from ER Shaw and the trigger is as light as one can get a factory trigger. It sits in a Boyds laminated thumbhole stock and wears a Nikon 3-9x40 BDC scope. The action has been worked over and is as slick as they come. The bolt on this rifle has been modified so all after market barrels designed for the small shank Savage 10/110 rifles will thread right on and headspace properly so with a barrel nut wrench and a set of headspace gauges one can convert this rifle to any cartridge using a 30-06 sized rim. This rifle is very accurate and shoots well under an inch with most loads with select handloads shooting under 1/2 moa at 100 yards. Looking for a flat shooting rifle that can reach out there without all the magnum recoil and blast? Look no further! Text me at REDACTED for more details.

Kimber only listed the 6MM PPC special world class single shot target/varmit caliber,  as a factory offering in the Ultra Varmint only, in that year. Kimber built a very few Ultra Varmint rifles chambered in the wonderfully accurate 6MM PPC. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE RIFLES!!  The Ultra Varmint was (and is) a varmint style or target rifle designed to tolerate inhospitable field conditions while delivering consistent accuracy. Starting with a laminated birch stock with a straight comb and no cheekpiece, Kimber added 20 lines-per-inch checkering, a curved rubber butt pad, a widened forearm designed to provide stability, a “medium-heavy” stainless steel 24 inch varmint weight barrel, a matte blue receiver and trigger guard, a three dimensional steel grip cap in matte blue finish, and two post-style sling swivel studs. This example of the Kimber Ultra Varminter is a single shot 6MM PPC with serial number “6PPC458”, the Heavy Barrel has a bead blasted matte finish and  has a 0.6875 inch muzzle. This rifle has the Kimber disc safety and the Model 84 standard bolt, with its Mauser-style extractor and matte blue handle and shroud. A correct one piece, matte blue finish, factory provided and installed  Kimber scope ring base is on the top of the receiver waiting for your choice of scopes. Weight: ~7 pounds 12 ounces. OAL: ~42.5 inches. LOP: ~13 5/8 inches. This rifle is “as new”, and has been shot an extimated 50 rounds.  These  Varmint/target rifles do not come on the market very often, and almost never are they seen in this “almost new” condition. Ultra Varmint examples in the 6MM PPC chambering are very rare.
