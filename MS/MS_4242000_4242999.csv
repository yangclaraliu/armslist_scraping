This is a factory Police Magnum, NOT an Express or Tactical. There are big differences. This one has a Wilson Combat magazine extension (much stronger then the factory police extended tube) and factory adjustable night sights. It was set up originally for three-gun. Round count is 25... like new. What's different about this shotty from the 870 Express or 870 Tactical ? Why do they cost so much more ?

870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.

All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.

All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.

Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.

A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.

A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.

Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.

The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.

The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.

The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization.

The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.

The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.

The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.

Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models. And more...

It is a Mustang XSP purchased brand new by me last month and has only had 100 rounds through it (with 0 malfunctions). It comes with original Colt case, paperwork, lock, and two Colt OEM magazines. 
I like it quite a bit, recoil is mild, accuracy is great, trigger is a crisp 3-4 pounds, and fit and finish are top notch. Unfortunately, due to my current financial situation I am looking to consolidate my calibers.
Therefore, I am looking to make a trade for a Sig Sauer P938 in new or like new condition. I have a quantity of .380 ACP ammo, additional magazines, and/or cash that I can add to make up any price difference. Finish is not a huge deal, but I would prefer a model with wood grips, and would be particularly interested in a SAS model.
I might also consider other pocket 9mm's, like a Ruger LC9s or Sig P290, but I will expect some cash on top. 
I am primarily looking to make a trade, but might also consider a sale, my price is $500 FIRM- these retail for 600-800, so I feel my price is more than fair.
The best way to reach me is by text to 316-619-9eight5four. I have my CCL and can sign a bill of sale if desired. FTF Wichita area only."

The gun is in very good condition and was manufactured in 1972. The stock has a few scratches but is in good condition for its age. The jeweled bolt is in great condition. The barrel has a bit of bluing worn in a small spot but the bore is still really nice. It comes with an older Bausch and Lomb Balvar 8A scope that is currently mounted along with the sling and ~15 rounds of ammo.  I've only shot this gun a few times but it functioned very smoothly when I took it out. I have decided to switch calibers to 30-06 before this hunting season so this gun needs to go.

Looking to purchase a new or used m14 clone, doesn't have to be Springfield M1A, will consider any manufacturer. However, I am strictly looking to purchase a Govt Profile version in wood(walnut is the usual), that is no carbine length, no covered in tactical rails, no DMR chasis, I am looking to buy a straight m14 in its original or G.I configuration. I don't mind doing face-to-face sales or buying from any dealers that may see this.

I'd love to see a norinco or springfield or fulton, but as stated before the manufacturer can be any as long as I can see a picture/ possibly even inspect it myself before purchase.
I'm interested in buying in just cash or money order. Willing to pay MSRP for new or like new products, willing to pay less for used or heavy used, just include pics and we can discuss price from there. 
Thanks,

WASR series rifles are manufactured with stamped sheet metal receivers that were originally intended for single-stack magazines. Featuring hard chrome-lined barrels, side-mount scope rail and wooden stocks, WASR series rifles are commonly imported to the United States by Century International Arms.

At the Century International Arms factory, the rifles are modified to conform with certain United States firearms regulations — in particular Title 18, Chapter 44, Section 922(r) of the United States Code, which deals with unlawful acts related to firearms. For example, the magazine wells are typically widened to accept double-stack column box magazines. Other common modifications include installation of upgraded gas pistons, fire control groups (i.e. trigger), pistol grips, and plastic folding or collapsible stocks manufactured by TAPCO of Georgia.

Older WASR series rifles commonly caused trigger slap, which is caused by the bolt slamming backward into the trigger assembly and causing significant pain to the shooter's trigger finger.[1] Beginning in 2007, Century International Arms has installed the TAPCO Intrafuse AK G2 trigger group, virtually eliminating the trigger slap problem. Rifles with this trigger group will have ""TAPCO USA G2"" stamped on the left side of the trigger. Some of these rifles may exhibit canted front sight blocks and gas tubes.[2]"

The Carbine is an intermediate range ‘brush gun.’ This handy rifle features open sights, a straight comb walnut stock and weighs less than 6 pounds! It’s the only model in the CZ family of bolt action rifles that is chambered for the popular 7.62×39. This cartridge is a top pick for younger shooters for its low recoil and effectiveness on medium sized game such as deer or wild boar out to 200 yards. Both cartridges offered in the 527 Carbine model are economical to shoot given their service rifle heritage.
Built to CIP specifications, our 7.62×39 chambers are ideal for shooting steel-cased surplus ammo. Designed to shoot .311 bullets, some American brass ammo may not perform as well as the imported steel-cased variety because of SAAMI brass dimensions and varying bullet diameters.
   We have 3 in stock, and have them priced to sell quickly for just $629 each.  Action : BoltCaliber : 7.62mm X 39mmBarrel Length : 18.5″Capacity : 5 + 1Trigger : Single SetSafety : ThumbLength : 37.4″Weight : 5.87 lbsStock : WalnutFinish : Blue"

402,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4242402,For Sale:  CZ 75 B 40th Anniversary Limited Edition (#70 of 1000),"East Bend, Winston Salem, North Carolina","$ 1,500","Listed On: Monday, May 4, 2015",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Product Description
During the forty years since its 1975 introduction, the CZ 75 has grown to be one of the most important handgun designs in history. Over the last four decades, the 75 became the most widely used handgun among police and military worldwide and ranks in the top two most copied handgun designs ever. To celebrate the anniversary, CZUB set their master engraver, Rene Ondra, to the task of creating a special pistol for the occasion. Each pistol is hand-engraved in the Czech Republic in true old-world style, with a hammer pushing the engraver’s tool through each minute detail of the art decorating the slide and frame, which are then polished and finished in a deep, glossy blue. The controls, extractor, grip screws and magazine baseplate are finished in a rainbow titanium nitride, an attractive and extremely tough finish. Lest there are any concerns about the durability of this finish, this is the same type of finish that is applied to drill bits to extend their working life up to three times those without the coating. To finish off the look, smooth, high-grade California birds-eye Maple grips are added. Dyed to match the hues of the frame and controls, the grips seem otherworldly, looking less like wood and more like a snapshot sent to Earth from the Hubble Space Telescope. Chambered in 9mm, the 40th Anniversary Limited Edition ships in a leather-bound presentation case with two 16-round magazines. Only 1000 pieces will be produced, each individually numbered and accompanied by a certificate of authenticity. (The certificate of authenticity was not put in with the 1st batch of these guns, however the buyer will be able to get one fron CZ when CZ gets those in. This was told to me by CZ customer service)We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

 The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

They measure .355"" diameter. You can see in the pictures that they are all hollow points of different styles. 
Two of the bullet types are 115 grain and one is 147 grain.

I have for sale:
1,460 of the 9mm-115 grain hollow point with canelure. $195
290 of the 9mm-115 grain hollow point $35
575 of the 9mm-147 grain hollow point $85

$300 cash or best offer for the whole lot of 2,325 bullets. Comes to about .13 cents a bullet. Considerably less than Hornady XTP's. 

Pick up in University Place along Bridgeport Way W. between 27th and 40th st.

Please contact me if you need more pictures or clarification of which is which.  

Thanks,
Doug"

I want to trade my Glock 43 flat magazine finger base for your Glock 43 Magazine Finger Base.

I'm hoping someone who just got a Glock 43 wishes they had two finger bases vs. flat bases. Cause I sure wish I had two flat finger bases instead of 1 flat and 1 finger. If so then lets trade!

My magazine is new. Will trade w/ someone who has one that is new or like new. I just have to say that otherwise I will meet up and the person who wants to trade will have a week old magazine that looks like its 10 years old that has been free dropped onto rocks and concrete and is all scratched and chipped up...."

Anyway, I'm happy to pay FFL fees and whatever more we need to negotiate for a used Stoeger Cougar chambered in .45 ACP, with the Weaver rail on the dust cover.  Used.  And I'm not picky.  If it's dinged up, it's just going to get Cerakoted sooner or later anyway.  

If it's broken, though, we don't need to waste any time.  It can be well-worn and weather-beaten but it must be in working order.

The Barrett 82A1 stands at the pinnacle of firearm design, and has been proven in long-range accuracy, ruggedness, and dependability in any environment (military or civilian). The low recoil and self-loading action of the 82A1 created it’s own hallmark! If you are anything like me, the more that you research the engineering that goes into the Barrett Model 82A1, the more you will be inspired by the close tolerances and meticulous engineering that has gone into every single part of this gun. It is unparalleled.

I was so overwhelmed by Barrett’s development of the Model 82A1, that I got this rifle to hold onto. I am the sole owner, and this rifle has remained new and unfired, to this day. It has been well maintained and stored in climate-controlled conditions with thorough cleaning and lubrication regularly. I NEVER intended to sell this beautiful gun, but must now due to financial necessity.

If you are unfamiliar with the Barrett Model 82A1, please watch some of the You Tube demonstrative videos of this rifle. There simply are NO Comparables.

The Swarovski Optik high-performance scope is made in Western Austria by Swarovski; a family business that was established in 1895 after Daniel Swarovski invented the first electric grinding machine for jewelry stores. In 1935, Wilhelm Swarovski pursued his passion for astronomy and built far better optics for telescopes than the world had ever seen. This gave rise to Swarovski Optik, a company that still stands firmly behind their products. I believe this to be the best scope, atop the best rifle.

The Pelican 1750 case for the Barrett Model 82A1 is built like a tank, and is specially designed for the 82A1. It is watertight, crushproof, and dustproof, and comes with a Lifetime Guarantee of Excellence. It measures 53” Length X 16” Width X 6.12” Depth, and is made of polypropylene with stainless steel bearings. It comes with a side handle, end handle, and roller wheels.

I cannot bring myself to piece out the gun, so I am selling it with all of the accessories. EVERYTHING IS IN NEW CONDITION. This includes everything detailed in the attached photos, including:
