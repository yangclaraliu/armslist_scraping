I have a stock 10 round, a bx 25 Ruger mag , A 30 round after market 30 round , and a 50 round drum made by pro mag runs good no problems. i would say its about 9.5/10 also a great gun

My 3rd gun is a Revelations it shoots. 22 Longs , Shorts and Long Rifles its now owned by marlin bolt action it was gifted to and its in excellent condition very accurate i cant recall how many rounds i put through this rifle since ive had it but less than 100 rounds of CCI with no malfunctions at all i have an 8 round mag to go with it . nice gun id give it 9.5 out of 10 i dont know very much about this rifle but its old and doesn't have a serial number so does not require ffl.

Throughout the world today, Colt's reliability, performance, and accuracy provide the confidence required to accomplish any mission. Colt's LE6920 Carbine shares many features of its combat-proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this carbine is its 16.1"" chrome-lined barrel. With a 1 in 7"" twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited, including the heavier bullets preferred for stopping power and long range. This rifle has an A2 style pistol grip and 4 position adjustable stock. It has a ""F"" marked front sight gas block and an adjustable, removable rear sight.

The SOCOM model offers several operational upgrades over the already competent 6920. It features a heavier profile barrel for more accurate shooting, and cooler operation under sustained fire. A quad rail hanguard is fitted for easy installation of tactical lights, lasers, and bipods. The ambidextrous safety makes operation for anyone.

This is a brand new, never fired rifle, but does appear to have some minor quality control issues from the factory. There are several scuffs on the handguard, though they are purely cosmetic and will not affect functionality.

GUNTEST magazine did a three way comparison test of pistol caliber carbines between a Hi Point, a Beretta, and a Ruger and the Hi Point came out on top; lots of good reviews on this carbine to be found online. I bought this carbine brand new a month ago, and haven't had time to shoot it, so I am letting it go.

322,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1852322,For Sale:  Accuracy International AX308 Rifle,"colorado, Colorado, United States","$ 2,500","Listed On: Sunday, July 7, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"The AX308 sniper rifle from Accuracy International inherited the best features of the Accuracy International AW series rifles and improved on many others.
Fixed butt pads are standard with target adjustable and quick adjust butt pads optionally available. The trigger is an adjustable two stage mechanism that allows a large sear engagement until the first stage is taken up. The rifle has a three position safety mechanism. The safety will only operate when the bolt is cocked. The 20mm diameter steel close fitting bolt features an integral short throw bolt handle (60°) with large bolt knob which lies close to the stockside just above the trigger. The bolt can be field stripped without tools for cleaning.
The AX308 action uses a double stack 10 round magazine. Magazine Surfaces are toughened and finished with a multi-part anti-corrosive, anti-friction coating. This military grade steel magazine combined with the revised chassis design makes loading faster and more positive without lifting the rifle. The Accuracy International AX308 forend rail system is free floating in either 16"" or 13"" featuring a keyhole slot system for quickly and securely attaching modular rail sections. Full length picatinny rails in flat, 20 MOA or 30 MOA options match the action rail.No Trade."

This gun is not showroom pretty. If you're looking for a pretty collector's gun then hit the back button because this isn't it. This is a gun for someone who sees a gun as a tool.. and this tool kicks ass and will make you look like it's not your first day on the range. If you want something minty fresh then go to Shooter's World and buy a cookie cutter S&W M&P 15 that'll look like everybody else's gun. If you want to have something unique, well, then keep reading.

The only markings I can find is the .30 on the receiver, and a matching serial number on the barrel and receiver. I have read that when some of these were refinished the crests and other lettering were scrubbed, and I believe that is what this is. If you notice on the rear portion of the mag well, on the front of the receiver there is a little notch cutout. This was done in the 30-06 conversions to accommodate the longer round and stripper clips of the 30-06. It is sitting in an aftermarket Monte Carlo stock that has seen better days. All in all it is a pretty cool rifle with a nice solid action. The price is firm, and I will only meet in the Canton area as I am not driving at this price. Any questions please ask. Thanks for looking."

 This new “Heavy” 44 SPL load is designed for use in all 44 SPL handguns and rifles, except Charter Arms Bull Dog. Likewise, it is safe for use in all 44 magnum chambered firearms. This Barnes X type bullet will expand on flesh and bone and penetrate more deeply than most expanding lead core bullets of the same weight. Expect roughly 16 to 18 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone.

We’ve utilized a flash retardant powder so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire should he need to “drop the hammer” in low light. Since nearly 95% of all civilian shootings in the US occur in low light, when the criminal element is active, low flash powders can give an enormous tactical advantage to the user.

As always, Buffalo Bore uses real, over-the-counter firearms to determine our published, real-world velocities. We prefer not to follow the industry wide, duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory test barrels to generate exaggerated velocities that the ammo user will seldom, if ever see. With Buffalo Bore you will know what velocity your ammunition is generating in the real world, where it matters."

BATF rules say this system is completely legal for civilian use as
long as you do not use it for high explosive or gas projectiles.
It comes in a Hardigg hard case which can double as a handgun carry case.
Charges or shells are not included from the manufacturer but they are available from many sources. If you can find one these kits go for over $600.
With it is a CM203 Cobray 37 mm launcher designed after the military 40 mm M203. There are some differences such as a charging handle, while the M203 cocks when you close it and a safety switch which the M203 does not have. Otherwise they mount and operate much the same. Again this is perfectly legal according to BATF and are not even considered firearms. They are classed as flare launchers.
These will mount not only on the AR15 platform but other rifle systems as well with
the correct rail system, such as the AK47.
Both items are like new but used. There is a small amount of non-pitting corrosion on the housing above the trigger housing and a prior owner had applied a bead of epoxy
along the top of the forgrip. Ten minutes with a dremel will make it disappear. The reloader is missing the tube cleaner nylon bristle brush but you can substitute a baby
bottle brush.

I wanted to list them here first to see if any fellow gun enthuasists would be interested. 1) 1974 VW THING. I bought to restore. Has no body damage, except for a rusted out area in the right rocker panel in front of the wheel well. The battery must have leaked in the past. I have a new gas tank for it, as the old one was rusted internally. Needs brakes repaired. Body needs sanding, paint. etc.   2)  1974 VW BUG. I drove this for years. Three years ago I replaced all ball joints, front shocks, all steering components, wheel bearings, brakes, rear hub bearings, adjustable rear shocks etc, etc. Car is stock and runs very well. The only real repair it needs is the tubes from the brake fluid reservoir to the master cylinder leaks.  3) 1985 VW WEEKENDER CAMPER VAN.  I drove this all over the country. Has body rust above both rear wheel wells, interior upholstery dry rotting due to age and sunlight. Still very good driver. All of these need work, that I just never have had the time to do, because of family matters I have to take care of. I hate to see them just sitting, but I realize I will not be able to start on them for a long time. I paid $ 7500.00 for the Thing, will let it go for $ 5000.00 or trade. The Bug for $1500.00 or trade. The Van, $ 1000.00 or trade. I'm flexible and don't have to sell because I need the money, I just hate tto see them sitting. I would be interested in trades for AR platforms, bolt action rifles, pistols, ammo, etc. Let me hear your offer, and see if a deal can be worked out. Thanks."

gen 4 glock 19, born october 2012, 600rds thru it, 200 of which the RMR was attached, all flawless


slide milled by Mark Housel at L&M Precision for the RMR


Atop the slide is a Trijicon RMR RM-02 8moa LED (used for 200rds of ammo thru the glock, was new before that)


Ameriglo BUIS installed (scratch on right side of rear sight, nothing I ever actually notice tho)


Gen 3 17 smooth trigger and trigger bar


Zev Tech 3.5 Connector (best drop in connector I've ever used, and only one I will ever buy for glocks now)


Zev Tech Type R trigger return spring (lightens pull even more, but retains a nice, positive reset)


Vickers Tactical Gen 4 slide stop


Grip Plug (can't recall brand but theyre like a 7$ part)


Dale Fricke Seraphim RMR AIWB kydex holster, RH, tan, 1.75"" loops


Trojan Tactical brown kydex mag holster, RH, 1.75"" loops


Trojan Tactical Bandito brown kydex minimalist holster, RH, 1.75"" loops


THREE gen 4 15rd mags 


THREE gen 4 33rd mags

Factory Glock box with factory accessories

original trigger bar/dot connector/slide stop 

This is gen 4 with swappable backstraps, double recoil spring for smoother shooting, and new grip. 

If you were to buy this new, the gun (a gen 3 tho so 50$ cheaper, mine is gen 4) from onesourcetactical.com, is 1400 with one mag. The holster from dale fricke is 95$, the Trojan tactical holsters are 45, we all know how much Glock 33rd mags are going for and there are 3 new ones included, the trigger work already done, you are adding all these up to 1600$ plus dollars. Taking a little off for being lightly used, 1500 is the trade value. 



Very accurate gun, keeps them all on a 3x5 at 25 yards with my sorry butt shooting




Trades either combined or with boot added:









Multiple guns is better than one gun and lots of boot






I don't need the money, so I won't accept crappy offers or trades. If it doesn't sell or don't find a good trade(s), then I keep it and maybe try again later. It is a freaking sweet pistol. I just have an itch for a CZ that I'm currently saving for, this would just speed up the process."

Lee Perfect Powder Measure is best for reloading rifle cases, can also be used for pistol cases. Can be used on the included bench mounted stand, or used in conjunction with the Universal Charging Die on the Load Master.

Best for reloading rifle and pistol cases:
Throws charges from 2 to over 100 grains. Eliminates Cut Powder and Jerky Action. A soft elastomer wiper strikes off the metering chamber rather than cut the powder. You'll be surprised at how smoothly the rotor operates. More importantly, you will enjoy the most uniform of charges.

Meaningful Calibration: 
A micrometer adjuster that reads directly in cubic centimeters. Just multiply the charge in grains by the cc for one grain and you have the setting. So very much better than a meaningless setting as most supply.

Versatile:
The metering chamber is the proper size for large rifle charges and the strike off opening small enough to work well with pistol size charges. The Lee Perfect Powder Measure works fine for charges from two grains to over 100 grains.
