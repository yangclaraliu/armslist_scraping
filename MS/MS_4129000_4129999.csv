Looking to trade my .45 Rock Island Armory 1911 Match. This is RIA's Top-Of-The-Line custom fit model that competes with other 1911's costing more than $1k. Think of it as RIA's take on the Springfield Armory TRP. This is not a cheap 1911, but a tight and right example of the design.

The Match distinctions include:

-Match grade barrel
-Extended Beavertail
-LPA Elevation/Windage adjustable rear sight
-Fiber Optic front sight
-Full length SS guide rod
-Ambidextrous safety
-Lightened trigger w/ 4.25lb trigger
-Flared & lowered ejection port
-Polished feed ramp
...and more

Included:
*Pistol as shown
*Original case
*SIX 8-round magazines (only two are pictured. 3 ACT, 3 Chip McCormick)
*Wilson Combat extended slide release


Shoots very well, and in good shape. Has some light scratches/wear in the finish along the front/bottom of the slide from use, not abuse(closeup pic).

Here's a review:
http://ezine.m1911.org/RIAMatch.htm

FWIW, Lowest new price I've found is $650 online - with only one mag included. This means $730 to $750 after FFL fees and tax. 
(MSRP for everything new is $880) 

Located in Seattle, though I make frequent trips down to Tacoma - can meet at FFL of your choice in Tacoma, Seattle or in between (as fits my availability) 

Only really looking for a nice P220 w/ SRT or DAK. Preferably a full size and/or an Elite.
Or HK 45 Compact (HK45c) with the LEM trigger. Cash added where appropriate - I place the trade value at $750."

The lower is a billet piece by C3 Defense with OD Green CMC flat bow drop in trigger. Upper is a WMD nickel boron coated upper with WMD nickel boron BCG and BCM Gunfighter charging handle. The rifle has all OD magpul furniture, flip up rear sight and sling mount. The optic on the rifle is a cheap eo tech knock off which really doesn't affect the value of the rifle either way. Also has a Powertac light and mount. As far as acessories It will come with Od single point sling, black molle rifle bag, 1 Od green windowed pmag, 7 other pmags( two connected the magpul maglink), two gen3 pmags still in their packages. I have somewhere around 300 rds of ammo that will go with it. The rifle still has less than 1000 rds through it and shoots smooth and flawlessly.

188,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4129188,For Sale:  1915 Ithaca Double Barrel Shotgun SxS Flues Model Grade 1 in GC Ejectors,"SW Portland, Portland, Oregon",$ 750,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 11, 2015",Shotguns,Ithaca                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Side by Side                                                                                ,Shotgun,"For sale is my old Flues Model Ithaca double-barrel SxS full-choke shotgun manufactured in 1915. The “L2” found on the gun’s watertable indicates the gun is a 12-Gauge. The “L” printed above this means the gun is a Grade 1. On several occasions Ithaca used an “L” to signify a “1.” The serial number is 260894 and this number is visible on the receiver, barrels, and the forearm. The receiver is stamped L2 along with a maker's mark. There is also a stamp that declares the gun as nitro powder approved. The barrels themselves are stamped with ""Krupp Fluid Steel"". The receiver has decorative engravings, as does the trigger guard, and there is a bird dog flanking both sides of the receiver below the breach. The stock is in VGC overall with some scratches and dings. The stock decoration/carving is in VGC appearing crisp and without much blemish or damage. The black Ithaca company butt-end-piece on the stock is VG and recognizable, again with sharp edges and without much wear for a 100-year old shotgun. After loading and shooting, move the lever to the right to break the barrels from the receiver and the ejectors will pop the empty spent shells from both barrels. Reload and snap the barrels back into position for your next round. The safety/fire mechanism has three positions, and this has control from the previous shot. If the safety was forward it returns to the middle safe position on reload automatically, if the safety was back then it remains ready to fire upon reload. You can slide the safety forward or back to fire from the middle position, but for safety the safe mode is the middle position and it works. 

 The last time I fired it was about 6 years ago to shoot some trap. It performed very well then, with the ejectors and safety still working. The gun has remained idle since approximately 2009 and has not been fired recently. The receiver maintains some of the original bluing finish. 

I will pay to transfer ownership of the gun to buyer at Tigard Pawn Shop."

Sorry to bother folk if this ad is not up to terms,  but I could use help finding a gun.   A few years ago, I had a pistol stolen from my truck along with several other items.   I reported it to the police in Missoula, MT, but nothing has turned up.  So,  here is my plea.   Figured the wide open internet could help.

The Gun stolen was a 1963 Hi-Standard “Double Nine” .22 cal pistol.  Model W-104, made by  High Standard MFG Corp.   Hampton Conn.  USA 
Serial Number is 1597662.   The pistol has rosewood grips, as the plastic stag grips long ago wore out.   It has a brass trigger guard that is well worn on one side.   There is a spot on the barrel where the bluing has worn away as well.     Pictures are attached,  but naturally,  the quality wont win first prize.

This pistol belonged to my Father, and was bought new for him as a kid by my Grandfather, who is no longer here.   I have kept my eyes open,  but have had no luck, nor have the cops.  I really would appreciate any help anyone could give.    I will gladly pay a reward,  ask no questions how it was obtained.  I just want this piece of family history back.    Its important to me.
I will be posting this ad in other states as well,  looking to get the word out.    If anyone knows anything, or has acquired this gun,  please let me know.

This historic niche, coupled with the fact that Randall pistols are exemplary specimens of their genre, has made every single one of the 9,968 Randall pistols eminently collectible.
Among Randall's many trend-setting innovations were two of the most significant breakthroughs in the 1911 field since John Moses Browning designed that form of semi-auto in the first place. One of these breakthroughs came when Randall made the very first production pistol of its kind in stainless steel.

	Hey everyone, 
	This was sold but something came up so it is back available for trade/sale. This is a great little pocket or tackle box gun. This is a Sundance Industries 25 ACP Pistol. Unlike most of the pocket pistols this one has both a grip safety and a push button mag release. I had this out at the range recently and it shot fantastic. 
	This would be a great starter pistol for someone to learn on or just a cheap tackle box or truck gun to have around. It has some paint missing on it, but it is what it is. I would also trade for 7.62x39 HP ammo or 7.62x54r ammo. Would consider guns as well. Honestly, just shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. 
Thanks for looking and have a good one!

The Gun stolen was a 1963 Hi-Standard “Double Nine” .22 cal pistol.  Model W-104, made by  High Standard MFG Corp.   Hampton Conn.  USA 
Serial Number is 1597662.   The pistol has rosewood grips, as the plastic stag grips long ago wore out.   It has a brass trigger guard that is well worn on one side.   There is a spot on the barrel where the bluing has worn away as well.     Pictures are attached,  but naturally,  the quality wont win first prize.

This pistol belonged to my Father, and was bought new for him as a kid by my Grandfather, who is no longer here.   I have kept my eyes open,  but have had no luck, nor have the cops.  I really would appreciate any help anyone could give.    I will gladly pay a reward,  ask no questions how it was obtained.  I just want this piece of family history back.    Its important to me.
I will be posting this ad in other states as well,  looking to get the word out.    If anyone knows anything, or has acquired this gun,  please let me know.

Serial Number is 1597662.   The pistol has rosewood grips, as the plastic stag grips long ago wore out.   It has a brass trigger guard that is well worn on one side.   There is a spot on the barrel where the bluing has worn away as well.     Pictures are attached,  but naturally,  the quality wont win first prize.

This pistol belonged to my Father, and was bought new for him as a kid by my Grandfather, who is no longer here.   I have kept my eyes open,  but have had no luck, nor have the cops.  I really would appreciate any help anyone could give.    I will gladly pay a reward,  ask no questions how it was obtained.  I just want this piece of family history back.    Its important to me.
I will be posting this ad in other states as well,  looking to get the word out.    If anyone knows anything, or has acquired this gun,  please let me know.  

Thank you all.

This Glock 37 in .45 G.A.P. is in excellent condition. It has had approximately 120 rounds fired through it.

For those who prefer large-caliber handguns, the GLOCK 37, in .45 G.A.P., represents a quantum leap forward in big-bore technology. This ideal, all-around pistol is a winner because it delivers power-packed performance in a standard framed handgun. The G37 is the answer to big bore muzzle flip and high velocity recoil.

I had someone ask about the availability of .45 G.A.P. ammo. It is readily available from many local gun shops; however, it is also widely available online at prices comparable to .45 ACP. 

This .45 G.A.P. is one of the most accurate pistols I've ever shot ! The ONLY reason that I'm selling it is because I need to switch to the department standard caliber which is .45 ACP. Thats the ONLY reason !

Trade interest are:

.45 ACP Glock or 1911 style pistols.

.45 Colt, .44 Magnum, Or .454 Casull hunting revolvers.

This gun was once used by the Norman, Oklahoma, police department  and bears the department's crest on the side plate. I have recently (last week) replaced the old Pachmayer grips that were on the gun with new Houge grips. I have taken this gun apart completely and oiled, cleaned, and polished the internals. The gun functions flawlessly as a revolver should. The only problem with this gun is the rear sight, which is missing. It can be easily replaced for around $50. This is truly a beautiful gun, pictures cannot do it justice. Please text/call me at REDACTED."

It's time to add to my collection of Smith and Wesson revolvers - I collect all Smith and Wesson revolvers but I am especially interested in the following:

- All Performance Center revolvers

- All .357, 10mm, .40, .41, .44, and .45 caliber revolvers

- All S&W revolvers made in the 1960s or before

- Ti, Sc, or PD revolvers

In all cases I am not interested in anything with a built in lock.

I collect, and I also shoot, so I am interested in any condition from broken guns only good for parts, to brand new, unfired examples never removed from the box, and everything in between. I do not deal or resell, so I'm only interested in buying guns that I plan to keep, and I am only interested in agreeing to a deal if we are both happy with the terms. I prefer to pay cash, but if you would rather like to trade, I have various Colt and S&W revolvers, a Les Baer 1911, and a Noveske AR available.

 Description:

 Beretta Benelli Mobil Sporting Clay Choke Tubes

 Carlson's Sporting Clays Choke Tubes are made from 17-4 stainless and precision machined to produce a choke tube that patterns better than standard choke tubes. These choke tubes feature a 25% larger parallel section in the choke, thus throwing more consistent patterns than conventional choke tubes. Lead, Copperplated, Nickel Hevi-Shot™, Bismuth, Tungsten or Steel Shot may be used in these choke tubes. For best results, pattern your choke tube with the specific shotshell load you will be using in the field. Different ammunition patterns differently from the same choke tube."

This was part of a deal for something else.  It's a nice clean little rifle, but I have enough .22 rifles so I'm offering this one for sale.  It has one magazine, the manuals, the box (right down to the plastic bag) and a lock.  

I'm not the first owner and the the only thing I've done with it is clean the barrel and chamber and wipe it down.  I did run a few snap caps through it to check it out and it cycles rounds well.  

The cleaning basically got the packing oil off it which suggests it's not been shot much if at all.  The bore is clean and shiny with good rifling (makes sense since it is very nearly new).  

The price might have a little flex, but it's not costing me anything to keep it and I'm noticeably under other asking prices on this site.  If you pay full ask I'll include 50 rounds of .22 ammo.  

Must be Ohio resident, legal to buy, of appropriate age (ID will be checked and a receipt will be required), CCW preferred."

I have about 3 ounces of scrap gold I'm looking to trade. Most is rings and chains. All but 2 pieces is stamped with its purity. I Have acid tested all of the gold. The marks are correct. Here's a list of what I have.....

10k gold: 1.155 grams
12k gold: 16.700 grams
14k gold: 85.810 grams
16k gold: 4 grams

Calculated down to melt value of pure gold in ounces: (weighed with a standard scale, this is not Troy ounces, just standard ounces.)

10k gold: 0.0154. $17.94
12k gold: 0.2683. $313.56
14k gold: 1.6070. $1,878.11
16k gold: 0.0858. $100.16

Total market value: $2309.77

For a cost of about $100 it can be smelted down to a bar of pure 24k gold in the weight of about 1.9756 ounce. Market value of it is about $2300 depending on when you do the calculations. 

With gold value always changing I'm setting my trade value at $1600. If I get a chance to take my gold to the smelter before trading it off the price will change. I just wanted to try listing it before I smelt and ell it outright. 

No I will not just sell the gold as is. My plan is to try to trade it or next week I'm going to smelt it and have it poured into a solid 2 ounce bar.

Now for what I'm looking for. I'm really looking for guns, AR's, bolt actions, lever actions, pistols. I will also trade for ammo, reloading supplies, gun safes, hunting equipment. As for specifics..... I'm looking for a 458 socom, 50 beuwolf, 338 federal, 454 casull revolvers, single action 357's, Winchester model 70's, Remington 700's, 1911's, 338 lapua, long range 308 or 300 win mag.
