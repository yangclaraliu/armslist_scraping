You must meet me at the Marksman gun range located in Puyallup and pass a background check because it is no longer legal to sell firearms privately in the State of Washington. The process is simple, it is $35 for a firearm transfer that I will cover.If you are looking to get an m1a and put a scope on it this is perfect and in great condition. I had a gunsmith place the mount and scope. Asking $1400 cash for the complete package, this is a great deal and you can take all the time you want inspecting the rifle.

216,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4404216,For Sale:  Fully Processed (Trimmed/Chamferred/Deburred) AND Primed .223/5.56 Brass - x1082 Pieces!,"Lexington, SC 29072, Columbia, South Carolina",$ 80,"Listed On: Saturday, June 6, 2015",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"You are purchasing >1000 Piece of Once-Fired (Approx 90% was fired from my own AR-15) .223/5.56 brass. I recently stopped reloading and this is what I had prepped already so I could just throw in some powder and a bullet and go. This is fully processed once-fired brass. Everything was run through a Small-Base .223 reloading die so they would chamber for an AR-15. They were trimmed with a Lee Trimmer and chamfered/deburred using my Lyman Case Prep Xpress machine. I used a VLD chamfer on the inside so bullets slide in much easier without ripping the plating. This is brass that I use for my AR-15 accuracy runs, not some quick cheap processing so I could turn around and resell them. 

Primed: These are primed with CCI #450 Small Magnum Rifle Primers. These are one of the best to use because they are hard to prevent detonation from the BCG due to the firing pin in an AR-15 going into battery and touching the primer. If you reload for AR-15s pay attention to this. There are very few primers like the AR-15 Federal Match primers or these that anyone recommends for an AR platform.

All of the brass has been divided by headstamp. 95% is Lake City, year 09/10/11/13/14. There are a little under 100 of FC/PMC.

Pricing: Current market puts 1000 once-fired military brass around $75 Shipped. The primers were approx $38 after tax. I'd like to get $80. I would consider that highly fair considering the amount of hours of prep and the care that was taken on these cases."

If you are looking for things in trade, not firearm related, even better. Let me know what you are looking for, and I just might have it. Partial or full trades considered. 

Message me or text REDACTED with what you have, asking price, and if anything you might consider in trade. I don't have a lot of gun related stuff to trade other than a in wall security cabinet and a couple small pistol lock boxes. The only firearm I have to possibly trade would be my Ruger SR45, and that would only be for a really nice shotgun.

Refurbished and factory inspected for wear and damage in March 2015. Brand new carrier, elastic, etc. Comes with a surplus Monarch Level II blunt trauma pad 5'' x 8'' for the front pouch. Vented sides. 3/4 of an inch gap between front and back for ventilation during hotter months. Bought it because the IIIA is a full wrap and it gets too hot in the summer.

Will fit a medium sized guy. I have a 38'' chest and a 37'' in stomach and the elastic is in it's normal default position. Plenty of room to go either way. Larger guys may lose some coverage on the sides. Really big dudes should probably buy a bigger vest. Remember optimal vest position is to cover the lung, the spare lung and the heart as well as a few of the other internal organs. Mine is sized to come to just above the belly button while standing so I can draw my sidearm, magazines etc. I am 5' 10'' / 170 lbs.

Vest has been worn once. I could send it back to Bulletproofme for a full refund but I'd rather it go to a local, law-abiding citizen who needs some protection.

Selling because my wife surprised me with a brand new Point Blank IIIA vest with vented sides for my birthday. No longer have any use for this one.

If you are unsure whether NIJ Level II meets your requirements I recommend looking it up. 

You could go to Bulletproofme.com and buy this exact set up for $220+$25 Trauma Pad +$20 shipping. And then wait for it to arrive. All respect to Bulletproofme but I'd rather save $80 and get it immediately.

Remember this is BULLET RESISTANT. This will not turn you into Iron Man. High caliber weapons can still penetrate. Multiple hits can penetrate. Something weird could happen and a bullet could penetrate. Wearing body armor is not a guarantee of survival. By purchasing you acknowledge this and accept all liability for what might happen if you get into a firefight.

Cash only, pick up is public parking lot Kroger Monroe & Secor in Toledo 43623.

By purchasing you acknowledge you are legally allowed to own body armor / bullet resistant materials and have no plans to export it or sell it to known felons or criminals."

I bought it two weeks ago along with a Ruger LCP to compare them and choose which one to keep.  Both of them have worked flawlessly and it’s been a tough decision but the LCP feels just a little better in MY hand so I’ve decided to sell this one.

This is a polymer frame gun…very light and it’s easy to make it disappear in any pocket.  The Taurus TCP has one major feature which the LCP doesn’t have and that’s last-round-slide-hold-open. When the last round in a mag is fired, the slide locks open telling you the Taurus TCP mag is empty.

The TCP is an outstanding pocket-carry design with a very smooth trigger. Its light weight (10.2 oz.) with a comfortable grip makes it an outstanding concealed carry gun. It's easy to pocket carry and just disappears in your pocket or purse.  It’s identical in size to the Ruger LCP but feels a bit softer to shoot than the LCP.

The full package comes with everything that came with the gun from the factory: original box, Taurus locking system with keys, all paperwork, and the 6-round magazine supplied by Taurus.

I’m also including an extra factory 6-round mag that I had purchased.

The serial number begins with “513...” and ends with “E” indicating this is a recently manufactured gun.  The Taurus lifetime warranty travels with the gun, not just the original owner.

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping. Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with valid TN driver’s license or permit.

If I don’t respond to your email immediately, it only means I’m at work and I’ll respond soon after I get home. If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.

I’d like a cash sale but I'll also consider a trade for a .22lr handgun or a double-barrel 20 gauge shotgun in decent shape.  Let me know what you have.

Sorry, but I’m not looking for low-ball offers. Thanks!"

I purchased the pistol new in late 2013, and have carried it off-and-on since I purchased it.  This combination of gun and holster proved incredibly effective during the summer last year, and the holster is comfortable anywhere on your belt (including appendix carry).   I've loved it as a CCW option, but it's time to clear out the gun safe, and I can live without it.

The pistol has around 500 rounds through it, probably less.

These guns are made in Turkey and imported through Briley and Academy Sports and Outdoors in Texas.   For warranty claims and repairs, the guns are sent to Briley in Texas where American gunsmiths work on them. 

I purchased this gun new in October 2014 for $430 from Academy.  I've fired 100 rounds through it on the trap field, and it handles quite nicely.  It has no cosmetic flaws and, other than the shortened stock, looks brand new. 

The action on this particular gun has been polished and properly lubricated to ensure smooth and easy function (not as smooth as a Beretta, but at 1/6 the price, it is perfectly pleasant).  If you've handled one of these off-the-rack, you'll know that the action is unpleasantly stiff when they're brand new (and if you didn't know that, be forewarned:  off the rack, these things are atrocious and really need work).    This particular gun has had these issues resolved, and is field-ready.  The gun is fitted with a walnut stock and handguard.  

The receiver is aluminum, so this shotgun is lightweight, and kicks like it.  I had a professional gunsmith shorten the length of pull by 1.5 inches, and install a Limbsaver recoil pad. 

If you're a serious clay shooter or bird hunter, you'll probably scoff at these imported Turkish guns, but if you are just looking to add a good-looking and functional O/U 12 gauge to your collection, this is a tremendous value (especially with the action work and customization). 

Shotgun is sold with two Briley Skeet Tubes installed ($40-value/each)
This shotgun also includes the 5 factory choke tubes (ranging from Cylinder to Full).

Prices are for cash, and are firm. 

Will meet face-to-face in Atlanta area, or ship via FFL at your cost."

Henry's have one of the smoothest actions of any lever-gun manufacturer, and this .22 lives up to that tradition.  This was my first lever gun and my first Henry, and I loved it so much that I now own 2 more in centerfire calibers. 

The gun is in perfect working order, and is cosmetically almost as good.  The pictures show some scratches in the powder-coating on the receiver cover.  I spoke with Henry's parts department and this can be replaced for $40.  I never bothered because once I got the centerfire guns, I never took this out of the safe again.

This gun has a 7 round magazine capacity.

As you can see in the pictures, this gun is not a safe queen (or, at least I didn't build it with that intent).  The gun has been duracoated, and there are some significant signs of finish-wear on various parts of the gun.  The gun's original finish is intact, but the duracoat has worn down over the last 5 years.  

This gun is ready for home/homestead defense, camping, or tactical work.  The action is flawless, and I've never had a malfunction while shooting this gun.  I know it's a little ugly, but it's been meticulously maintained and has no rust or any damage to the original finish or metal. Mossberg 500's are legendary for their value and dependability, and this one's no different.  

Some of you will like the worn tactical camo look, and some of you will think this thing is ugly as hell.  I happen to love it, and if you like the well-worn look, I think you will too.  

The price on this gun reflects nothing more than the wear and uneven finish.  The gun is in perfect functional order, and has never had any issues. 

Prices are for cash, and are firm. 

I can meet face-to-face in the Atlanta area, or I will ship via FFL at your cost."

Rarity index scale (1 to 10, 10 being the most rare): 1 - Very common; easily available on ebay, google product search and almost every knife selling website. Spammed with at least 10+ listings on ebay. 3 - Has been around for at least 2 years and are selling reasonably well, with retailers favouring other newer models over this knife. 5 - Knives that are on the borderline of being discontinued or have been discontinued for less than 6 months 6 - Products from 6 onwards are either discontinued or limited edition. 7 - Discontinued knives that pop up once every few months on the ""For Sale"" part of forums or on ebay. Still can be found at a few online shops though. 8 - Knives that need lots of researching to find. Not available anymore in online knife shops and pop up (if you're lucky) >4 months for one at a time. 9 - Knives holding this rarity are the shadowy kind. You can't find any information on them at all (not even from online knife shops that have not taken down that knife's product page). If you see one for sale grab at all cost. 10 - The rarest of all knives. If you hadn't been here you wouldn't even have known that it existed. Should you have one of these you better lock it up in a triple-combination safe and treat it like a family heirloom..."

I'm also open to trades just to have something new. Not into hunting guns or shotguns and don't need any carry guns. Mil-surps are great like a couple of Mosin 91/30s or one plus ammo, SKS (would do Marlin plus all ammo for a nice SKS), Enfield, Webley, K31, whatever. Just no Mausers as I don't have any 8mm. Would also like a GI clone 1911 like an Auto Ordnance or RIA. Let me know what you have 'cause anything is possible and plus/minus cash okay. And please, I stay up on values so let's not waste each other's time!

*We are the only ones who offer to sell to the public. Anyone else who proclaims to sell them are not being honest with you and or are ignorant in what they are selling. Our Armor is certified, tested by the Military. Tested by us and are legitimate. We take pride in the quality of the craftsmanship of our products* The armor fit majority of plate carriers. Upon Request I will coat the plates if you want.

*Note: If you should decide to contact me please be a serious buyer and someone who is interested. You are only cheating yourself if you are someone just wasting my time. Anti-Fragmentation coating will be applied to Armor Upon Request. Not only does this help to protect against fragmentation it also reduces the impact. I have taken it out and tested it has proven to be very effective. Shot at it 20 yards with 9mm and .45 and at 50 yards with a 223/5.56 rounds it had stopped the fragmentation.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 5. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up.

Rossi Single Shot Rifles combine simplicity, accuracy and practicality in a rifle built for generations of shooting enjoyment. Each of these rifles is equipped with a scope rail and hammer extension that accommodates all popular optics. The heavy barrel models are button rifled for extreme accuracy. Rossi varmint rifles and their standard profile counterparts all feature a black synthetic stock with removable cheek piece and are equipped with Rossi’s soft recoil pad and distinctive white line spacer, button rifled barrels, adjustable fiber optic sights and sling swivels. Centerfire models have an extra wide positive action extractor to ensure easy removal of the spent case when you open the breech.  These rifles combine four safety systems to make them as safe and enjoyable as possible. The Rossi single shot rifle incorporates a transfer bar mechanism that stops the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the hammer has been cocked and trigger has been pulled completely rearward. This helps prevent accidental firing from drops or impact. All Rossi rifles incorporate our breech lock system, which prevents the action from being opened or closed when the hammer is cocked, along with our manual hammer block safety and Taurus Security System. Over 100 years of firearms design has taught us that safety comes first and foremost. Every Rossi full-size and youth-size rifle is equipped with fully adjustable fiber optic sights and are drilled and tapped to accommodate the Rossi scope mount base. These single shot rifles are perfect for training first-time shooters, fun and affordable target shooting and all types of hunting. This youth model is chambered for .243 and the 2nd sho gun barrel is 20 gauge 3”.  All youth models come standard with scope mount base and hammer extension. Youth models come standard with removable cheek piece.

The combo also comes with a canvas bag with carrying strap. Manufactured in a brand new facility owned by Taurus in SaoLeopoldo, Brazil.

Rossi Single Shot Rifles combine simplicity, accuracy and practicality in a rifle built for generations of shooting enjoyment. Each of these rifles is equipped with a scope rail and hammer extension that accommodates all popular optics. The heavy barrel models are button rifled for extreme accuracy. Rossi varmint rifles and their standard profile counterparts all feature a black synthetic stock with removable cheek piece and are equipped with Rossi’s soft recoil pad and distinctive white line spacer, button rifled barrels, adjustable fiber optic sights and sling swivels. Centerfire models have an extra wide positive action extractor to ensure easy removal of the spent case when you open the breech.  These rifles combine four safety systems to make them as safe and enjoyable as possible. The Rossi single shot rifle incorporates a transfer bar mechanism that stops the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the hammer has been cocked and trigger has been pulled completely rearward. This helps prevent accidental firing from drops or impact. All Rossi rifles incorporate our breech lock system, which prevents the action from being opened or closed when the hammer is cocked, along with our manual hammer block safety and Taurus Security System. Over 100 years of firearms design has taught us that safety comes first and foremost. Every Rossi full-size and youth-size rifle is equipped with fully adjustable fiber optic sights and are drilled and tapped to accommodate the Rossi scope mount base. These single shot rifles are perfect for training first-time shooters, fun and affordable target shooting and all types of hunting. This youth model is chambered for .243 and the 2nd sho gun barrel is 20 gauge 3”.  All youth models come standard with scope mount base and hammer extension. Youth models come standard with removable cheek piece.

The combo also comes with a canvas bag with carrying strap. Manufactured in a brand new facility owned by Taurus in SaoLeopoldo, Brazil.

You can see from the photos that this gun is in excellent shape.  It has exactly 76 rounds through it, just enough to check function.  As expected, it performed flawlessly.

I bought it about a month ago and I really wanted this gun to work for me but my hand doesn’t fit the gun the way I want it to (I blame my hand, not the gun).  That’s a shame because it’s an outstanding design and every inch a Glock.  Its slim profile makes it great for concealed carry.

The full package comes just the way it came from Glock, including factory box, factory lock with keys, cleaning rod and brush, and all paperwork that came from the factory (as shown in photo).  I’m adding two extra factory magazines to the two mags supplied by Glock (all 4 mags have Pearce pinky extension floor-plates installed; the original flat floor-plates are included as well).  I’ve also added a Hogue “Hand All” grip.

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with valid TN driver’s license or permit.

I’ll certainly take cash, but I’d like to trade for a Ruger LC9s (either standard or Pro model).  That’s about the only trade I’m interested in at this time.

Matrix Aerospace AR10 308 upper lower matched receiver sets. This receiver set is the newest version from Matrix Aerospace. It has been redesigned to accept the latest Generation 3 (M3) PMAGS, while still accepting all DPMS style magazines, and Magpul Gen1 and Gen 2 magazines as well. Take a look at the cover of Guns and Ammo for December 2013 and we think you will see a shocking similarity between the cover gun and these receiver sets. It’s because the Ruger 762 is made by Matrix Aerospace and they even use the same model numbers stamped on them.
