I purchased it a couple of months ago and only have about 300 rounds throughout it.  I am only looking to get rid of it because my hands are massive and I can't consistently shoot this pistol well.  I have replaced the cheap guide rod that Ruger includes for a machined stainless steel one with better spring from Galloway Precision.  The holster is the Simply Rugged Cuda with IWB straps.  The holster can be worn OWB strong or cross draw or IWB.  There is also a magazine holder from Simply Rugged.  These guys make some of the best practical gun leather out there and are a great company to support.  I have approximately 125 (or more) of ball 9mm ammo that will be included.  It comes with the original box, a 10 round, and a 17 round magazine.  The holster has never been carried and is brand new.  It goes for $80 and the magazine pouch is about $30 new.  

I will sell the pistol, holster, and ammo for an even $500 cash.  I prefer to trade for a Ruger SR1911 in either full size or the smaller commander size.  I would also be willing to do a partial trade or full trade for a 1911 from a reputable manufacturer.  I am located near Harpers Ferry but can travel a couple of hours if necessary for the right deal.

You must include your phone number with your inquiry, or I will not respond.

For sale is a like-new Canik 55 Stingray C compact 9mm pistol (about 300 rounds down the pipe, no failures), imported from Turkey by Century Arms International.  If you're looking for an ultra-light sub-compact pocket pistol, this is not the gun for you.  If you want a reliable, accurate, concealable pistol you can comfortably shoot all day, then read on.

The Stingray-C is patterned after the CZ P-01 Compact (not a true clone).  It is a robust all-steel construction, that employs a slide that rides inside the frame, for a lower center of mass and lower bore axis, with very manageable recoil.  It is a very well-made pistol, with well executed fit and finish, and no sloppy tool marks anywhere, inside or out.  The trigger is smooth in both DA and SA, with a nice clean break in SA.

It features ambidextrous manual safety and slide release, 3-dot sights, a Picatinney frame rail for lights or lasers, grip serrations on the frontstrap and backstrap, and on the front of the trigger guard, a prominent loaded-chamber indicator, and a 1911-style frame-mounted manual safety (up is safe, down is fire), with a firing pin safety that blocks the pin until the trigger is fully pulled.  You can engage the manual safety in any hammer position, and fire in DA mode from hammer down or half-cocked.  SA from full cock.  There is no de-cocker, but the hammer is easy to manipulate.  You can safely carry in cocked-and-locked, or hammer down on a loaded chamber.  There is no magazine disconnect safety.  

This pistol comes with two factory 15-round magazines, a 14-round CZ 75 Compact magazine (fits flush to bottom of grip), with after-market exotic hardwood grips.  It is 7.0 inches long, 5.0 inches high (5.25"" with factory grips, see photos), with a 3.4"" barrel.  The finish is a polycoat over black phosphate, and most internal parts are black-chrome plated for wear resistance.

Check the reviews online, they are all very positive.  The best you'd do buying new is about $315 (Bud's guns), plus FFL tran$fer, $10 background check, about $35 for the grips, and about $25 for the CZ magazine.

Cash only, FTF transaction, Wisconsin residents only, ID required.  No felons.  No kidding, I will check.  Nothing personal, I just don't need the legal hassles.

I travel often, so I may not reply immediately, but I will respond to your PHONE NUMBERS in the order in which they are received."

We took everything that we expect from a firearm light and made it better. The O2 BEAM™ uses patented O2 Technology™ to achieve a beam of light so impressive - you’ll have to see it to believe.

OPTIMIZED OPTICS (O2)
The natural tendency of light is to disperse into infinite directions. We use optics to help us focus the light’s intensity in one direction. The Optimized Optics bends the light closer toward the center of the beam. The result is a hotter, brighter spotlight with the lowest power consumption in its class.

The 5.56 Carbine Quad Rail 16"" Upper is a standard M4 style upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

Upper Receiver: A4 Flat-Top. Billet

Barrel Length: 16""

Barrel Contour: Carbine M4

Barrel Material: Voodoo Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel
finished with our proprietary QPQ Melonite process inside and out. Unlike hard chrome and magnesium phosphate, Melonite is a molecular bonding process with the metal. It allows the chemicals to seep down below the surface area of the metal, instead of just adding a top layer. This means that the barrel can be cut to a true rifle bore while maintaining complete corrosion resistance and virtually no wear. It also means that the protection offered is not just a thin layer on top of the material but actually penetrates layers deep ensuring that it does not wear off. Now you have the velocities of a stainless steel true rifle bore with complete protection! You can out last a chrome lined barrel and shoot with the accuracy and efficiency of a stainless steel barrel, all without breaking the bank

1937 Tula Mosin M91/30PU Sniper - Factory Reproduction (New PU Scope)
Importer PW Arms, Redmond WA

Dark barrel with well defined lands and groves and no visible rust or major pitting - in decent shape considering it was probably used in battle by about 100 Russian conscripts. Little or no rust spots throughout this rifle, still has a bit of cosmoline here and there.    All numbers match - no number on scope.

Stock and barrel has not been bedded, barrel has not been re-crowned, scope mount was not yet adjusted, nor has any bolt or trigger work been performed - still looks to be a decent shooter for a 78 year old Mosin used in war.  

Scope it looks to me to be brand new from Factory ... No other known markings or date other than shown.  So, this is not an original dated scope based on the pristine condition, however the scope mount appears to be original. The optic came from the factory importer and is NOT a Firefield reproduction.

No mechanical problems, no cracks in the stock or wood anywhere, no missing parts.

Make this a project gun, or use as a 100 yard pie plate plinker as is. 


Includes Rifle, mount, scope, sling, cleaning rod ( not pictured ), ammo belt pouch and 880 sealed rounds of 7.62x54R.

I do not really want to let this one go, however I Need CASH for another build project -- no 100% trades -- at least 90% of any deal or trade has to be in cash.

The SLR-95 is regarded as among the best along with the SA-93 and SLR-96 because they were the only 100% Bulgarian made rifles ever imported. All other Arsenals have some U.S. component to them. These guns also have CHF Chrome-lines Steyr barrels, making them incredibly accurate. The SLR95 is outfitted with a 90 degree gas block and an AKM front end.

These guns are rare, but what puts this one on an entirely different level is that it is unfired. Made in 1997, this gun has managed to spend nearly 20 years unfired and occasionally cleaned so that it maintains its collectors value.

Here are their identical mates from the manufacturer, ACT-Mag s.r.l. of Gardone V.T., Italy. Exclusive importer is PSI of Klarides Village, CT. These are superbly finished blue steel magazines with chrome plated steel cartridge followers and high impact polymer floorplates. Each magazine holds 8 rounds of .45 ACP / 45 Automatic ammunition. Like their chief competitor Mec-Gar, they lock the .45 open when it fires dry like they’re supposed to; they free-fall eject like they’re supposed to, and most important, they hold spring strength and function reliably in all manner of environmental conditions and even when left loaded for months at a time. This magazine will fit any 1911 type pistol that is chambered in .45 ACP caliber, from Colts to Llamas and Norincos. Our single magazine price is $29.00.

CONNECTICUT residents must furnish us a copy of your CT Eligibility Permit or ammunition certificate.                This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of additional magazines we have on hand at the same per-mag price and no extra shipping.  Photos show genuine factory Smith & Wesson Magazines for the M&P .45 Smith & Wesson Pistols chambered in the venerable .45 ACP caliber. The M&P Pistols haven’t been in service long enough for us to get many of them or their magazines, but we do frequently trade with other dealers; and we trade and buy from police officers and our customers throughout the country. The photo specimens came from a 5 year tour of duty with the Distinguished Officers of the Agawam MA Police Department. Construction is serrated body matte stainless steel with black polymer floorplate and followers. These will work in any Smith & Wesson M&P 45 Pistol; these fit flush on service size variants but will protrude a bit on the Compact Variants. Each magazine holds 10 rounds of .45 ACP caliber ammunition. These magazines themselves show the most significant of Smith & Wesson’s improvement upon Gaston Glock’s design; these magazines hold together, free-fall eject, and always lock the slide open just like they’re supposed to, something that cannot be said for Glock pistols and their magazines, admirable though they are. Surface wear on these comes more from carry in unlined leather magazine cases than from insertion and ejection. We estimate each one has been fired 300 times during annual qualification. We rate them as Very Good, but photos ought to suffice for our shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Replacement pricing on these in our area is in the $60 range, and they’re not easy to find at that. Our single magazine price is $29.00. We’re offering the magazines in the photos, however, or their substantially identical mates from the same Department, in lots of 3 or more at $23 each.

I just bought this gun about a month ago and have only 483 rounds fired. Flawless in performance and function. I have everything you get when purchasing new (manual, test fire casing, 2, 7-round magazines, 3 different recoil springs, lock & NRA stuff). I am selling because I would like to get another Kahr (the Kahr T9 with Night Sights to be specific).

When he saw it, he was thankful but really didn't want it. So it has sat in my closet. I was just starting to look for a stock set when I decided to just put it up for sale.

A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. 
The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints. 
Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions."

The PT-911 shows Taurus innovation and German influence at the same time. Taurus took its Beretta Compact type frame and installed a shorter, sturdier slide with looks akin to the German Sig Pistols. Here is Taurus’s PT-911 in blue steel and black anodized finish, with a straighter, thinner grip frame on the order of Beretta’s Vertec frames for shooters more comfortable with a pared-down grip frame compared to the relatively fat feeling 92 variants. Manufacturer is Forjas Taurus of Porto Alegre Brazil, and Importer is Taurus International of Miami. Type is compact traditional double and single action semi-automatic; construction is steel barrel, slide and parts mounted on a matte finished alloy frame; grip frame is traditional and serrated fore and aft. Height is 4 15/16 inches from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the magazine floorplate; and 6 15/16 inches from the muzzle to the end of the grip frame strut. Minimum frame thickness is .740, with a maximum slide thickness of 1.07 inches. Frame is equipped with an integral Picatinny or Weaver type rail for optical, laser and light accessories. Magazine capacity is 15 rounds, 15+1 total capacity. Barrel length is 4 inches according to the box label, but 3 3/4 inches by our own measurement. This pistol comes furnished with two blue steel finger rest floorplate Taurus factory magazines; and any Taurus 92/99 magazine will fit into this pistol with some protrusion. Ambidextrous Frame Mounted Safety levers also serve as decockers, to safely return the hammer to its resting, double-action-ready position. The pistol, like all Tauruses with frame mounted safeties, is also capable of cocked-and-locked, single-action-first-shot carry. Current replacement pricing on the PT 911 is upwards of $500 per unit in our area, if a person can even find one. We’re offering the PT-911 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 349.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts.

Buyer must show CHL, no trades. Comes with box and all paperwork.
Thanks for looking.
I'm in Russellville, but travel to Paris most weekends. Don't want to drive too far out of the way, and I will not ship the gun. Local sales only.
Price is $550 FIRM, lower offers will be ignored as I feel this price is fair."

Trigger is .350 polymer with center lever, pulls at a smooth 5 pound vicinity with 1 inch of travel. The Ruger SR9, writes the factory, is sized to be comfortable and controllable with a slim, ergonomic grip and a narrow slide. The structurally rigid, recoil-reducing, glass-filled nylon frame and alloy or stainless steel slide combine to create a low-maintenance, rugged, and reliable handgun. The SR9 features a modern blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, and a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator. In addition, the SR9 has a unique reversible backstrap (flat or arched), an adjustable 3-dot sight system, an ambidextrous 1911-style manual safety and magazine release, and a built-in Picatinny rail. The SR9 weighs in at 26.5 oz.

Figure a full box of 50 wadcutters is $28.00, and a full box of PDX is 28.00 for 20. you are getting about a half a box of total rounds including 7 personal defense rounds, so I'd do 15 bucks for the lot which is 20 dollars worth of bullets. In this climate any discount is a good deal.

This is a vastly better handgun for most purposes. All of us love and respect the Ruger Single Six revolvers. The Convertibles, however, cannot produce accuracy with Long Rifle ammunition. Not so, however, with the Winchester Magnum Round. The Convertible Single Sixes have always been bored correctly for the larger diameter bullet that the magnum carries, and a good many of us noticed the superb accuracy years ago. Here, then, is Ruger’s new KNR69M, the Stainless Single Nine. Manufacturer is Sturm Ruger of Newport, New Hampshire. Construction is entirely stainless steel, only with black anodized, bifocal friendly green fiber optic dot, windage and elevation adjustable rear sights, and matching screw-on ramp front sight. Barrel is 6 1/2 inch, 1:14 twist. Grips are factory Ruger laminate wood. Type is Single Action Only Revolver with transfer bar safety mechanism. Hammer is .290 serrated spur stainless, with .300 smooth faced trigger. Capacity is 9 rounds of .22 Winchester Magnum ammunition. Weight empty is 39 ounces, with center of gravity at the front trigger guard junction. Each Single Nine comes in its factory box with all its papers, massive Ruger padlock, and fired brass envelope.

This is the Taurus Model 66, product code # 2-660049. Its 7 round capacity was as much an influence on the parent Smith & Wesson as an effect from Smith. Sights are classic Red Ramp front and adjustable White outline rear. More traditional than the 686, the Taurus's barrel lug has a nice smart bevel that brings its styling closer to the Smith & Wesson 66. Satin Stainless .385 Hammer and smooth combat trigger are both closer to classic 1970s S&W configuration, and the patented Taurus internal lock is the least conspicuous of its kind on any revolver. Weight empty is a superbly balanced 39 1/2 ounces. Grips are factory Taurus Combat grips, superior in fit, function, and recoil absorption to the Michaels grips that are standard issue on many S&Ws. Caliber is .38 Special and .357 Magnum interchangeably. With the Smith & Wessons commanding prices well above $700.00 apiece, this Taurus 66 Stainless 4 inch full lug 7 shot model 66 is an exceptional value at only $ 519.00.

Does have some holster ware, but honestly it's a Glock it's not in a beauty contest. I'd you are looking for a glock to shoot, carry, keep on the bedside, or throw in the truck this is that gun. It's a glock made to go bang every time you pull the trigger and that's just what this gun does. Need further reason to make this your next gun?

It is in excellent shape and would possibly pass for new. Looks like it was never issued. Only shot once at the range and it did great. Not a single problem to report. Felt recoil is very low and the gun is accurate. 

Two magazines are included with the gun and the box it was shipped in.

The trigger pull is very smooth. There is no magazine block meaning that the hammer can be dropped with the mag out of the gun. These guns fire 8 round single stack magazines with 1 in the chamber for a total of 9 shots fully loaded.

I am only selling because I am saving up for a new car. Otherwise I would keep it. 

If buying locally I will include a full box of 50 rounds.

If you have a C&R license I can ship directly to you but it will probably cost a large amount since UPS will demand next day delivery. 

Otherwise we have to meet in person. 

In order to buy this you need ONE of the following: 

1. Concealed Carry License 
2. Pistol Purchase permit
3. C&R license 

I do not live in Asheville but rather, over an hour away. Google my location and see what you think. I can meet in Sylva if you prefer since its closer. 

I have a little bit of wiggle room for negotiation.
