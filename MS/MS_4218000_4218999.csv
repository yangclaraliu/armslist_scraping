Here is the Wikipedia description for my rifle. In the late 30s to early 40s an unknown number of Type38 rifles were converted into ""Cavalry Rifles"" at Nagoya arsenal, that did all rebuilds of Type 38 and Type 44 rifles and carbines.[10] The barrels were shortened to 635 mm (25.0 in) from the standard 794 mm (31.3 in) barrel and the stock shortened to match the barrel while the handguard retained its original length.[11] The end result is a Type38 which is similar in size to the Type99 Arisaka. The designation as a ""Cavalry Rifle"" is unusual as at that time the cavalry branch was in decline and it's far more likely these rifles were issued to second line troops instead.[12] There is no consistency to serial numbers or arsenal marks as the rifles were converted from existing stock. Although total production is unknown, it is estimated to have approximately 100,000 converted. 6.5 Japanese is the calibre. The front left ear of the front sight is broken off, but it does still have the original 2400 meter sight from before the conversion. 375 cash/400 trade Also note that the stock is not cracked, it was made that way as they often were in Japan. Also there was never a mum stamped into it as this was issued to a training school as indicated by concentric circles after the serial number.  These received no mums as the Imperial Army rifles did."

Remington Predator 223 Remington w/22"" Fluted Barrel & Mossy Oak Brush Stoc A dream to handle, our compact Model Seven Predator is officially every predator and varmint's worst nightmare. The new Model Seven Predator weighs in at 7 lbs. and is decked from butt to bore in Mossy Oak Brush camo to surpass your needs for mobility and concealment. Much like our legendary Model 700 action, the Model Seven platform will amaze you with its accuracy right out of the box. The predator's fluted, magnum-contour 22"" barrel promotes awesome long-shot repeatability and cools quickly when the action heats up. Speaking of hot, the lineup of calibers, including our 17 Remington Fireball at 4000 fps is sure to light'em up. Our X-Mark Pro trigger system delivers a level of shot control and crispness unrivaled by any other factory system. And the rugged synthetic stock features an R3 recoil pad to dramatically enhance shooting comfort.

These holsters are made with over ten years of experience in the Private Security Fields of Executive Protection, Close Protection in high threat environments as well as a background as a tactical weapons and shooting methotds instructor. (Including Center Axis Relock ""C.A.R.""). Until very recently I was only making holsters as custom orders for Security Companies and Individual Contractors, Law Enforcement, Tactical Training Agencies and of course friends. 
I have recent;y moved back to Glenwood Springs and can now offer (Customs in the area). 

My guarintee:
I put a lot of time and effort into each holster, nothing I do is line manufactured as I have never once personally found anything line produced that I was actually happy with so why would I offer junk?
I guarintee that my holsters (Kydex & Rivets) will last, if there are ever any retention problems I will replace it or fix it if I can safely. I do not guarintee any of the loops or hardware that get installed, I can suggest my favorites to anyone backed by experiences but I will not take responsibility for anything not of my own manufacture. 

A holster means the difference when it comes to your life, the lives of your friends, co workers, family or just the people next to you... Make sure the holster you carry day to day is worth your life and not the savings to your pocket book!!!

This pistol does shoot but cylinder has about a 1/8 inch play when hammer is back all the way. When hammer isn't back then cylinder will free spin in one direction so not being a gunsmith I would say to you that it should be looked at and fixed before it gets regular use again. If I can't get at least $200.00 for it then it will go into a shadow box and will be displayed on my wall like some of my other old guns are.

Here's a super nice black powder commemorative revolver! Sold by the United States Historical Society, this is the ""SAM HOUSTON PISTOL / TEXAS SESQUICENTENNIAL"". It is an exact, firing replica of the famous Colt Model 1847 Walker revolver. The Walker revolver was the largest and most powerful repeating black powder handgun ever made. The Walker was named after Captain Samuel Walker, a renowned national hero who fought (and died) in the Texas-Mexico war and who was instrumental in the development of this revolver for use by the early Texas Rangers. This commemorative is dedicated to Sam Houston, the first President of the Texas Republic. Houston was the key figure guiding the destiny of Texas and securing freedom from Mexico. A very large handgun, the Walker tips the scales at nearly five pounds. It fires a .44 caliber bullet and has a 9-inch barrel. The revolver is finished in highly polished blue with lots of 24-karat gold decoration. The cylinder depicts the famous Alamo, has a portrait of Sam Houston, and also a vignette of Houston at the Battle of San Jacinto where his small army defeated Mexico's Santa Anna and secured Texas' independence. Scroll that includes the Texas flag, Texas lone star symbol and other designs adorn the balance of the gun. The smooth walnut grips feature a medallion bearing the likeness of Sam Houston. Condition is excellent, as new, and the revolver remains unfired, the gun is gorgeous! It comes in the specially designed solid walnut case with embossed leather top. The crimson velvet interior of the case is specially fitted for the revolver as well as a powder flask, bullet mold, nipple wrench, and cap tin that is stamped with the outline of Texas. The case is lockable (one key included) and has storage compartments for bullets, etc. Comes with white gloves. Original issue price of this revolver was $2300.00 in the early 1980's. Has a few dings on the wooden box but inside is pristine. Gun is in excellent condition!"

Caliber is .32 S&W or .32 S7W long. (Both fit.)

Yep, some period target grips here! When I got this one, I had every intention to get a set of original or reproduction grips for it. I never did, because they are so darn comfortable. They seem professionally made, and are fitted perfectly. This was going to be my kit gun, but I never get all that much time to roam around in the desert anymore, so it can find a new home. 

It's basically a gray gun, but lockup is tight and it's quite accurate. The patina is pleasant to my eyes, and it has been there and done that for somebody for over a hundred years. It seems to be zeroed for about 40 yards to me, but my son shoots it to point of aim at 25. 

I have only ever shot PPU wadcutters in it, so those loads are very mild. I did take a jackrabbit with it last winter. Aimed at its front elbow, and hit it in the head. My son thinks I am a good pistolero, and I don't ever try to dissuade him. ( In other words, a luck shot.) it's a fun little I-Frame S&W with a 4 1/4 inch barrel.

This is a nice shooting, tight little S&W, At over 100 years old, it's ready to go another hundred.  this ammo is once again readily available locally (Petersons had a BUNCH of it last week.) I can toss in a box of ammo for it for another $25 if you don't feel like going to the store.

Email me through Armslist or call/text at REDACTED to see it in Santa Fe.

Thanks for reading my ad. You will like this little revolver.

Description

With a long history of innovation Sharps Rifle Company (SRC) has done it again!

After developing the most technologically advanced AR-15/M16/M4 bolt in the world Sharps felt compelled to develop a bolt carrier unit to complement it.

We began by identifying what the shortcomings were with the traditional AR-15/M16/M4 bolt carrier. We identified two primary issues. The first being the rotational camming of the carrier during the unlocking portion of the operational cycle. The second being the canting of the bolt carrier group upon firing due to the gas pressure exerted to the gas key which naturally causes the front of the bolt carrier group to rise and the rear of the bolt carrier group to be pressed downward during its rearward travel.

Armed with this knowledge our team of innovative engineers set about to correct those shortcomings. We used computer design technology coupled with real world testing to address both of these issues. When the process was completed we sent the resulting prototypes to a broad spectrum of professionals who use their rifles hard for their personal evaluation and feedback. Their observations were then incorporated into the final design resulting in the new SRC Balanced Bolt Carrier (BBC).

The Sharps BBC is precisely machined from S7 steel which then undergoes our proprietary heat treatment process. Finally the BBC is finished inside and out with NP3 to minimize the need for lubricants, to aid in smooth operation and to make clean up a breeze. The BBC has the SRC logo machine cut on the side of the carrier which is visible when the ejection port door is open. It fits standard AR-15/M16/M4 rifles chambered in .223/5.56mm, 25-45 Sharps and 300 Blackout calibers.
