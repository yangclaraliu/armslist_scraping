This is a great gun and caliber for Deer or Hogs, the gun has a 16"" barrel so it is a perfect truck gun or youth rifle especially with the muzzle brake allows heavy 220 grain bullet with less recoil than a .223."

MSRP 	$333.00
The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. 


The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.

I will allow a very serious buyer to test fire and verify fit, function and condition of the weapon before transacting. Fit and finish are superb, no wear at all except for the normal paint wear on the barrel from firing, weapon was only used at the range and as a home defense handgun. No steel cased ammo has ever been through the weapon, only Federal and Winchester brass cased ammo. This is NOT a red box Sig Sauer refurbished unit. The date of manufacture is March 28, 2009 and was purchased brand new with lifetime warranty from Midwest Guns in Lyons, IL. The product code is E29R-40-BSS.

72 hour wait, must have valid DL and FOID. Bill of sale will include FOID TRANSFER APPROVAL NUMBER in accordance with 430 ILCS 65/3(a-10).

Here is an interesting read from ar15 message board:

“One issue you really need to look into before purchasing a new Sig is the ""long extractor' which was added on the newer guns along with full rear serrations and the E2 grip. The original extractor was the ""short extractor"" and many reports are out there that the newer extractor isn't as reliable and many new P229's internal slide to barrel fit is out of spec. causing jams/malfunctions.”

I already have a heavy full size .357mag revolver so I really don't need this gun since I don't like carrying it.

Unlike an Airweight or an LCR, recoil is hardly noticeable when shooting .38spl and minimal when shooting .357mag.  I've had it to the range twice, totaling 100 .38spl and 50 .357mag rounds.  I take good care of my guns, and this has been cleaned after each time shooting and wiped down once a week since I carried it.  It's a model 640-3 with the lock, and the S&W test fired cartridge envelope is dated 07-17-14.  I bought it new at Vance Outdoors.

Included with the gun is the box with all factory contents, a Galco Sto-N-Go IWB holster, and a box of 25 Hornady CD .357mag ammunition.

I'm asking for $550 cash.  This price is firm and generous given the like new excellent condition of the firearm.  I will not travel outside of I-270 and ask that buyer present a valid ID at time of sale (CHL preferred).

I will consider trades and/or trade/cash combo.  I'm interested in service size 9mm pistols.  I already have a carry pistol, so I'm not interested in subcompact guns."

I purchased the rifle through the CMP in 2009.
In late February 2015 I sent the rifle to a local armorer to give it a good inspection and it came back with a great report card!

It is a 1952 born Springfield rifle with a complete HRA trigger group (all other parts are Springfield). TE of 3. ME of .309. The Op rod spring is strong and like new. The trigger breaks at 5 lbs 8 oz. Wood matches, is a nice dark color and is in great condition (also has the aiming device for firing grenades mounted to stock). Like I said, this rifle has a clean bill of health and received great marks from the armorer. 

Asking for $1,000 (based on armorer's appraisal and recent inspection) 

Included with the rifle will be the reproduction leather sling, reproduction carrying case, CMP certificate of authenticity, armorers inspection sheet from Feb 2015, field manuals, 5 bandoliers with cardboard inserts, 30 en-blocs and about 150 pieces of once fired Federal brass.

I live in Flagstaff, AZ and would prefer to sell locally simply to eliminate the hassle and expenses of shipping, insurance and FFL fees. With that said I am willing to drive to meet with a buyer in the state of Arizona.

Please read the entire add before contacting me.  The truck runs and drives, and will tow just about anything you can throw at it.  The truck has no rust, as it was a Washington State truck and has only seen 1 Indiana winter (which it did great in).  Has 7.4l 454 and 4l80e auto trans with engine oil cooler and trans cooler.  In the last year I have replaced top engine seals, tie rods, radiator, brakes, New Alpine Stereo with sirius satellite radio (nice one cost 600, have receipts), and I am sure I am forgetting things.  The truck has had the oil changed every 3000 miles and has been running full syn.  The truck has power everything, cruise control, cold ac, hot heat and all works as it should.  The bed has rhino bed liner.  The interior is 9/10, and has upgraded tow package with 15k hitch.  The tranny has about 80k on it since rebuild, odometer reads 200xxx and will go up slowly as it is my daily driver.  The bad: front tires will need replaced within the next year (backs are only about a year old), and there is a few small dents and some paint chips, but good overall.  Crack in windshield on passenger side (no leaks, and doesn't affect vision).  Runs and drives good.  I am asking $6500 cash or trade for 1500 4x4 same value or cash can go either way.  No I will not trade for a truck worth half the value without cash or something else in trade being added.  I have the title in hand.  Feel free to come and give the truck a test drive.  If you are wanting to trade must be willing to let my local mechanic shop check the truck out.

The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.
 
Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.

The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.
 
 
Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols.

I already have 5 other similar sized 'pocket pistols'.  The pistol has been fired six times then cleaned and stored.   Per Beretta, the specs are:

Action	Striker
Barrel length (mm)	78
Barrel length (in)	3
Caliber	9x19 (PARA)

Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.

This pistol gets very good reviews and everyone seems to agree that the pistol is reliable, durable and accurate.  It comes in the original factory box with everything from the factory and that box comes in the thin cardboard box from Beretta.  Literally, it is a 'new' pistol but I don't think I can legally call it new since I am not a dealer.  I'm pricing this pistol for a quick sale.  If you have an Indiana ID and a carry permit, this pistol and all that it shipped with can be yours for $375.00 or best offer!  This will make a fantastic concealed firearm with a LOT more stopping power than the smaller .380 pistols yet is really no larger physically than the micro .380's.

The pictures are stock pictures, but they are of the same model.  I'm just not at home right now to take pictures of the actual picture.  If you are interested and want actual pictures, just ask."

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.Available at Ventura Munitions on the SW Corner of Valley View and Russell.

Also included with this sale is the factory case, owners manuals, warranty, and locking cable. This performance center gun is a rare find, with a beautiful look, and some excellent features! What sets this revolver apart from others is the un-fluted cylinder, Custom wood grips with stippling and finger choils, and the flat slab sides on the barrel. The action job has also really smoothed out the double action pull, and the front hi-viz sight really pops with the eye making this revolver that much easier to point and shoot.

I like it quite a bit, recoil is mild, accuracy is great, trigger is a crisp 3-4 pounds, and fit and finish are top notch. Unfortunately, due to my current financial situation I am looking to consolidate my calibers.
I would like to trade for a full size pistol in 9mm. I am mainly interested in something SA/DA with a metal frame. My top choice would be a Beretta 92, but I would also be interested in a CZ-75 and other similar items. I would also be interested in a Ruger GP100 4"" or 1911 .45. That being said, I will consider most any reasonable offer.
I will also sell for $500 FIRM- these retail for $600-$800, so I feel my price is more than fair.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
 
The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.
 
The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.Available at Ventura Munitions on the SW Corner of Valley View and Russell.

The LCP utilizes a double-action only, hammer-fired mechanism, with the hammer recessed into the rear of the slide to prevent snagging. The double-action only firing mode makes it simple to use in stressed situations—no levers or switches to remember—just point and shoot. The LCP features low profile front and rear sights integrated onto the slide that do not snag on clothing when pistol is drawn from a concealed position, and all sharp edges have been eliminated on the LCP to aid in concealment and to reduce wear on clothing. This LCP model features an alloy steel slide with a blued finish. Right-handed shooters can comfortably reach the magazine release on the LCP with their thumb, while left-handed shooters have no problem using their trigger finger. The mag release pushes in easily, but not so easily that the magazine pops out unexpectedly. Unlike many small semi-automatic pistols that operate with a blowback action, the Ruger LCP operates on a locked-breech system, which mitigates recoil and does not necessitate the user to pull the slide back against an excessively heavy recoil spring during loading. The LCP also has a manual slide hold-open latch for inspection and cleaning.Manufacturer: RugerModel: LCPCaliber: .380Barrel: 2.75"""

With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Research & Development teams, developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF. The TAVOR® was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the “father of the TAVOR,” spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities – seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990’s through the early 2000’s, the TAVOR underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies around the world. IWI and IWI US have brought the same dedication of craft and commitment to performance and reliability to the American customer with the TAVOR SAR rifle. TAVOR® SAR Features Include:   Bullpup configuration allows for short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease-of-use Clean, long stroke gas piston operation 5.56 NATO detachable, cold hammer-forged barrel (CHF), chrome-lined with 1:7 twist, CrMoV steel  ptional 9mm Parabellum conversion kit with CHF barrel, 1:10 twist, CrMoV steel  100% ambidextrous configuration and operation with optional left-hand bolts for 5.56 NATO.
