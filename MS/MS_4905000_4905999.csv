KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

Has a 5 inch barrel and is a 5-Screw model.  All serial numbers (#431xx) match on barrel, frame and cylinder.  Original finish is approximately 75-80%.  Lock up is tight.  Rifling is sharp.  Has factory S&W roll stamp, ""Reg. U.S Pat. Off."" on hammer (Rare).  Factory grooved trigger.  Last factory roll stamp, on barrel top, is ""Dec 29, '14""

This model was built in response to law enforcement's requirement for an arm that would shoot a high speed round which could penetrate car bodies and bullet proof vests.  The collaboration between Smith & Wesson, Remington and Elmer Keith produced the 38/44 S&W cartridge which could launch a 158 grain bullet at 1175 fps and producing 460 foot pounds of energy.  This round would penetrate 11-7/8 inch thick boards and would go thru the trunk of a car, seats, dash and into the engine area.  The factory first offered this gun in a 5 inch barrel, blue or nickel finish and service stocks.   The 38/44 Heavy Duty was the father of the .357 Registered Magnum which appeared in 1935.

Introduced to the firearms market in 1927, the Colt Official Police is a medium frame, double-action revolver with a six-round cylinder, primarily chambered for the .38 Special cartridge, and manufactured by the Colt's Manufacturing Company. The intended specific target market for the Official Police was mainly law enforcement agencies and it became one of the best selling police firearms of all time, eventually in the 1950s coming to exemplify typical peace officer weaponry. The Official Police was also used by various U.S. and allied military forces during World War II.

Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

The moniker “Official Police” was borrowed by this model in a new generation of revolvers Colt introduced in the late 1960s, called the “MK III” series. MK III models consisted of simpler versions of several classic Colt revolvers with updated lock work. The MK III product line was actually a different and original design based on a new “J” frame and was only available for three years.

tried hydrodiping, it didn't come out like i wanted so I sanded and threw a tan paint on it, some has come off over time.  Still shoots hollow pints perfectly fine, but after some research it acts like a lot of rulers and is picky on its ammo.  Will fire any hollow point i have come across, but cheap target ammo will light strike and not fire.  I called ruger and they wanted me to send it in to get a better spring.

Shotgun is excellent shape, fired maybe 30 rounds through it. Functions well with cheap birdshot, probably still needs some break in time. One of the front sight screws stripped when I removed it, if you want to use the factory sights, the screw would need to be replaced. Trust me, you don't want to use the factory sights - they are junk.

Fair buttstock with pitted buttplate & cracks by tang. CURIO. In 1907, the J. Stevens Arms and Tool Co. of Chicopee Falls, Mass., introduced a pump action .22 caliber rifle that was marked on the barrel, ""Visible Loading Repeater"". It was cataloged as the ""Visible Loading No. 70"", and was chambered in .22 short/long/long rifle. A .22 short only model, the Model 70 1/2, was also produced. Barrels were round in lengths of 20"" or 22""., and the rifles had a straight grip stock. In 1916 the company name changed to J. Stevens Arms Company and the firm was eventually purchased by Savage Arms Co. in the 1920s. In the mid 1920's, the rifles catalog name was slightly changed to ""Visible Loader"" until 1931, when it was replaced with a similar ""Visible Loader No. 71, which featured a 24"" long octagon barrel and a pistol grip stock."

Designed by Hugo Schmeisser, the designer of the infamous MP40 Submachine Gun used by the NAZI's in WW2, and also the actual designer of the AK47 Kalasnikov rifle (as recently declassified Russian/Nazi documents prove). Kalashnikov was a simple corporal assigned to assist Schmeisser in the rifle development program for the USSR after WW2 ended. We got Von Braun and a space program, and the Russians got Hugo Schmeisser's AK47 and the most robust battle rifle ever made in history. And Mikhail Kalashnikov got the credit and fame for being the Russian inventor. True story!

The Haenel factory in Suhl made these pistols before the war, and the ones sold for export outside of Germany had Made in Germany stamped on the slide. This one was made for sale to German citizens, in Germany, and doesn't have that stamp. Very few were sold in Germany before the war, as a gentlemen's pocket pistol was a luxury item that few Germans could afford. Most of these domestic Schmeisser 25 acp guns ended up in the uniforms of high-ranking NAZI Officers and members of the Wehrmacht, and elite SS troops, as they were a highly prized backup gun for their Luger sidearms.

This one is exceptional, with all matching numbers, an original magazine, and original grips.  It has an outstanding plum-brown original patina, and hasn't been refinished. And it fires and functions perfectly.

It would make an outstanding addition to any advanced German auto pistol collection.
I have more collectors information, and photos available concerning markings, proof marks, and model variations if you desire in PDF form.

I'm asking for $550 cash sales to local collectors, but I will also transfer out of state FFL to FFL if the buyer pays those fees and shipping costs.

Thanks for looking!

I will also consider trades for other guns of similar value for my collection."

718,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4905718,For Sale/Trade:  Two Mauser Chileno Modelo 1895 Rifles,"Irondale, Birmingham, Alabama",$ 500,"Listed On: Tuesday, December 1, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Two Sporter rifles. One looks to be a numbers-matching Mauser Chileno Modelo 1895 Carbine that has been professionally sporterized. The bayonet lug, cleaning rod and attachment is gone and the hole for it in the stock has been plugged. I am told by someone who purports to know these guns (without seeing them) that it has been rebarreled to .308 and indeed several boxes of .308 came with it. I don't know if I believe that, and you will need to find a gunsmith to verify or disprove it before firing it. It looks to be an original barely-used rifle, I won't be surprised considering the source if it was un-issued which was at some distant time sporterized by a gunsmith who knew what he was doing. It has a modern rail mount with a 3x9 Hailey's Optics scope and a bent bolt.
The other I cannot identify exactly. It has the Mauser Chileno Modelo 1895 receiver, stamped 7.62N on the receiver bridge, but I have searched the internet and cannot find a long barrel - long stock rifle like it. The wood, for example, extends above and below the barrel longer than anything I see depicted on the net or in Mauser books and the barrel is quite a bit longer than even the long rifle pictures I can find. All of the pics I find show the top forestock ending at the sling band, as the carbine's does. The long rifle top piece extends to the full forestock. Like the other rifle the bayonet lug and cleaning rod have been removed. This one has a beautifully done Chilean 1895 acceptance cartouche on the stock. This bolt is straight.
I bought these from a cousin who inherited them from his father last month, who was a professional art restorer. Whoever did the work on these rifles did as good a job as I have ever seen. Unless you knew they were supposed to have a bayonet and cleaning rod or that they have been sporterized you couldn't tell it...this is certainly no Bubba job.
Both are dirty but inside the barrels are clean, excellent rifling (looks almost as-new to me) and their overall condition is excellent with no significant rust or damage. they look as if they were oiled then stuck in someone's gun case for the last 125 years.

I may keep the long rifle simply because it has the most beautiful stock I have ever seen. With the stock style and long continuous grain in the wood, and the elegant overall lines, this is the prettiest gun I have ever seen, well worth owning as a piece of art. In that case I will take $300 for the scoped carbine.

Being made in 1895 these are Antigues that do not need FFL transfer registration."

As for the gun itself, it's a short barrel, blacked out side by side.  The barrels are ported to aid in recoil/muzzle rise.  There is a rail that runs the bottom from the foregrip to the end of the barrels.  I've put a light on there easily and it works very well.  The top of it has a rail for optics.  However, I didn't have an optic available (not sure I would put one on there) and it's sitting in the box.  This one breaks open very smoothly too.

The only reason I am selling is to fund a purchase/build.

I'm asking $375 for a quick sale.  $400 gets you two boxes of 00 included.  Open to trades, but the only thing I'm really in need of is an optic for an AR10 variant.
