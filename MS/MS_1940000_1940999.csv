The PK380 is not just good looking. It is small and good looking. That makes the PK380 excellent for concealed carry. Its small grip is ideal for shooters with small hands. The slide is easy to operate, making it a good choice for women. The light weight goes unnoticed in a pocket or purse. Credit Walther Performance Design for another hit. Small is indeed beautiful.

The Glock original finger-grove grip has been reshaped to a smooth finish. Some of the finish is flaking, but this does not affect the mechanical function of the gun. I did not do the modifications except for the extended slide, so I do not have additional information on these changes. The gun has been carried and shot at the range, but round count is low – under 500. Purchase includes pistol and two Glock OEM magazines. The original box is not available.

Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.

I have had this gun since I was 18 and only put about 200 rounds through it, it was used when I bought it but had the original wooden stock.

I have since replaced the stock with a composite collapsible stock. The SKS comes with 2 20rd mags and 800 rounds of Wolf Military Classic FMJ. The only reason I am selling this guy is because I am moving to California soon and it's current configuration isn't legal over there.

Select different rates of twist to help stabilize heavier bullets during long range shooting — a Savage exclusive.

The top-of-the-line Model 12 Long Range Precision Varminter provides legendary Savage accuracy and sets the standard in long-range shooting. An extra-heavy, fluted, one-inch diameter barrel with a smaller ejection port provides more rigidity to the receiver and greater precision. All this, plus an aluminum v-block system in H-S Precision’s Varmint stock.

Stock # MMH171904RT. This is a pretty sharp DWM 1915 WWI 9mm Military Luger. All numbered parts except the grips and magazine are matching, and the mag is a correct wood-bottomed WWI. About 85-90% of the original straw remains, and the blued finish has normal holster wear on the barrel and sideplate, and there is very minor freckling on the sideplate and here and there on the receiver, but overall finish condition is about 90%. All markings are crisp and legible, there are NO importer’s markings anywhere on the gun. The grips show pretty normal wear for a WWI gun, there is one tiny chip on the right grip, and overall grip condition is 85%. The pistol has a fairly crisp bore with visible rifling. This is a very collectible WWI Luger that will really enhance a good collection. i do not have a holster or any accessories for this gun. Please do not send me an email regarding this item unless you have a sincere interest in purchasing it, thank you!"

The ""haze"" or ""film"" you see on the gun in the picture is not a blemish, just a healthy dose of TW25b lubricant/protectant. If you stay tuned in to the 1911 market you know that for whatever reason Dan Wessons are few and far between lately for whatever reason. I do not have to get rid of this, for the money I would easily call this the best 1911 on the market. No MIM and built like a brick shithouse. This weapon is worth more than what I am looking for, but will let it go for the right one. Cash price is $1250 if you were going to ask.

It is in the serial number range of the ""Golden Age"" of this rifles history. Glen was commissioned to make the Super Match rifles for Springfield Armory for many years. He only used USGI parts, which are superior to the ones used in today’s M1As. I read about a Super Match (in a ransom rest) that put fourteen rounds in a quarter sized hole at 200 yards! That’s the accuracy potential of these heavier “Douglas” barrels. The stock is beautifully bedded, it has a very low round count, as you can see by the trigger assembly, and is a superior battle rifle, home defense rifle, and it's a pretty darn good hunting rifle as well. Linseed oiled stock for weather protection. Original cleaning kit in stock butt. It was a ""safe queen"" for many years. If you are looking for the best of these legendary .308 caliber rifles, this is one of them. I’m thinning out my gun collection.

MADE IN AMERICA!!! There is no other way to ensure such a high level of quality. Kimber is the most popular 1911 pistol in the world, a family with twenty one models in four calibers, whose quality is unequaled with accuracy and dependability right out of the box. The STANDARD is now the Custom II. It incorporates the Kimber Firing Pin Safety that makes each pistol more secure without impeding performance or altering trigger pull. As with all Kimber pistols, standard features set Customs apart from other brands: Match grade dimensions for barrels, bushings, chambers and triggers, ejection ports that are lowered and flared, dovetails mounted sights, extended thumb safeties, and the list goes on. The LAPD SWAT Team carries the KIMBER 1911, as do United States Marines, thousands of law enforcement officers, and hundreds of thousands of American shooters who refuse to compromise on quality.

Will sell everything for $300 dollars OBO. . The two grips have some damage. I had to rewire the J-rich and the bi-pod grip came with a leg that doesn't lock properly. Everything else is in MINT condition, never used in game situations, only test fired. The mask is new in the box and never worn. Same with the lens. I have developed a medical condition which prevents me from playing so I am selling these cheap.

Magpul PMAG M2 MOE Magazine AR-15 223 Remington 30-Round 
Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers (sold separately). Available in four molded-in colors: Black, Flat Dark Earth, Foliage Green and Olive Drab. Made in the USA.

It has the two tone 8 round magazine. The firearm has been protected with a duracoat finish to stop any further corrosion since all of original finish was gone. The frame was done in stainless and the slide and furniture done in gun blue. The magazine was not touched. It is fully functional and ready for someone to enjoy. Since the finish is not factory original so it is good to go for a carry piece or for fun. The good thing about duracoat finishes are they can be removed with ease by applying a stripping agent and no metal loss by sanding is required. The lettering is still intact on both sides but the very top of the rampant colt is partially worn off. 

The grips are replacements, the bore is very good with strong rifling.

I am not looking for trades unless it would be for other colts.

The parts kit came with the front half of the gun completely assembled with a US barrel, non chrome lined.  The front half was assembled and properly headspaced by Centerfire Systems.  I refinished the buttstock, but it could be redone with a finer sanding and red stain to match.  The foregrips are left as original.  The outside of the receiver was blued using several coats of Birchwood Casey perma blue.  Sights are good to hit a 1'x2' steel plate at 100 yards, but I have not shot any paper off a good rest to precisely sight in. 

THE BAD:  I built this with a screw kit rather than rivets, and many of the screws on the front trunion and trigger guard stripped and fell out from recoil.  I've tried replacing them but the same problem occurs.  Plain and simply, AKs MUST be built with rivets.   If you or someone you know has the tools to rivet this together, perfect.  
UPDATES: I put in a few household screws to go shooting last weekend, but all of them stripped out and are gone now.  The oak pistol grip in the picture is not included, this will come with an unfinished pine grip I made as a first attempt.

MFG Description
The refined and upgraded MLP-1722 is designed for the target-shooting connoisseur. The MLP's Picuda barrel consists of a steel liner surrounded by graphite with the grain running parallel to the bore, which produces a rigid barrel that releases heat as quickly and with a reduced overall weight. The receiver and Weaver scope mount were machined as one piece to create an optics mount that is stronger and more precise than a bolt-on mount. The MLP is easy to cock and fire and its stock has an attractive heavy wood grain appearance. This pistol features a smooth wood laminate stock.

Here is a well preserved specimen of the 9mm Star Model B. It comes to us from service with the LANDES POLIZEI NEIDERSACHSEN, the post WWII German police organization. Located on barrel (visible through slide cutout) ""Cal. 08"" see above. The gun is in NRA VERY GOOD condition, and bears matching serial numbers on frame, barrel, barrel bushing, magazine and slide... It bears no alien stamping or import marks on the frame. It was brought back to Texas from a man that served in the Army Intelligence Corp stationed in West Germany after WWII. The manufacturer is Star, Bonifacio Echeverria S.A. of Eagar, Spain. Barrel and slide are 5 inch Colt Government length, blue steel with John M. Browning bushing type mechanism. Sights are stake-on half-moon low profile front and matching dovetailed blue steel rear combat type. Extractor is housed completely internally to the slide, located in right rear serrated area, as the photos show. Safety setup is main safety only for cocked-and-locked carry, with no grip safety. The Star safety, however, will engage with the hammer in resting or half cock positions. Star B may or may not have a magazine safety. It is Series 70 type, no firing pin block. Magazine is blue steel Star factory. Capacity is 9 rounds, 8 + 1; and magazines are available throughout the country. Caliber is 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Weight empty is 37 ounces, and weight and dimensions are very similar to the Colt 1911 Government Pistols. Grip panels are checkered Brown wooden factory issue with moderate flattening to the checkering crowns; photo will show. On this specimen, surface detractions are moderate, principally contact wear from holstering. We rate this specimen as good, 79 percent vicinity by our estimate; photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. It is excellent mechanically; bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean and excellent, and the trigger pull is crisp approximately 5 pound vicinity with negligible felt creep. We’re offering this very attractive, eminently serviceable and collectable Spanish-German Star Spain 9mm Model B Pistol to a lucky buyer. It is a good shooter, very accurate and has new Wolff Mainspring, Recoil Spring and Trigger Spring and was recently services by a competent gunsmith.

DESCRIPTION:	 	 	 
The semi-auto hunting rifles VEPR are designed for medium-sized and big games. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). 
VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market 

The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope. 

All VEPR rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory, included in the manual.

The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.

The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol.

This sight is completely internal, and replaces the Glock guide rod, so you can keep your existing lights, grips, holster, etc. 
Included is everything in the picture: the laser sight guide rod, the slide lock and spring, installation tool, original box, manual, and warranty card. 

Manufacturer Description and Information:

Extremely rugged. LaserMax internal guide rods for GLOCK meet or exceed both Mil-Spec and Homeland Security durability test standards (drop tests, blowing sand, temperature and humidity extremes, salt water fog, deep water immersion, 20,000+ rounds live fire).

Installation takes minutes. If you can field-strip your gun, you can install your LaserMax sight—No gunsmithing required. 

Hi-Vis Pulsating Beam. Pulsating gives effortless awareness of muzzle direction, transcends language barriers. Can be used outdoors from dusk till dawn, or indoors round-the-clock. IR versions optimized for NVG characteristics.

Alignment. The Internal Guide Rod lasers come permanently aligned from the factory* for center-of-mass accuracy at 20 yards. It will never drift out of alignment. There is no need to re-zero after changing batteries.

Accuracy. As close to the bore of the GLOCK as possible, positioning allows for the closest and most consistent relationship between your point of aim and point of impact (POA/POI) over all shooting distances. Especially useful for moving targets.

Turn it on! Ambidextrous switch in custom take-down lever closely resembles the factory GLOCK take-down lever. Deliberate on/off activation—highly desirable in a tactical or personal defense situation!

Battery Model: LMS-3x393 (readily available silver oxide batteries commonly used in watches)

Accuracy (20 Yards): ±2"" POA

 Laser Operating Temperature: 15°-120° F

 Wavelength: 635nm (red-orange)

 Power Output: 5mW (brightest available - blinks for highest visibility)

Combining the best elements of the 92FS and the 90-Two, these pistols feature a frame mounted Picatinny rail for easy mounting of tactical lights or lasers. The 92 series operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and time proven design. The included three 17 round steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. The barrel also features a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. This pistol features a lightweight frame made from extremely strong Aircraft-quality Aluminum alloy, and an Open Slide Design, virtually eliminating jamming and stove piping, and allowing the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged. This model is one of the most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history. The average reliability of all M9 pistols tested at Beretta U.S.A. is 17,500 rounds without a stoppage.

I picked this up from Green Top this April.  This is the 16"" bbl one with the threaded barrel and scope mount, Accu-Trigger as well. I have the original stock that is also painted by me and the box it came with. It has maybe a brick worth of subsonics through it, and it shoots with a suppressor VERY well; 1/2-28 threads are perfect. 

Mods include:
-Boyds tacticool wood stock (black texture coated under paint)
-Upgraded metal kit and hex screws for stock 
-Nylon stock spacers (you can remove these, I was testing them for stock TQ)
-Tasco 6-24 AO scope (15yds - infinity AO)
-low rings
-Knockoff Harris BRS bipod
-outdoor connection quick-adjust black sling.


I painted this up with Krylon ultra flat paint and used ferns and laundry bag mesh for the snakeskin details. it's really fun to shoot and a great trainer for cheaper shooting and a lazy weekend in the back yard. I don't want to sell it but I have no choice. 

thanks for looking! PLEASE check my feedback, I am a solid seller as well :)
