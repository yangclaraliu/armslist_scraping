The 6.5 Grendel is a middle ground between the 5.56×45mm NATO and the 7.62×51mm NATO. It retains greater terminal energy at extended ranges than either of these cartridges due to its higher ballistic coefficient and 1,900ft/lbs of energy.
The 123gr 6.5 Grendel has more energy and better armor penetration at 1,000 meters than the M80 7.62 NATO round due to its longer low-drag bullet being more aerodynamic (ballistic coefficient of .547 and a muzzle velocity of 2,600 FPS). The 6.5 Grendel remains supersonic to 1,200m providing flat trajectory and high accuracy for tactical, target and sufficient for CXP2 class game such as deer."

Rapid target identification and quick and precise repeated fire on a target's center-zone nets you the best possible score. In home defense scenarios, time and accuracy are also important factors. Smith & Wesson created its 5-inch M&P9 Performance Center Ported (M&P9 PC Ported) to increase the performance of its M&P line of pistols so that they can be shot at competitions, straight out of the box. Does this increased performance translate into the home defense realm?Conventional wisdom rules out a tailor-built competition handgun to fill the role of a home defense pistol. Custom-modified race pistols often ride the ragged edge of ultimate performance to the point that they can sometimes sacrifice reliability. This is much like how a finely tuned race-car is capable of astonishing performance on the track, but wouldn't last a day chugging along in gridlock to and from your work. Race-guns also usually have a very light trigger, which may not be welcome when adrenaline is coursing through your veins, making your heart race at what feels like 500 beats per minute. In such a stressed state, your fine motor skills become an afterthought. These are all valid arguments against using a high-performance competition gun for home defense.With all that in mind, a couple of questions arise. When the lives of loved ones are on the line, wouldn't you rather have a pistol that can give you every advantage over the bad guy? If you were given the choice of defending yourself and your family with a run-of-the-mill pistol or one that has been worked over to run faster and more accurately, which would you choose? What if a commercially available pistol can deliver some of the positive attributes of a race-gun without the shortcomings?The M&P9 Performance Center Ported is based on the five-inch-barreled, long-slide version of the popular striker-fired, polymer-framed M&P9 pistol, but features a few upgrades performed by the folks at Smith & Wesson's Performance Center. Engineered with competition shooters in mind, the ported M&P9 is easy to spot at a glance due to its polished stainless barrel and the slide's lightening cuts. It's no custom race-gun, but we'd say that it's inspired by the same performance features, bundled in a factory-reliable package.If you look carefully at the two slots cut into the slide closest to the muzzle, you'll notice that the barrel is ported as well. The two ports at the end of the barrel help keep muzzle rise down by channeling the escaping gas of a fired cartridge upward and outward as the bullet travels out of the barrel, helping push the muzzle down. The gasses escape in a V formation from the top of the slide.In the years since the M&P's release, aftermarket companies such as Apex Tactical and even Smith & Wesson itself have steadily enhanced the M&P trigger in a variety of ways. This most recent version of the trigger by S&W's Performance Center on the M&P9 PC Ported features an improved ""Performance Center Sear"" that is said to give the shooter a quicker and more defined trigger reset.The Performance Center trigger feels smoother and not at all like the older generation of triggers. The product description for the M&P9 PC Ported on S&W's website listed a pull weight range between four and five pounds. We measured it at a consistently smooth six pounds. To further enhance this pistol, the engineers at S&W added an adjustable trigger stop just behind the trigger. The trigger stop essentially a long setscrew threaded into the frame adjusts through the rear of the frame with an Allen wrench when the grip's backstrap is removed. The trigger stop is used to stop the trigger's rearward movement after the trigger break, resulting in less over-travel, which in turn leads to a quicker trigger reset. When each of the M&P9 PC Ported enhancements works in unison, it equates to fast and controllable follow-up shots.SpecificationsManufacturer Number10098ModelM&P9 Performance Center PortedFrame SizeFull SizeCaliber9mmAction Striker Fired (Double Action)Magazine Capacity17+1 RoundsBarrel Length5 Inches (12.7 cm)Front SightWhite Dot DovetailRear SightFixed 2-DotOverall Length8.5 Inches (21.2 cm)GripPolymerWeight24.1 Ounces (683.2 Grams)Barrel MaterialStainless SteelSlide Material Stainless SteelFrame Material PolymerFinishBlack, Durable, Corrosion-Resistant"

HOW IT WORKS: adjust regulator with low velocity target type load, back out regulator(reducing gas pressure used) until bolt will not cycle. then tighten regulator(increasing gas pressure used) until bolt continues to cycle with out error. this is least amount of gas pressure required to cycle bolt. now, when using high velocity rounds no adjustment of regulator is necessary to keep from damaging your shotgun… this is because u have adjusted the regulator to only send the minimum gas pressure needed to cycle bolt, any extra is expelled out of the regulator ports. VS. stock regulator that only comes with 2 settings which require the shooter change when changing ammo types, failure to do so can damage firearm. *Chaos USA extended quad rail - stock quad rail will also be included *Bushnell reflex red dot sight *Ace Original 9.5"" Butt-Stock - stock butt-stock will also be included *DPH ARMS mussel break - this break doubles as a flash suppressor and chokes. this break accepts remming style chokes. currently comes with modified. *Magpul angled fore-grip *Tromix charging handle *Storage compartment pistol grip * 2 x AGP 10 round Mags 2."

It is not the tactical version with the threaded barrel.  Currently, it has about 1000 flawless rounds through it.  There is nothing wrong with it, I just don't feel it's practical to own such a large handgun.  It holds 15 rounds of .45 ACP and comes with three mages, case and original paperwork.  

I have owned it for about a year.  I love it but am looking for something a little more practical like another handgun or an AR Platform Rifle.  

As for price, I am asking 650 for it with the light.  Without the light, 600.  I don't need to sell it so please keep the 400 dollar offers to yourself.  I am negotiable, but I'm not giving it away.    As for trades, I'm looking for: Glock 19 in FDE (especially a Lipsey's in FDE), HK VP9, an Arsenal AK in 5.45 or 7/62x39, or an AR Platform Rifle in 5.56 or .308.

For sale is my essentially brand-new Hawken rifle(shot 5 times). I've done a lot to this since getting it. Paid a professional to gloss-finish the stock; had a gunsmith add on a hunting dual-trigger system; also had the gunsmith add modern iron sights that include windage dials. Replaced original ramrod with new brass/hardwood ramrod. This is an absolutely gorgeous gun, and I'm loath to let it go. Some lucky hunter out there is about to get a steal of a deal.

Everything pictured is included; enough shot, powder, caps and supplies to keep you shooting for months. I am happy to ship and maintain my own FFL.


Includes:

-Hawken rifle, .50 caliber, with upgraded sights, trigger, and ramrod.
-Handmade powder horn(I made it), with handmade intricate-weave sling(my girl did this)

-Bore cleaner
-Bore laser







This entire get-up cost me well over $850; the rifle pre-upgrades alone was $500. Priced to sell, because I need to, but I'm only doing this once. First come, first served. Whoever takes this home is going to have a damn fun time, black powder rifles are fun to begin with but Hawkens are almost as accurate as modern rifles. Indeed, under 200 yards you won't even notice a difference(aside from longer load time).

You will not find a better black powder deal for an essentially new gun anywhere in Oregon. And for my non-Oregon fellows out there, I am again happy to ship to wherever you live. You will simply pay postage. For your trouble, I will pay for tracking and insurance on your new Hawken, keeping it safe until it reaches your door."

Bluing is excellent with a very small area at tip of barrel where bluing is slightly worn. Not noticeable unless your attention is drawn to it. It has a very, very thin line on the cylinder, but again very unnoticeable. The grips are original, but had a coat of polyurethane in late seventies which is now beginning to wear. Could be easily restored to original finish. Only selling it because I need the funds for another purchase.

The GP100 is built on a robust, medium/heavy frame of stainless steel. To withstand recoil from heavy 357 loads, a triple-locking cylinder is locked into the frame at the front, rear, and bottom so it stays aligned without getting sloppy over time. A full-length rib along the top of the barrel adds weight, and provides ample steel to dovetail the front sight, making the sight easily replaceable. The rear sight is fully adjustable for windage and elevation, and the factory ramp front sight is easily seen, while providing minimal interference when drawing the sidearm from a holster. (3"" barrel model has a fixed rear sight and a pinned front sight.) The angle of the GP100's peg-style grip frame, and the recoil cushioning Hogue® Monogrip®, greatly absorb recoil and allow the shooter to stay on target while firing the revolver in double-action mode. A full-length ejector rod shroud puts extra weight out front to reduce muzzle flip, allowing for faster sight acquisition on follow up shots. The Ruger GP100 has a smooth double-action trigger pull, and a clean, crisp break in single-action. Stainless steel construction provides corrosion resistance, and low maintenance in the backcountry. The solid frame of the GP100 has no side plate, and the revolver disassembles into large subassemblies with no tools, aiding to ease of maintenance in the field. As with all Ruger Double-Action Revolvers, the GP100 features the patented Ruger transfer bar mechanism that provides an unparalleled measure of security against accidental discharge—the revolver can be dropped directly on its hammer and will not fire without the trigger being pulled all the way to the back. The Ruger GP100 Double-Action Revolver is solidly built sidearm that will serve a lifetime of hard use. Made in the USA.

$260 FIRM cash.  Thought this one was sold, again, after holding it almost two weeks, so I'm sorry for those who were interested and I told them it was already sold.

I don't need anything, but I may look at trades only if it's a good deal, If it's not a good deal for me, I will politely pass.  Mostly interested in semi-autos and some AR-15 and AR-10 stripped lowers and mags, but will consider other items, depending on the deal and I can add cash or other??

The specially designed hollow point will not plug while passing through a variety of barriers and the jacket and core hold together providing nearly 100% weight retention! This ammunition was engineered to meet or exceed  ammunition testing protocols; these protocols put bullets through 10% ordinance gelatin, steel, wallboard, plywood, laminated automobile safety glass and gelatin covered in heavy clothing and measure how well the bullets penetrate, expand and hold together. Extensive testing has shown that the on average the 45 ACP load will deliver 12.92"" of penetration, 0.81"" of expansion, 99% weight retention through all FBI barriers when shot through a Smith & Wesson M&P at 10 feet. One of the great things about this ammunition are high quality features that make this ammunition perfect choice for self-defense ammunition. Each round of ammunition is loaded into a Federal Premium nickel plated brass case with waterproofing on the case mouth and primer. Every load has a consistent powder charge and reliable primer for consistent ignition. Every HST bullet features a tapered jacket profile for reliable feeding, a cannelure that locks the copper jacket to the lead core, patented co-aligned internal and external skiving and a deep tapered hollow point that will not clog.
