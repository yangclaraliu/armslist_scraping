This gun is black on black not 2-tone like the SD9VE. This handgun is also not the Sigma series. That's a good thing too.

This handgun is a very nice gun. 

Price is Fair for this handgun and 3 mags. 

Must have a Michigan CPL or a issued Michigan Purchase Permit with Valid picture ID to finalize sale. No shipping or out of state deals. 

If your reading this, it is still available. 

Due to the last few interested buyers not showing up or calling to cancel, I will sell to the first person who shows up with cash and PROPER PAPERWORK. I tried being fair and holding things for people just to get shafted. Also If I have dealt with you already about this handgun, I will not sell it to you either due to your lack of responsibility. No exceptions. You will also have to come close to Saline. I have spent enough time and gas chasing ghosts So, with all of that out of the way, feel free to contact me and hopefully we can make a deal. 

I may be interested in a 20g semi or pump trade. Doesn't hurt to ask.

This AK-22 is manufactured by Armscor of the Philippines, the company that brings us their excellent 1911 pistols that perform so very well. Importer and warrantor is Armscor Precision of Pahrump, Nevada. Construction is steel barrel, bolt, trigger guard, gas tube, sight post and leaf, screws, lever, and internal parts built into an alloy Action with alloy sight body, tube hardware, and trigger. Buttstock, forend, cover, and pistol grip are oil finish Filipino hardwood. Despite the imitation gas tube, type is blowback semi-auto, and it is a direct descendant of the Remington 550-1 rifles that are still in service after 60 years. Action is not at all Kalashnikov, so this rifle is not proscripted by anti-AK State and Local laws. Sights are correct elevation adjustable square notch rear and hooded blade front. Magazines are 10 round blue steel, housed in a correct-looking and fitting short curved AK type housing. Fifteen rounders are usually available, and we will be happy to sub a 15 at the buyer’s option, so long as they are legal in buyer’s resident jurisdiction. Barrel is 18 1/4 inch one piece blue steel with 1:16 rifling, a real barrel, not a liner and plastic cover like the German competitors. Note that the muzzle has 3/8 inch worth of 1/2-28 threads on its muzzle, with a removable thread protector. Weight empty is a well balanced 7 pounds. Sling is 1 1/2 inch black military style, and it attaches easily to the permanent swivels. We have sold substantial numbers of this brand rifle with good results since the 1970s, when the 550-1 phased out and the Filipino manufacturers filled the gap with a good quality economically priced rifle marketed under the Squibman and K-Mart brands, then Armscor. ARMSCOR uses, writes the factory, only high grade ordnance steel for all major parts for durability and mechanical reliability even in the most adverse operating conditions. Instruction manual and magazine call for high velocity .22 ammo; our local customers have always had best results with Winchester, Federal, and Aguila copper coated ammunition. This is a good little rifle, but it is NOT a garbage-mouthed Ruger 10/22. Each rifle comes with its hang tag, protective papers, inspection sticker, parts schematic, and safety manual.

I had this rifle built for elk hunting when I was planning to go elk hunting before an accident I had.  I just do not need the rifle anymore.  Would make an increditable hunting rifle!

This is a very nice rifle and at the price I'm asking I wouldn't think it would be around long!  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks"

This is top quality, true military overrun ammunition produced in Sweden for a NATO European Military contract. It’s loaded in 10-round stripper clips, individually sealed in plastic bags and comes neatly packed in a brand new 50 caliber ammo can, making it perfect for long-term storage. Includes two magazine loaders for easy loading from stripper clips.

Technical Information:
    Caliber: 5.56x45mm NATO
    Bullet Weight: 62 Grains
    Bullet Style: Full Metal Jacket Steel Core
    Muzzle Velocity: 2985 fps
    Muzzle Energy: 1227 ft lbs
    Case Type: Brass
    Jacket Material: Gilding Metal
    Core Material: Hard Steel/Soft Steel
    Reloadable: No
    Corrosive: No
    Compatible with all 5.56x45mm NATO weapons
    NATO Qualified: NATO Design AC/225-128A
    Non-Toxic with Improved Penetration compared with NATO standard ball (SS109)
    No lead or antimony in cartridge

Note that, despite their certification to the SS109 and M855 standards, the bullets in the ammunition contain no lead – the jacket material encloses nothing but steel, so the penetrator is larger than any other SS109 bullet, and the longer bullet has a higher ballistic coefficient for improved stability and flatter trajectory at longer ranges. Also, the absence of lead means that this ammunition can be used at ranges where lead is banned.

Each can is a brand new .50 ammunition can, filled with 100 sealed plastic bags that each contain a stripper clip of 10 rounds, and two magazine loaders for the AR- and HK-pattern magazines. Please let me know if you have other questions or would like more pictures. I have only one can left now, one can of 1000 rounds is $450.

I prefer a face-to-face deal for cash in the NW San Antonio / Helotes / Leon Springs area. Since part of the value of this package is that it is sealed for storage, I will not break the wire seal on the cans for you to look at – but once your money is in my hand, you may open it up in front of me if you wish, and I will happily return your money if the contents are not as described.

Buy it from me and have it today -- no shipping, no sales tax, no dealer fees, etc.

 This Correct Grade rifle has all correct/matching parts for the date of manufacture with around 80% to 90% overall original metal finish.  The stock and handguards are walnut and correct for the rifle but has some dings, and dents.  Stock has the appropriate original inspector's cartouche.  The rifle bore is very good with no significant defects and with a throat erosion of 2 to 2 1/2 and a muzzle wear of 1.  The action timing is perfect.

Colt Factory Letter confirms that this pistol was produced in 1970 and was one of only 1000 Colts manufactured with this barrel bushing transitional feature. This wonderful Colt is one of approximately 1000 pistols that Colt manufactured during the transition period preceding the introduction of the Series 70 1911s. Colt was investigating technology to increase the ""out of the box"" accuracy of the Model 1911A1 without having to hand fit every barrel and bushing. The barrel bushing feature used on this Colt is the result of this investigation. The test results from Colt M1911's equipped with this new barrel bushing technology flowed into the design of the Series 70 pistols that Colt enthusiasts value so highly. Colt has been quoted as saying that they had no idea that this small group of pistols would be so sought after in later years. The barrel is stamped with ""COLT .45 AUTO"" with ""BB"". The right side of the frame is stamped with the serial number and ""BB"" underneath. Both ""BB"" stamps signify that this pistol has the ""barrel bushing"" feature. Metal finish is high polish Colt blue on the flat surfaces and matte blue elsewhere. Features include fixed, low-profile sights; serrated hammer, slide stops, thumb safety, magazine release, and arched main spring housing. Magazine is blue with ""COLT / .45 AUTO"" markings. Grips are brown ""Colt Wood"" with rampant Colt imprints. Pistol is NEW IN ORIGINAL TWO PIECE BROWN BOX with Owner's Manual and original bill of sale (Would you believe $125 in August 1970??!!). The box has the serial number hand written on the bottom of the lower box section. All stampings / markings are crisp and clear. The action is excellent. How many New in Box examples of the M1911 Barrel Bushing pistol have you ever seen? Serial number 333692C."

It was a pistol target shooters could only dream about. A Smith & Wesson Model 52-1 chambered for .38 Special, mid range, wadcutter ammunition. Serial number is 103729. Meaning it is one of the original models manufactured between 1961 and 1963 where only 3,500 units were produced. The extension made the sight accuracy better without having a longer barrel. I rate this firearm to be in Good condition. Please note the pictures.  This pistol is known for its accuracy, and “to insure the accuracy of the pistol, extra-rigid inspection was incorporated by having the Model 52 machine rest tested at 50 yards to assure that the pistol would shoot 5-shot groups having a maximum spread of two inches. Any pistol that could not meet this standard was returned to production for reworking.” The slide action has no sway or loose feel at all due to its closely fitted barrel bushing. The trigger pull is perfection at its best.   
This model has the reputation of being one of the most accurate handguns ever made. The original grips are checkered walnut grips with Smith and Wesson monograms. The gun has a serrated trigger and hammer with adjustable trigger stop., 2lbs trigger pull...crisp and clean. Included with this pistol are 3 magazines. The grips are sharp with no losses or cracks. All markings are deep. The finish is factory original.

Our first trigger, the Hi-Speed National Match, was designed by our Founder, Bill Geissele, for CMP and NRA Hi-Power Rifle competition. For The Warfighter Although designed for target shooting, the Geissele Hi-Speed trigger was found by the U.S. Military to have applications in semi-automatic sniper weapons. In 2005 Geissele Automatics received a request from the Department of Defense: ""Can you build us a select-fire trigger that is as good as your Hi-Speed?"" In response, Bill designed the Geissele Super Select-Fire trigger (SSF). After rigorous testing the SSF was adopted by entities in the U.S. Special Operations community and has become their trigger of choice for M4 carbine based weapons. For The Protector A derivative of the SSF trigger was developed to meet the needs of law enforcement and civilians who do not need select-fire capability. This trigger, the Super Semi-Automatic (SSA,) combines stellar performance with the safety, reliability and forgiveness for which 2 stage triggers are known.Check out the wide selection of Geissele Triggers at DEGuns.net, starting at $139"

These are once-fired, and a mixture of several manufacturers. I did run these through an ultrasonic cleaner once, but they will need further prepping (depriming, resizing, further cleaning, etc). This lot is good shape and looks good for reloading.

I am asking $10 cash for the whole lot. I prefer to sell the whole lot as one. Price is firm. Will meet FTF in the La Crosse area.

I still have the factory sights that will come with the pistol but it currently has HiViz front sight on it and it comes with a sight kit that has red, yellow, and a white sight. It will be sold with the original case and everything that came with it from the factory.  I also have 1,545 rounds of high velocity ammo that I would like to sell as well. I would like to get $110 for the ammo. If you're seriously interested please send me a txt message and I will txt you or call you back as soon as I can. REDACTED.      (update) I want everyone to stop Emailing me about this pistol. Like I requested please just send me a txt message please if interested. Also , this asking price of $260 on the pistol if FIRM. My asking price is already a great deal. For the people asking me what my bottom dollar is is very disrespectful on your part. Also, Im selling this pistol and ammo at this very low price due to health issues not because there is something wrong with the firearm. This pistol runs 100% with great quality ammo like all firearms. Also, I don't do Paypal nor do I directly ship to a buyer. That is ILLEGAL. I'm not a FFL. Also, NO TRADES. So as you can see, I've had issues with possible buyers on this pistol. I just want a simple, easy transaction like I've had in the past when I sold my other 3 pistols. Just want someone to contact me, I meet them somewhere, and then have the firearm,ammo,and money exchange hands. It's that simple .... Thank You."

The second is a K Kale Turkish Mauser. Chambered in 8mm Mauser. It is marked 1943 and is also built in the Ankara arsenal. This one is missing the upper handguard and the wood is in pretty rough shape. The blueing is gone in a lot of places, but the bore still has strong rifling. This one would make a good project or sporter rifle. The main difference in the models is that the M38 was built using various parts from both germany and turkey, but the K Kale was built completely in Turkey."

The gun is in very good condition, has been kept clean, and has about 120 rounds through it.  There are minor signs of use, but no notable damage or wear.

The rear sight (notch in the hammer) has been modified slightly to better line up point of aim at ~25 yards, but it's really hard to tell anything was done to it.  It still shoots pretty high at that range.  I wasn't willing to modify it further with just hand tools.  My understanding is that it's pretty normal to modify the rear sight for elevation.

Also included:
- Triple K holster - lightly used, excellent condition
- Box of 100 Hornady .451"" caliber round ball
- Box of ~80 Hornady .454"" caliber round ball (both sizes seem to work fine.  .454 is a little more accurate but a lot more effort to load)
- ~80 Remington percussion caps
- ~80 .44/.45 caliber Wonder Wads
- Nipple wrench

The revolver sells for $200 new at Cabela's when on sale.  The accessories are worth about $70 in total.

Asking $170 for everything.  Other offers considered, but I'm not in a hurry to sell, so don't waste your time with a low-ball offer.  No trades.

Pick up in Cary, or add $15 for shipping (USPS Priority).  Even though it's a black powder gun, I will need a scan or picture of your drivers license and will only ship to the address on the license.

Comes with two magazines (one brand new) a bunch of spare parts and barrel pictured below.  The parts are all Colt and will require some fitting if you plan on using them. The only thing wrong with it is that the grip safety fits a little loosely in the frame but this doesn't impact its function. There is a GI style grip safety included in the spare parts as well as a spur hammer to complement it.  She's got a little cosmetic wear but overall in great shape. From my research she was built in Spain around 2004 and imported by RSA Ocean.

It has a 1.5mm thick receiver vs. 1.0mm receiver on most stamped AK rifles and comes with a chrome lined barrel.  Unlike your standard MAK 90's, this one comes with a spring loaded firing pin, a much more pronounced feed ramp and a heavy duty recoil assembly with a thick steel rod vs two slim wire rods that are interconnected at the middle of the assembly.  I've been told that with the spring loaded firing pin etc, that it ""probably"" started as a Poly Tech but was ""neutered"" when it reached the US, but I can't confirm that so I am selling it as an exceptionally nice Chinese Mak 90.  It will also include the original sling, (1) 30 round metal magazine, (1) 30 round Tapco magazine and (1) 40 round metal magazine.  You won't be disappointed!

It has a 7-round cylinder and blued finish.  The gun is in excellent condition mechanically.  There is normal wear on the cylinder, ejector star, and a little on the front edge of the cylinder, as shown in the pictures.

Bore is shiny, and the gun is very accurate.  The long sight radius and overall weight of the gun contribute to excellent target shooting potential.  The grips and sights are also excellent.  The single action trigger and hammer pull are both very good.  The double action pull is usable but pretty heavy.  I wouldn't recommend the gun for rapid fire.  There are aftermarket scope mounts available for the Tracker series of revolvers, which is relatively uncommon in .22LR revolvers.

Asking $240.  Other offers considered, but I am in no hurry to sell the gun, so don't waste your time with a low-ball offer.  No trades.

Pick up in Cary is GREATLY preferred.  If you would like the gun shipped, you'll need to pay for the outgoing FFL fee and the shipping itself, which will probably total about $45, plus your own FFL fee when it arrives.  If picking up, I'll need a picture of your driver's license and your NC concealed handgun permit or the actual pistol purchase permit.

Rough estimate for you going and buying everything listed here in the same condition from a licensed dealer. Synthetic stock, 3 point sling already fitted, chest rig fit as well. 700 rifle and fees that come to around 150. Then speaking on the harness about 25 plus S/H. Then the mags and ammo.

845,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4268845,"For Sale:  Walther G22 Bullpup .22 LR rifle w/ laser, bipod","Cary, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina",$ 325,"Listed On: Saturday, January 30, 2016",Rifles,Walther                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"For sale is a Walther G22 rifle in excellent condition, with the laser attachment, UTG bipod, original hard case, and two original 10-round magazines.  I am the original and sole owner.

The rifle is missing its original charging handle, and I have replaced it with one that I mocked up, as you can see in the photos.  The replacement functions exactly like the original -- there's no play in it and it's comfortable to use.  I also have additional long machine screws to fit the bolt so you can make your own version with plastic or metal standoffs if you want.

Condition:
The bore is in immaculate condition, but I was unable to get a good photo of it.  There is a small patch of minor pitting on the top of the barrel where the metal is first exposed.  It's very difficult to see in person.  There's some finish wear on the barrel where it meets the red sliding safety indicators, and some wear on the ends of the disassembly pins.  Other than that, there's not really any wear or cosmetic problems to speak of.

The case (not pictured) is in good, functional condition.  It shows plenty of use, including some damage to the foam inside, but is fully functional.  I actually have been using it for lots of other smaller guns when I am not taking the G22 to the range.

History:
The gun has around 3000 rounds through it.  Bulk ammo works well.  I have had good luck with many different types of .22 LR.  Early on, it didn't like Remington Golden Bullet, but either it ""broke in"" or Remington changed their ammo, because it seems to run fine with it now.  Several months after buying the gun, I sent it off for repair because the trigger bar (connecting the trigger back to the sear) was able to bend too much, causing a ""squishy"" trigger.  Smith and Wesson replaced the part and sent it back much better.  I haven't had a problem with it since.

Overall, the gun handles and operates very well and is amazingly accurate for a semi-auto.  The main negative is that it's a pain to take apart to clean (similar to a Ruger Mark 2 or 3 in annoyance level).  The good news is that a bore snake and an external wipe-down is really all that's necessary 90% of the time.  The gun tolerates lots of internal dirt and fouling.

I'd recommend the gun for any bullpup enthusiasts or for rimfire action competitions, due to its handling characteristics and super-short overall length.

Asking $325 for everything.  Other offers considered, but I'm in no hurry to sell the rifle, so don't waste your time with a low-ball offer.  No trades.

Pick up in Cary is GREATLY preferred.  If you need it shipped, you'll need to add the cost of shipping and the outgoing FFL fee, which I would estimate at $55 total.  I'll also need a picture or scan of your driver's license, regardless of delivery method.

Thanks for looking!"

Barrel: A proprietary blend of hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" because of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons, the US Army's main machine guns in 5.56 and 7.62.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid gas system.   Mid profile  barrel is phosphate coated to mil-specs.  Barrel is High Pressure Tested (HPT), and Magnetic Particle Inspected (MPI), to ensure quality and dependability, and is finished off with an F-marked front sight base, mid-length hand guards,  and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, these uppers are made for PSA in the USA.

Bolt Carrier Group: Mil-spec shot-peened, proof tested and MPI, Carpenter 158 Steel bolt. Phosphate coated, chrome-lined M-16 style carrier.  Hardened steel key is chrome lined and properly staked.

The stock is a 6 position adjustable, with PSA logo.  The grip is standard MILSPEC.

I also mounted a PSA Aluminum back-up rear sight.

The scope and mount are new.  The scope is a Bushnell TRS 25 with a UTG RS10S3 High Profile riser mount which provides 1/3 co-witness.  You can use the sights or the red dot at the same time.  I'll deduct $75 if you don't want the Bushnell and mount.

I can email more pictures, just ask. Perry: 2zero8-3four5-55one8 or 2zero8-9four9-706one.  I can also do a Skype or FaceTime video tour.  That works really well.  Prefer local, but I'll ship to your FFL in legal states for $30 insured.  Asking $850.
Thanks for looking."
