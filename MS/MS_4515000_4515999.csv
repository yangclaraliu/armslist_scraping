I bought this 20+ years ago from a widow whose husband gave it to her for home protection AND I USED IT FOR COWBOY ACTION SHOOTING from the late 1990's 'till recently.

Pocket pistols and handguns geared towards concealed carry typically lack the features of their larger, easier to shoot service pistol counterparts. That's all changed with the introduction of the Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .380 Automatic.With an actual set of full sized adjustable sights, a practical thumb safety, and a functional slide stop, you aren't giving up anything by switching to a smaller sidearm - except the hassles of carrying a large gun. Unlike most pocket pistols, the slide on the Bodyguard .380 stays open on the last shot. Takedown and maintenance are easy, thanks to the simple to use disassembly lever.The Bodyguard is uniquely engineered to be the most state of the art, concealable and accurate personal protection handgun possible. Lightweight, simple to use, and reliable - nothing protects like a Bodyguard.Specifications and Features:.380 ACP2.75"" Barrel6 Round capacityManual thumb safetyDouble actionHigh strength polymer frameStainless steel barrel and slide, Melonite-coatedBlack finishErgonomic gripExtended finger tabStainless steel drift adjustable sightsIntegrated Insight laser sightAmbidextrous laser activation5.25"" Overall length0.75"" Wide4.1"" Tall12 OuncesE-mail or call with questions This item is new in the box comes with everything included from the manufacturerIf item is not as described we do have a 3 day return period"

The flared magwell aids in fast and reliable reloads while the extended magazine base pad provides a secure grip during loading, handling and shooting the DB FS Nine. Diamondback has incorporated a trigger safety and firing pin block safety with a short, positive reset, minimizing trigger travel for faster cycle times. A cocking indicator is located at the rear of the slide, providing visual and tactical recognition. For quick target acquisition, fixed, three-dot sights are mounted onto the stainless slide.  Both front and rear tactical serrations provide firm engagement between the user’s hand and the DB FS Nine's slide, allowing for a better grip during manipulation. The dust cover has an integrated MIL-STD1913 Picatinny rail for tactical lights, lasers and other accessories, extending its versatility for everyday carry, home defense, training or use on the range. The 4.75” Chromemoly barrel on the DB FS Nine provides a long, 6.25” sight radius, aiding the overall accuracy of the pistol during practice and competition."

Well, I've been kind of busy but I think I will pull a few out for you guys. I will only keep this ad up for a couple of weeks or so. After that they are all going back into storage. I might sell a few more towards the end of the year or in 2016 if you miss out on these. Actually, I will probably sell out of my round Tulas this time (I only have a few) so this is probably your only shot at getting one. I've seen what is coming down the pike and the Mosins that are currently commercially available look like sh*t! If you ever wanted to own a nice one for a reasonable price now is your chance.

Here is a copy of the ad I posted in March so I don't have to retype everything:

All my Izzy's are gone and since I have a few people asking I decided to put several more desirable / rare Tula's up for sale. I don't know what the production numbers were for a round receiver Tula but you hardly ever see one. I know after all these years of collecting I was only able to get my hands on a few (gotta love those big Russian stars on the receivers). These are mostly pre-war rifles (1938-1940) but likely saw battle. There are a few with rareish BRASS hand guard ends and a couple with nice factory repairs (always a plus for collectors - adds to the mystique). As always, all numbers match. First come / first served on getting to hand pick the best from the lot. If you buy a rifle I will throw in a 440 round spam can of silver tip milsurp ammo for $125. Yes, you might find a cheaper Mosin but it is well worth a few extra $$$ to get to hand pick one that you get to see instead of using mail order, paying for shipping, paying an FFL fee, and then finding out it was ran over by a tank in 1945 and is horrible looking. My rifles look great and all are still packed in cosmoline by the Russians who were waiting for WWIII to begin. Ask around, people know I have a quality collection. I will only sell a few rifles so make sure you jump on this. All rifles have matching numbers (including the bayonet !!!), a cleaning kit, and an oil/solvent canteen. Prices are extremely FIRM.

*** Oh, if you do not put I LOVE MOSIN somewhere in your email to me I will NOT reply. This is to keep the spam down. Again, if you do not put I LOVE MOSIN somewhere in your email to me I will NOT reply. ***

***** NOTE - I am looking for used 7.62x54r brass for reloading. If you shoot brass ammo please keep it instead of throwing it away and drop an email to me. I will buy it from you OR trade it for unfired military surplus rounds (silver tip). *****

From Springfield website:
The XD® 5” Full Size is designed to put the most into your hand when you need it. Built on a full size frame with a 5” barrel, this is the XD® that delivers the most in performance, capacity and controllability. Whether you’re looking for a pistol for the nightstand or the shooting range, the XD® 5"" Full Size will do the job.

The XD® 5” Full Size has all the same features found in the standard XD® line in a tactically-sized package. This XD® is as easy to shoot as you would expect it to be. The 5” barrel brings you a longer sight radius and decreased shot-to-shot recovery time. The advantages don’t stop with easy shooting, though – the XD® 5” Full Size includes everything that makes Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block give you the safety and usability that you expect in a Springfield Armory® XD®."

Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.Caliber 12 gauge 3”Barrel length 18.5""Total capacity 6+6+1Weight empty 6.9lbsWeight loaded 8.5lbsLength 26.1""Height 7""MSRP $990.00"

 Includes 1 flush fitting magazine which was stock and 2 additional extended mags that hold 8 rounds each.

 Ammo it takes per Kimber's specifications is 124gr and 147gr 9mm ammo. 
 Ran less than 50 rounds through the gun. It was my wifes CCW but she shot my new Glock 43 with Tru Glo's, talon grips and pinky extensions and other upgrades I did to it prior to the range and fell in love with it for a small 5'0 woman.  

The Kimber is snappy but accurate as with any high end ccw. 

This is the top of the food chain conceal and carry ultra concealable 9mm. 

MSRP is $815 plus $60 for the additional mags. We paid $790 OTD plus $60 for the additional mags $850 total. 

Price is $700.00 cash money. You come to Shalimar and I may take $675.00 otherwise price is as stated. 

It is ammo sensitive per Kimber so it will eat any 124gr and 147gr 9mm ammo it won't eat 115fmj. 124 is the same price and a lot of guns are ammo picky so it's nothing unusual. It's not the guns flaw it's just Kimber's design.

T380 is also good for conceal carry.  Holds 7 rounds in the mag, unlike the J.A.380's 6 round magazine.   The J.A. T-380 is based on the JA NINE and J.A. LC380 but in a slimmer package. Like the J.A. LC380, the J.A. T-380 has a easy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern.

LaRue Tactical MBT-2S Trigger
In a world of instantly M.I.M.'d rifle and pistol components, we threw on the brakes, slowed to a walk, and built 2-stage triggers out of solid S7 tool steel plates. Meticulous triggers built by our staff toolmakers ... without a stopwatch in sight.

No question, we’re particular about accuracy. Everyone knows that one of the smartest improvements an AR-owner can do to their rifle is a precision trigger upgrade. Everyone also knows that LaRue Tactical has a track-record of doing things right. The LaRue MBT-2S was purposefully designed and manufactured to render the greatest benefits from our legendary line of accurate rifles. The MBT-2S can also replace the stock trigger on any mil-spec AR lower receiver.

Sparing no expense, all major components are precision-machined from S7 Tool Steel. The result of this extra effort is a glass-smooth, hyper-consistent trigger that will satisfy even the most scrupulous competition shooter, but also be overly rugged for the battlefield. The MBT-2S breaks crisply at 4.5 lbs (2.5 lb first stage, 2 lb second stage) and has a smooth and positive reset. Made in-house, in Texas, in the USA."

-Early model IMI Mk VII Desert Eagle chambered in .44 Mag, two tone black on matte gray. Only 50 rounds put through it, it’s not broken in yet. I bought it about a year ago on consignment, unfired. Magazine was still in factory grease.  An elderly gentleman had bought one in each chambering as an investment in the ‘90s. After he passed away, his next of kin put them up for sale. 1 magazine, no box lock papers etc. Slight storage/transport wear on the muzzle."
