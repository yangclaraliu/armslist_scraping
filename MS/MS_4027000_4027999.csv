These are import banned. This AK has been fully converted to the true AK form as designed by Kalashnikov who works at the same factory where these Izhmash Saiga's are made.

Handguard is an Intrafusion Combat with all the rails for light, etc. Added is the foregrip with ejection bipod.

Scope mount is one-piece detachable which detaches in seconds and firmly re-attaches holding the scope right where it was adjusted. Scope is a brand new UTG Accushot 1-4.5x30mm with 36 color option push-button adjustable display. It is zero'd in at 100 yards.

Gun shoots amazingly well and is among one of the lightest guns you’ll ever hold. If you know Benelli, you know what you’re getting. It has the Intertia driven system resulting in easy maintenance, easy break down, and flawless performance. The gun comes with 4 Benelli chokes and the choke tool to install and uninstall them.

This gun is perfect for the all-around hunter. You can hunt deer, you can hunt turkey, you can hunt dove/quail, you can shoot clays. This gun will do it all.

Plus, I'll include or throw in a couple of brand new HKS speed loaders with the gun. Bought this gun a few months ago for my wife for her CCW. But she decided to get something else. The gun just sat in the safe. So, off it goes, and there's nothing wrong with the gun. I'm just not much into revolvers, and my wife found another gun to carry. Must be at least 21 years old + and be a Kentucky resident with proper ID to buy or trade this gun. CCDW preferred but not required. No shipping out of state.  * Note; black tape on the gun is just to cover the serial # for security reason. Just a tape, and not permanent. $350 firm. Thanks for looking.

That's what firm meant = like my ad/posting says, $350 ""firm"" - won't take less than $350 cash price. Evidently some people don't understand a simple English word ""firm.""

The .22LR Kalashnikov manufactured by GSG represents much more than a small caliber knock-off of a famous rifle. The GSG-AK47 is not only a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate, but it actually bears the name Kalashnikov.This Rebel model even has hand weathered wooden furniture with tape and bandana added. GSG is currently the only company in the entire world licensed by Mr. Kalashnikov to manufacture real, functioning firearms, and they have not taken this opportunity lightly. Specifications: - Action: Semi-Automatic - Caliber: 22 Long Rifle - Barrel Length: 16.5"" - Capacity: 24+1 - Safety: Lever - Trigger: Standard - Stock: Wood - Finish: Matte - Overall Length: 33.5""

This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).
With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.

This is a KF date code gun which means it was built in 1995 and makes it one of the most desirable P220s made (the 1994-1998's are considered the cream of the crop for the P220 series pistols.) The pistol is all #'s matching and I do have the original Grey Sig case with papers, test target, etc. I will include at least 5 magazines (more if I can find them), two factory dovetail, one factory stainless and two MecGar mags. The gun is also wearing Trijicon night sites that glow reasonably well. 

This gun has been shot and has some honest holster wear, but always taken care of and cleaned/conditioned with Frog Lube. I had the barrel and guide rod TiN coated (cost me $150-$175 If I recall correctly), I also have a few sets of grips I will include (The wood ones pictured on it, a set of rubber Hogue grips and a set of black checkered stock grips.) I also a galco Kydex/leather holster I will include that I have carried maybe 3 times (incredibly comfortable).

I am looking for $675 and can meet you within a reasonable distance of 19038 (Kings, Claytons, American Arms, etc). Only partial trades I would be interested in is a quality rail for an AR, keymod or M-LOK preferred and as I do not have an A2 front sight I would prefer 13""+. I would also possibly be interested in a drop in AR trigger (Geissele, CMC, etc).

All Eclipse pistols have Meprolight night sights. The Eclipse Target II and Eclipse Pro Target II have an adjustable bar/dot night sight system. All other models have fixed, low-profile three dot (green) night sights securely mounted in dovetails.

All Kimber pistols have beveled slide serrations that will not snag. The brush-polished Eclipse finish combines with matte black small parts to create a stunning appearance, and the stainless steel slide and frame ensure resistance to the elements.

Eclipse pistols feature 30 lines-per-inch front strap checkering from the Kimber Custom Shop for a positive grip, even with cold or wet hands. Laminated gray/black grip panels are checkered in the traditional double diamond pattern and compliment the finish.

The true beauty of Eclipse pistols is in their performance. Match grade barrels and triggers ensure the level of accuracy that made Kimber the world’s most popular 1911. Breech faces are polished for dependable feeding, and slide and magazine releases are checkered for fast, reliable operation. The Eclipse Pro Target II is the only 4-inch Kimber with an adjustable sight, and the Eclipse Ultra II is the only 3-inch Kimber with a stainless steel frame. Still, performance never looked this good."

NIB Thompson Center ICON with brand new Leupold VX2  2X7.  Just back from factory for safety recall work which was done and certified.
Besides beautiful, it is one of the finest .243 caliber rifles on the planet.  The 24 inch barrel is beyond match grade; it is a 5R, which means five lands that are radius cut for improved velocity and attenuated barrel wear. The receiver is milled from a solid block of steel, and the weaver/picatinny rails are machined as the top part of the receiver which in turn  is anchored to the stock with an internal aluminum frame. Yes, you can slide a dollar bill the length of the barrel.  Amazing trigger- beautiful walnut wood to metal fit.

IF you are interested in a package, it will come with a rubber style stabilizer, a hoyt drop away rest which is really really nice, kind of a capture style(like a whisker bisket)/drop away hybrid.  It has an Axcel 4 pin sight.  This excellent sight allows you to tune each pin independently which is a really really nice feature for those long shots.  There is also a little illuminator on the sight that will just need batteries, I have some for it and will include.  It also comes with a tight spot quick detach quiver.  Very low profile and removes super quick and easy.  I have 3 Victory VAP arrows for it, as well as 3-4 Slick Trick Magnum Broadheads that I will include. I think I also still have 2-3 of the Gobbler Guilotine broadheads I will include and I may have an arrow or two that is longer and stiffer for use with the gobbler heads.  Included is also the plano hardcase shown in the pictures.  I peep is starting to rotate a bit in relation to the D-loop since the D-loop is loosing a bit, but that will be fixed whenever you take it to the nearest Hoyt Dealer to get it set up for your draw length, weight, peep location and nock point location for whatever arrows you want to use in case you don't like the Victories.  Also comes with a very nice release.  All of this as a package for $700.  Willing to ship but buyer will have to cover shipping.  Text 785-sevensixzero-2281."

I bought this, new, while living in Virginia last year.

Unlike compliant guns (cough S&W M&P cough) it has a crisp, light trigger.

It is estimated that this gun was manufactured around ~2010.

According to Zastava's website, M88's were designed in 1988, based on the Tokarev, designed for defense and recreation.

Round count is ~600. During my torture test, which included high round count and not cleaning the gun, it had very rare stovepipe-jams on P+/HP's only, which were easily cleared by pulling the slide."

Great to keep children or anyone for that matter away from your pistol.

I'm only selling it because I already have two other AR's chambered in 300BLK and don't really need a third one as much as I originally thought I did. I've only put 40 rounds though it to verify functionality and it was perfect. It will cycle subs and supers no problem. This gun is very compact and very lightweight. 

Cash is king. I’d also be happy to trade, but I’m not interested in giving this away. Trades for lesser value guns will require cash to make up the difference.  I do have a valid MI CPL."

Up for sale is a new armasight CO-Mini ID Night Vision Mini Clip-On System Gen 2+. This can be used as a monocular or mounted in front of your scope. Want a night vision scope? Those are big money, but now you can have that and more.

Auto brightness control
Simple and quick conversion of daytime scope to night vision
Mounts in front of any daytime scope with no rezeroing required
Powered by a single alkaline 1.5V AA or 3V CR123A lithium battery
No export outside of the US

Designed for short-to-medium ranges, the Armasight CO-Mini ID is the most compact commercially available Clip-On Night Vision Device. The CO-Mini ID uses image intensification technology and is designed to convert most low-to-mid power daytime sights, scopes, or binoculars to operate at night. The CO-Mini ID can be mounted in seconds and without tools. It can be attached in front of a day rifle scope (using its quick release Picatinny mount) or directly onto the day scope (or binocular/telescope) objective lens with an optional adapter. CO-Mini is suitable for use with most commercial and military specification day time sights, telescopes or binoculars (up to 6X magnification). Because the CO-Mini ID is mounted in front of your own day scope, the shooters eye relief is not altered, and shot release and follow through all remain intuitive. The clip-on device is factory bore-sighted to better than 1 MOA accuracy, so no alteration in zero is experienced. The Armasight CO-Mini ID is intended primarily for use by the most demanding hunter or short range assaulter, where field of view and ease of use is more important than high magnification. Whether your day scope is a well known brand or not, the Armasight CO-Mini ID will work just as well at magnifications 2-6X. The Armasight CO-Mini ID utilizes a high performance Improved Definition Gen 2+ image tube providing resolution of 47-54 lp/mm. The CO-Mini brings high quality clip-on night vision within everyone's reach.
