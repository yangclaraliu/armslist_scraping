Beautiful wood furniture and with Norinco you know you get the Quality that you know that you need.The model name MAK-90 stands for Modified AK-1990.This was because AK rifles with pistol grips, folding stocks, threaded muzzles and bayonets were banned from importation to the USA in 1989. The first AK rifles imported in 1990 after the ban were modified by replacing the the pistol grip and stock with a one piece wooden thumbhole stock. The threaded end of the barrel had a muzzle nut screwed on to cover the threads and some were tack welded on. The bayonet lug was ground down so a bayonet wouldn't lock on. The model name was ground off and the modified rifle had the new model name MAK-90 stamped on them. Some had 90 added to the serial number that denoted the year of import. The MAK-90 rifles imported after 1990 had the threads on the muzzle turned off and a 2 digit year of import stamped in front of or in back of the serial number. Some have a space or dash between the serial number and 2 digit year of import stamping. There were a half dozen or so companies that imported MAK-90 rifles. The importers company name, city and state will be stamped on one side or the bottom of the receiver. Some had it stamped on the barrel between the gas block and front sight."

The AK-74 is an adaptation of the 7.62×39mm AKM assault rifle and features several important design improvements.[8] These improvements were primarily the result of converting the rifle to the intermediate-caliber high velocity 5.45×39mm cartridge. In fact, some early models are reported to have been converted AKMs, re-barreled to 5.45×39mm.[12] Compared to the preceding AKM the AK-74 has better effective range, firing accuracy (a main development goal) and reliability. The AK-74 and AKM share an approximate 50% parts commonality (interchangeable most often are pins, springs and screws)As far as why choose the 5.45x39 caliber?(aside from price)Relatively small sized, light weight, high velocity military service cartridges like the 5.45×39mm allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared to their larger and heavier predecessor cartridges and produce relatively low bolt thrust and free recoil impulse, favouring light weight arms design and automatic fire accuracy.[15] Tests measured the free recoil energy delivered by the 5.45×39mm AK-74 rifle at 3.39 J (2.50 ft·lb), compared to 7.19 J (5.30 ft·lb) delivered by the 7.62×39mm in the AKM.[16]Early 5.45×39mm ballistics tests demonstrated a pronounced tumbling effect with high speed cameras.[17] Some Western authorities believed this bullet was designed to tumble in flesh to increase wounding potential. At the time, it was believed that yawing and cavitation of projectiles were primarily responsible for tissue damage. Martin Fackler conducted a study with an AK-74 assault rifle using live pigs and ballistic gelatin; ""The result of our preset test indicate that the AK-74 bullet acts in the manner expected of a full-metal-cased military ammunition - it does not deform or fragment when striking soft tissues"".[18] Most organs and tissue were too flexible to be severely damaged by the temporary cavity effect caused by yaw and cavitation of a projectile. With the 5.45 mm bullet, tumbling produced a temporary cavity twice, at depths of 100 mm (3.9 in) and 350 mm (13.8 in). This is similar to (but more rapid than) modern 7.62×39mm ammunition and to (non-fragmenting) 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition."

Late 80's model. Great barrel rifling, lots of life left in this little pocket banger. Double action only, very smooth trigger and at my estimate (I don't have a gauge) it's probably about 9 lbs. Like butter and clicks right into action. It's got a set of very comfortable pink Hogue grips on it, perfect for a wife, girlfriend, or daughter. The gun has just enough weight to manage recoil and is all stainless. They don't make them like this anymore, this is also collectible as some folks like to call it, because of the absence of a locking mechanism on the newer smiths. It may not matter to you unless you are a collector, but it does add value. 

I'm asking $525, but will consider offers. I'm really looking for cash to pay down some credit card bills, so I'm not particularly interested in trades.

We have been on Youtube now for almost a year and a half and it is growing. We mostly do concealed carry pistols and or really any kind of pistol. We need guns for reviews and have done this very successfully in the past. It may seem a little crazy to loan a gun to someone but we are legit and I would encourage everyone to check us out. Our Youtube name is Hegshot87. The way we have done this in the past is basically sign a contract to keep the pistol for a week or two which is generally the time needed to do a good review. We will not ruin our rep on Youtube and make sure that you have all of our info. The most popular guns are 9mm and 45s of any make so  If you would like to contact me at this email or REDACTED Also you can contact me at 843 five 01-3101.

I bought this gun and it had a manufacturing defect that caused the safety retention pin to fall out while I was shooting it, and it wreaked havoc inside the gun.

I sent the gun to Kimber to have it repaired and they replaced the Slide, Barrel, Extractor,  Sear, Trigger Spring, Trigger pin, and Firing Pin Spring. This is basically a brand new gun. Kimber put 4 magazines through the gun to test it, and it has not been fired since.

While the Kimber was being worked on, I bought a cheaper pistol for my daily carry, and now that the Kimber is back, it doesnt have a place in my collection and I would like to recoup some of the costs. There are some sight blemishes in the frame finish, but this is mechanically a brand new gun. Apparently I can only post 1 picture, but I will send pictures of the slight blemishes and the documentation of the rebuild upon request.

Price is $625 obo. I am not currently interested in any trades, full or partial. I am willing to negotiate on the gun some, hence the OBO, but please dont lowball me and expect to get it for $300

The picture shows these grips on it, I have since changed the grips to the Hogue rubber finger groove grips with stainless hex head screws. The E2 grip is also included in the box. I have also added a bright solid stainless steel guide rod and the original steel guide rod is also included. There is nothing wrong with this gun, I am just looking for a lighter carry gun. I sold all my carry guns and started carrying this Sig, but it is just too big to carry for my body type. I do not need to sell, just seeing what offers I can get as I will not give this away. I am located in the Margate/Coral Springs area and would like to keep this local, might travel for a great trade or cash offer. I also have ammo available if the trade is for another caliber or for sale with a cash offer. 21 and over please with a CWP preferred but not a deal breaker.

911,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4666911,For Sale:  USMC OKC - 3S Bayonet Combat Knife USGI,"Akron/Medina, Cleveland, Ohio",$ 80,"Listed On: Wednesday, November 11, 2015",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Nice veteran issued knife.  Good condition fully serviceable.  Hard to find US Marine Corp fighting knife.

The OKC-3S is manufactured solely by the Ontario Knife Company and identical civilian versions are available for purchase. It bears a resemblance to the Marines' iconic Ka-Bar fighting knife, though it is not fullered. It is larger, thicker and heavier than the M7 although slightly thinner and lighter than the current US Army issued M9. A sharper point helps penetrate body armor that many modern adversaries wear; while serrations near the handle help improve its function as a utility knife. In one demonstration, a prototype was able to pierce a punching bag covered with aircraft aluminum and a ballistic vest. The entire weapon is designed to be corrosion resistant, and weighs 1.25 lb (0.57 kg) with its sheath. The scabbard and grip are colored to match the Corps' coyote tan gear, compatible with both woodland and desert camouflage. The NATO Stock Number is 1095-01-521-6087.

The OKC-3S features an 8 in (20.32 cm) long, 1.375 in (3.49 cm) wide, .2 in (0.51 cm) thick blade. The serrations measure 1.75 in (4.4 cm) of the blade length on the true edge. The blade is made from high carbon steel rated at HRC 53-58 and is capable of functioning without breakage in operating temperatures of −25 to 135 °F (−32 to 57 °C). The blade also has a non-reflective phosphate finish.

The grip is made of Dynaflex, a synthetic non-slip material, is ergonomically grooved, and is more oval than round. This design helps prevent repetitive-strain injuries and hand fatigue during training. It also features an embossed Eagle, Globe, and Anchor molded in to allow a user to identify the direction of the blade in the dark. The full tang connects the cross guard/muzzle ring (which is .165 in (0.42 cm)) and pommel latch plate that clasps the barrel lug; both are phosphate coated like the blade. Former Ontario Knife Company president and chief executive Nick Trbovich Jr. said of it: ""We spent a lot of time making sure the handle was ergonomically correct… There are no blister points on the handle. The Marines are the best and they deserve the best.""[1]

The polyester elastomer scabbard, designed by Natick Labs, offers a weight and noise reduction from the previous M7 Scabbard and is ILBE compatible. It has a fitted internal stainless steel spring and friction device at its throat to secure the bayonet. A ceramic-coated aluminium honing rod is located on the back of the scabbard. The scabbard is compatible with the MOLLE/PALS modular attachment system."
