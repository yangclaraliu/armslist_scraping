These incredible pistols feature a 4.9″ barrel, Blued slide, 15+1 round capacity, thumb safety/ decocker lever, three-dot sights, and rubber grips. Made in Italy.
 
Accurate out of the box, this workhorse features an open slide design that virtually eliminates jamming, a safety system that combines decocking with a positive thumb safety and a combat muzzle crown.
 
The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and time-proven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them.
 
BERETTA U.S.A. RELIABILITY AND DURABILITY STATISTICS FOR THE BERETTA 9mm PISTOL:
• The average reliability of all M9 pistols tested at Beretta U.S.A. is 17,500 rounds without a stoppage.
• During one test of twelve pistols fired at Beretta U.S.A. before Army supervision, Beretta-made M9 pistols shot 168,000 rounds without a single malfunction.
• The Beretta 9mm pistol was the most reliable of all pistols tested in the 1984 competition which resulted in the award of the M9 contract to Beretta.
• Two-thirds of all M9 pistols endurance tested at Beretta U.S.A. fired 5,000 rounds without a single mal function or, at most, with only one malfunction.
• The average durability of Beretta M9 slides is over 35,000 rounds, the point at which U.S. Army testing ceases.
• The average durability of M9 frames is over 30,000 rounds. The average durability of M9 locking blocks is 22,000 rounds.

The CZ 85 Combat version was created as an extension of the CZ 85 B with some additional features. The CZ 85 Combat adds a fully adjustable rear sight, extended magazine release, drop-free magazine and overtravel adjustment on the trigger. The Combat designation comes from the lack of a firing pin block safety, allowing the replacement of the firing pin without tools.
The rear sight is adjustable for elevation and windage, and the trigger for overtravel regulation. An extended magazine catch, elimination of the magazine brake and ambidextrous controlling elements directly predispose this model for sport shooting competitions.
Ambidextrous features include safety levers, slide stop levers and a reversible magazine release. The lack of a firing pin safety gives the 85 Combat a slight advantage in the trigger pull department, making it a long-time favorite of competition shooters.
  We have 1 in stock, and have them priced to sell quickly for just $579 each.  Type : PistolAction : Single / DoubleCaliber : 9mmBarrel Length : 4.7″Capacity : 16 + 1Safety : AmbidextrousGrips : Black SyntheticSights : FixedWeight : 2.2 lbsFinish : Black"

Has minor cosmetic holster wear at muzzle, but a very solid gun with an excellent trigger.  It's easy to shoot accurately. It's definitely classy looking, has good proportions, nice wood grips.

Price is firm, it's worth it.

Light enough to carry around in the woods, but heavy enough that shooting 357s out of it isn't unpleasant.  Grips are comfortable for a large range of hand sizes.  This is an excellent kicking around outdoors or home defense gun, and a lot of fun to shoot at the range. Could be a concealed carry with the right holster, but t's a little on the large side carrying every day.

Nothing wrong with it, I just got a different revolver that is my primary shooter now. This gun has good balance, a nice trigger, and is easy to shoot accurately. 

If you are a new gun owner, we can meet at the gun club in Muskego and I'll walk you through operation and safety.  I'm a DNR Hunter Safety instructor and want you to be a safe and responsible gun owner.

The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.. GEN 4 Features: The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested ""Safe Action"" system, Durable exterior finish, Cold hammer forged barrel, Durability, Reliability, Light weight, ....that make GLOCK firearms famous! The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin. The grip angle of the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol. The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts. Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps. Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol. THE PEARCE FRAME CAVITY INSERT FITS BOTH ADJUSTABLE BACKSTRAPS. Features: Gen4 G23, (2) 13rd Magazines, Reversible magazine catch, Rough Textured Frame, 2 Back Straps, Revolutionary ""Safe Action"" Design."

Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance.  Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. SIGLITE® night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous.  Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol"

4 1/4"" barrel, 1911 commander style stainless carry pistol with ambi thumb safety. Factory original with bright fixed night sights dated 2007. All steel construction, no plastic parts or firing pin safety. This pistol is very tight and solidly built. It also has the best trigger of any 1911 I've owned. It is in perfect condition, aside from 2 very very faint lines below the ejection port, which I could not get to show up on camera. You will not be disappointed with this fantastic pistol. Any deals are contingent on your inspection in person and satisfaction.
Comes with 2 factory magazines and an Ed Brown soft case. Will sell to legal AL residents face to face through FFL. Thanks!

This was a surplus unit from a south American police department so it's likely been carried a lot but not shot all that much.  I've owned it a few years and it doesn't get used much so time for it to go.

It's small enough to carry with an IWB holster.  Would be a good home defense or carry gun for someone on a budget that prefers a revolver.  

I'll add pics shortly, but it's a 6 shot revolver with some bluing wear, wood grips, 4"" barrel.

If you are a new gun owner, we could meet at the gun club in Muskego and go through safety and operation of the gun if you purchase it.  (Not judging, just a lot of new owners seem to gravitate to less expensive weapons).  I'm a DNR Hunter Safety instructor and want you to be a safe and responsible gun owner. 

Prefer to sell to CCW holder.  If you are shady/underage/insane/prohibited don't even bother.

- I do not have the original box for this

This is from my AR-50 .50 BMG rifle that I bought 10 years ago.  I knew the original owner, who never got to shoot it before he died.  I put about 20 - 30 rounds through the rifle/scope (not a lot of places to shoot .50 BMG).

I sold the rifle about 2 years ago, and have no plans to get into any type of long range shooting (I just sold both of my M-14s, and plan to concentrate on .22 LR and AR-15).  So this scope has just been sitting around in storage.

This scope does NOT have the ""Zero Stop"" feature found in newer Nightforce scopes.

In his autobiography ""American Sniper"", Chris Kyle wrote that “Scopes are an important part of the weapon system. Overseas, I used a 32-power scope. As a SEAL, I used Nightforce scopes. They have very clear glass, and they’re extremely durable under terrible conditions. They always held their zero for me.""  (chapter 5)

The ultimate long range riflescope. Its 56mm objective lens provides
maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range.
The most advanced field tactical scopes ever produced, the wide
magnification factor of our 5.5-22 series allows precision accuracy at
the longest ranges, yet at 5.5 power remains highly effective for
shots at close ranges. Nightforce was the first company committed to
perfecting extreme magnification variable power scopes. Our years of
experience perfecting long-range optics is evident in every scope we
build.

Product DescriptionDesigned in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.
The 75 B features a steel frame, a black polycoat finish, 3 dot sights, and, of course, the ergonomics and DA/SA action that have made it the most copied handgun design second only to the 1911. The ‘B’ designation is an indicator that the model is equipped with a firing pin block safety.
CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.
