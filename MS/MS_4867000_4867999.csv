These shotguns share the same classic lines, craftsmanship and reliability associated with so-called ""high end"" over-and-unders without the high-end price tag. At the heart of every Reserve Series shotgun is an underlock design, boxlock action for superior strength, and a low-profile. Precision machining keeps the action completely closed-dirt and debris doesn't get into the receiver, reducing wear and maintenance, while manual extractors provide a smooth, effortless operation of the action. Every 12, 20 gauge Silver Reserve Series shotgun is equipped with five interchangeable choke tubes and wrench, providing the ultimate in versatility.

Do NOT expect all your extras to get you a crap ton of extra money.  They are EXTRAS that you put into YOUR investment that other most likely won't care for.  That's like adding a car stereo to your ride and expecting what you spent for YOUR preference.

Example:  Joe Schmuckatelly posts a glock 23 with 7 holsters and expects people to buy everything for $850 and will not part OMG I can buy a new one for $550 OTD and buy a decent holster for $40.  Used its worth $500 WITH the holster... So ask $550... But $850?  Man alive just sell the holsters separate.

Example:  Ditzy Blonde posts Glock 17 with ""custom"" stipling... MANY don't like stipling so why expect an additional $100 in value for your tainted plastic?  The gun is literally ruined in most instances when you burn into it or God forbid CHOP THE GRIP to fit Glock 19 mags.... BUY A GLOCK 19 if you want those mags!!! 

Example:  Biggie Smalls posts an M&P 9 FDE and asks $150 more then the gun costs new because it has NS and its that pretty tan color BUT USED.  Well if I buy the gun NEW at $150 less in a RANGE PACKAGE do you think I won't buy my own NS for $80-100 for a NEW gun for the same price???  

Example:  Don Smackahoe builds an AR from low end forged parts and calls it CUSTOM because he built it ($580).  Adds flip up sights and an eBay rail and expects $900 for it.  Nothing beats factory except HIGH end components and building experience.  No stock plinker is worth more then $650.... Period.

Look people, armslist was designed for 2nd amendment lovers who enjoy guns to share their toys with others and possibly turn a minimal profit on occasions... So when you do anything like the aforementioned you are doing a disgrace to the site and your rep.  FFL fees are often overlooked.  Discount your toys enough to have the buyer cover this fee or meet it in middle.

Expect and post fair and honest numbers and you'll move your ""precious"" toys.  For those that have posts up for over a month, check yourself for higher then reasonable expectations or pricing, or your trying to land a crook. 

For those that respect the site and the pro gun folks on it, cheers to you.  For those that insult people with fair offers because you think you have a gem (yah FDE is SOOOOO precious) A HUGE salute to you .l.

Glock pistols are the perfect combination of reliability and accuracy. Their high-tech engineering and construction create a handgun that can stand up to more punishment than even the most unforgiving conditions can generate. Glock Pistol's Safe Action trigger system offers several benefits over conventional double action pistols. First you can choose from several trigger pulls. Second, the trigger is the one and only operative control. Third, is the smooth and consistent pull you feel every time you squeeze the trigger. Glocks have about 50% fewer components than conventional handguns of these calibers. The G17 has only 34 parts. A couple of pins. No screws. So there are fewer parts. The Glock pistol can with stand temperatures ranging from-40C to 200C and still come out firing.

Uses aluminum magazines, it will come with four, a folding wire stock and resin impregnated plywood furniture.  Weight is about a pound less than a milled AK.  Trigger system is a striker.  My understanding is these are no longer being brought in the country, all the parts kits are used up and the Czechs aren't making them anymore.

I'm presuming this one to be a post-war refurb in a laminate stock. All numbers match, but bolt handle is a force match. This M44 is in very good condition with a good bore. It has not been counter-bored, the lands and grooves are excellent, and the bore is dark / frosted (like most). The laminated stock is odd in that it isn't slathered with shellac AND it has a matching serial number stamped into the butt. No refurb stamp / mark that I could find, but this is the only one I've seen with a serial number stamped into it. CAI import mark on left receiver. Acquired this through a trade and I've never fired it. An excellent collectible M44! I will add some 7.62x54R ammo and a few assorted cleaning tool parts, but don't have a sling. $250  Tel: 6 THREE 6 _ 9 TWO 6 _ 3 NINE 7 2"

Both ends of the pins have a swaged chamfer and are perfectly square, making them much easier to install than conventional roll pins. Once you used these pins you will never go back to the old style.

Unique Features of Spirol Coiled Roll Pins

Equal Stress Distribution
Stresses imparted to the pin during installation compression as well as stresses resulting from applied loads are distributed equally throughout the pin's cross section. This concept and uniform flexing and strength are related and inherent features of the spiral design. Stress concentration results in a weak point where progressive shear failure starts and premature fatigue occurs. SPIROL Coiled Pins have no weak points.

Uniform Strength and Flexibility
The shear strength and flexibility of SPIROL's Coiled Pin is not affected by the direction of force. Compression causes the pin to coil from the outer edge inwardly towards the center. As the pressure is relieved, which happens in shock and vibration, the pin action reverses thereby maintaining a constant radial force. Application of an excessive load results in compression into a solid tube. Further loading causes shear failure. In properly engineered applications, this condition should not occur.

Absorbs Shock and Vibration
The SPIROL Coiled Pin design represents broad design latitude in the control and development of pin flexibility. The engineered flexibility of SPIROL Coiled Pins provides for compression of the pin into the hole and for continued flexibility after insertion. Without this flexibility, the total load applied to the pin would be transmitted to the hole wall without dampening the impact. Since the host material is normally softer than the pin, elongation or enlargement of the hole would result. The fit between the hole and the pin would become loose, increasing the impact force and accelerating the rate of hole damage. The inevitable result would be premature failure of the assembly. In properly engineered applications, the flexibility of SPIROL Coiled Pins dampens shock and vibration, thus eliminating hole damage to all the components of the assembly resulting in maximum product life. The smooth, concentric chamfer combined with square, clean-cut ends translates into trouble-free installation. Inward motion from compression Reverse motion when pressure is relieved.

Square Ends
SPIROL Coiled Pins have clean, square cut ends. This has a substantial impact on trouble-free automatic installation as the square ends enable the pin to align itself with the installation punch/quill to ensure the pin remains straight as it is inserted into the hole. The cleancut ends also impart a quality image to the assembly.

Swaged Chamfers
SPIROL Coiled Pins have a smooth, concentric lead-in chamfer with a radius which blends into the diameter of the pin. There are no sharp angles or edges to bite into the hole wall. The swaged chamfer provides maximum compression leverage with minimum thrust resistance to ease insertion. The chamfer concentricity assists in alignment of holes. Only Coiled Pins utilize the coiled spring concept; a recognized superior pin design. This imparts to SPIROL Coiled Pins unique features not found in other Spring Pins or Solid Pins. More than fasteners, SPIROL Coiled Pins are also shock absorbing elements which are integral, active components of a total assembly. There are other pinning methods, but when the total assembly's manufacturing cost, quality and useful life are important, the pin of choice is the SPIROL Coiled Pin.

Closer Diameter Tolerances
SPIROL Coiled Pins have a closer diameter tolerance than any other Spring Pin. At least 270° of the outer circumference is within the specified tolerance range. The minimum diameter is not averaged, as is the case with other Spring Pins. The edge of the seam is designed to be tucked below the hole diameter to prevent the edge from contacting the host. These factors combine to make SPIROL Coiled Pins ideal for hinge, axle, and dowel applications.

Other Advantages
Lower Insertion Pressure -- Radial Tension
Standard and light duty SPIROL Coiled Pins require less pressure to insert than other Spring Pins. In addition, these pins exert less radial tension, an important factor where holes are in thin sections or close to an edge. It is also important when using soft, weak or brittle materials such as aluminum or plastic. The benefit is lower component damage and fewer rejects. An added benefit to lower insertion force is insertion machinery can use smaller cylinders, and if manually installed, the assembler is less subject to fatigue or repetitive motion syndrome.

Conforms to Hole
The thin gauge material and the 2¼ coiled construction gives the pin a greater inherent ability to conform itself radially and longitudinally to the hole wall. It can be used in out-of-round and tapered holes without negatively affecting its performance. SPIROL Coiled Pins develop a mean radial pressure without excessive high points which would result in hole damage upon insertion or under loading. Other types of Spring Pins typically have three points of contact between the pin and the hole which results in focused stress over a limited contact surface area. On the contrary, SPIROL Coiled Pins maximize contact between the pin and the hole resulting in better load distribution and reduced possibility of hole damage.

Reusable
When driven from a hole, the SPIROL Coiled Pin expands towards its original diameter. The same pin may be reused in the same hole.
Wider Hole Tolerance Range
SPIROL Coiled Pins can be installed in holes with a wide diameter tolerance. Holes can be drilled according to normal shop practices, drills can be used longer, and the feed rate of the drills can be maximized. Drilling can be eliminated completely by utilizing molded, cast, and stamped holes. No secondary hole preparation is necessary to be able to use a Coiled Pin.

Straightness
Although the straightness specifications are technically the same, carbon steel Coiled Pins of longer length in relationship to diameter are straighter than roll-formed Slotted Pins. The stresses imparted during the heat treating process distort long Slotted Pins into a ""banana shape"" caused by the material stretching at the slot and contracting 180º opposite the slot. Straightness is important in numerous applications and for trouble-free insertion."

Yes, it is really a pistol. The barrel is too short for it to be considered a rifle and there is no butt-stock for it to be considered a short barrel rifle. Instead of a butt-stock, it has a forearm strap. 

It fires 5.56 NATO rounds just like any AR. Futhermore, the gass exhaust is placed at the front of the gun. Normally ARs have it towards the back, which is annoying because some of the escaped gasses are blasted towards your eye. With the gass exhaust being in the front in this model, it solves that problem. 

It comes with a SureFire muzzle break that runs at 150.00. 
SureFire SOCOM muzzle brakes, featuring precision stainless steel construction and an Ionbond DLC coating, deliver superior recoil and muzzle-rise reduction, permitting faster follow-up shots. They also serve as adapters for mounting SOCOM Series Fast-Attach® sound suppressors (silencers).

It also comes with EOTech 552 holographic sights which run at 569.00. In addition to this, it also comes with ALL WEATHER TACTICAL carrying case.

I've notice that my gun sells between 1,500-1,700 on this website. So I figure if it sells used between 1,200 and 1,300, coming with all of the attachments I figure 1,600 is a fair price."
