The GLOCK 31 in .357 SIG delivers the same legendary stopping power as the old Magnum with faster delivery of many more shots with less recoil and better trigger pull thanks to the modern GLOCK ergonomics. This handgun has a 4.49"" barrel and the magazine holds 15 rounds. The Gen 4 GLOCk allows the shooter to add multiple back straps to the frame. Internally, the Gen 4 GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed operators.

Glock 23 Gen 4 Semi-automatic Double Action Only Compact 40 S&W 4.02"" Polymer Matte 13Rd 3 Mags Fired Case Right Hand Fixed Sights PG2350203The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.. GEN 4 Features: The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested ""Safe Action"" system, Durable exterior finish, Cold hammer forged barrel, Durability, Reliability, Light weight, ....that make GLOCK firearms famous! The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin. The grip angle of the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol. The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts. Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps. Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol. THE PEARCE FRAME CAVITY INSERT FITS BOTH ADJUSTABLE BACKSTRAPS. Features: Gen4 G23, (2) 13rd Magazines, Reversible magazine catch, Rough Textured Frame, 2 Back Straps, Revolutionary ""Safe Action"" Design."

P30L
Introduced in 2008, the P30L (for Long), has a slide and barrel that measure approximately a half-inch longer in length. Otherwise the P30L is essentially identical to the P30.
Like the P30, the P30L was designed as a modern police and security pistol and combines optimal function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstraps inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user.
Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases, magazine release levers, and a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame (for applicable variants). A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator providing a reminder of a loaded chamber that can be subtly seen and felt. The standard P30L is a 9 mm “Variant 3 (V3)” with a conventional double-action/single action trigger mode with a serrated decocking button on the rear of the slide.
P30LS models have the features of the “L” model with the addition of an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. LS models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode with decocking button (“V3S” 9 mm and .40 S&W) and with HK’s enhanced double action only “V2” Law Enforcement Modification trigger. A special “V1” lightweight trigger pull model of the Law Enforcement Modification is also available.
Extensively tested, P30L and P30LS models have been adopted by several international police and security agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30L naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions."

The P30 is one of the most advanced police pistols of all time. During it's development the most important requirements were flexibility, functionality and safety. Ergonomics of the grip have been improved by interchangeable backstraps and side panel inserts. In combination with the ambidextrous operating controls, this pistol can be individually adapted to almost any user. No compromises have been made regarding safety. The P30 V3 has a traditional double action/single action trigger system with a decocking button at the rear of the slide and a firing pin block safety that eliminate the need for a manual safety. Its advanced loaded chamber indicator, which is easily seen and felt, positively indicates a loaded chamber.

This 130gr., hard cast, 327 Federal load, is the direct result of customer request for such a load. It is designed primarily as an 'outdoor' load as it penetrates deeply and does not expand. It will perforate a large bear's skull and will also serve well for any application that requires very deep penetration. This load utilizes flash suppressed powder, so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire should he need to fire in low light situations."

I bought this pistol about 6 years ago from a dealer who advised that he got it directly from H&K, and that they told him that it was an un-issued, un-fired pistol.  I have never fired the weapon as it has remained in my safe in it's factory box.  I looked the pistol over carefully before buying it and it appeared that it hadn't been carried in a holster or fired, other then factory test firing.  It does have the typical milling hash done by H&K on the right side of the slide where the agency crest was removed. All the H&K tools for maintaining the weapon are in the box, as is the owners manual.  These pistols are probably the best made when it comes to factory production weapons, with the usual German precision and attention to detail.  Very accurate and reliable.  Partial trades considered.  CASH only, face to faced with S.C. residents with valid divers license and CWP, or we go to my local FFL holder and run the check.

Comes in factory case with compact and extended magazine, and an extra extended magazine.  It has a Pearce pinky extension to the shorter magazine which makes this thing fit perfectly.
Plus all the stuff that Springfield gives you...different sized backstraps, different sized slip on grips for the extended mags, holster, magazine holder, ez loader, lock, manual, etc.

Excellent fit and finish on this gun. Great features including match grade barrel, melonite finish, short reset trigger and multiple backstraps.  This is like two guns in one. With the shorter mag it can easily be used as CCW. with the longer mag it is more like a full service weapon.

I've only run two boxes of brass through it, with no problems at all.  Excellent gun.

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

It will adjust to a very large person, down to a small frame individual. The holster itself will cant to 3 different positions, allowing you to carry it as you wish. The mag holder will also do the same, and will carry 2 double stack 45 cal. mags to a single stack 9mm. 
 The holster itself is interchangeable, allowing you to just purchase another holster and installing it to the rig that you have all ready purchased. So no need to purchase entire rigs for different firearms.
I use it with my Rock Island Armory 1911 in 9MM with no problems what-so-ever! And it will fit most of the 1911's made. It has only been worn a couple of times so truly almost new.
This sells new for around $140 plus shipping.
I will take $80 for it in a FTF meeting or I will ship it for $85.

 2008 Tomberlin Emerge E-4 LSV (Low Speed Vehicle)/ Electric Car. It is black in color and  has 1085 miles. It was just serviced at Palmetto Custom Carts in Mt. Pleasant, an authorized Tomberlin Dealer.  All batteries tested at 100% with regards to state of health and charge, with the exception of one, which tested at 97% (I have printout of test results).  They are all re-conditioned Trojan batteries, with 4 being 2011, and 4 being 2009.  The vehicle has a custom full enclosure with matching seat covers (cost approx. 1k).

This vehicle can be tagged and registered through DMV as a LSV, having met all of the guidelines of the DOT. This would allow you to operate the vehicle anywhere there is a 35mph speed limit or under. It can also be registered as a golf cart, which would allow operation on streets 25mph or less within a certain distance of your registered home. This vehicle will literally pay for itself over time, as it will save you in gas expenses ( See SC Laws pertaining to LSV's/ Electric Cars/ Golf Carts). Below documentation was taken from Tomberlin's Website. For inquiries or to set up an appointment, please call 8four3-44two-20one9. Thank you.


The E-Merge E-4 is an aggressively styled, four passenger, street-legal, electric car that can charge overnight on a standard 110 volt outlet and have a range in excess of 30 miles. It is targeted to individuals in local neighborhoods and communities for running errands, commuting and general recreation. Its powerplant will generate almost 11 kilowatts making it capable of a top speed of 25 mph and giving it the ability to aggressively climb hills. The Tomberlin E-Merge™ has 4 wheel braking, seat belts, tip-over-bar, lights, and is street legal.

This one is black with the walnut grip and has the 6” barrel. It has the picatinney rails on top and under the barrel.  It shoots both .357 Magnum and .38 Special.

The Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment.

Also included are a Target Sports Red/Green dot sight with integrated laser, 3 speedloaders (including a Safariland push button loader), and a Safariland Loading Block that sets up 14 (6 rnd) loads for the speedloader (a nice to have at the range!).  Original Box and owner’s manual also included.

Also known as a ""squeeze cocker"", this pistol is unique in the handgun world due to the ingenious feature built into the front grip strap. The front strap is actually a lever which performs several functions. First and foremost, by squeezing the lever, the gun is made ready to fire (hence the nickname). This action partially cocks the firing mechanism and the final trigger pull is light, crisp and consistant. To make the gun safe, all you have to do is relax your grip slightly and the lever pops back out decocking the firing mechanism. After the final shot is fired from the magazine the slide locks open and upon replacing a loaded mag, another squeeze of the lever instantly drops the slide, loads the chamber, cocks the firing mechanism so that you're immediately ready to shoot. The magazine release is ambidextrous. The pistol operates by a gas delayed blow-back system that allows the barrel to be fixed to the frame...this greatly improves accuracy. This pistol is in excellent shape with only very light wear. I'd grade the original finish about 97-98% with just a slight amount of finish wear to the right side at the edge of the muzzle and along the right edge of the back strap. There is some minor ""in-out"" wear on the edges of the magazine body. There is no rust or any pitting. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is mirror bright. Looking at the internal components, it appears that this pistol is likely unfired!! It comes with one factory 13-round magazine. The ""II"" date code on the frame (and magazine) indicates this pistol was manufactured in 1988. It is also a ""Chantilly"" marked pistol which many HK collectors feel were of the highest quality. Instantly ready, instantly safe...the P7M13 was discontinued in 1994, but remains one of my all-time favorite handgun designs."

This is an Arsenal FIME group assembled SGL21 AK 47 rifle with only about 40 rounds through it and not a scratch or blemish on it.  These are considered some of the higher quality AKs you can find…if you can find them at all now.  I replaced the original plum synthetic forearm assembly with a milled aluminum set from Damage Industries and replaced the handgrip with a hogue.  I thought about replacing the stock with a VLTOR adapter and maybe a Magpul CTR stock but I hadn’t got around to it yet.

I am also including 8 mags, 7 of which are 30 rounds and this does include 1 Circle 10 which are considered some of the better AK mags out there.
Rounding everything off is nearly 16 rounds of Wolf and Tula steel.  All non-corrosive berdan-primed.

I have invested over $1800 in all of this gear by the time you include shipping and transfers.  This is a really good deal where it’s at so I probably won’t be interested in lowering the price much if any at all.

We don’t have to do a transfer at a dealer but we can if you would like.  At the very least I have a private party transfer form to fill out and sign that is just a good idea to have for both parties involved.

Thanks for your interest…please let me know if you have any questions.

     The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.

     The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

If you have a government frame and would like to trade straight across that would be cool with me!  I prefer blued frames but would go for a stainless or a nickel.  It doesnt matter if it shows some wear.  
If you have a commander slide to trade I have a government slide that would be a good trade as well.  I am not to picky as long as i get similar quality and can build my 1911 at the end of trading.
the slide is very unique.  it is an Embel slide made off Colts patent.  it is made in Brazil and on the right side it says it was for the Brazilian Air Force."

The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with a NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle."

The shotgun is a phenomenal piece as they stopped making them around 2000 and haven't been shipped into the country since before 1994. This model is a fixed stock, that shows very little sign of wear (only real issue is where the pump slides on receiver seen below). This shotgun is featured in so many movies like The Terminator, Jurassic Park, and Snatch, that many people look to models with the folding stock which is a huge mistake due to the recoil. The fixed stock is really the way to go. Also, As many know, this is a one of a kind shotgun as it is capable of firing in both semi-auto and pump action. I have to slim down my collection to help pay for school, and this is a must see gun perfect to add to anyones collection. Cash only, no trades and sorry I am not willing to ship the firearm. Contact me via the site with any questions or for more info."
