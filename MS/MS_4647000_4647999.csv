This is the 7.62X51/.308 Winchester, one in twelve twist model. This is the one that will reach out and touch someone. I'll let the stock photos tell the story but I'll just go over the features as she sits here on my lap. The upper receiver has an integral 16"" rail. The flip up rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable. It allows you to flip between either of two different apertures. It can be moved forward or back on the upper rail. The flip up front sight is mounted on the gas block and is also windage and elevation adjustable. The post is square in cross section and about 1/16"" in width. The elevation adjustment is similar to that of the M16. The 16.25"" barrel is free floating; has a cold hammer forged, hardchromed bore; and its muzzle is threaded 5/8"" X 24tpi having what I expect to be a flash hider, although it suggests it might function as a brake as well. I couldn't find the answer to that on the FN website. The forearm has three accessory rails. There are ambidextrous integral forward and rear of receiver sling attachment points. They were designed for tactical slings, not traditional high power shooting slings. Shame on them. Oh well, ideas change, eh? There is a bolt hold open reminiscent of the M16. The magazine release is ambidextrous as is the safety/selector. Two positions only....sorry. The buttstock collapses and folds to create an overall length between 28.5"" and 38.5"". It has an adjustable cheek piece that elevates to fine tune your spot weld/sight picture. I like that because I tend to ""crane"" forward and take a tight weld which actually puts me low on the iron sights. With the cheek piece up, I get a perfect sight picture when I'm settled in the way I prefer. I'll bet this would be fun to shoot at distance. FN does brag about the long range accuracy, although it doesn't have what one would consider a target trigger. The pull is military heavy. The rifle weighs 8.0 lbs empty. An owner's manual, a lock, and one 20rd magazine are included."

The magazine release is ambidextrous as is the safety/selector. Two positions only....sorry. The buttstock collapses and folds to create an overall length between 28.5"" and 38.5"". It has an adjustable cheek piece that elevates to fine tune your spot weld/sight picture. I like that because I tend to ""crane"" forward and take a tight weld which actually puts me low on the iron sights. With the cheek piece up, I get a perfect sight picture when I'm settled in the way I prefer. I'll bet this would be fun to shoot at distance. FN does brag about the long range accuracy, although it doesn't have what one would consider a target trigger. The pull is military heavy. The rifle weighs 8.0 lbs empty. An owner's manual, a lock, and one 20rd magazine are included."

This is the 7.62X51/.308 Winchester, one in twelve twist model. This is the one that will reach out and touch someone. I'll let the stock photos tell the story but I'll just go over the features as she sits here on my lap. The upper receiver has an integral 16"" rail. The flip up rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable. It allows you to flip between either of two different apertures. It can be moved forward or back on the upper rail. The flip up front sight is mounted on the gas block and is also windage and elevation adjustable. The post is square in cross section and about 1/16"" in width. The elevation adjustment is similar to that of the M16. The 16.25"" barrel is free floating; has a cold hammer forged, hardchromed bore; and its muzzle is threaded 5/8"" X 24tpi having what I expect to be a flash hider, although it suggests it might function as a brake as well. I couldn't find the answer to that on the FN website. The forearm has three accessory rails. There are ambidextrous integral forward and rear of receiver sling attachment points. They were designed for tactical slings, not traditional high power shooting slings. Shame on them. Oh well, ideas change, eh? There is a bolt hold open reminiscent of the M16. The magazine release is ambidextrous as is the safety/selector. Two positions only....sorry. The buttstock collapses and folds to create an overall length between 28.5"" and 38.5"". It has an adjustable cheek piece that elevates to fine tune your spot weld/sight picture. I like that because I tend to ""crane"" forward and take a tight weld which actually puts me low on the iron sights. With the cheek piece up, I get a perfect sight picture when I'm settled in the way I prefer. I'll bet this would be fun to shoot at distance. FN does brag about the long range accuracy, although it doesn't have what one would consider a target trigger. The pull is military heavy. The rifle weighs 8.0 lbs empty. An owner's manual, a lock, and one 20rd magazine are included."

This is the 7.62X51/.308 Winchester, one in twelve twist model. This is the one that will reach out and touch someone. I'll let the stock photos tell the story but I'll just go over the features as she sits here on my lap. The upper receiver has an integral 16"" rail. The flip up rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable. It allows you to flip between either of two different apertures. It can be moved forward or back on the upper rail. The flip up front sight is mounted on the gas block and is also windage and elevation adjustable. The post is square in cross section and about 1/16"" in width. The elevation adjustment is similar to that of the M16. The 16.25"" barrel is free floating; has a cold hammer forged, hardchromed bore; and its muzzle is threaded 5/8"" X 24tpi having what I expect to be a flash hider, although it suggests it might function as a brake as well. I couldn't find the answer to that on the FN website. The forearm has three accessory rails. There are ambidextrous integral forward and rear of receiver sling attachment points. They were designed for tactical slings, not traditional high power shooting slings. Shame on them. Oh well, ideas change, eh? There is a bolt hold open reminiscent of the M16. The magazine release is ambidextrous as is the safety/selector. Two positions only....sorry. The buttstock collapses and folds to create an overall length between 28.5"" and 38.5"". It has an adjustable cheek piece that elevates to fine tune your spot weld/sight picture. I like that because I tend to ""crane"" forward and take a tight weld which actually puts me low on the iron sights. With the cheek piece up, I get a perfect sight picture when I'm settled in the way I prefer. I'll bet this would be fun to shoot at distance. FN does brag about the long range accuracy, although it doesn't have what one would consider a target trigger. The pull is military heavy. The rifle weighs 8.0 lbs empty. An owner's manual, a lock, and one 20rd magazine are included."

Adams Arms retrofit piston system - convert your mid-length gas barrel into a clean piston system.
Includes everything needed - bolt carrier, piston/rod, gas block and handguards.

Factory Description - 
Kit has everything you need to replace the standard gas system in your AR-15 and convert it to a reliable, positive-cycling, gas piston system. Eliminates venting of hot gases and powder residue into the bolt carrier and receiver for reduced fouling and less wear on the action. Feeds more smoothly, maintenance is easier, and the gun runs cooler, too. Short-stroke piston shaft eliminates concussive gas expansion in the upper receiver for less violent cycling and reduced felt recoil. Easy to adjust for three levels of gas release: normal fire, firing with a suppressor attached, or a single round fired without cycling. Picatinny rail on the gas block provides mounting space for a variety of front sights. Installation requires removal of original gas block, but no permanent alterations to barrel or upper receiver. Remove the piston system at any time and reinstall the original parts. Replacement handguard provides extra internal clearance for piston rod and has internal shield to protect your hand from heat buildup during sustained fire."

The designs are largely based on the Browning action found in the M1911 pistol, but with minor variations, generally related to the safety mechanism and the barrel-camblock interface.

Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.  Rifle looks and shoots like a new gun and has probably had less than 250 rounds through it.  Currently I have a stainless picatinny rail on it but I do have the factory Ruger rings as well.

This models include .22 LR and .22 Magnum cylinders that are manufactured using precision machinery to assure accuracy and reliability. Cylinder lock-ups are tight, and the perfect timing of the actions make for handguns that put shots where you want them. Machined barrels are microthreaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red-dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. Proudly made in the USA, all Heritage revolvers combine quality with affordability."

542,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4647542,For Sale:  Onan RV Generator,"East Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 500,"Listed On: Saturday, August 29, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"1978 Onan 4.0 BFA RV generator, runs great. 120v 4kw output. Comes with RV transfer switch to isolate when using grid power. Also has circuit breaker and 12v inverter for running 12v lighting and accessories. It has a 120v outlet installed at the moment, allowing it to be used as a portable, although its really too heavy to move around easily. These generators are low RPM, which is why they are so big compared to their rated output, but they last forever and are much quieter and vibrate much less than common portable generators. Does not come with a battery or fuel tank.

Please note that the scope, scope mounts and bipod are not part of this sale. Shippig is a flat rate of $25.00.

I was trying to sell the rifle only but have had a few inquires requesting a price with the scope, mounts and bipod. So if you're interested in purchasing the whole package, here's the cost break down: the scope is a Leupold Mark 4 8-25x50 mm tactical with mil-dot reticle and illuminated crosshairs, I paid $1400.00; scope mounts are TPS high mounts which cost me $75.00; bipod is a Harris swivel mount which cost me $85.00. So just pick what you want and add it to the cost of the rifle. Long range shooting isn't cheap, but you can spend a heck of a lot more than this depending on what you want."

Nickel Boron finish produces an exceptionally hard surface that’s 40% more wear resistant than chrome plating, with an ultra-low friction coefficient. Surface is actually harder than the substrate underneath and will not peel, flake, gall, or rub off. Nickel Boron finish bolt/carrier groups have been tested to function reliably without additional lubrication up to 50,000 rounds. Reduced friction also means less heat generated by metal-on-metal contact, so the gun runs cooler and parts last longer. Easy to clean too, fouling brushes right off."

Before I get all of the ""why are you selling it"" questions. I bought this brand new from a forum vendor, took it to show to my Dad, he liked it a lot so I left it for him to try out. While it was there I picked up another one for me to shoot. However, my stepmom bought him a Shield for his birthday so this came back to me now I have an extra one I don't need."

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol."

This firearm is extremely rare- only 2000 were made in total. This is not to be mistaken or mixed up with the cheaper Intratec Tec-9 that was notorious for jamming and being unreliable. I purchased this firearm as a collectors item, and I have only fired 5 rounds through it since I've owned it. The gun shoots 9mm, it has very little felt recoil, and it has no issues cycling.

The firearm is in very good condition: no scuffs on the lower, and very minor scuffs on the slide which you would expect on a firearm that is over 25 years old. Comes with 4-36 round magazines, gun sling, and hard case as shown. Price is firm at $700, the magazines go for $50 a piece and the sling is ~$35, so this is a great deal at $700 for the whole package. See prices below:

Never had a FTF or FTE. This is a Smith from when Smith's still had quality manufacturing behind the brand. Comes with 2 factory mags. No case. Cash price is $450. Trade value is $500.

The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Rifle Scope was designed specifically for the US Special Operations Command SOPMOD M4 Carbine and features the reticle bullet drop compensator and range finding stadia lines that are based on the trajectory of the 62 grain bullet from a 16 inch M4A1 barrel. The black, daytime reticle of the Trijicon ACOG 4x32 glows amber at night and in low light due to its tritium composition. Unique to the Trijicon ACOG sights is its internal adjustment capability - only the prism housing moves - making this the most rugged scope available. This rifle scope by Trijicon will withstand exposure to temperature extremes, salt spray, fog, fungus, humidity, sand, dust, shock vibration and a free fall drop onto a hard surface. Aerospace seals make Trijicon riflescopes waterproof to depths greater than 500 feet. The user does not need to make any special adjustments between shots at different ranges.

Both in GREAT shape. 
- The CZ is the Russian ""Baikal"" version single/double action with adjustable sight and was imported by B-West. I would say 95% shape with miniscule wear, no blue missing or edges worn at all. Comes with an extra clip and the original leather holster as pictured. Inside holster says made in Russia. Look these guns up if you do not know them as they are known to be very reliable. It has been sitting in my nightstand (not holstered) for the last 20 years. Was like new when bought and I've put maybe 10 rounds through it.
-The Ruger is an excellent pocket gun. Small enough that no one knows it's there, but does kick like a mule due to small frame. Clip has the pinky extension, making it fit your hand better than stock. I would say the same 95% condition. Comes with factory soft case and conceal type soft holster as pictured. Only 1 clip with the Ruger.
I also have quite a few rounds that I will sell at a low price if you would like, or include for the right trade.
WHAT DO I WANT? I will trade both of these, and can include up to $100 cash for something large caliber. I like .357, .44, and may go for a .45 if it's nice. Will sell both for $500 FIRM or will trade for $600 in value, plus include up to $100 cash to you."

I have for sale a .177 Dianne Model 48/52 pellet rifle with a Center Point 4x16 scope. 
I got in trade a few days ago so I only a few things about it. I know it does shoot though. Scope is nice.

Gun itself is in pretty good condition. I was doing some research on these and these are a very sought after Pellet Rifle (mostly because I read that they very reliable/accurate for being a Pellet rifle). I do not know if that is entirely accurate because you cannot believe everything you read on the internet obviously.

I have $325 in the trade so I am asking $300 OBO. Whether the guy was telling me the truth I don't know but he said he had almost $500 in the rifle. 
It also comes with a soft gun case. If you don't want the or the scope I can knock money off. The scope brand new from Walmart is a $70 scope. Reviews are 4 out of 5 on it from Amazon's website.

This would make a great rifle for plinking, I've been told some people use them to go after small game (squirrels, mice, birds) I don't know I was never into pellet rifles. 
It would make a great rifle for a young kid as a first rifle to be taught the basics of firearm safety/firing. Very simple, short range and no recoil. 

I am open to trades I would prefer cash though, but worst I can say is no. Please understand I do not have cash to put towards your trade so please don't ask to trade anything that is higher value than mine I just cannot do it at this time.

Please call or text at 41niner- ate 9 zero- sixer 9 0 seven. or respond to this posting.
