Different grips size and finish available for maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect.Manufacturer: Chiappa Firearms Model: 60DSBarrel Length: 6""Caliber: .357 MagnumCapacity: 6 shot"

The ""Charlie"" model retains most features of the original SU-16, such as integrated bipod, Picatinny rail, and AR-15/M-16 magazine compatibility. The front sight is integrated into the gas block and uses an AR-15/M-16 style front sight post for elevation adjustments. The SU-16C has a true folding stock and can be fired with the stock folded. A reciprocating dust cover and a case deflecting operating handle are also integrated into the rifle. The medium weight barrel is 16"" long and is threaded 1/2x28 TPI at the muzzle. Chrome lined bore and chamber are now standard. The ""Charlie"" is only available in Parkerized finish with black polymer components. 

The SU-16C is not a replacement for the original SU-16 but a complement for customers that put a premium on ruggedness and adaptability. The ""Charlie"" type stock can be purchased as a retrofit for SU-16 owners preferring the foldable stock.

285,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4131285,For Sale:  HK VP9 Nightsights 3x15rd Mags,"Southlake/DFW, Dallas, Texas",$ 910,"Listed On: Thursday, March 12, 2015",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014.

Got this thing with plans to SBR, but decided against it. Professionally installed extension to meet 16"" ( pin and welded). Can be removed with minor drilling if you wish to SBR or revert back to pistol (remove stock first). 

You get the rifle w/ bolted on stock system and magpul CTR stock + 14 steel military mags and 2 tapco mags.

This was my father's daily carry gun for many years and he could sweat the finish off of anything. The finish on this gun is pretty rough on the right side and under the frame, beneath the grips and on the right side of the slide. Mechanically it is fine. If you want a .45 carry gun for a bargain this is it, use it the way it is or get it refinished and use it as a base for a custom gun without dropping 1000.00 for a new one. 

I would like 450.00 for it, or will trade for a Glock 19 or something of equal value. Open to negotiation.

* This is a repost. Previous buyer/s (twice in different occassion now, and had a trade going also) backed out on me. Both deals fell through. So serious inquiries only please. And by the way, don't email and offer me an expensive gun for trade that I don't want in the first place, and want a lot of boot for it. And you get pissed cuz I said no trade or deal. I don't want to be rude, but there are a lot of stupid ignorant assholes on here. Just like Ron White said, ""You Can't Fix Stupid."" *

Started out as a base model Stag Mod 2 that has been added to.  All factory furniture has been replaced with magpul, grip, forend, and ACS stock.  Has a Vickers Tactical two point sling that I added Magpul MS3 hardware to so now it functions as a two point/one point convertible sling.  Has a BCM Gunfighter charging handle and a Surefire Procomp muzzle brake/compensator that does an excellent job at reducing recoil and muzzle rise.  Originally was running it with an optic but I have switched it back to iron sights and it is fairly light weight if that's important to you.  Will also come with a Condor Tactical chest rig that will hold ten magazines, multiple pistol mags, and a vertical universal pistol holster that will hold just about anything, even handguns with lights.  Will come with ten magazines, six magpul and four GI's, and about 300 rounds of Tula 223.

This has been an excellent, 100% reliable rifle for me with zero malfunctions of any kind, has had around a thousand rounds through it of mixed brass and steel, so it is not picky.  If you aren't familiar with STAG they make very high quality rifles and are a contract parts manufacturer for many of the big name AR producers on the market now.  Totally mil spec, chrome lined barrel, M4 feed ramps, MPI inspected BCG, and just about everything else you could want in an AR. Only thing I can say against it is that it has some scuffs on the left side of the receiver from rubbing against gear.

I'm looking to switch things up, so I would be interested in a partial trade for a quality AK47, primarily one of Yugo manufacture (absolutely no WASR's).  Would also be interested in partial trade for a quality 9mm, particularly a SIG P226 229 or M11, HK VP9, or Beretta 92.  might consider a commander length 1911.

If you'd prefer to buy It sell for $1100, fairly firm on price, I have over $1400 in it.  

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

And by the way, don't email and offer me an expensive gun for trade that I don't want in the first place, and want a lot of boot for it. And you get pissed cuz I said no trade or deal.

This is an quick and easy upgrade on you Glock pistol.  Fits Gen 1 to 4 Glocks. 

Use a GHOST INC trigger connector and become a ""Ghost Maker"" not a ghost!

The GHOST RANGER is ideal for those who demand the finest drop-in trigger connector for self defense.
The GHOST RANGER is the one Ghost family of trigger connectors that make your glock more reliable!? How? It is all in the hole or should we say it's all out of the hole-debris that is. The HOLE removes debris from the trigger mechanism. Debris in this area would normally cause the Glock designed connector to bind with the trigger bar rendering the pistol inoperable. The GHOST RANGER? removes these pistol choking debris insuring that no matter what gets in the hole gets it out!"

It will have our 'City of Louisville' logo on the front of the slide. The right rear corner has all the finish worn off, the night sights were almost dead, and the right side of the grip is chewed up from the seatbelt...
I had to leave on a disability retirement after being injured on duty and had to turn in my issued weapon. To add insult to injury, I missed the chance to buy back the G22 I had carried daily since 1998!
It was sold to an LE dealer near here- Keisler's/Orion Arms back in the beginning of the year. From there it was sold to a dealer in South Carolina, who has since gone out of business and turned in his FFL so I hit a dead end tracking it. I had this same gun in my hand when I received my career-ending injury, so you can imagine the sentimental value it has for me.
If you have this Glock, or know where it it, pleas contact me!
Thank You!"

The Ithaca Gun Co. produced the “Lefever Nitro” using the well known name of Dan Lefever to call attention to their affordable but well made double shotguns.  They utilized this marketing to produce a group of Lefevers with nicer fit and finish and with a variety of configurations which they labeled the Lefever A Grades, with nicer wood, checkering, some line engraving, and they looked nearly identical to their more costly Ithaca NID era guns.  Ithaca actually produced 6 different configurations in the A Grades from a field style, to a single barrel trap, to the very low production Model 6 Skeet gun."
