Its a great rifle, only shot a magazine through it to insure it was not automatic (info further down...)  Shoots well, unfortunately the previous owner put an after market dust cover on it, and it doesn't quite match, and he had gotten rid of the original.  He also did some ""work"" to the receiver.  I think he had the idea that if he made the safety lever go down further, that it would be select fire.  IT IS NOT, and if you know anything about firearms, they don't work that way.  As stated before, shoots great, comes with five (5) mags, two (2) original, three (3) other brand, all steel mags.  Also included is around five hundred (500) 7.62x39 rounds of ammunition.  I am looking for cash for this, not really interested in a trade, so don't ask.  Also it should be noted that I am a Sheriff's Deputy and I will take whatever precautions I need to insure that I am not selling this weapon to a felon, who cannot legally own a firearm and I reserve the right to not sell if I do not feel you ""need"" a weapon  (AKA you are a criminal).

The precision rails enable consistent ""repeat zero"" of any accurately dimensioned devices attached to them. 

Then you have a Magpul that combines the light weight of a standard hand guard with modular flexibility. Designed with versatility in mind, slots at the two, six, and ten o'clock positions allow the attachment of optional Picatinny rail sections and other accessories for mounting tactical lights, slings, grips, etc. Reinforced, heat-resistant polymer construction provides operational durability without the weight and expense of an aluminum rail hand guard. Front extensions and lower lip provides additional operator protection from hot front sight assembly.

  Info from Arsenal website:

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its Bulgarian Warsaw Pact length stock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

The SAM7R 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, Arsenal, Inc.’s US made hammer forged and machined trigger that features a wider trigger grip for more comfort on the shooter’s finger and a Bulgarian WARSAW PACT length stock, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, and bayonet lug.

if you bought ANYTHING from Armslist chances are you OVERPAID.
Free ads allow sellers to write unreasonable prices:

used Glocks for over $400 !!??  who do they think is reading these ads, a moron or Uncle Scrooge?
The worst are the sellers buying beat up former police dept. Glocks from SLICKGUNS or other sites where they sell for $300 and less, turn around and post those dangerous weapons (they are at the end of their service lifetime) for sale in Armslist. Be carefull, it can cost you literally an arm or a leg, maybe a hand or an eye.

Used Sigs for the price of a new one or more!!!!  NUTS !! seller must think we are all imbeciles.
The funniest ones are sellers asking $300 or more for cheap, dangerous, unreliable pieces of crap like anything Taurus, EAA, ATI, RIA, Jimenez, etc.  They honestly believe an idiot will pay that kind of money for trash.

And my favorite line ""no low ball offers will be considered"".  If you overpriced your gun because it did not cost you anything to list it, please, DO NOT LIST with an overpriced figure!!! is simple: you post shit, you get shit.

Finally, those of us who buy/sell often have to deal with the transfer/nazi background crap.
I have seen these fees range from $15 (at honest FFL'ers such as Rapid Fire Bunker, great honest people there ), even Gander charges $20 which is great, to over $40 for pushing paper for 5 minutes!!  Only way to eliminate gouging is supporting the non-gougers.

This rifle is very nice. The bolt, Barrel, chamber and trigger block all numbers matching. I have shot it - it is not just a looker - with iron sights we regularly hit 8"" steels at 75 yards. I drove 3 hours to buy this rifle. It was a great deal then and it is a great deal now. I have another Mosin and I dont need two. The wood is in good shape. I will include a sleeve to protect the rifle. $280 text REDACTED email REDACTED Intersted in trades - text me with a picture or email a picture.


I hate it when people put .01 as the price and you have to read the add to ge4t the price - that is such a waste of time.


I am interested in trades - text me a picture of what you have.


I am interested in bulk ammo so if you dont have the cash you can order some ammo and trade that.


This caliber is generally too large for J&J to allow and I am sure that we can get in there to try a handful of rounds if you want to shoot it.  If you buy it no charge for the range time and ammo - if you dont you pay for the range time and ammo.


This is a nice rifle. Nicer than my other Mosin.  The only reason I am keeping the 1922 round receiver is because its already in an Archangel stock.


This rifle is an inexpensive way to take almost anything on the North American continent.  The 7.62x54r packs a serious punch and Youtube has videos of the Mosin reaching out to 400 yards (with an optic) so you know the rifle will shoot accurately at least as far as you can shoot it!

The patented internal tensioning mechanism adjusts automatically to your receiver extension, eliminating rattle and making adjustments smooth and uniform. Quick-detach sling swivel sockets on each side allow rapid installation and removal of today’s popular QD-equipped slings. Webbing slots are also provided to accept traditional web slings. At only 11.8 ounces the TI-7 is a great lightweight upgrade for your rifle. Store multiple CR123, AA, or similarly sized batteries in each of the two water-resistant battery compartments. Access to these compartments is accomplished quickly and easily without removing the stock from the rifle. Simply twist the caps and they open on specially designed cam surfaces. The overmolded buttpad has added height to allow shooters to maintain a “heads up” position for greater situational awareness. The protected release lever is wide and features a large checkered area for positive activation with gloved or wet hands. Heavily rounded corners and smooth lines ensure snag-free performance. The broad, sloping surfaces on each side of the TI-7 create a perfect cheek-rest to ensure proper head position for consistently quick engagements.

This is FN's polymer-framed, striker-fired pistol. This is not the hammer-fired model, as you can see from the picture. This one does NOT have a thumb safety. Some do. This one does NOT. This pistol retails for $600. Comes with 3 magazines and original case with humped backstrap insert and flat backstrap insert (2 choices). The humped is currently installed. 

This pistol has the barrel polished to a satin finish. It is not the original blued barrel finish. If you want more pictures, please let me know, and I can text them to you. But it looks great. These barrels fit very tight in the slide, so the blueing tends to come off the barrel hood right away on ALL of them. I would rather have the satin stainless look rather than black finish wearing off. But that's just me. If it's not your thing, move along. 

Only 150 rounds fired through this pistol, with ZERO malfunctions. It's a good one. No scratches or wear marks of any kind. This has been a coddled range toy and home defense pistol. 

Also including my Streamlight TLR-3 weapon light. This light retails for about $90. Very bright. Awesome for home defense. Comes with the box and all the original rail keys so it fits virtually any railed pistol, not just this one. 

Also getting rid of my .40 ammo, as I have no other .40 pistols. 
- 150 rounds of American Eagle 165gr FMJ range ammo 
- 100 rounds of Winchester 165gr FMJ range ammo
- 40 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense 165gr FTX JHP
- 28 rounds of Federal HST 180gr JHP (loose in ziplock back)
All this ammo would retail for about $160 or so. 

So all together, everything retailed for about $850 (not including taxes and fees, which would bump it up to about $900).

Asking $675.

If you want just the pistol and 3 mags, it's $550.

Both exceptionally accurate.
Very ornate hammer and double trigger set up. 
The first trigger will fire the weapon as normal. The second one, if pulled first, will ""set"" the first trigger - making a hair trigger.
The stock is beautiful, however it does have a few nicks (its a functioning hunting weapon after all).

Now, the weapon comes ready to shoot, about a pound of powder, 90+ round balls with the same number of lubbed patches, and around 1000 no. 11 primers.

Hello everyone,
	I have available for trade/sale a used but classic pistol. This is a Norinco made 1911A1 45 pistol. This gun is in good overall shape and will come with two magazines as well as some aftermarket ""Don't Tread on Me"" grips. It also has a compensator installed on it as well. This is a good shooting pistol. I would keep it, but shortly after I bought it, I realized I would prefer something else. This gun needs a good cleaning, but aside from that didn't give me any issues. 
	Shoot me any offers at REDACTED via text, or a message on here. I'm open to most firearms, Bersa Thunder plus boot,  but no black powder, 22, Taurus, or shotguns unless it is heavily in my favor. Some trades will need boot on my end, some will need boot on your end. Need to meet in Norman on this. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting,

Comes with two 35 round mags.  The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army.  The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG).  The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42.  The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43.  This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946).  The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied.  This historical firearm has been re-designed to shoot from a closed bolt position.  The safety is located at the front of the trigger guard.  The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel.  The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type.  The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake.  This firearm is an ATF approved pistol.  The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position."
