28,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4090028,For Sale:  Bulk Ammo - Most Common Calibers - 100-Round Brick Deals,"NE, Southeastern, PA, Pennsylvania",$ 35,"Listed On: Sunday, March 1, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Greetings Armslisters,




I have just opened the doors to Vexxxer Munitions(metaphorically; we don't actually have doors yet), and to celebrate I am posting the current stock of ammunition on Armslist, three weeks before our scheduled 'opening' ceremony, here in lovely Portland, OR. I should note right off the bat that this is an online-only store; we do not have a physical office address for one to come pick up ammunition, at least not yet. But you're not here to listen to ramblings about a green-as-grass munitions company, you're here to buy ammunition!


All ammunition is priced and sold in sets of 100 rounds. Shipping will be determined based on location and amount of rounds you want; buying more will end up saving you money, as I can pack them all into a single box, instead of 100 rounds per small box. 

I also offer a 'penny-round' discount for orders of 1,000 rounds or more. At the 1,000 round mark, I take off a penny per round. It's not a huge discount, granted, but if you are planning on shooting a lot anyways, it will save you a fair bit of cash to buy in large quantities. It also makes it much easier on my end logistically, and thus the savings fall directly to the consumer. I try every day to get the best possible deal for the end-customer, in this case, you.


While I do not yet have ALL calibers(we do plan to carry all as soon as is practical), I do have the most commonly shot rounds in America, according to the 2013 arms industry census. I chose to maintain healthy stockpiles of common calibers, rather than create a single brick per caliber, and have to fight to keep them stocked. So, without further preamble, I currently have in stock:


-Tula .45ACP


-Wolf 7.62x39mm


-Silver Bear .223/5.56 NATO


-Winchester Super-X 12GA, Buck-shot


-Bulgarian 7.62x54R, Silver-Tipped [CORROSIVE]


[A quick word on the corrosive ammunition; I am a huge Mosin fan, if you need any advice or assistance in keeping your Mosin pristine, while using the vastly cheaper surplus ammunition(the secret is boiling water), don't hestitate to send me an email. I'm more than happy to help out fellow gun enthusiasts, and Mosiners in particular]


I will be taking special notice of obtaining 9mm especially, as well as .22LR, .308, 10GA rounds as soon as possible, I know that I am missing these very common calibers. But as I said before I'd rather have a healthy stockpile of fewer calibers; the last thing I want is for someone to contact me, and me to be fresh out of any rounds they were looking to buy.



PROCESS:


To order(while our website is being constructed, at least) is very simple; email me with how many rounds you would like, of what caliber. I will require a state or military-issued ID as proof of age (sorry kids, no bullets for you!). From there, I will send you a shipping quote, NOT an estimate. There is an important distinction there; estimates can change, quotes will not. Most ammunition companies use an estimator, and charge you the final price halfway through the process, whether or not the estimate was correct. As I am not trying to profit off both the ammunition and shipping, I do not play the 'estimate' game; if I make a mistake, I will eat the cost; what I quote is what you pay, no exceptions. I'd rather lose money and keep a customer, and keep money and lose a customer.


Once we have the final cost and a formalized request for rounds, I will send you an invoice via Paypal. Once payment is received, you will receive an email from Paypal with the tracking number and current status of your order. Unfortunately, as many of you are no doubt aware, munitions by law MUST travel via ground, otherwise known as snail-mail. So please, factor in at least a week for shipping. That being said, I will ship the same day generally that your order is placed, and on rare occasions the next day. I discount Sunday completely, as no shipping company works on Sundays, much to the world's chagrin.


[For the unfamiliar: Paypal is an escrow service that watches over the transaction, protecting both you and I in exchange for a small fee from me. It is a completely free service for you, and takes about 5 minutes to create an account.]


From that point, all you have to do is wait. Your package will arrive(please notify me when it does; I'm timing various shipping companies to find the fastest ground transport. Also email me if there is something wrong; I'm here for my customers, if there's a problem, I want to know about it), and then all you need to do is go out and have a blast! No pun intended.



Building A Better Business:


Before I wrap up, a word on pricing. I am fully aware that the prices are high, and I am working on it. The bottleneck at this moment is waiting for the various munition factories to analyze and accept my business identification, to confirm that yes, I am a business in the realm of ammunition, and no, I am not just some guy trying to buy 10,000 rounds of ammunition for his 'hunting' trips. Prices and ammunition availability are different for licensed businesses and private citizens. Expect to see prices drop slightly within a month, and drop significantly within 7 months. It may be sooner but I'd rather be conservative in my estimates. The ads will change the very hour I get confirmation from the factories.




Feel free to email me with any questions, comments or concerns you might have. I hope to have a long business career supplying Americans with all their favorite calibers(please note I cannot ship international, at all, by law. Would if I could, but I can't, so I shan't). 


And, as a squeaky-clean, brand-new company, I would be remiss in my duties if I did not ask the customer; if you have any ideas or thoughts on how to run it more efficiently, cut down on shipping time, make the process easier for the customer, etc, please, my email is always open, and I check it multiple times a day. I would also love to hear your opinions on the 'brick' system, as well as my 'can' system that will go into effect next month. If I may tug on your ear a moment longer:

-I plan to have two basic types of product; bricks of 100 rounds, and ammo cans(with number of rounds dependent on caliber). So for example, 300 7.62x54R rounds fit perfectly into a .30 caliber ammunition can, and pricing would be based on how many rounds are included(the cans are free, a thank you for your business). The cans are all brand-new, un-stenciled; I chose this method to allow you to use them for other rounds and not have confusing stenciling on each box(claiming your ammo can full of 9mm is in fact 40mm explosive rounds, for example). I also chose to put the company brand on the back of the can, as I do not think slathering your logo onto every surface is a professional way to advertise your business(though it is certainly effective). I do want you, the customer, to know the name Vexxxer Munitions, but I'm not going to throw it in your face at every opportunity. I did try to put the logo inside the can on the lid, to make them more circumspect, but there are very odd ridges to make the cans stronger, and they interfere with my hand-stamping process.

If you have any comments on those two theoretical products especially, or if you have an idea that's even better, please email me. I am always open to customer suggestion. I hope to implement a quasi-forum on the store website for just this purpose, but for now emails will suffice.




Cheers Armslist, and happy hunting!

It also makes it much easier on my end logistically, and thus the savings fall directly to the consumer. I try every day to get the best possible deal for the end-customer, in this case, you.


While I do not yet have ALL calibers(we do plan to carry all as soon as is practical), I do have the most commonly shot rounds in America, according to the 2013 arms industry census. I chose to maintain healthy stockpiles of common calibers, rather than create a single brick per caliber, and have to fight to keep them stocked. So, without further preamble, I currently have in stock:


-Tula .45ACP


-Wolf 7.62x39mm


-Silver Bear .223/5.56 NATO


-Winchester Super-X 12GA, Buck-shot


-Bulgarian 7.62x54R, Silver-Tipped [CORROSIVE]


[A quick word on the corrosive ammunition; I am a huge Mosin fan, if you need any advice or assistance in keeping your Mosin pristine, while using the vastly cheaper surplus ammunition(the secret is boiling water), don't hestitate to send me an email. I'm more than happy to help out fellow gun enthusiasts, and Mosiners in particular]


I will be taking special notice of obtaining 9mm especially, as well as .22LR, .308, 10GA rounds as soon as possible, I know that I am missing these very common calibers. But as I said before I'd rather have a healthy stockpile of fewer calibers; the last thing I want is for someone to contact me, and me to be fresh out of any rounds they were looking to buy.



PROCESS:


To order(while our website is being constructed, at least) is very simple; email me with how many rounds you would like, of what caliber. I will require a state or military-issued ID as proof of age (sorry kids, no bullets for you!). From there, I will send you a shipping quote, NOT an estimate. There is an important distinction there; estimates can change, quotes will not. Most ammunition companies use an estimator, and charge you the final price halfway through the process, whether or not the estimate was correct. As I am not trying to profit off both the ammunition and shipping, I do not play the 'estimate' game; if I make a mistake, I will eat the cost; what I quote is what you pay, no exceptions. I'd rather lose money and keep a customer, and keep money and lose a customer.


Once we have the final cost and a formalized request for rounds, I will send you an invoice via Paypal. Once payment is received, you will receive an email from Paypal with the tracking number and current status of your order. Unfortunately, as many of you are no doubt aware, munitions by law MUST travel via ground, otherwise known as snail-mail. So please, factor in at least a week for shipping. That being said, I will ship the same day generally that your order is placed, and on rare occasions the next day. I discount Sunday completely, as no shipping company works on Sundays, much to the world's chagrin.


[For the unfamiliar: Paypal is an escrow service that watches over the transaction, protecting both you and I in exchange for a small fee from me. It is a completely free service for you, and takes about 5 minutes to create an account.]


From that point, all you have to do is wait. Your package will arrive(please notify me when it does; I'm timing various shipping companies to find the fastest ground transport. Also email me if there is something wrong; I'm here for my customers, if there's a problem, I want to know about it), and then all you need to do is go out and have a blast! No pun intended.



Building A Better Business:


Before I wrap up, a word on pricing. I am fully aware that the prices are high, and I am working on it. The bottleneck at this moment is waiting for the various munition factories to analyze and accept my business identification, to confirm that yes, I am a business in the realm of ammunition, and no, I am not just some guy trying to buy 10,000 rounds of ammunition for his 'hunting' trips. Prices and ammunition availability are different for licensed businesses and private citizens. Expect to see prices drop slightly within a month, and drop significantly within 7 months. It may be sooner but I'd rather be conservative in my estimates. The ads will change the very hour I get confirmation from the factories.




Feel free to email me with any questions, comments or concerns you might have. I hope to have a long business career supplying Americans with all their favorite calibers(please note I cannot ship international, at all, by law. Would if I could, but I can't, so I shan't). 


And, as a squeaky-clean, brand-new company, I would be remiss in my duties if I did not ask the customer; if you have any ideas or thoughts on how to run it more efficiently, cut down on shipping time, make the process easier for the customer, etc, please, my email is always open, and I check it multiple times a day. I would also love to hear your opinions on the 'brick' system, as well as my 'can' system that will go into effect next month. If I may tug on your ear a moment longer:

-I plan to have two basic types of product; bricks of 100 rounds, and ammo cans(with number of rounds dependent on caliber). So for example, 300 7.62x54R rounds fit perfectly into a .30 caliber ammunition can, and pricing would be based on how many rounds are included(the cans are free, a thank you for your business). The cans are all brand-new, un-stenciled; I chose this method to allow you to use them for other rounds and not have confusing stenciling on each box(claiming your ammo can full of 9mm is in fact 40mm explosive rounds, for example). I also chose to put the company brand on the back of the can, as I do not think slathering your logo onto every surface is a professional way to advertise your business(though it is certainly effective). I do want you, the customer, to know the name Vexxxer Munitions, but I'm not going to throw it in your face at every opportunity. I did try to put the logo inside the can on the lid, to make them more circumspect, but there are very odd ridges to make the cans stronger, and they interfere with my hand-stamping process.

If you have any comments on those two theoretical products especially, or if you have an idea that's even better, please email me. I am always open to customer suggestion. I hope to implement a quasi-forum on the store website for just this purpose, but for now emails will suffice.




Cheers Armslist, and happy hunting!

This stove has been disassembled, cleaned down to bare metal, repainted on the outside with a high gloss high quality heat paint (black & silver), on the inside flat black paint and has a minimum of 6 coats of paint on each piece of metal and meticulously reassembled (this stove is solid).  All cast iron metal and fire box is in great condition, super clean. I don’t know much about these types of stoves but I do know it looked great in my house and always a conversation piece.  I have owned this stove for many years, never lit a fire in it just kept it as a decorative display piece in my living room and just now this winter had it refinished. The stove body and the leg section are two separate pieces; the body sits on top of the leg section just the way it was when manufactured.

I have just opened the doors to Vexxxer Munitions(metaphorically; we don't actually have doors yet), and to celebrate I am posting the current stock of ammunition on Armslist, three weeks before our scheduled 'opening' ceremony, here in lovely Portland, OR. I should note right off the bat that this is an online-only store; we do not have a physical office address for one to come pick up ammunition, at least not yet. But you're not here to listen to ramblings about a green-as-grass munitions company, you're here to buy ammunition!


All ammunition is priced and sold in sets of 100 rounds. Shipping will be determined based on location and amount of rounds you want; buying more will end up saving you money, as I can pack them all into a single box, instead of 100 rounds per small box. 

I also offer a 'penny-round' discount for orders of 1,000 rounds or more. At the 1,000 round mark, I take off a penny per round. It's not a huge discount, granted, but if you are planning on shooting a lot anyways, it will save you a fair bit of cash to buy in large quantities. It also makes it much easier on my end logistically, and thus the savings fall directly to the consumer. I try every day to get the best possible deal for the end-customer, in this case, you.


While I do not yet have ALL calibers(we do plan to carry all as soon as is practical), I do have the most commonly shot rounds in America, according to the 2013 arms industry census. I chose to maintain healthy stockpiles of common calibers, rather than create a single brick per caliber, and have to fight to keep them stocked. So, without further preamble, I currently have in stock:

-Wolf 7.62x39mm


-Silver Bear .223/5.56 NATO


-Winchester Super-X 12GA, Buck-shot


-Bulgarian 7.62x54R, Silver-Tipped [CORROSIVE]


[A quick word on the corrosive ammunition; I am a huge Mosin fan, if you need any advice or assistance in keeping your Mosin pristine, while using the vastly cheaper surplus ammunition(the secret is boiling water), don't hestitate to send me an email. I'm more than happy to help out fellow gun enthusiasts, and Mosiners in particular]

But as I said before I'd rather have a healthy stockpile of fewer calibers; the last thing I want is for someone to contact me, and me to be fresh out of any rounds they were looking to buy.



PROCESS:


To order(while our website is being constructed, at least) is very simple; email me with how many rounds you would like, of what caliber. I will require a state or military-issued ID as proof of age (sorry kids, no bullets for you!). From there, I will send you a shipping quote, NOT an estimate. There is an important distinction there; estimates can change, quotes will not. Most ammunition companies use an estimator, and charge you the final price halfway through the process, whether or not the estimate was correct. As I am not trying to profit off both the ammunition and shipping, I do not play the 'estimate' game; if I make a mistake, I will eat the cost; what I quote is what you pay, no exceptions. I'd rather lose money and keep a customer, and keep money and lose a customer.


Once we have the final cost and a formalized request for rounds, I will send you an invoice via Paypal. Once payment is received, you will receive an email from Paypal with the tracking number and current status of your order. Unfortunately, as many of you are no doubt aware, munitions by law MUST travel via ground, otherwise known as snail-mail. So please, factor in at least a week for shipping.

From that point, all you have to do is wait. Your package will arrive(please notify me when it does; I'm timing various shipping companies to find the fastest ground transport. Also email me if there is something wrong; I'm here for my customers, if there's a problem, I want to know about it), and then all you need to do is go out and have a blast! No pun intended.

The bottleneck at this moment is waiting for the various munition factories to analyze and accept my business identification, to confirm that yes, I am a business in the realm of ammunition, and no, I am not just some guy trying to buy 10,000 rounds of ammunition for his 'hunting' trips.

It may be sooner but I'd rather be conservative in my estimates. The ads will change the very hour I get confirmation from the factories.




Feel free to email me with any questions, comments or concerns you might have. I hope to have a long business career supplying Americans with all their favorite calibers(please note I cannot ship international, at all, by law. Would if I could, but I can't, so I shan't). 


And, as a squeaky-clean, brand-new company, I would be remiss in my duties if I did not ask the customer; if you have any ideas or thoughts on how to run it more efficiently, cut down on shipping time, make the process easier for the customer, etc, please, my email is always open, and I check it multiple times a day. I would also love to hear your opinions on the 'brick' system, as well as my 'can' system that will go into effect next month. If I may tug on your ear a moment longer:

-I plan to have two basic types of product; bricks of 100 rounds, and ammo cans(with number of rounds dependent on caliber). So for example, 300 7.62x54R rounds fit perfectly into a .30 caliber ammunition can, and pricing would be based on how many rounds are included(the cans are free, a thank you for your business). The cans are all brand-new, un-stenciled; I chose this method to allow you to use them for other rounds and not have confusing stenciling on each box(claiming your ammo can full of 9mm is in fact 40mm explosive rounds, for example). I also chose to put the company brand on the back of the can, as I do not think slathering your logo onto every surface is a professional way to advertise your business(though it is certainly effective). I do want you, the customer, to know the name Vexxxer Munitions, but I'm not going to throw it in your face at every opportunity. I did try to put the logo inside the can on the lid, to make them more circumspect, but there are very odd ridges to make the cans stronger, and they interfere with my hand-stamping process.

If you have any comments on those two theoretical products especially, or if you have an idea that's even better, please email me. I am always open to customer suggestion. I hope to implement a quasi-forum on the store website for just this purpose, but for now emails will suffice.




Cheers Armslist, and happy hunting!

This is the first version produced by CZ that was later followed by the CZ70. It's all steel  construction and it's a close copy of the Walther PPK. It fires single action or double action.

It's quite concealable and like all CZ firearms it's very well made, durable, reliable and quite accurate. This particular pistol was issued and it was most likely to Czech police forces. It does has some finish wear from use, but it's in very good shape overall and has no signs of any rust or corrosion. I'd rate it around 85%. Bore is excellent, there are no cracks in the grips and mechanical function is perfect.

Pistol comes with 2 factory original finger grip magazines that are in excellent shape. There are also two holsters: One is a brown leather military flap holster that carries the included cleaning rod and the spare mag. Then the other is an original Eastern European military/police shoulder holster that has a spare mag pouch. This holster would be ideal for carrying concealed under a jacket or a sweat shirt.

Finally there two 50 round boxes of recent production .32ACP ammo by Fiocchi. Ammo is brass case with FMJ bullets and it's fully reloadable.

This rifle is the newest incarnation of the wildly popular AR-50 chambered for the powerful 50 BMG cartridge. A single shot bolt action rifle featuring a unique octagonal receiver bedded down into a V-shaped stock. Designed to be an economical answer for the challenges of long range shooting, the AR-50A1 is amazingly accurate and with its massive fluted muzzle brake, it has a very gentle recoil. The AR-50A1 is a highly refined rifle which is a stark and refreshing difference that maintains its superiority over its competition.

ArmaLite's great .50 has been refined, with smoother action, attractive new bolt stop, and even greater strength than the original AR-50.  The same great accuracy, but now even more Beautiful.

COMMENTS:
This rifle is in mint condition and has less than 50 rounds through it.   The recoil is about that of a 308 or less.  My son weighs 118 pounds and had NO PROBLEMS shooting it.   It is LOUD.... and sets off car alarms at the range!   Photos are samples only.

The SIG556 features the same high-performance two-position adjustable gas piston operating rod system, engineered by SIG's sister company Swiss Arms, and marries it to a trigger housing that not only cuts the rifle's weight by a pound, but is designed to accept standard AR-15 magazines. The SIG556 features a 16"" military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1:7"". The A2 flash suppressor retains a standard 1/2x28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with aftermarket accessories. 
The vented tactical tri rail forearm provides the same overall feel of the Classic SIG556, but with the added utility of three accessory rails. The picatinny rail equipped receiver is made of high strength carbon steel with a durable wear-resistant Nitron finish. The trigger housing is machined from an aircraft grade aluminum alloy forging, with a hard-coat anodized finish designed to survive extreme conditions. 
The rifle comes equipped with a smooth two-stage trigger, ambidextrous safety and is designed to accept standard AR-15 magazines. The rifle has an M4 type collapsible and collapsible buttstock. The ergonomically designed pistol grip features an integrated storage compartment.

Electric Airsoft Rifles use batteries as their power source and they shoot very fast. Some Electric Airsoft Rifles come with semi-automatic fire. That means that when you pull the trigger only 1 BB will come out at a time. Other Electric Airsoft Rifles come with full-automatic fire. This means that when you pull the trigger multiple BBs will come out at a time. The longer you hold the trigger down the more BBs come out. Check the description above to see which kind of gun this is and if it is right for you. Electric Airsoft Rifles don't require any pumping or cocking, just simply point and shoot. This is a High End Electric Airsoft Gun. Please only use .20 gram high quality BBs with this item in order to keep it in proper working order. Using anything else as ammunition for this gun will void the warranty and may cause it to jam. Also, to keep your Electric Airsoft Gun working properly, do not fire the gun when there are no BBs in it as it may cause damage to your gun. You must be 18 years of age or older to purchase this Airsoft gun."

Most importantly, no more accidentally committing a felony by leaving your tool attached to your bullet button. 

 The tool mounts to ""virtually any"" stamped aluminum or plastic magazine. The cap is made from plastic to help protect your AR-15 from scratches and it can be replaced if its damaged or wears out. This simple to use system is a ""MUST SEE"" for any bullet button AR user. 

 All research done on the CA DOJ website, as well as feedback from gun shop owners, parts dealers, and contributors to previous Calguns.net threads, indicate that this tool complies with CA DOJ regulations. What makes it compliant is that once a modified magazine is inserted into the mag-well it becomes part of the rifle, rendering the tool ""unusable"". It still requires another modified magazine (or other tool) to remove the magazine from the rifle. However, it is not officially approved by CA DOJ.

WITH IC CONTRO","Southwest Washington, Virginia, United States","$ 2,000","Listed On: Sunday, March 1, 2015",Rifles,Marlin                                                                                ,300 Winchester Magnum                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"BLASER R8 JAEGER, 300 WIN MAG LEFT HAND, WITH IC CONTROL. ALL OTHER CALIBERS IN STOCK. Cocking the R8 iC activates the illuminated dot of the ZEISS rifle scope. The hunter is immediately ready to shoot. He gains time, remains calm and therefore is able to shoot safely. WITH CASE. Focused repeating In-line repeating in the correct shooting position allows for a relaxed posture in situations that require a quick succession of shots. The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy. Blaser Saddle Mount Only with a perfect scope mount, rifle and rifle scope become one accurate unit. Four inconspicuous notches which are aligend with the chamber hold the one-piece mounting base without causing tension. Thus, the barrel can float freely and keeps its point of impact even with the heat generated by a quick succession of shots. By just a few turns, the rifle scope can be detached and reattached within a split second – all without needing to re-zero your optics. Blaser Radial Locking System Extremely strong consentric locking directly to the barrel without rotary motion. Besides barrel bedding and quality, the Blaser radial locking system contributes decisively to unsurpassed accuracy. Success Factor: The stock Different from some traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. Due to the increased muzzle stability the felt recoil is substantially reduced. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Short and huntable The unique design of the R8 magazine above the trigger allows the overall lenght of the rifle to be 9 cm (3?½“) shorter than conventional bolt action rifles. This innovative feature proves to be a distinct advantage in all terrain. Perfectly balanced The combination of overall length, total weight and balance sets a new standard for bolt action rifles. The balanced weight distribution allows for fast handling and quick target acquisition. Safely stored, ready in a split second In situations when hunters have to walk long distances, it is more comfortable to carry the rifle stripped down in a backpack. If required, the rifle can be reassembled in a split second, without influencing the point of impact. When traveling, the R8 can be transported stripped down in a rifle case. In contrast to very long conventional rifle cases, passers-by do not recognize the R8’s inconspicuous rifle case. Locked Magazine The double release buttons protect the magazine against unintentional drop out. Our innovation does not stop there. We also incorporated a locking device for the hunter who prefers a non-detachable magazine. When the magazine is locked in place, and with an open bolt, the rifle can be loaded from the top. Protected All metal parts of the R8 are either made of rustproof material or otherwise protected against corrosion. The closed construction of the R8 action prevents contaminants from entering the rifle. Every magazine comes with a protective cover (1) preventing dirt from entering the rifle when the magazine is stored outside of it. When taking out the magazine, the magazine chamber can be closed with a magazine chamber cover (2) which is included in the scope of delivery. Desmodromic Trigger Mechanism The critical link between shooter and rifle is the trigger. The R8 offers the next leap in technology. Upon cycling the action, the trigger is reset mechanically. This innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing. This important design feature offers unsurpassed reliability in extreme conditions such as freezing rain and blowing dust. Hunting around the world There is no better advantage to a hunter than the ability to use one rifle anywhere in the world. With calibers ranging from .222 Rem to .416 Rem. Mag. there are no limitations for your Blaser. Several rifle scopes on one barrel Every barrel is prepared for the Original Blaser Saddle Mount. This allows for several rifle scopes to be used with one barrel."

From the production history and markings the pistol appears produced, under the first year of S&W licensing, at Black Creek, Gadsden, Alabama, but before S&W put its own serial numbers on Walther licensed PPK’s likely in 2000 or 2001. The serialization neither matches Interarms nor S&W numbering systems. The pistol has a short tang, the standard Walther markings and the “VA” proofing mark of Interarms appears on the receiver in the ejection port. In the interim period between the end of the Interarms license (1999) and the beginning of S&W ""manufacturing"" (2001) pistols continued to be made in Gadsden, Alabama by Black Creek, or Mid-South, companies under the S&W license from Walther (Umarex) apparently using various marked component parts. Records show that 6,600 pistols were manufactured in .380acp at Black Creek in 2000. The suffix “AAA” could represent: first 10,000 series, stainless, Alabama, or simply be filler. These transitional American PPK’s need to be recognized and valued as a variation, as distinct from the more common serial numbered German made, Interarms licensed, or later fully-marked and numbered S&W variations."

The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.""

Zero corrosion, and it will remain that way due to the complete stainless steel construction

This is a very stong gun, due in part to the one piece frame.

Revolver also comes with:
Classic lee reloader
Lee perfect powder measure
Almost full bottle of red dot powder
50+ New brass
Assorted ammo, maybe 50 rounds. Some reloads 


This trade will give you the revolver and everything you need to reload .44 special or .44 magnum. Great companion gun for a .44 mag rifle


I am interested in a trade for a new coyote gun. Prefer a semi auto rifle. Preference will be given to Ak or SKS variants or semi auto shotguns

I will also consider bolt action rifles, Glocks, Kahrs. S&W and other quality handguns.
If you have anything different please feel free to offer.

This has been lovingly melted over a roaring gas flame, fluxed repeatedly during the melting process and the resulting crud skimmed off.  The molten lead was cast into ingots weighing approx. 2½ and 4¾ lbs. each.  Ingots are 7"" long and either 1¾"" or 2½"" wide and will fit any of the common electric melting pots by Lyman, Lee or RCBS and other makers.

I had one batch of this alloy analyzed and it tests Antimony 1.49%, Tin .23, Lead 92.94, Copper .27 with the balance being traces of Iron, Bismuth and other metals in insignificant quantities.  I am assuming that the analysis remains fairly constant as it is all coming from the same section of the range but I make no guarantee of that.

Add 1% additional Tin to this and it will work for just about any handgun bullets and most rifle bullets to 1500 fps. if gas checked.  As it is it does fine for handgun bullets at under 1,000 fps but needs to be cast a little hotter than normal to get good fillout.   BHN is around 10.

Any quantity you want, picked up in Milton for $1.10/lb.  Shipping can be arranged via USPS Flat Rate Box, $5.00 to cover the cost of packaging + actual shipping costs for up to 65 lbs."
