It's a 12 gauge shotgun.  Load, point, pull the trigger, it shoots.  It's a used gun, and has not been a safe queen.  Shot skeet with it, slugs, 3 inch turkey loads, and it eats anything you feed it and never had a single failure of any kind.  Always stripped, cleaned, and oiled after every outing.  Great all around shotgun.

It has three factory Sig mags, 2X8 Round and 1X10 Round so you're getting an extra 8 round mag worth at least 30 dollars. It has the factory Siglite Night sights and integrated rail. Also, the sig ""Short Reset"" trigger (SRT) was done to this gun as well for an even better overall shooting experience. This alone is over 100 dollars.

The price is 1000.00 dollars in cash.
I will also trade, looking for pistols in .45 Auto though as that's the ammo I have. I would take something like

Springfield XDM 45
Springfield XDS 45
Glock variants in 45
H&K USP or Tactical
FNX Tactical

I would consider an Arsenal or other high value AK variant rifle as well like a Sig 556 in 7.62.
Of course cash would need to be added on any gun of lesser value.

I am selling my Like New H&K USP 45 V1, I purchased it two months ago, and went to fire a box of ammunition out in the desert. I love the gun, but unfortunately I would have preferred the 9mm version of it. I had installed a set of night sights, a $80 value and I also have a Tactical light with the H&K mount. So here I am on Armslist trying to trade for a USP 9mm, i am only looking for the full size, I kept my gun like new so i would like to trade for one in same condition.
Otherwise i will take 850 cash.

Friends have Hornady LNL's, what I originally bought years ago but returned after calls to Hornady and bringing it over to GunStop Reloading in favor of the Dillon XL 650.  Well honestly, I had 2 lemons in a row, both checked out and 100% mfg error. They must of outsourced since they were so behind and on back-order forever it seemed, IIRC after 2009 and O came in, must of been. (?) 
Dillon they say is top notch and so far it has been flawless, Dillon DOES have the BEST Warranty though. I researched and took PC notes for over 2 yrs. before I jumped into it.

I already purchased a brand new Hornady LNL from Cabela's very recently, so not in a rush. I could use the Dillon, but don't fully see the need, might as well be put to good use to make 10's of thousands of rounds instead.

I have a used McCree's chassis for sale inletted for a Remington 700 long action. No magazine included.

This stock was bought in FDE color and has some slight krylon stripes when I tried to camo it. The front section (everything in front of the folder) has been used, and there is visual evidence of it being used (some scratches around the magwell, scuffs here and there). There is absolutely no damage or other imperfections that hinder its operation.


The rear section is brand new and contains parts which are a mix of raw aluminum and FDE cerakote parts. I will make a picture available for clarity.


This goes for about $700 brand new. I'm looking for $480 for this stock, shipped to your door in the lower 48. If you want insurance / tracking, please add $10. No way to get into a solid and reputable chassis for less than this!

I am swamped both at work and in my personal life right now, so it may take me a week or so to ship it out. Please keep that in mind. My feedback speaks for itself, thanks for looking.

Our Motto: Shoot Zombies, not paper!

October 17, 2015 Zombie Shooters United (ZSU) will hold it’s last Zombie Killer Series Shoot of the year … “The South Will Rise Again”. If you want to shoot zombies rather than just imagine paper & steel plates are zombies, this Zombie Shoot is for you! We offer the only 3-gun “running & gunning” style Zombie Apocalypse themed competitive shooting match using realistic, life size, interactive zombie targets requiring precise brain shots to bring them down. Our shooters call this scenario driven, full immersion, experience “live ammo role playing”. Bring your pistol, shotgun & rifle (or rent them at Knob Creek Range) and we’ll bring the undead. Fight your way through the lost Rebel’s Roost enclave from a truck and on foot. Up to $1500 in prizes to be awarded from our sponsors, most as door prizes!

Participation in the event will be limited due to space restriction at the site and the time it takes to run the course!   Pre-registration guarantees a spot on the course. Walk-ins shooters will be accepted as long as we have enough range time to permit them to shoot.  All shooters must be at least 18 years old.  Spectator tickets will also be sold for non-shooters.  Pre-registered participants will have their time slots scheduled and will participate before walk-in shooters.

To learn more about the zombie killer event stages and scenario visit our website www.ZombieShootersUnited.com or check our facebook page @ZombieShoot & follow us on twitter @Team_ZSU for daily updates."

I've had no problems with the pistol but this conversion kit can be finicky with the 22 ammo because it is still new. It is a stupid accurate little shooter too and will fit any full sized 1911 frame. $530 or BEST OFFER -- Comes with both original boxes. I'm only interested in trades if you happen to have sheet metal for a 1968-1969 Chevelle or El Camino. Thanks! Email me if interested."

History:

 George Kellgren, an Engineer from Sweden, moved to the US in 1979, and eventually founded the firearms company Grendel, Inc. in 1987.  In 1990 he developed and introduced the Grendel P-30, which was a .22wmr Pistol that had the capacity of 31rds, and weighed only 26ozs fully loaded.  The pistol remained in production until 1994, when Mr. Kellgren sold the company.  He founded another firearms company, Kel-Tec CNC Industries, or better known as Kel-Tec, and began producing firearms once again in 1995.  In 2011, Mr. Kellgren produced the PMR-30, which was modeled from his earlier P-30 design. 

 That brings us to the 2nd Pistol.  The Keltec PMR-30, is as new, and has only been factory test fired.  It too comes with 2 30rd mags, and will additionally include factory case, manual, and other accessories/papers. 

This pkg. is $1500.  A cash sale is preferred, but a cash plus pistol trade may be considered with more towards the cash end."

Only shot this comp maybe 50 times on a AR pistol I have. Awesome muzzle control eliminates recoil, shoots extremely flat and keeps the muzzle down for fast follow up shots even with a short barrel and carbine gas system.  

From VG6:
The VG6 GAMMA 556 is a muzzle brake and compensator hybrid.  It virtually eliminates recoil and minimizes muzzle movement.  The unique combination of both braking and compensating features inspire shooter confidence and allows the shooter to make very fast follow up shots. Its unique chamber geometries give it a very soft feel in the shoulder and the gas ports dimensions have been strenuously tested to give the utmost control to the muzzle.
The VG6 GAMMA 556 has been tuned for versatility. While it is perfect for SBR’s and AR pistols the brake has been optimized for 10.5"" to 18.5"" barrel lengths. The Gamma556 will allow you to saturate the target no matter how fast you shoot."
