At first glance you would think that the Colt 901 is just a .308 Win./7.62 NATO version of a standard AR-15, much like any other .308 AR out there, but it is a lot more than that. The Colt LE901-16S is a “Modular Carbine,” which means it can be adapted to any AR-15 platform upper. This isn’t a new concept, because there are of course a whole bunch of different caliber uppers for ARs. The difference is in all the other ones, they have adapted a standard size AR magazine to boutique calibers and cartridge designs. The Colt 901 is different. It can be adapted from .308/7.62, using standard P-Mags, to .223/5.56, using standard AR mags, and back again, in literally seconds. The design uses one proprietary part, and you have to swap out the recoil system. It is that simple, and it works fantastic.

Has a Bushnell AR223 1-4 power scope on it, zeroed at 25 meters (shot 1 inch groups offhand with XM193). Have 8 magazines for it and about 100 rounds of XM193 5.56 ammo. Have $1200 invested in it.

It has had all the excess oil cleaned off. Slide to frame fitment is pretty decent, not great, but pretty good. Some wiggle. Crisp trigger (dry fired to test pull) Parkerized finished it by the looks of it.  Any questions just ask. Text preferred. You can email me, but you it may be awhile before you get a reply.

Includes the gun, recoil pad, the one piece scope mount pictured and the original two piece scope mount. The scope and level are NOT included.

This is not the original stock, it is a replacement from Boyd's. You can see a hole drilled out towards the front, this is to accommodate a swivel stud that was originally there. But I would NOT use it, you will end up pulling the barrel down into the stock and negating your freefloat. If you want a swivel stud, you will need to drill one directly into the stock. If the hole is a problem aesthetically, it can be cleaned up with some wood filler. 

Feel free to contact me about trades. I'm mostly interested in AR15 parts."

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.
The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

The beauty of this scope vs other low power variables is that since the red dot is daylight visible and it is a true 1x power on the low end, you can truly use it as an Aimpoint type sight for CQB or crank it to 6x for longer shots.

I've only used this scope a handful of times at a local indoor range.  I will ship out of state for an extra $15.  Details below:

Scope:
Made in the USA and decorated with a 24k gold-plated ring and a medallion, the matte black 1-6x24 VX-6 Riflescope from Leupold is designed for medium-to-long range shooting and features a FireDot Circle reticle. The proprietary Xtended Twilight Lens System offers index-matched multiple anti-glare coatings that maximize light transmission in low-light situations. In order to improve contrast and reduce stray light, the environmentally friendly lead-free optical elements have their edges blackened. The DiamondCoat 2 protective coatings on external surfaces protect optics from scratches. To help you compensate for wind drift and ballistic bullet drop, the scope offers 75 MOA windage and elevation adjustment ranges with a 1/4 MOA impact point correction. 

Located in the second focal plane, the FireDot Circle reticle features a bold lower post, three fine posts, and a bright-red illuminated fine center dot surrounded by a circle. It is designed for fast-moving targets, including dangerous game like a wild boar, but can also be used for hunting turkey. Because of its location in the second focal plane, the reticle will remain the same in size as you change zoom factor. 

The 6061-T6 aluminum housing is lightweight and durable, waterproof, fogproof, and features a twin bias spring erector system that increases holding force by 30%. To prevent fogging-up of optics when you are moving through environments with changing temperatures, the housing is filled with a mixture of argon and krypton gases. Moreover, this riflescope is equipped with a Custom Dial System (CDS) which allows you to quickly switch the elevation of your sight-in ranges. Also included with the riflescope are a CR2032 battery, an Allen wrench, protective lens covers, and a protective riflescope cover.

Mount:
The Industry Standard.
The LT104 is the best mount made for attaching high-power riflescopes onto flattop-style AR15's, period.

The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.

The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.

Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.

Assembly and adjustment only takes a few minutes, then off to the range."

Here is some info and what has been done:

The frame is from an unfired German P229. The serial number places its date of manufacture at 2006. So this part is NEW.

The folded carbon slide/barrel is from a Made in Germany P228. The serial number from it is a 2001, with approximately 100 rounds through it total, and has been a safe queen part (the frame was sold long ago, so had been an extra slide in the safe when I decided to take on the project). The guide rod and spring are like-new as well.

The 9mm locking block insert is NEW, just purchased. I replaced the .40 insert for it so that it could be properly converted to 9mm.

The aluminum grips are the older style OEM version. Very difficult to find. They have been used on a couple of range trips and are immaculate. They, too, are LNIB. Finding a pair in this condition typically sets one back $160.

Comes with the appropriate P229-1 15-round magazine, also NEW and unused. Essentially there is no real difference in this version versus the last run coming out of Exeter in 2009, except maybe the price. Need to sell to fund an upcoming trip. Will come with owner's manual, lock and a red CPO box for transport.

At first glance, the Model 101 appears to be a traditionally styled 6-shot single-action revolver. Actually it is a single-shot pistol with dummy cylinder pinned to the barrel to form an integral unit. Thus, there is no gap at junction of barrel and cylinder to leak gas as in ordinary revolvers.The barrel and cylinder swing to the right to expose the breech for loading or ejection. The rod ejector is actuated by a thumb button under the left side of the barrel near the muzzle. The firing pin is of spring-loaded independent type pinned in the frame. The hammer rebounds so that it is unnecessary to partially or fully cock it before opening the breech. The mainspring is a virtually unbreakable coil spring. The frame and dummy cylinder are of die-cast alloy with barrel and other parts of steel. Grips are of laminated walnut-colored wood impregnated with plastic.

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

The slide action, also known as a pump-action, means that the shotgun has a moving bolt system which is operated by a “wooden or composite slide called the fore-end”.[5] The fore-end is located on the underside of the barrel and moves front to back. The weapon can hold a maximum of five rounds total with four in the tubular magazine and one in the chamber. It has a hammerless action which means that there is no external hammer spur. There is only a firing pin which strikes the primer on the shell to ignite the powder in the round. The Model 1200 is a takedowntype of shotgun; it can be taken apart for easy storage and transportation.[6]The Model 1200 was the first shotgun to utilize a rotary bolt with four locking lugs secured within the barrel extension. The 1200 was Winchester’s first shotgun to incorporate the company’s patented Winchoke system, a quick change tube to allow the easy replacement of chokes.[1]Model 1200 Hunting: 28-inch barrel with a built-in choke and a five-shell tubular magazine."
