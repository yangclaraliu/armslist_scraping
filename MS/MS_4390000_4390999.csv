Will include original mag spring, plug, and cap. Here is a list of differences between the Express model and the Police model • 870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection. • All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift. • All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality. • Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function. • A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs. • A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds. • Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety. • The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks. • The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty. • The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing. • The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.. • Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

Purchased from CMP in 2004. Has mainly been a safe queen since.
100% correct, unlike many HRA rifles for sale here. Barrel, bolt trigger group, oprod, etc., all HRA. Stock is HRA but markings have been sanded off. Not a rebuild, chamber is in the white. Barrel dated 10-53. Original finish is nice.
Muzzle guages less than 2 on a CMP guage, Throat guages a bit less than 4 on a Badger Ordnance guage.
Handguards have some dings but are original USGI. Stock is an H&R that was on another rifle of mine but I put it on this as the CMP stock was not as good. I was going to strip and steam the handguards, but never got to it. Easy to do, happy to advise you if you wish.
$1150.00 or best reasonable offer.

The gun functions properly, but does have some amount of surface rust and some pitting along the trigger guard, the bluing varies across the piece.  The rifling looks good and is clearly visible.  I have not tried to clean the gun up at all, and it may look better after some fine steel wool and oil.   As a majority of these guns were modified to shoot alternate ammunition an all original .455 Webley had ejector is fairly rare.  $575 OBO.

FERFRANS Muzzle Brake Concussion Reduction System

Description:

The FERFRANS CQB Modular Muzzle Brake System is a two part system consisting of the performance muzzle brake mount + CRD (Concussion Reduction Device) which features a built in quick attach/detach mechanism. 

The muzzle brake effectively mitigates felt recoil and muzzle movement and with the CRD attached does this while minimizing side blast/concussion and redirects sound to the front of the shooter. It is a two piece modular system that includes (1) very effective high performance muzzle brake and (2) a ported Concussion Reduction Device (CRD) that attaches to the muzzle brake using a quick detach mechanism. The CRD has strategically placed side ports that allow the muzzle brake to retain its compensator functionality as opposed to brake shields that cover the brake and negates its function. 

With the CRD attached, recoil feels like a slight, straight to the rear push (it's a softer recoil feel, not the typical sharp kick). It is, of course, a compromise between reducing side concussion versus minimizing felt recoil. We believe we have achieved an optimal balance of sufficient brake/ compensator functionality (muzzle leveling effect) and side concussion reduction. The CRD has a quick detach/attach mechanism to allow you to easily switch back to a full brake whenever you.
Specifications:

Muzzle Brake:
Weight - 3.9 oz
Length - 2.28""
Thread Pattern - 1/2x28 or 5/8x24
Caliber - (.223/5.56) or (.308/7.62)

CRD (Concussion Reduction Device): 
Length - 2.17""
Width - 1.6"" Diameter
Total weight of the system combined is 10.3 ounces

Note: When CRD is attached the tip of the muzzle and CRD are flush"

Non-import; NO import markings. CMP rifle purchased a few years ago from the original owner. 
Original barrel is dated 6-43. Type II lockbar rear sights. -12SA bolt. WWII SA gas cylinder and correct lock is SA WWII with the bevel. Lock screw is a later replacement as you would expect to find. Oprod is D35382 SA with relief cut. Stock is correct, can still see the EcMf Final Inspection Stamp, or ""Cartouche"" as most refer to it. Correct for this date of manufacture. Can still see the firing proof 'P' as well. Has a small hole near the bottom of the grip where a arms room tag or metal stock disc insert would have been, about the size of a nickel/quarter. Also has the serial number of another rifle imprinted in lower portion of butt, below the grip. Handguards have later metal. Buttplate is WWII SA. Trigger group is correct and appears original in finish to the parts as a whole. Milled trigger guard, early -1 SA, housing is -5 SA, hammer is C46008-2 SA, safety is marked SA.

Not too much work required to fill the tag/disc indent in the stock, steam and raise the previous serial number out, and obtain a few needed parts to make this a 100% correct WWII rifle worth $3500.00 to $4500.00, or leave as is and enjoy it as what it is, a survivor that had a few parts replaced along the way as upgrades were available.

Almost forgot MW=just over 3, TE=just over 4. Amazing for an original barrel.

Serious only please. $2750.00 or best reasonable offer.

MagPul PRS stock, 
Geissele SSA-E trigger, 
Threaded 5/8x24""tpi Barrel with matching thread cap.

The Rifle has only 300 rounds total shot thru it and its in Excellent Condition.

This GAP-10 Sniper Rifle comes with an 18.5"" Bartlein 5R barrel with 1x11.25"" twist rate and shoots Lights Out. Well under 1/2"" groups at 100 yards all day long. Runs Great with all ammo tested. I have shot this out to 300 yards, the maximum distance of my gun range, and it shoots right at 1 inch with a 3 round group.

I have the Build Sheet and all paperwork that came with it from GA-Precision along with the hard shell case that it came in.""

I have added a ****SLR Sentry 8 Adjustable Gas Block**** which works great.

Also added Battle Arms Development - Ambidextrous Safety Selector AND UPGRADED the rail to the Patriot Ordnance MMR M-rail

I have put an additional 300 rounds through rifle so round count is now 600.

Includes 2 magazines, YMH Bipod adapter, and hard case.

Have gotten several emails asking why the asking price is same as MSRP.

Base price is $2890, need to add PRS stock ($210), adjustable gas block ($120) and threaded muzzle ($175) ambi safety ($50) and shipping ($75). 


So total cost new would be $3520 plus 10-12 month wait.

16"" barrel, Flat Dark Earth, 5.56/223 Semi-Auto Rifle
The IWI Tavor SAR FD16 Rifle features an innovative design (bullpup) which allows for a full length barrel (16.5 inches), which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt (can be changed at the factory), the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The Tavor Rifle was built through collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to fit the need for close quarters engagements. The Tavor SAR FD16 features an aluminum receiver with a Mil Spec Cold Hammer Forged Barrel, all covered by high impact strength polymer uni-body allowing for excellent ergonomics. The bull pup design allows for easy transition in close quarters without sacrificing barrel length. The Tavor is supplied with a 30rnd PM ag and you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazin"

I've owned this 101 Diamond Grade Trap Combo for around 15 years or so.  It is in EXCELLENT condition.  I've just had the wood refinished in high gloss by the factory refinisher, Midwest Gun Works in Missouri, and the job came out perfect!  Honestly, it looks like glass!  It's not been fired since the refinish job, and I don't want to risk getting any marks on it.  So it'll probably stay in the safe until it finds its next home.

You, kind sir, are not part of the problem regarding .22lr ammo. You ARE the problem. Ten cents a round is a ripoff even for CCI and you're selling bulk and otherwise inexpensive ammo for rediculous prices and the fact you have ten bricks at that price is disturbing in itself. Don't buy from this person and DONT trade (basically round for round of 9mm) with this guy. THIS is the reason the shelves are empty and stores are all but void of the most commonly produced ammo on the market. Absolutely sickening...

You, kind sir, are not part of the problem. You ARE the probelm! Selling 50rd boxes of basic .22lr for $10 each is appauling and what is equally appauling is that you're gouging the shooting community and trying to make double, triple, and even quadruple what you paid. I don't know what's more disturbing... The fact that you're selling otherwise cheap and dirty bulk ammo at .20 a round of the fact that you have TEN BRICKS! There's a reason you can go into Walmart and find a box of .50BMG but not a box of .22lr and that reason is you. Paying .10 a round at the stores is considered a ripoff in my book and paying .20 a round private party is a joke. And you're asking to trade for 9mm? What, round for round? Cabelas has 100rd packs of MiniMags for $8 and 325rd packs of federal auto bulk for $18 and I hope that NO ONE buys this ammo from you or trades you for your desired caliber. The worlds most common round and also the most mass produced round is all but impossible to find and its not because there is a shortage, it's because of people like you who get to the stores before they open, race to the ammo section, and sell their ""scores"" at triple what they paid for it...

I bought a bronze 22/45 lite, and it has the frame with the removable grips. I don't like them. I want the slim, molded, lightweight frame that just has texture. Even though the one I have is worth more, and UNFIRED, I will trade straight across for the slim frame.

Since this is NOT the ""firearm"" part of the gun, this is open to Washington residents as well. Pictured is the grip panel model followed by the molded one I want.

Ruger's response to my request: ""we don't recommend changing any component from the factory originals. Sights, frames, triggers, disconnectors, springs, bolts, firing pins, or uppers.""
Me:""you have the most customizable 22 rifle on the planet, do you not recommend changing the MAGAZINES either?!""
Ruger: ""I suppose that's fine, but we can't guarantee the firearm will function.""
Me: SMH

Thank you.

Aditional: Apparently I need to clarify that I'm ONLY looking for the slim frame in trade. I don't want any sanded down Saturday night specials, no amount of 22 ammo, no Nigerian inheritances, no Honda Gold Wing exhaust systems, no iphones, xboxes, playstation machines, no gig by your band in the garage of my choice, no tattoo work, no full size replicas of the Mona Lisa, or Magna Carta.

As stated the Makarov is in almost new condition. Was unfired when I got it and I've only put 150 rounds through it since.  This is an Arsenal commercial model and not military surplus, so it is in excellent condition cosmetically, I'd say around 95-98%.  Is still in military configuration though with fixed military sights and bakelite grip.  Will come with two 8 round magazines (one of which is serial matched to the gun), a surplus military flap holster, and 450 rounds of 9x18mm ammo.  

I've enjoyed Makarovs but I'm looking for something a little smaller for carry this summer.  Primarily interested in a Springfield XDs (prefer 9mm but would still consider 45), a Ruger LC9s plus cash or ammo,  Walther PPS, a S&W J Frame of some kind in 38 special (not interested in LCR's), Glock 26 or 27, or maybe a Ruger SR9c or SR40c.
