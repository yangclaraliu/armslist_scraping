And 100 rounds of HIGH Velocity Ammo. You can choose between Blazers or Remington Gold Bullet. Both are clean burning ammo with enough power to cycle this big semi-auto pistol.

The PLR-22 pistol is chambered for the popular and economical .22 Long Rifle cartridge (.22LR). It is based on the 5.56mm NATO chambered PLR-16 pistol and shares many parts including the grip and front and rear sights. The PLR-22 is not a simple conversion kit, it is a standalone firearm chambered for the .22LR and is designed for target shooting, plinking, or small game hunting. The PLR-22 operates by blowback action and has a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The cross-bolt safety and magazine release operate identically to the PLR-16 and SU-16.

The first is a 96a1, in very good condition, has had less than 500 rounds through it. This is the newer A1 model, so it has a railed frame and a shock buffer in the frame to extend it service life. Will come with its box and three 12 round magazines.

The second is a 92FS compact. Has carry wear but is mechanically in good condition. Only comes with one 13 round magazine, but the 40 Cal mags from the 96a1 will feed and fire 9mm in it, and any capacity 9mm 92 mag out there will work in it. The only thing I can really say against it is that it could use a new set of grips, the Hogue's on it are in rough condition.

I would like to trade the pair for something different. Would be most interested in a pair of Glocks, such as a 22 or 23 and a 26, or a 17 or 19 and a 27. Would be interested in a similar set up of XD's, or a similar combination of semi auto handguns. Would also be interested in trading both for a higher end handgun such a 9mm Sig (P226, 229, etc), HK P30, or similar.

 Would sell or trade the 96a1 by itself for 600 or for one of the handguns mentioned before, or a VP9, PPQ or similar, but I will not sell or trade the 92fs without the 96a1, sorry!

I have cash, and would like to buy a working Eotech Holographic sight (no clones, please- I've had a couple and have broken each one after little use). If yours has a reticle that turns green when you push the NV button (550 series), it's a clone. There are some elaborate fakes out there, but they can be identified with the proper knowledge. I'm only looking for an authentic unit, so please don't offer a fake.

As long as the unit functions fine and the lenses are good, I don't care about scratches or missing finish (this isn't going to mounted on a show rifle, rather on a shooter-grade gun). I'm not looking for extras, but I would consider them, if offered.

I don't want anything that is stolen either, so unless you bought it from a dealer or second-hand (from someone who purchased it from a dealer), please refrain from offering.
I will pay fair value for your unit, depending upon condition and function (you offer the item and your price, and we'll discuss it). 

If you ask full retail price, the unit had better be brand-new and include a warranty. Likewise, if your unit is badly scratched-up or has cracks or a corroded or damaged battery cover, please don't think it's worth full retail price. Please be realistic, and we'll work something out.

I'm willing to travel a bit (within reason), to meet with you, to close the deal. Feel free to email me, through the Armslist email system, and we'll go from there.

2 stripped M4 (one marked with ""O"" and the other a box forge mark) uppers epoxy painted and clear coated in what I like to call ""Okie Earth"".

A streamlined, anti-snag profile shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation and the extra-power lock mechanism uses a premium chrome-silicon spring to avert auto-collapse failure by resisting spring relaxation. Similar to the Magpul CTR™, the ACS also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes wobble* for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy. Dual, rear accessible, water-resistant battery storage tubes and an integral storage compartment in the butt of the stock provides multiple storage options. The ACS comes standard with a 0.30"" thick rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear. Made in U.S.A. * Friction lock performance may vary depending on the receiver extension's dimensional tolerances. Features * Mounts on commercial-spec sized carbine receiver extension tube (not included) from manufacturers such as Bushmaster, DPMS, Olympic, and others (please see the note below) * Supplemental friction lock minimizes accuracy robbing wobble* * Premium chrome-silicon lock spring provides positive locking and long service life * Sloping cheek weld provides a wide contact surface for user comfort * Shielded release latch prevents snagging and accidental operation * Replaceable 0.30"" Rubber Butt-Pad offers an anti-slip surface and increases impact protection * Compatible with Magpul ASAP® and other receiver-mount sling attachments * Metal strike plate provides a hardened striking point on toe of stock * Two water-resistant battery storage tubes located on the left and right sides of the stock o Each tube will store up to three CR123 lithium or two AA batteries o Tubes are accessible from the rear via a tethered, hand-removable rubber plug * Storage compartment in tail of stock with positive latching access door on right hand side * Sling Mounts o Mid - Optional QD Sling Mount accommodates up to 1.5"" push-button swivels (NOTE: QD Sling Mount Sockets are sold seperately.) o Rear/Bottom - 1.00"" sling loop Optional Accessories** * Extended Rubber Butt-Pad, 0.55"" * Enhanced Rubber Butt-Pad, 0.70"" * Push-button QD Sling Mount Sockets Specifications** * ACS, Commercial-Spec Carbine Stock (w/ Rubber Butt-Pad, 0.30"") o Weight, Stock: 0.89 lb. o Weight, w/ Rec.

Background: 
In September 2013, Ruger began production of the Ruger American in Mayodan NC. The boxes of the first 1,000 rifles were affixed with a special ""First Production Run"" sticker. Rifles with serial numbers 832-01001 through 832-02000 were the only ones to leave the factory with this special sticker. Ruger auctioned the first five of those rifles for charities. The other 995 rifles were circulated through distribution in the Carolinas only."

Smooth, streamlined exterior contours prevent snagging on clothing, sling, or vegetation, and helps ensure fast exits from vehicles without snagging on gear. Removable battery storage compartments run the full length of the extra-wide comb and hold 2 AA or 3 CR-123 batteries, while providing a wide, contoured area for an exceptionally solid, comfortable cheekweld. Secure molded rubber caps keep water and dust out of compartments and face the rear of the stock for easy removal; cap exterior is beveled to resist snagging when shouldering weapon. Positive-locking trapdoor on right side of the stock reveals a roomy storage compartment for additional batteries, coiled up cleaning cable and other cleaning supplies, ear plugs, spare parts, or other small items. Magpul’s dual locking system uses an additional cam lever to protect the release lever from accidental operation, yet still allows you to adjust length of pull by simply pushing on the release lever. Slot molded in the toe provides an attachment point for a 1¼"" wide sling. Also includes the same detachable rubber buttpad found on Magpul CTR and UBR buttstocks to help keep stock firmly mounted on shoulder.

Machined aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shaft provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1 / A2 type rifles with fixed stock. Note: The PRS™ requires a Rifle Receiver Extension tube, OEM Rifle Buffer and Spring (Not included).

581,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4584581,"For Sale:  MMHW , LOT OF 10: 'THE BRUSH' SELF-DEFENSE AND GROOMING TOOL!! Only 3 lots left","fayetteville area, Arkansas, United States",$ 35,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 20, 2015",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"ALMOST GONE!!!!
Here is a lot of 10 of 'The Brush', a self-defense Lexan polycarbonate spike inside a nice hairbrush. The Original was invented by Ted Frizzell of Mineral Mountain Hatchet Works, located in West Fork, around 1991-1992 and featured in Blade Magazine and Fighting Knives magazine. This is one very handy item to have in your pocket or purse whether your hair/beard needs a groom or some wannabe mugger needs a bit of dissuasion. It WILL do the job. I have sold thousands to nurses and women who have to work at night.
These particular units were manufactured right here in NWA, in Prairie Grove, before we were 'knocked' off by companies in Asia who used an inferior plastic. The design was also stolen by a dealer in SW Missouri; but, that is another story. I only have 3 lots of these [30 units] left in stock and when they are gone there will be no more. The molds were destroyed 10 years ago. I do have a couple of dozen of the spike without the cover at $2 per unit.  Contact me if you are interested.

You aint gonna find these at Wal-Mart or Cabelas. They are too politically correct to let your wives and daughters protect themselves. NOTE: Dont let your kids take these to school. They are legal and might save a life; but, what do school boards care about that? Your child will get expelled for no legal reason.
The cruciform spike is molded of neon yellow Lexan polycarbonate [same stuff police riot shields are made from] and comes very, very pointy. It is tough enough to penetrate most any clothing. The cover is of opaque virgin polypropylene and fits snugly around the spike/handle. It wont rotate or fall off. I recommend a very light coating of vaseline to the inside of the cover. Each lot has been so lubricated; but, it is a good idea to re-new the coating periodically.

Remember: Twist and tug and stick a thug!!!

Price is for the LOT of 10, not per brush.

This pistol makes a great CC weapon, comes with 2 (two) 6 (six) round magazines, and these mags are sometimes tough to find in stock for a good price. 

No trades please. Reasonable offers considered.

775,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4584775,For Sale:  Beeman P3 Air Pistol by Weirauch - Free Shipping,"Jefferson Township, Columbus, Ohio",$ 150,"Listed On: Sunday, August 16, 2015",Air,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I bought this from Pyramid Air about 2 years ago.  I might have fired it 100 times or so in my garage to train my wrists and elbows for indoor bullseye competition while .22LR ammo was in such short supply.  It turns out that I don't have the time for this sort of activity anyway, so I'm offering this incredible air pistol for sale.

If you're reading this far, I don't have to elaborate the difference between the German P3 and the Chinese-made P17.  They look the same, but they're completely different animals and I leave it at that.  Pyramid did a video on the P3 where they'd gauged the trigger at 1.2 pounds and chronographed the pistol at velocities upward of 370 fps. Noise maxed out at around 95 db, so it's fine for basement or garage use with a proper pellet trap.  The accuracy is exceptional.  The right person could easily compete with it in 10-meter matches alongside pistols that cost several times as much.

I'm sending the remaining can of Crossman .177 air pellets (this pistol will not shoot bb's), an open pack of NRA 5-meter targets, and an Allen pistol rug.  Below is a list of US states and/or municipalities that Pyramid will not ship to due to state/local laws regarding the shipment of air guns.  For that reason, I can not ship to mailing addresses within those areas.  The responsibility rests with the buyer for knowing their own local and state statutes. Thank you for looking!

Please review photos and ask questions but this was my personal rifle and is very accurate. Sighted in at 200yds in current configuration with 180 Partitions and I shoot MOA with it at that range. 

Rifle comes with two factory magazines. It still retains the factory sights with the flip-up rear and hooded front sight. I still have the booklet for this one somewhere if I can find it.

Scope is included. It is a Leupold varix-III 2.5-8x36. Leupold rebuilt it for me a couple years ago. I had it rebuilt because I didn't know a lot about it and I wanted click style adjustments instead of the MOA ones that don't have the clicker.

Barrel: A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.

The G43 is Glock's subcompact, slimline, single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43
is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is
ultra-concealable, accurate, and fantastic for all shooters regardless of
hand size. The grip has a built-in beaver tail design which allows the
shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the
grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine
catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the
same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other Glock
pistols.
