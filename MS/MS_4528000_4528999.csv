Nikon P-223 3x32 AR Riflescope. The new P-223 Series broadens Nikon’s line-up of precision optics for AR rifles. Designed for extreme sighting speed and superior long-range accuracy for AR platform rifles and .223 cartridges, the P-223’s entire optical system is fully multicoated for extreme brightness and provides light transmission up to 98%.The P-223 3x32 Carbine is an incredibly compact optic designed specifically for fast-handling, shorter barrel ARs. The all-new, fast-sighting BDC Carbine reticle was developed specifically for the 3x32 and .223 Remington cartridge to make engaging targets quickly and accurately both in-close and out to 600 yards. With tactical-style turrets with Zero-Reset feature to simplify field adjustments, the 3x32, like all Nikon AR riflescopes, is optimized for use with Nikon Spot On Ballistic Match Technology. Spot On allows you to discover all of the exact aiming points on the BDC carbine reticle for your exact ammunition and load.

BDC Carbine Reticle-Developed specifically for the trajectory of the .223 Rem /5.56 NATO round with 55-grain polymer tip bullet, the new BDC Carbine reticle provides a 200 yard crosshair with ''hash marks'' at 400 yards and 600 yards.

Fully Multicoated Optical System-Provides up to 98-Percent light transmission and maximum brightness from dawn to dusk.

Precise, 1/4-MOA Hand-turn Tactical-Style, Zero-Reset Turrets-Positive click reticle adjustments get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting - even withrepeated recoil.

I don't need it all sitting around so just reduced the price to only $50 per thousand.
THAT'S just a NICKEL A CASING!!
I'll even add extra cases to make sure you get all you pay for in good usable cases.
The USGI brass is nicely annealed and being once-fired it is not work-hardened so a great choice forming your 300 blackout, .17 Remington, 6 x 45 or other wildcat calibers.....the annealed brass is softer and easier to work with!

These are not polished, not cleaned, not processed....fresh off the range, they are dusty and will need to be cleaned, tumbled and the crimped primer pockets will need to be swaged, but what you get for your effort is a great price on some really high quality brass that will last you years with reasonable care. AND PRICES have just been REDUCED to just 5 cents for each case!

Mostly LC (recent years, 03, 05, 07 and 12) along with small amounts of other US contracts (small amounts of TAA 09 is one example)....all in great shape.

I got this gun in trade but I dont really want to get into shooting .50 caliber as I currently shoot many others and getting another mold or buying more balls just isnt going to happen.

Its in great shape, its blued with synthetic stock. Comes as pictured with sling and fiber optic sights. It is also drilled and tapped for scope mounts.

The bore looks good, but dirty. Since I dont shoot 50cal I dont have jags or brushes to clean it with. However, it is missing the breech plug, as such, I can use my light and look through the bore... it looks really good, though it is dirty... no obvious pitting. 

SO... in case you missed that... it needs a breech plug... but you can find TC plugs anywhere. BiMart, Sportsmans, ebay, etc."

.58 cal rifle by Ranson of Italy.

Im not sure what to make of it as it is unlike anything Ive seen before.

Its the illegitimate child of a '63 Zouave & an Enfield Musketoon

You can see in the first picture it is much shorter than the Zouave and very much resembles the Enfield. However, the Enfield had a straighter stock and no patchbox.

Anyhow this is a cool little .58 carbine that while it may not get you into the reenactment world... it will be fun to shoot and will take any four legged game in the area. 

This gun has been refinished by a previous owner as well as having Thompson Center fiber optic sights installed. There are some scratches in the finish and the finish on the stock is in good shape. 

The bore is a little dirty but when I shine my light in there its shiny and I cannot see any pitting.

WI drivers license a must, and CCW preferred. The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Remington's Exclusive ArmorLokt process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3-1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built- in. Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18-1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail."
