Again, as a result of popular demand, Buffalo Bore has added a new cartridge to its line—the 460 Rowland.

The 460 Rowland, as we load it, is squarely at mid 44 magnum power levels.  This means that a person can now carry a 1911 style combat pistol that has the power of a 44 mag. revolver, but is slimmer, faster to reload, faster to shoot and holds nine rounds instead of a revolver’s six.  The 460 Rowland casing is simply a 45 ACP case that has been slightly lengthened so it won’t chamber in a 45 ACP chamber.  It also has a stronger web area in the casing, so as to avoid ""blow outs"".

To acquire 460 Rowland test guns, I sent two of my 1911 45 acp pistols to Clark Custom Guns and had them install their 460 Rowland conversion kits. To date the converted 1911’s work great. I can fire a 255gr. hard cast bullet @ 1300 fps or a 230gr. FMJ-FN bullet @ 1350 fps. What a great ""woods"" pistol that still maintains combat pistol qualities.

We are using flash suppressed powders in each 460 Rowland load, so that if you have to shoot a bear or “bad guy” in the dark, the muzzle flash will not blind the shooter and we feel this feature is a big tactical advantage as most civilian shootings in America, occur in low light and we are willing to bet that most emergency wildlife shootings in the wilderness will be in low light too.

It should be noted that my 460 Rowland conversions are Clark Custom conversions. I did not try this ammunition in conversions manufactured by anyone other than Clark. This ammunition was reliable and safe in my test conversions, but I cannot verify the reliability or safety of this ammunition in conversions done by anyone other than Clark Custom."

The safe does have a couple of very small scratches on the exterior from being moved around. The quality of this safe makes your typical Sentry, Liberty, First Alert, etc. safes look like toys. This is not a safe that can be picked up and dropped until it opens. No one is going to walk off with this safe. It takes 2-3 guys to lift this. It includes the drawers for this inside which were a $300 option. Although it is marketed as a data safe because it protects against heat as well as fire, it would also make the ultimate normal household or handgun safe. This safe was purchased in 2008 for around $4,000. I see you can find them new now for around $2600."

Noveske is one of the premier manufacturers of AR-15 pattern rifles and this is a perfect example. This is a Noveske factory built gun, not a ""parts"" gun, and includes a certificate of authenticity with the built-on date. This rifle features a 16"" Stainless Steel barrel with a 1:7"" twist rate and Polygonal rifling. Polygonal rifling is an innovative alternative to conventional rifling, boasting increased velocity and accuracy, and significantly easier cleaning. The smooth bore profile provides an improved gas seal, decreases deformation of bullet jackets, and has no sharply angled grooves to hold deposits of fouling. Noveske's Stainless Steel barrels are made to fill a precision role while retaining flawless function. Retaining accuracy and reliability is a complicated balance in that the chamber needs to be slightly modified from the NATO to improve bullet hook-up in the throat, while keeping to functional properties of the NATO body dimensions. The result is a proprietary Noveske chambering. The steel used is a type of 416r and hardened to about 30 HRC prior to any machining. These barrels are button rifled with Noveske's proprietary 7 PT button. This design and the type of stainless used helps the lead edge of the rifling from eroding as fast as it might with conventional rifling, and the barrels tend to outlast others. The barrel has a bead blasted finish for a matte appearance. A mid-length gas system is used, decreasing heat related wear to critical internal componentry, and reducing felt recoil to the operator. For use in any precision application, Noveske recommends a Stainless Steel barrel for its edge in accuracy and excellent reliability."

This pistol was sent back to the pro shop after purchase to have the works done to it...Ramps were polished as well as the barrel, nicest custom trigger was installed and the springs adjusted, Kimbers best night sites were added & the insides were basically given a complete overhaul and tune-up so that it functions flawlessly and is smooth as silk to operate. When the gun artived home it was sent away again, this time to Novaks gun shop fpr the details that make this Kimber a truly one of a kind pistol that u wont see another of. The Gunsmiths at Novaks took particular time and care to blacken in all the engraving on the pistol. Once the engraving was done they began work on the rest of the pistol creating an immaculate two tone design that truly showcases this Kimbers design aesthetics. The slide was reworked as well as the lower, paying close attention to the guns visual appeal and stainless steel begginings. You will truly enjoy this piece, as will every other person that has the chance to gaze upon its pristine shape and condition! The work alone in this pistol was well over 1000$ and the original cost of the pistol at purchase was 1,100$. Included with this piece is 5 clips (2 Kimber and 3 McCormick), as well as a very nice aftermarket cabellas softcase, and a Don Hume custom leather CC Holster in black. I will also throw in 100 rounds of .45 so once it arrives u can head straight to the range without having to call all over trying to find ammo. The price on this custom work of art is 1450.00$ OBO (your basically getting the pistol at cost minus all the acessories an ammo sheesh lol...). Trades of FNH firearms will be accepted as well as other hard to find pieces but cash is king and needed more than another gun for the collection. This piece has seen bery few trips to the range and is tight as can be and ready to be broken in by a new loving master! Act quickly before you miss your chance to own a Kimber of this model that u will nver see the likes of again.

I purchased this gun for $319.99 plus tax from Fin-Feather-Fur in Ashland on June 29, 2013 (will provide supporting documentation).  I've only put 65 rounds through it and it has functioned flawlessly.  I'm simply selling the gun because I had to have the Springfield XDS .45 when I saw it and it has replaced the Kel-Tec.  I'm also selling $100.00 worth of ammo with the gun.  A total of easily $450.00 worth of firearm and ammunition for $350.00.  This price is firm and non-negotiable as it won't take long to find a willing buyer.

The PF-9 is a semi-automatic 9mm Luger pistol that comes with one single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.

I mounted it on my Sig, sighted it in with about 20 rounds then went another way with a different AR. It is in perfect condition and comes with the Sig G1 Rail style mount. Awesome scope, hell it's a SIG!!!
The CP1 Prismatic Scope is a lightweight solution for fast target acquisition.
This rugged and reliable scope provides assured accuracy from a 3X fixed
magnification reticle, graduated to 600 meters. It features three reticle
modes – non-illuminated black, illuminated green and illuminated red, with
each illuminated mode offering 5 brightness settings. Anodized aluminum
construction ensures optimal performance in the most extreme conditions.
I have the original box but still trying to find manual, I can print one from Sig if needed. Has simple operation.

If you know what it is you're interested. If you don't and you want an AK be sure to read below. These don't come available very often. It is in like new condition. 

I am selling an as new Bulgarian made Arsenal SLR-101S AK rifle, caliber 7.62x39mm. The SLR101 is made in Bulgaria and imported as a complete rifle. This means both the receiver and barrel are original Arsenal BG milspec. Rifle comes with 1 Bulgarian made 40rd magazine. The original Soviet Russian AK47 utilized a milled receiver from the late 1940s until the adoption of the less expensive and lighter AKM in 1959. Most other Warsaw Pact nations followed suit and switched from the milled AK47 to the stamped AKM. While Arsenal in Bulgaria did manufacture stamped rifles starting in the 1960s, it never abandoned the milled design and continued to update and modernize it. The Bulgarian military has been using these weapons for decades, in various configurations.
Back in 2001, Arsenal Inc. of NV in the USA imported a milled rifle from Arsenal of Bulgaria called the SLR101. This rifle had an original Bulgarian made milled receiver, as well as an original Bulgarian barrel. This line was discontinued 10 years ago and only in 2012 has Arsenal once again imported a batch of SLR101s. Arsenal has done the SA M7 line with a milled receiver, but with one key difference; the SA M series used a US made milled receiver and other US parts. The SLR101 is wholly made in Bulgaria and is imported into the US as a complete weapon. It is brought in without a bayonet lug and with a thumbhole stock, to get around import restrictions. Once in the country, Arsenal Inc. installs a proper butt stock, pistol grip, and muzzle brake. They also insure the rifle is capable of accepting any standard AK double stack, high capacity magazines. All parts are Bulgarian made, except for the required 922(r) ones. These parts are made in the USA by Arsenal, but to original Bulgarian specifications and include: the furniture set, trigger group, and muzzle brake.
Comparing the 2012 SLR101-13 to the 2001 SLR101s, the same manufacturing quality and fit and finish can be found. Since the 2001 rifles were sold during the 1994 Clinton AWB, they were not allowed to have either the removable muzzle device, threaded barrel, or bayonet lug. These modern SLR101 rifles though have all of these features as the AWB sunset in 2004.
This rifle features: original Arsenal of Bulgaria AK47 style milled receiver, original 16"" long Cold Hammer Forged barrel with a chrome lined bore, standard 14mm threads on the end of the barrel, side-mount on the receiver for optics, a smooth double hook trigger, intermediate length polymer butt stock, milspec polymer hand guards with steel heat shield, standard military pistol grip, and the ability to accept any standard AK47/AKM magazines and drums. These milled Arsenals are known for their reliability and trouble-free service; but if it does have any problems, it is fully covered under Arsenal's warranty. It has been a decade since any milled receiver rifles have come in from Bulgaria and I don't think I am out of line in saying they are some of the finest AK pattern rifles ever produced. All moving parts work smoothly; the rifle is very accurate, durable, and great looking. 
Asking $1,350. Need to sell but won't just give it away, so no low ballers please. 
Pictures can be send by request. 
Thanks for looking and God Bless."

These guns are nice and in good condition, Ive lowered the price for quick sale. The bundle of these three guns will run you only 1500, thats 150 off my original asking price, and well below market value for these guns. Comes with everything listed below. Thanks!

#1:
Beautiful Springfield XD with trijicon night sights and all parts and paper work included. Only had 5 mags ran through it. Shoots great. 

2-13 round mags,
Trijicon night sights,
extra fobus holster.

#2:
I have a nicely accesorized Yugo sks for sale or possible trade. The wood stock was in good condition previously, but has been very beautifully refinished. A shock absorbing butt pad has been installed in place of the normal metal butplate. The bayonet is included but has been replaced by a bipod. It has extendable legs and folds up nicely without adding much weight to the front of the rifle due to the fact that its a sturdy polymer. It has upgraded flip up iron sights meant for low light as well as the original iron sights. It also comes with a 6x40 leapers scope mounted on a dust cover that can be bolted in place so the rifle holds a good zero as well as the original normal dust cover. Comes with approximately 7 stripper clips and an ammo pouch. I have 150 rounds of wolf 7.62x39 and 20 rounds of remington soft point brass ammo which is of course included.

#3:
I have a very nice fnp-9 9mm pistol for sale. Need to sell cause Im moving and the military doesnt pay much extra so I need to get rid of some toys.

Pistol is in great condition, 250 rounds down range very accurate.
Comes with:
3-16 round mags. All original FN mags.
Nice fobus holster
200 rounds of fmj ammo.


So there you are, nice package of good well taken care of weapons. Will need bos and to see id. No felons, must be 21 since pistols are included.

It has numbers matching on scabbard throat insert and on the blade. It is in good shape and has the wood liner in scabbard yet. 
Sword is a type 95. It has the 9mm thick tsuba or guard, has the aluminium tsuka or handle as its called. Has the lanyard ring. The iron tsuba or guard came in during mid 1941. The aluminium handled swords with the brass tsuba or guard were 11mm thick guards and then the 9mm brass  were made. The aluminium handles with brass guards ran from 1938 to early to mid 1941. The first issues of the type 95 swords had the copper handles with brass guards and started production in 1937. 

There were three manufactures or arsenals for these swords. Tokyo First, Nagoya and Kokura but Kokura more so administered the program they did not directly supervise nor produce any of the type 95 swords. But their marking will be found on the Fuchi as this sword has their marking. 

The fuchi markings on this sword read Gifu-Nagoya-Kokura
Gifu being the corporate logo of the group within the arsenal , there were six altogether.
second is nagoya which is the arsenal inspection mark and third the kokura arsenal inspection stamp, produced under their administration. 

This sword has a blade made by nagoya and you can tell because when you read the serial number on blade the cutting edge is facing upwards. On tokyon first blades when reading the number it faces downwards. And the Fuchi is also stamped with the Nagoya marking as well. 

The blade has the proper tip and has the correct fuller in blade. The NCO's were machine made blades so there is no family or sword makers mark on the tang like others brought into military service by officers who had a family sword to use which would have that family or makers marking. 

This is not a reproduction sword. It is complete and correct per the specs in the book Swords of Imperial Japan 1868-1945 Cyclopedia Edition wrote by Jim Dawson.

Hello,

     This is to inform you that the payment has been mail out. So will get back to you once i have the tracking #.
Am very sorry for my late response. To be candid with you,have been going through hell with my daughter's illness thats why couldn't reply all your emails.

I have been a bit offline for a while due to my daughter's illness, I was away because I was called that my daughter was seriously sick and she was being rushed to the hospital. After several tests were performed on her, we got to know that she is suffering from breast cancer and she has to go through chemo treatment and surgical operation in Ecuador. I am sorry for the slow Response. I want to inform you that my assistant has sent out the payment to your contact address you gave me and it will be delivered to you 3-4 days but there is something I must bring to your notice, I discovered that some how my assistant have over paid you. The payment that was meant for another transaction was sent to you and the one meant for you was sent to another but the payment is on your name.I am very mad at her right now!

However I want to believe I won't have any problem with this and if I can trust you with my money. I don't even know you.I have never met you and don't know if I can trust you with the money.Please once you receive the payment, I will like you to take it to your bank and deposit it.Deduct your money for the item and help me send the remainder so to treat my daughter..We will be needing it for the treatment.Please safe my daughter's life.I hope this arrangement would work out..I will arrange how the item is sent and received  by an FFL address..This is just for you to ensure that I am possessing the item legitimately..This will however be after you receive funds and we have everything sorted out. I am a bit indisposed right now and so mad at my assistant!!! 

Your urgent response will be appreciated so that my mind will be at ease.

The shotgun is beautiful and performs flawlessly.  It has only been lightly used during its lifetime and lately only used for shooting clays.  I have decided to go with an over/under shotgun since a semi-auto is more work at the range when you are limited to loading one shell at a time.  I have a printed copy of the owner's manual, 4 chokes, the choke wrench and the original soft case (which has a couple of stains).  Again this gun is beautiful in person, performs flawlessly and only has a mild kick due to the nice stock pad and the high pressure gas discharge system. It also has a three shot magazine adapter which when installed allows (2) 2 3/4"" or 3"" shells in the magazine and one in the chamber or when removed allows (4) 2 3/4"" shells or (3) 3"" shells in the magazine and one in the chamber.  It also has a magazine cut-off switch to allow you to switch the load in the chamber w/o emptying the magazine."

The rifling has rust and frosting but looks like it will clean up. I have not fired this rifle, but it seems to be in working order in exeption of one of the trigger guard screws being broken. I do have a replacement screw. I have done some digging on all the markings and from what I can tell it is NOT a Russian capture and is a original German WWI rifle, it has all numbers and stampings intact on stock, handguard, barrel rings, buttplate, trigger guard, barrel and receiver. No import marks or electro penciling. As far as numbers matching, the bolt, receiver and barrel have matching numbers.  The stock, hanguard and buttplate are a different number but match so it looks like the stock was changed, the stock has a stamped date 1920. I'm working getting pics together, I can send them upon request and will try to answer any further questions but I am not an expert and have done my best to be as detailed as possible in the description with the limited research I've done.
