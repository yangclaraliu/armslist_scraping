I'm not hard pressed to sell, just doesn't get much use so seeing if anybody wants it more than I do. I'm perfectly fine holding on to it, so asking price is pretty firm. I will need you to fill out an Ohio gun bill of sale, so make sure you are legally allowed to purchase a handgun.

For the first time, record High Definition directly to Memory Stick PRO Duo media card. The HDR-CX7 includes a professional-quality Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* lens and Super SteadyShot optical image stabilization, so you can capture the detail and clarity of high definition. Plus, you can take still images and video at the same time, all with exceptional battery life so you're sure to capture every moment.
HDR-CX7 Highlights
3.2-megapixel ClearVid CMOS sensor The 1/2.9-inch ClearVid CMOS sensor provides stunning detail and clarity with exceptional video (1080 lines of resolution in HD Mode; 530 lines of horizontal resolution in SD Mode) and still image performance (6.1-megapixel). Unlike traditional CCD imagers, CMOS sensors require less power, providing better battery performance.
Switchable HD/SD format recording The HDR-CX7 is capable of recording and playing back both High Definition (HD) and Standard Definition (SD) video recorded on Memory Stick PRO Duo media (sold separately).
x.v.Color Technology x.v.Color technology can capture or display nearly twice as many (1.8x) viewable colors than currently possible. This provides a more accurate and vivid color range, for a more natural, lifelike overall experience.
10x optical/20x digital zoom The optical zoom helps to bring the action close up from far away. In addition, the digital zoom interpolation means that extreme digital zooming is clearer, with less distortion than previous types of digital zoom.
Professional-quality Carl Zeiss Vario- Sonnar T* lens Carl Zeiss lenses have an advanced optical multi-layer coating that offers less glare and flare with increased contrast. This results in vivid image brilliance, true-to-life color saturation and perfect renditions of subtle tones. The additional T* coating on the lens further reduces unwanted glare and flare.
2.7-inch widescreen Hybrid touch-panel Clear Photo LCD Plus display The 2.7-inch 16:9 LCD screen provides excellent viewing clarity with improved resoltuion. The 211K-pixel screen also rotates up to 270 degrees for multiple viewing angles, providing sharp, detailed images for monitoring or playback. The widescreen format makes shooting in 16:9 mode and composing shots even easier.
Smooth slow record By increasing the record rate from 60 fields per second (fps) to 240 fps for 3 seconds allowing you to capture 3 seconds of fast motion and play the video back in 12 seconds. This is great for analyzing a golf swing or a viewing a bird in flight. In addition, record an audio track to narrate what is being seen in the video.
Memory Stick PRO Duo Media slot Capture still images up to 2848 x 2136 resolution, directly onto Memory Stick PRO Duo Media for easy trasfer to PCs for emailing, printing or shairing with other compatible Memory Stick PRO Duo devices.
Dual record While recording video in High Definition you have the ability to capture a 4.6-megapixel still image directly to Memory Stick PRO Duo media.
Super SteadyShot Optical Image Stabilization system An advanced form of Sony's SteadyShot Image Stabilization system that controls an even higher range of shake and vibration frequencies. This optical stabilization system achieves an even higher level of smoothness without degradation of vide like some digital stabilization systems.
Tele Macro function Useful for shooting close up shots, but without having the camcorder casting a shadow on the subject. Images shot in the Tele Macro mode will have the subject properly focused with the background unfocussed so that the subject stands out.
Active Interface Shoe Provides a location directly on the camcorder on which to add optional accessories while providing power and two-way communication to those accessories.
Built-in intelligent flash For added clarity and detail when taking pictures in low-light situations, the built-in flash improves pictures and reduces shadows.
Super NightShot infrared system With Sony's NightShot infrared system, capture video in total darkeness (0 lux) up to 10 feet away. Super NightShot mode automatically adjusts the shutter speed to increase picture brightness and clarity. Color Slow Shutter mode allows you to record in low light situations with full color detail by slowing down the shutter speed.
Scene Selection modes Scene Selection modes make recording easy even when filming in challenging situations. Choose from Beach, Candle, Fireworks, Landscape, Portrait, Sports Lesson, Spotlight, and Sunrise & Sunset."

For the first time, record High Definition directly to Memory Stick PRO Duo media card. The HDR-CX7 includes a professional-quality Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* lens and Super SteadyShot optical image stabilization, so you can capture the detail and clarity of high definition. Plus, you can take still images and video at the same time, all with exceptional battery life so you're sure to capture every moment.
HDR-CX7 Highlights
3.2-megapixel ClearVid CMOS sensor The 1/2.9-inch ClearVid CMOS sensor provides stunning detail and clarity with exceptional video (1080 lines of resolution in HD Mode; 530 lines of horizontal resolution in SD Mode) and still image performance (6.1-megapixel). Unlike traditional CCD imagers, CMOS sensors require less power, providing better battery performance.
Switchable HD/SD format recording The HDR-CX7 is capable of recording and playing back both High Definition (HD) and Standard Definition (SD) video recorded on Memory Stick PRO Duo media (sold separately).
x.v.Color Technology x.v.Color technology can capture or display nearly twice as many (1.8x) viewable colors than currently possible. This provides a more accurate and vivid color range, for a more natural, lifelike overall experience.
10x optical/20x digital zoom The optical zoom helps to bring the action close up from far away. In addition, the digital zoom interpolation means that extreme digital zooming is clearer, with less distortion than previous types of digital zoom.
Professional-quality Carl Zeiss Vario- Sonnar T* lens Carl Zeiss lenses have an advanced optical multi-layer coating that offers less glare and flare with increased contrast. This results in vivid image brilliance, true-to-life color saturation and perfect renditions of subtle tones. The additional T* coating on the lens further reduces unwanted glare and flare.
2.7-inch widescreen Hybrid touch-panel Clear Photo LCD Plus display The 2.7-inch 16:9 LCD screen provides excellent viewing clarity with improved resoltuion. The 211K-pixel screen also rotates up to 270 degrees for multiple viewing angles, providing sharp, detailed images for monitoring or playback. The widescreen format makes shooting in 16:9 mode and composing shots even easier.
Smooth slow record By increasing the record rate from 60 fields per second (fps) to 240 fps for 3 seconds allowing you to capture 3 seconds of fast motion and play the video back in 12 seconds. This is great for analyzing a golf swing or a viewing a bird in flight. In addition, record an audio track to narrate what is being seen in the video.
Memory Stick PRO Duo Media slot Capture still images up to 2848 x 2136 resolution, directly onto Memory Stick PRO Duo Media for easy trasfer to PCs for emailing, printing or shairing with other compatible Memory Stick PRO Duo devices.
Dual record While recording video in High Definition you have the ability to capture a 4.6-megapixel still image directly to Memory Stick PRO Duo media.
Super SteadyShot Optical Image Stabilization system An advanced form of Sony's SteadyShot Image Stabilization system that controls an even higher range of shake and vibration frequencies. This optical stabilization system achieves an even higher level of smoothness without degradation of vide like some digital stabilization systems.
Tele Macro function Useful for shooting close up shots, but without having the camcorder casting a shadow on the subject. Images shot in the Tele Macro mode will have the subject properly focused with the background unfocussed so that the subject stands out.
Active Interface Shoe Provides a location directly on the camcorder on which to add optional accessories while providing power and two-way communication to those accessories.
Built-in intelligent flash For added clarity and detail when taking pictures in low-light situations, the built-in flash improves pictures and reduces shadows.
Super NightShot infrared system With Sony's NightShot infrared system, capture video in total darkeness (0 lux) up to 10 feet away. Super NightShot mode automatically adjusts the shutter speed to increase picture brightness and clarity.

It's a gen4 Glock17. It has a polished barrel, pins, extractor, ejector, and slide release.
The frame is shortened to accept g19 mags and has the finger studs removed as well as an undercut triggerguard and is stippled, though the rear section is left the same so that aftermarket beavertail parts can still be added just as easily ( I originally put them on but decided against them).
has wear from being carried daily in a serpa holster (comes with it) along the top left edge of the slide. 
comes with the g19 mag and one g17 mag, case, and serpa holster for $500.
I can add in a g17+2 mag, glock 18 mag, tritium front sight, tungsten guide rod assembly, and hornady custom ammo (jhp. 9mm) for extra.
Gun has been cleaned after every range trip and periodically to remove dirt from carry ( mostly therapeutically tbh).
feels great w/the full slide and g19 mag (feels significantly more balanced to me) and for you cc guys you can have the characteristics of a full g17 slide while not having to worry about the grip making lumps in your clothing.
Located in Springfield and will only do ftf transactions with VA ID and bill of sale.

The only person legally allowed to draft and advise you on is a licensed attorney.  There are fake websites out there that will sell you an improper trust that fails to obey Ohio law.  Only deal with a licensed attorney.  I practice NFA gun law here in Ohio and am duly licensed.

100% Success rate. Guaranteed to be accepted by the ATF or your money back. Period. No questions asked.

What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.

As a Texas lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!

This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.

I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me. I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless.

Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.


What the Trust includes:

- The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages)
- Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms)
- Appointment of Trustee (1 Page)
- Trustee resignation (1 Page)

I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.

Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information***"

Available in two compact models—PT 111 and PT 140—the Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment. Taurus Security System (TSS)sTaurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.    Loaded Chamber IndicatorTaurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.    Accessory RailFeatures the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessoriesModel: 111G2      Finish: Blue      Status: Available      Caliber: 9 mm      UPC: 7-25327-61060-1      Capacity: 12 +1      Weight: 22 oz.      Barrel Length: 3.2""      Frame: Compact      Action: SA/DA      Front Sight: Fixed      Length: 6.24""      Safety: Loaded Chamber Indicator,Manual Safety,Manual Safety,Taurus Security System,Trigger safety      Order #: 1-111031G2-12      MSRP: $434.59      Rear Sight: Adjustable- 2 DotsAll of our firearms are listed in our online store:AJ Guns, use the following link to visit the online store:    www.ajguns.net/oc/index.phpCash, Money orders, MC, Visa and Discover are accepted for payments.   There is a 3% fee on credit card purchases to cover card processing charges.IF REQUIRED:  Shipping USPS Priority Mail $31.00 Firearm must be shipped to a licensed FFL dealer.Local pickup is available by appointment.

I have made many belts and slings for people as a side job and am looking to increase my market. Each sling or belt is made with 100% made in USA materials. I have access to any color you could possibly want and can make things custom fit. I just need the measurement and color you require.  I can make single point slings,  two point slings, and belts. Belts use between 120-180 feet depending on size and slings utilize approximately 80-110 feet depending on size. Two point slings are made using Winchester or Remington sling attachments (your choice). Single point slings utilize steel components. Belts come standard with a plain steel buckle or a blued steel buckle, with the option of a Dickies brand buckle for $10 additional. Belts are slightly more expensive because they use a much more intricate weave and more cord. If you want to see more pictures, just ask as I have more photos available that would not fit on here.

— - does not include buffer and buffer spring


Since this is just the upper-receiver assembly, no background check is required (for now), and this can be shipped to other states without going through an FFL dealer.




caveat (short):  If you plan on shooting Russian steel-case ammo (such as “Wolf” or “Tula”), you probably don’t want to buy this upper receiver assembly.  With the post-panic glut of AR-15 parts available, you’ll have no problem finding another one.



caveat (long):  This is from a Bushmaster XM-15 that I bought in November 2008.  I ended up trading this upper-receiver to a friend of mine, which he put on a Bushmaster lower that I had sold him a few years earlier (back when Colorado was still a free state).  At the same time, we also bought several cases of Wolf .223 62 grain hollow-point ammo.

When shooting the Wolf brand ammo, the empty cases would frequently fail to extract, getting stuck in the chamber.  And I mean stuck, as in he had to insert a brass rod down the barrel from the muzzle and hammer the case out.  The rim of the case would be torn, where the extractor had tried to pull it out.  note:  I’ll include the brass rod (3/16 inch, 4.76 mm, a couple of bucks at Home Depot).

I’ve shot a lot of Wolf ammo over the years.  While I wouldn’t trust my life to it, it was always fine for recreational and training shooting.  But not this batch.  The batch of Wolf ammo we bought seems especially problematic; it even causes my FS2000 and Tavor to seize up in a similar manner.

Another friend of mine who also bought a Bushmaster XM-15 in November 2008 had extraction issues with his rifle (not quite the same problem, but I don’t remember the details).

This upper receiver and barrel assembly hasn’t had problems with regular brass-case ammo.


Anyway, my friend recently got another complete upper receiver assembly (with Magpul hand guards in olive drab, so he ended up changing the stock and pistol grip to match), which is why this is for sale.

Before putting this up for sale, I decided to try and quantify the failure rate (and possibly troubleshoot) so I could let any potential buyers know what to expect.  I took this upper, put it on my AR-15 lower, and shot 60 rounds of Wolf, 20 rounds of Prvi Partizan PPU, and another 20 rounds of Wolf:  100 rounds total.  I had zero failures:  zip, nada, zilch.    I have no idea why it was working with Wolf ammo one day, when shooting Wolf ammo been so problematic over the years.

The universe must be mocking me.




PS —


There are several videos on YouTube of folks who had to get a brass rod and hammer out stuck Wolf cases, so it's not just this receiver/barrel assembly.   For example:

It has parallax adjustments from 5 yards to 200 yards with an infinite parallax setting beyond that. It has red and green illumination with 5 brightness settings on each. It can also be used with no illumination which gives the standard black cross hairs. It is a mil dot reticle. This was given to me for my birthday to use on my Mosin Nagant with scout mount. This is a standard eye relief scope so it will not work for me. It will work for anyone who wants a scope mounted in a conventional manner, I however need about 10"" of eye relief. This scope gets many great reviews online for a budget scope. It has been tested on all calibers between .22 and .416 Rigby. This scope also features resettable zero turrets that are the finger dial type that don't need tools to adjust. It also has a quick focus eye piece. Includes a set of decent set of rings. The large 40mm objective has a great field of view and is extremely clear. MSRP is $100, asking $60 obo. 

About this item
Adventure Class scopes come standard with adjustable objectives, delivering a parallax-free image, without moving the point of impact. This means, if your target moves, your scope can adjust quickly and accurately at any distance. And their dual illuminated reticles offer a bright, sharp image for those fast-moving, close-in shots. Whether you're shooting at dusk or at dawn, in heavy brush or open field, the Adventure Class will deliver a quick, bright image. Includes weaver-style/picatinny mounting rings and flip-open lens caps.

I am asking $650 cash (I put $860 into it). Will trade for an AR15 bull barrel .223/5.56 or 9mm handgun - no compacts.

Feel free to text offers. Open to any deal. No calibers other than .223/5.56 or 9 please. Trades must be of similar value whether new or used."

12 gauge Model 930BW Blackwater Tactical 3 inch 18 1/2 in 8 Shot Ghost Ring Fiber Optic Front 

Sight Pistol Grip Stock Exc Factory Box 
Item Description 
This listing is for the exact shotgun in the photos. Dealers, collectors, and departments, 

however, may take any very similar extras of this variant we might have on hand, at the same 

per-gun price and with no additional shipping charges. The quality and dependability of 

Mossberg’s 935 series shotguns for the past 25 years led to the introduction of the 930, for both 

sporting and tactical purposes. Here is one of Mossberg’s best, the 930BW Blackwater variant. 

Manufacturer is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Construction on this 930 is steel barrel, 

bolt, and parts, built into a light weight alloy receiver with matching alloy trigger housing. 

Type is dual system self regulating gas operated semi-automatic, made to specs for the zealous 

Carolina security contractor whose name it bears. Chambering is for 12 gauge shells, 2 3/4 inch 

and 3 inch magnums interchangeably. Capacity with extended Choate factory installed tube is 7 + 1 

on 2 3/4 inch; 6 + 1 on 3 inch. We have added an extension tube clamp, since the 930 lug does not 

have a detent ball. Operators should keep the clamp tight. Barrel is 18 1/2 inch Cylinder Bore, 

.725 muzzle diameter. Since the 930 is not back bored, it will handle rifled slugs and sabots 

just fine. Sight system is factory issue, low profile XS brand windage and elevation adjustable, 

removable aperture or Ghost Ring rear sight integral to its 10 slot Picatinny Rail. Receiver on 

the 930 is contoured like the Model 500 and 835 shotguns, for a Weaver #88 or 417 four screw 

base. Front sight is raised, white bar blade type. Operating handle is oversize knurled steel. 

Safety is classic Mossberg top tang style; and the .250 smooth face blue steel trigger pulls at 5 

pound vicinity with minimal felt creep. Length of pull is 14 inches from the trigger face to the 

end of the 1 inch black factory recoil pad. Weight empty is 7 1/2 pounds, with center of gravity 

at the operating handle. Pistol grip stock and forend are black graphite based synthetic, with 

lateral checkered surfaces. Buttstock tapers to a 2 1/2 inch drop at the heel, with a 3/4 inch 

right hand cant. It has a removable spacer, visible in the photos, next to the buttstock that 

will bring the length of pull down 7/8 of an inch. Buttstock has a blue steel sling swivel stud. 

Metal finish is matte blue to its steel, with matching black matte anodized receiver, and black 

trigger group, stock, and forend. This 930 served with Mossberg’s sales demonstrator. Surface 

detractions on this specimen are minimal, only faint occasional surface streaking or edge 

whitening. We rate it as Excellent, 90 to 95 percent vicinity by our estimate, but its photos 

ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bore, choke 

threads, and mechanism are all bright and clean. From examination of the shell carrier, we do not 

believe this shotgun was loaded more than 10 or 15 times; if it was ever fired, no more than 

that. It comes in a factory box with cable lock and instruction manual that bears Mossberg’s 

Statement of Warranty. Replacement pricing on this shotgun in our area is $800 or more. We’re 

offering the Mossberg 930 Blackwater in the photos, however, for only $ 717.00. Not transferable 

to civilian residents of New York City, or any jurisdiction where semi automatic shotguns with 7 

shot magazines are restricted to law enforcement only.

754,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4029754,For Sale:  1987 Sea Ray Pachanga 19,"NE Bend, Bend, Oregon","$ 1,695","Listed On: Friday, February 13, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"1987 Sea Ray Pachanga 19. This particular Sea Ray was built in 1987 and comes with a matching 1987 Calkins roller trailer. The boat has a 19'2"" centerline length and has a very comfortable 94"" beam (width). The Pachanga series was built by Sea Ray to compete with the Fountain and Formula cigarette boats of the 80's and has developed quite a cult following over the years. It has a deep vee hull with lots of freeboard and a large built in swim platform, as well as a very large space under the bow that is fully carpeted and has a headliner, and is actually large enough for me to take a nap under comfortably.

The boat has a Mercruiser Alpha One outdrive with power trim and tilt, and new bellows and water pump were installed by the previous owner the year before I bought it, as well as new fuel line and fuel fill and vent lines and upper seal kit on the outdrive.

I bought the boat at the beginning of last summer and have installed new OEM switches and circuit breakers, new gas lifts for the engine cover, new outdrive trim and tilt sensors and replaced a bad trim tab solenoid.

Features:

4.3L Vortec engine with roller rockers and lifters (engine is an '06-'08 engine and is not original to the boat)
2bbl carb
47 gallon aluminum fuel tank
Halon automatic fire suppression system
blower
full instrumentation (all gauges and switches work)
compass
trim tabs
through the transom exhaust
built in swim platform and swim ladder
new spark plugs
new tags good through the end of 2016
trailer has newer tires that are in great shape with bearing buddies and LED tail lights

The front two pedestal seats do need to be upholstered, and the boat could certainly benefit from a good waxing. The pictures make it look like the gelcoat has worn through, but that is just a reflection, the paint and gelcoat are good shape. Has a cassette stereo that should be swapped out and speakers installed.

I used it last summer, but with a new baby and a ""fixer"" house I just don't have time to go to the lake for the forseeable future. I drained and winterized the engine, exhaust manifolds and outdrive and filled with RV antifreeze, and it has been covered in the barn since the fall. With the huge 47 gallon fuel tank it can run all day and the V-6 is economical on fuel. I cruise 30MPH at 3000 RPM. With the long bow and deep vee hull it cuts right through the chop and wake board boat wakes. Neat, rare boat. Asking $1695 OBO."

It utilizes a long-stroke piston system modeled after the ultra-reliable AK-47.
This thing RUNS.  Have fired somewhere between 600-700 rounds.  Not a single malfunction of any kind, not once.  I've fed it everything from quality brass to cheap steel cased Russian stuff like silver bear.  it Eats Anything you feed it.  It also runs extremely clean, significantly cleaner than DI guns.  This is of course due to the design, gases are not kept in contact with the BCG, rather they are pushed into the piston tube. Upper breaks down exactly how a DI upper would, except there is a piston rod attached to the BCG.  It is the simplest and most reliable piston AR design out there.  All the other piston ARs (I've tried most of them..LWRC Barrett POF LMT Sig etc) operate using short-stroke piston designs which utilize more proprietary parts and result in more metal on metal action, and IMO are more problematic (at least potentially, someday down the road). The other thing I should mention on the topic of other piston guns, is that all the other piston ARs I've tried (while nice) are no where near as light or as well-balanced as the PWS.  Most the other piston ARs are front heavy and/or bulky.  The PWS is as light as a DI and AS well-balanced as a DI.  Weighs in under 7lbs.

 Do your research and you'll find not a single bad review on PWS.  It is not quite as well known a company as say LWRC, but I believe it is due to marketing, not the quality of builds, b/c PWS has an extremely loyal fan base.  I for one am not interested in buying any other rifles outside of the PWS brand.  Only selling b/c I'm tight on cash, otherwise I'd keep it.  If I didn't have another PWS sitting at home I wouldn't even be selling it regardless of cash needs.  You will not be disappointed by this upper I can assure you that.

Asking $1000 OBO

Would sell the entire rifle (complete upper with complete lower) for $1500 OBO,
but would prefer to keep the lower as it has the best buffer tube system on the market.
If you live out of state let me know and I may consider shipping FFLs.

Make an offer.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin."

This is the model with the double action trigger. Its got the ghost ring sights, the 8+1 mag, the bayo lug, a butt stock shell holder, a sling and a tac-star sidesaddle shell holder. A few cosmetic flaws listed here: stock and fore end used to be painted tan, which I removed, but furniture still has a ""dirty"" look to it. Part of the magazine cap has been dremeled off to mount a stryder ZT9 bayonet; the cap still does its job, just with a shiny, flat patch that I ground away. And finally, the butt pad (a brand name one, recoil reducer or something like that) got soaked in simple green during the paint removal process became gummy and sticky. Thusly, I have it wrapped in electricians tape. Anyways, all the flaws are visible in the photos. Take it or leave it, its a great functioning shotgun that looks bad bubblegum and has some great features. Asking $400, OBO for it. Round count is unknown, since I got it from gun broker a few years ago, but I myself only ran about 50 shells through it.
