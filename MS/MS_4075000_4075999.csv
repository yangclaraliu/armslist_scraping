""In 1987, Benelli introduced its first Super 90, the M1. It quickly became a favorite among European practical shotgun competitors, but hunters who wanted a more traditional looking shotgun had to wait for the Montefeltro version to come out the following year.

Appealing features of the Montefeltro include a series of stock shims for adjusting the drop at heel by almost 1/2"". Adding the shims is simply a matter of unscrewing one of the buttplate screws so the buttplate can be turned, exposing the stock through bolt. Loosen the 13 mm stock bolt retaining nut, then pull the stock off the recoil spring tube. Install the desired shim, and reassemble the buttstock.

The recoil-operated action has a rotary locking system that fires 3"" and shorter shells interchangeably. Lockup is by two lugs on the bolt rotating into a steel barrel extension. Since the bolt locks directly to the barrel, the Montefeltro can use a lightweight, aluminum receiver. A slender fore-end is achieved through a lack of gas system parts around the magazine tube. No gas system means no rubber O-rings, which reduces the chance of malfunctions attributable to fouling and helps keep overall weight of the gun low."""

""With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

A quick look on Armslist shows retards asking $.75 to $1 a round! I hope no one is stupid enough to pay that!

Honestly you should not be paying me $.58 as the CBC 77gr OTM is much better ammo, But hey who I am to tell you what to buy. If you have green tip fever (disclaimer these do not have green tips, however they are M855 Nato which are the same rounds that are painted green in the states) You can have these and I'll shoot the good stuff!"

(price includes conversion)The Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect.This is a dealer sale, price is non-negotiable.

380,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4075380,"For Trade:  6"" Colt Anaconda Custom - Bright Stainless and Ported. Trade for 1911 or ?","South, Salem, Oregon",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, February 26, 2015",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,44 Magnum                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"I was looking at my gun collection today and realized that I never take my anaconda out to shoot. It's really my safe queen, and I kind of vowed to never have a safe queen. I really am a 1911 man who got sidetracked by the snake guns. I have had it for about five years, and shot way less than 500 rounds through it - a stupid use of such a ridiculously sexy gun.

For the 1911 I'm looking for, it needs to be at the very minimum colt quality or higher, such as Wilson combat or less better, and stainless. Again, for the right piece I would be willing to add trade or cash. I'm not against a lower value trade with multiple firearms, but at least one of the trade needs to be a quality 1911 and stainless. I am also interested in higher quality factory AR 15's, bolt action .308's and nice optics. Please do not be offended if I am not interested in your offer, I am very particular about this gun and will not trade it for anything less than exactly what I'm looking for.

As far as the anaconda, it has been shot but is an overall good condition. Really, once you shoot the Colt revolvers you will understand the premium prices attached. With the custom shop porting, it is easily one of the nicest 44 caliber pistols I've shot (Certainly nicer than the scandium framed smith I had).

I have the original pachymer grips, as well as the wood presentation grips on currently. The wood grips dont fit as well as I would like, and have been shimmed. I eventually meant to fit them to the gun better, but have not gotten around to it. Rhonda, as my wife and kid have named her, does not have a box or documentation. 

I value this around $2500; the lower end of what the sold prices on Gunbroker. Attached are the photos that I had on my phone, I will get better pics as soon as I'm able. The pistol is currently in the room where my wife is sleeping, and as many of you may realize, there are a few things in my life that would make it worth it to wake her up, much less pictures of a gun.

The value of these colt snake guns just keeps increasing, I am sure that I am making a financial mistake but can't justify having a gun I don't shoot. I also realized I want a stainless 1911, preferably a Colt gold cup or other higher end 1911. All of my other pistols are in 45 and I never reload the 44, and find the prohibitive costs of 44 rounds makes me all the less inclined to take it out.

This is NOT a WASR or a century put together. This is a like new (maybe 100 rounds fired thru it) Zastava Arms OPAP 7.62x39 AK. The OPAP's are much harder to find and much more desirable than the commonly found NPAP variant. This gun still appears as new finish wise. It does have Yugoslav military furniture. The handguards are M70, the buttstock is from an M76 sniper. The straight comb of the M76 stock eliminates the so called ""cheak slap"" that is common on the M70 and NPAP variants and positions your head properly on the sights. Not only that, it looks nicer (IMO). This rifle comes with one Yugo bolt hold open 30 round mag (I have many others listed seperately). It also comes with a cleaning rod, original Yugo sling, and 2 muzzle brakes - borth a slant brake and a birdcage brake (both Tapco). This gun is 922r compliant, as it was made for Century at the Zastava arsenal in Yugoslavia (with the exception of the M76 stock which was added). It is matching - except for the M76 buttstock of course.

Metroarms is a small company and different from Armscor/Rock Island, the owner Hector Rodriguez, a former competitive shooter and also STI engineer surely knows how to build an exceptional 1911.  This is a great concealed carry officer's size 1911 that is packed with features you can find from the likes of Kimber but at a fraction of its cost. The extended beavertail grip safety, throated and polished 3.5 bull barrel ( that's easy to field strip), flared ejection ports, combat hammer with the unique Metroarms logo and a hardwood grips and you have an excellent 1911 carry that you can't find in other brands. I've fired only 100 rounds through it since I got it 2 months ago, 50 rounds through my CHL class and another 50 rounds , all without jams, FTE, FTF. I've paid close to 550 with this pistol with FFL fees. I'm throwing for free a Desantis horsehide leather IWB holster and 2 extra Mec-gar officer's 6rounds mags to go with the factory 7 rounds ACT mag, a $75 value. I'll consider a trade only with a full size 1911 in 9mm caliber only such as the Rock Island Tactical II ( with VZ grips and FO sights) or a more expensive 1911 in 9mm and I'll add cash.
