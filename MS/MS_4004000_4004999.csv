     I'm a master machinist, and I'm offering up a made-to-order custom threaded barrel + thread protector for a Beretta 92 series pistol!  

     I have a BRAND NEW IN BOX Beretta 92FS ""Black"" 4.9"" barrel.  Since I'm doing the machining, and it's a virgin barrel, I can do a multitude of options for you:

Threading Options:
~1/2-28UN Class 3 (Right OR Left Handed)
~M13X1.0 ""Metric"" Class 4g6g (Right OR Left Handed)
Notes: 
*1/2-28UN Right Hand is most popular for add-on accessories.
*Threads are machined with a single point tool on a lathe - NOT a tap & die.
*Radial and axial runout to bore will be less than .002"" COMBINED - 4x more accurate than tolerance specs on mass production threaded barrels. 

Protector Material: 
304 Stainless (*Recommended) OR 6061-T6 Aluminum

Protector Style: Smooth, Radially Grooved, Knurled, or Knurled and Grooved

Protector Bore Crown: Flat, Chamfered, or Radius

Protector Finish: Glass Bead Blast, Satin or High Polish. *Knurled is as-machined

For Reference: The one in the pictures is my actual gun.  It has 1/2-28 LEFT HAND threads, and a knurled/grooved cap with a radius crown. 

*Notes:  
1.  If you like, I can use a ""bluing"" pen on the barrel, but other than that, rust prevention is your responsibility after you receive the item.
2.  Since I will be doing custom work on the item; turnaround time will be 1-2 weeks AFTER I receive your payment.
3.  Donor barrel is AUTHENTIC Beretta barrel for a 92FS (4.9"").  It's your responsibility to make sure it will fit your model gun.
4.  Price INCLUDES shipping to the lower 48.
5.  **Price DOES NOT include the rest of the gun!!

I know my price is higher than you can buy a mass-produced threaded barrel, so don't bother emailing to tell me...quality and custom work costs money.  If you don't agree, then please feel free to settle for one of the others.

Thanks for viewing my ad!"

WARNING!!!!! 
They say they will price match but they will only price down to their ""so called cost"" which was still $100 more than 2 other local shops. WHAT A JOKE AND FALSE advertisement. 

I advise everyone to give their money and business to honest businesses in the area that actually honor what they say. When I asked to talk to store manager they tell me ""They are gone and will not be back for a day or two"", interesting. It was 12:30 in the afternoon.

When talking to them about price matching they make you feel like you were stealing from them and then it had to match exactly and the guy at the counter was trying to talk me out of even checking. When it had an exact match with PSA he said they would not match that price cause it was too low???? What is price match mean then? 

ANYWAY
I will not set foot back into Gander Mountain. Their prices are extremely high and now that they will not price match so long."

It is a very interesting rifle. I bought one personally and am totally in love with it. It has the thunk of an AK but the smoothness and accuracy of the AR. Possibly the perfect blend? Cheaper to shoot than an AR-15 or AR-10 and something different for sure.
Regular AR stocks, pistol grips and triggers will work on this rifle, making it very customize-able without getting out the hammer and grinder.
Takes regular AK mags. Comes with a MagPul mag. Steel cased ammo runs just fine in it. Only 7 lbs empty!!

Well, here is an economical solution that works well and is extremely simple. 

Introducing the ""variable report"" steel gong target.  This target is a 20"" cone plate with a reinforced 6"" bulls eye center. The result is 2 distinct sound effects when hit. 

The 20"" outer cone target is 7mm thick, extra hard spring/blade steel, (AR 300-400). This thinner convex style, hardened metal blade steel, rings much louder when hit than a piece of 1/2"" AR500, and makes a very distinct ""TINK"" sound.  And the results to the target are the same, no damage. 

The 6"" reinforced center bullseye is made from a piece of 1"" thick hardened steel.  When hit, the bulls eye makes a very distinctive ""THUD or KNOCK"" sound.  The result is 2 different sounds, making it easier to distinguish a center hit versus an outside hit. 

This setup really shines out past 400-500 yds, and is very impressive at 1000 yds. At these ranges, 1/2 "" AR500 is mostly an overkill for most anything smaller than 50 BMG. Not to mention it can be a lot harder to distinguish a center mass hit, or even hear a hit out at 800+ yds with smooth AR500. The cone design of this plate works much like a bell, plus the added benefit of deflecting copper and lead more rearward, instead of sideways or even back forward like you can get with a smooth plate.

But it doesn't stop there. This Super Gong comes with its own stand which is integrated all as one unit that folds up neatly for transport or storage. Setup and takedown takes literally 10 seconds or less and requires no tools or hardware.  The stand is basically a tripod design and is extremely stable and sturdy. Plus you can adjust the height from ground level to 5' without any tools or extra cut pieces. 

Key benefits of the stand:
-Made of wood 2x4x8's. These will absorb a lot of hits before they have to be replaced, plus they are much lighter than steel. Replacing them only requires a trip to the local lumberyard and a 1/2"" drill bit. No specially cut flimsy pieces here!
-Tripod design is far more stable than a stand with cross members. Height adjustment is as simple as changing the pitch of the legs. Adjust target from ground level to 5' in order to compensate for terrain or brush.
-Target is mounted to stand using dense conveyor belting. This is far superior to chain or wire. Bullets only make tiny holes thru belting, you don't run the risk of breaking a chain with a bullet. Another added benefit from belting is the target will sway a lot less and returns to center quickly. None of the swinging effect you get from chain.

The approx. weight of steel target and stand is 45#.  If weight or handling is an issue, simply remove steel target from stand using two 3/4"" wrenches.

Up for sale is an original Steyr Aug A1. This model comes with the upgraded receiver (flat top versus the integrated scope) and the polymer body has been modified to accept both the semi auto and full auto sear packs. This is not a machine gun and the auto sear pack is no longer available.

From my experience, the Steyr Aug is by far the most ergonomic and modular bullpup battle rifle to date. After owning and/or handling several others, such as the FNH Fs200, FNH Ps90, and the IWI Tavor. If you lookup reviews on these rifles, they are nothing but quality. The A1 is highly compared to the new A3s, and have been noted for having higher quality parts (specifically the barrel) compared to its successor.

With the rifle, you will also get a good amount of magazines (both 30 and 42 round) as well as several sear pack shells and Steyr Aug replacement parts to ensure you have your rifle running for a lifetime.

I will ship this rifle to your FFL if you are out of the area.

The .40 caliber introduced at the 1990 S.H.O.T. Show closes the gap between the heavy .45 rounds and the internationally proven 9 x 19mm service calibers. GLOCK was the first manufacturer to make the advantages of this balanced caliber accessible to law enforcement agencies in a perfect pistol. Today, countless police units in the United States and throughout the world put their trust in the 15-round GLOCK 22.

Bought in December as a Christmas gift for my wife and she struggled with the racking the slide so I had Wild West Guns smooth out the slide, mag release, and do a trigger job for $160.00.  She still had difficulty racking the slide so I bought her a Sig P938 and selling this fine gun at a loss.  Let me be clear no one else has had any issue with racking this slide.  If you know anything about EMPs, they really difficult to find due to demand and this one is better than most thanks to Wild West Guns. This EMP is really smooth, fine tuned, and no breaking in required!  Valid NV ID and signing a Bill of Sale required.

There is no VP9 LE models on Armslist in Hampton Roads.  I paid $719 in October, but I need to sell it soon.  

     $585 for the handgun.  I will also add:

Carrier does not have molle. This is not a military carrier. Hunt on public lands? A little more protection never hurts. This vest includes armor panels. The cover on the back soft armor panel has been worn thru to the inside ( from riding in a vehicle??) but I saw no damage to the Kevlar. I have covered it with ""Gorilla tape"". Panels are 2000 and 2001. Size medium... chest 37"" to 41"". Sorry but no sales to Connecticut. No overseas sales! USA only! Lower 48 states only! E mail me for other form of payment.
