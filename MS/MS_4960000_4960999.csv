My father is in stage 4 cancer and has now lost his life insurance. To help out my step mother I am now forced to sell some of his guns for him. This pistol was produced in late 1945 and is one of the very last ones. If you know the history of these then you know that the RR are considered the very best of all 1911 A1s produced with the quality second to none. A quick Google search will tell you all you need to know about this. 
All markings are there and are correct. Several decades ago the slide stop was polished as this seemed to be a bit of a fad back then. The pistol retains much of the original finish but has been taken down at some point in time to where you can actually see the milling marks on the slide. Collectors may or may not like this but this is still a very valuable and highly sought after pistol. The weapon functions and performs as it should. I have the two era correct mags that came with this when it was purchased used about 40 years ago. One is stamped with the letter G on the floor plate as well as the number 23. The second one is not stamped anywhere that I can see. The pistol is marked with a number 10 in yellow paint on the bottom of the frame. All other markings are correct and can be seen although I have to use a magnifying glass and light as I have had a series of small strokes and can no longer see this tiny stuff. I did take it to a respected gun smith for verification of all the markings. You are certainly welcome to inspect this for yourself. The grips are obviously the rubber finger grove type by Hogue but my father does have the original ones somewhere. I do not know how long it will take my to find them so the pistol will be sold as is for now. If I find the originals I am willing to mail them to the buyer. 
Now, the important part. Price. We all know the approximate values of theses somewhat rare pistols. I am going to leave this open for now and look at realistic offers. My father does not have much time and is looking for cash for all of his firearms to help my step mother with the massive medical bills that are already nearing 200k. That being said, I have been buying and selling guns for about 35 years and am willing to look at trades for guns that I can sell and then give the money to my step mother. Expensive guns are fairly hard to sell here at the coast where I live so multiple guns in trade would actually work out better for us at this point. 
As for a price, I will say that I have taken this pistol to a couple of different shops, we only have two here, and the lowball offer from one of them was 1000 dollars which is not going to happen. The gun will stay with me and go to one of my kids when the time comes before I will sell it for 1000 dollars. That being said, please feel free to toss out some offers of cash, trade or some of each. I live in Toledo and my father lives over in Brownsville. I am willing to travel between here and there for a deal but lets be realistic here. I am not going to run all over hell and back for a bunch of tire kickers who want this for nothing. Please excuse me if this sounds rude but I have been down that road before and simply do not have time for games under the circumstances that I mentioned about my fathers timeline. Our family is hoping and praying for more time but the cancer is now in his femurs and hips as well as his prostate, colon, lower intestine and skin so every day is a crap shoot. He has gone from walking 5 miles a day to a walker and now to a wheelchair in less than one month due to the cancer now being labeled as super aggressive. Please excuse the sob story but I want to explain the urgency to sell these guns. If I had time I would simply place it for sale on Gunbrokers.
Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

This rifle was a standard SOCOM 16 and since then I have added many different add ons that I think you will be pleased with. The rifle itself is in great shape, having less than 300 rounds through it. I will list the costs of the parts below to give you an idea of how much money you'll be saving. But overall, the parts cost around $2200. I will take 1800 and that is a FIRM price. That's not including shipping, time at gunsmith, etc.  I would like to keep the scope, but everything else goes with the gun. I will also ship to anywhere provided you pay for transfer and shipping fees to your FFL.

One tool, any job.The Sphinx SDP Compact Krypton is a duty-sized pistol for the most discerning of shooters. The SDP Compact Krypton features a full anodized aluminum lower frame, which gives it unparalleled balance, and can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Krypton is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The aluminum pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allows the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allows for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Krypton. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.Technical Specifications Caliber9x19 mm / 9x21 mmOverall Length7.4 Inches / 188 mmOverall Height5.4 Inches / 136 mmOverall Width1.4 Inches / 35 mmWeight29.06 Ounces / 824 GramsBarrel Length3.7 Inches / 95 mmSight Radius5.7 Inches / 145 mm SightsFront: Iron Blade with White DotRear: Serrated U Shape SightActionDouble Action / Single ActionAmbidextrous decocking leverTrigger Pull WeightSingle Action: 4.0+lb / 1.8+kgDouble Action: 10.0+lb / 4.5+kgSlide MaterialSteelSlide FinishBlack with TIAIN coatingFrame MaterialUpper: Hard Anodized AluminumLower: Hard Anodized AluminumGripFinger MoldsInterchangeable Inserts: Polymer base with RubberSize: Small, Medium, LargeMagazine CatchLeft / Right - ReversibleMagazine Capacity17 Rounds"

I replaced these with the impregnated wood butt stock, a Mojo peep sight, and a top cover from Ohio Ordnance. The top cover needed to be replaced because the guide rod bent on the old one during a field strip, which I'll also be including. Not entirely sure how that happened, but it's been replaced by a better looking one. I've fired it since and it works perfectly.

The scope is a cheap pos but is also brand new as is the action lock. This rifle has had exactly 5 rounds through it. I fired them myself. The only thin I added is the new sling which came from Walmart for 15 dollars. This rifle is absolutely flawless other than a scratch on the bottom of the hand guard just in front of the receive due to a gun avalanche while getting another rifle out of the safe.

I live in Toledo and my father lives over in Brownsville. I am willing to meet anywhere in between as I am driving back and forth almost every day now. I have sold several of my own weapons just to keep buying gas for my truck but am not going to stop driving back and forth until the end. My dad wants 450 for this beautiful rifle. I am willing to drop that down to 400 for cash and then toss in the other 50 when I take the money to my step mother. I will not tell my father about this. You can reach me via email, phone or text.

It also has the wrench for installing/removing chokes and some sort of green plug thingy, I think it's for reducing magazine capacity, not sure.  The easy loader modification makes loading/releasing the bolt much easier.  I also have about 8 or 9 spare gas rings.

I don't know the round count but I bought it used from someone who used it as a backup to their primary 3 gun shotgun, and I doubt I've put more than 2-300 shells through it myself.

The CZ 75 XCR is a combination of the PCR Lower and the Rami upper with a whole lot of aftermarket parts mixed it. It is Intended to be a hi capacity but easy to conceal weapon weighting in at 23ozs. Gun has around 500 rounds through it after being fitted to insure that it runs like a clock.

Here's some pictures and upgrades below:

CGW firing pin
CGW reduced firing pin block spring.
CGW thin black grips
CGW free floating hammer pins
CGW free floating trigger pin.
CGW 13lb hammer spring
CGW reduced firing pin spring.
CGW hybrid Disco
Trigger job/polished internals
2 cz modded mags
Custom hammer installed
PCR trigger drilled and tapped with a 85c screw installed for pre travel adjustment.
Dawson precision FO front sight.
Barrel and chamber polished
Barrel throated
Comes with 1.5in of FO rod in Red,Green,Blue,Yellow, and Orange

So other things that make this gun unique is that is holds 15rd with the modded 14rd cz mags and the one of a kind hammer machined by CGW. The hammer is a CZ Czechmate SAO hammer that David machined to be DA/SA and work with the decocker. The reason this gun wasn't drilled for a post travel screw is there is no need for it with this trigger as it stop on the frame right after the trigger break. The barrel has been polished along with the chamber to improve lockup and feeding. The throat in the barrel has been extended to accept any factory OAL. The pre travel screw, hybird disco and PCR hammer makes for the shortest DA reach possible.

Figured someone might want to give themselves a Christmas gift so I better get this up here.

Price is $1250

The 6 cylinder chamber and bore are excellent and shows no signs of pitting or rusting. The frame is stainless and the pistol grips are wood from factory but I have a pair of houge grips that will go with it as well. As you can see in the photos there is very little visible signs of handling markings and no visible signs of pitting or rusting on the barrel and frame. This revolver has box and paperwork. This revolver was manufactured in 1985 per Ruger. Also has a 100.00 factory leather holster just made for that pistol.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy."

I Purchased this rifle for $300, specifically to build a scout rifle out of. It is chambered in 7.5x55 Swiss, and the ammo is readily available online, and isn't too expensive. Soft nose hunting rounds are also available. I started this build with a scope mount i found online, that replaces the rear sight. I matched that with a $300 Nikon Force XR long-eye relief scope with BDC. I had a gunsmith cut the barrel at 16 5/8"", and threaded 5/8x24 and put a Troy Claymore muzzle break on the barrel. After that came the Boyd's Gun Stocks monte carlo stock in Pepper. It took me awhile to get the gun to fit properly, but it fits like a charm and feels wonderful. I finished the stock with a rub on polyurethane finish, about 9 coats worth. It shines like a new penny and feels great. Gun shoots great, i was getting about 1"" groups at 100 yards off of a good rest, and I've never considered myself that great of a shot. Gun is a 1958 model, and numbers match. I have the name and address of the Swiss citizen it was issued to, on a card I found under the butt plate. Gun will come with 60 Rounds of Swiss FMJ ammo. Thanks for looking, no Trades. $600 is the price."

It's in excellent condition with dark, deep grooves in the rifling, no cracks or serious blemishes in the stock other than some dents and dings, and matching serials on the bolt, hex receiver, and baseplate.  Bolt is smooth and easy to work.
Marks on the barrel are a Soviet Union Red Army emblem, two circle K marks suggesting it's been sighted twice, three circle tombstone marks suggesting it's been black powder tested, and a small Cyrillic marking on the barrel shank I have no idea about because I don't read Cyrillic moon speak scribbles.
Sights are standard WW2 Soviet Mosin Nagant hooded front sights with 2000 meter rear adjustable sights.
Bluing of the metal is almost perfect.
Includes WW2 era Red Army dog-collared sling and bayonet.  The bayonet is old, but the serial number and all markings have faded and the exact origin is unknown.  Probably Russian.  Attaches and detaches without problem and is quite sharp and doubles as a disassembly tool.
Tested on the range and works excellently and without issue.  Overall an excellent gun in a country where Mosins in great condition are becoming rare and expensive
I will include all my 7.62mmx54r ammunition with it.  It's a mix of Soviet surplus and Monarch (Academy sport's brand).  Roughly 100 rounds.  I need to recount.  If less I'll buy more.
Contact me for pictures of everything.  Will include timestamp if desired.  I'm an individual with a thing for antique guns, not a shop, and am open to negotiation."

I bought it to conceal but id like to get something a little smaller and with christmas right around the corner, I could use the cash. Im asking $400 for the gun,case,paper work, different handle sizes, lock, (4) 50 round boxes of ammo and (1) box of home defense. I think 400 is a hell off a deal. Thanks for looking.

It allows to use ar-15 compatible parts on your .22. These are very rare as they are discontinued and are a hard find. This is a drop in system meaning all you have to do is drop in your 10/22 receiver and barrel and your good to go. It's a free float barrel system making sure it's as accurate as possible. Also has side, bottom, and Top picatinny rail segments. Also included is the CAA butt stock and buffer tube and palm swell grip. This chassis is very accurate and machined with superb quality. Have had it for a while and decided to go a different route with my .22. You can use standard or bull barrels with this system. Would be willing to trade for Vortex Sparc 2, 5.56 ammo, .22lr ammo, 9mm ammo, .22 pistol or any other guns or gun related items.

m38 and m44- both in good contain love to bring to the range and set off some car alarms and fire balls lol new wood stock for the m44 and for the m38 it has been drilled near the muzzle but that normal for m38's (m38-500 m44-350)
