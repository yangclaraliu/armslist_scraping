The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with rosewood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The Sig Sauer P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine and a holster. If you are a Texan and love Sig pistols, this one is for you.

Scope is functionally and aesthetically paired with rifle. The Leupold scope has never let me down and the rifle easily has reached to the 200 yards it is sighted in for.
The rifle has been sitting clean in the safe, but this is no longer in use as my primary deer rifle. It has been generously cared for.
