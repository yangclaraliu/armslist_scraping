It has been to the range a few times, has maybe 100 rounds through it. It's always been clean and either in a safe or at the range on a bipod. I never took this one out hunting, although that's what I got it for. Just never made it out. 
As for accuracy, I was very surprised. I'm only using a 1-4x scope on it and I was able to get some 1/4"" 5 shot groups at 100 meters! This little rifle is way more accurate than I thought it would be. 

I've done a couple of upgrades to it as well. 
-removed scout rail and installed a full length rail from XS Sight Systems which still has a tiny adjustable iron sight in the back
-I also removed the stock flash hider and went with a PWS FSC30 muzzle brake/hider. It did wonders for stability with this short barrel
-I put a multicam stock pack on too-- it holds 10 rounds inside
- It will come with 2 mags also - 1 steel and 1 ruger polymer (both 10 round)
- I will include the bipod also. It's a VersaPod Sniper pod with universal adapter

Ive lowered my price now to $900- for everything listed above
----Optic is Not included----

~>~>~>~>UPDATE~
Due to quite a few questions regarding the scope,
I will include the scope and rings for a little bit more $$$

It's a Millett DMS-1, 1-4x with dot/donut illuminated reticle- dot is 1moa
Rings are Warne tactical QR 30mm

I will do everything for $1100- and everything is in perfect condition



This sale will also include the original rail and rear iron sight and I think it had some stock spacers too. I bought it new, but I got rid of the box. I think I still have the manual and maybe the little ruger lock too. 

I can meet you within the Greenville area and would be happy to answer any questions you may have"

First the good: I was going to the range recently any way so I took this along to make sure it functioned okay. I shot 6 cylinders through it, and it seems to shoot great, very pleasant to shoot, and when I paid attention it seemed to be very consistent with its shot groupings.

Now the bad: These grips are not original to this gun. They do look quite natural on it though, and show a matching level of wear. The finish has several issues with it, hopefully depicted. Mechanically, if you pull the hammer back, pull the trigger, and leave the trigger depressed, the cylinder is locked up tight. But for some reason when it is in its state of rest, you can sometimes get the cylinder to spin counter-clockwise with a little pressure. I recommend to have this gun checked out by a gunsmith. I have only noticed this happening with counter clockwise pressure, not with clockwise pressure. Underneath the left stock (hidden from view, someone has scratched CBA0193).

Yep!,"Holly Springs, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina","$ 5,000","Listed On: Friday, April 17, 2015",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This marvel was literally assembled last week in CA. The Zeus 336x256 60 Hz 75mm 5-20x performs as it should at this pricetag! Removed and tested only. Never mounted to a rifle other than for pictures - email for more. NO buyers remorse here, love it and will keep it, but it might be a little too powerful magnification-wise for me to be 100% happy with it. Selling for $5,000 cash local. Has the optional external battery pack, batteries and charger which will save you some $$$. Will accept bank check, or wire - but expect a 5-7 day delay for shipment. Shipping/Insurance would be 100% responsibility of buyer. This unit is NOT for sale outside of the USA and you would need to fill out, sign and return an ITAR compliance form. Would be open to trading for a lower magnification ATN ThOR or Zeus ONLY. Pic was shot up my street - house/cars @ 230 yards at dusk. Thanks for looking.

Marlin Model 36 - Lever action .30-30 from 1946. Good shape, bluing touched up but no rust or pitting. Bore is good, little bit of frosting in the last 1"" or so. Folding rear sight, but never drilled & tapped for a scope mount. I think it had a peep sight at one time due to the extra two screws in the tang. Full length mag tube.
$400

Marlin Model 336RC - Lever action .30-30 from 1948. Refined version of the Model 36, still in production today. Bluing is thin, but no rust or pitting I can see. Bore is shiny. No goofy stuff here, just a nice old rifle.
$450

Mauser Model 1910 .25acp pistol. WWII bringback, probably nickel/chrome plated at that time as a trophy. Made in the 1920's, likely someone's personal gun rather than issued. Numbers matching, comes with one magazine
$250

FN Browning 1910/22 .32acp pistol. Another vet bringback that was chrome/nickel plated. Unfortunately, this one was originally Nazi marked, but those markings were pretty much obliterated when it was plated. Original grips with the wrong screw and a home made slide extension button, but the numbers all match.
$275

FN Browning 1910/71 .380 acp. Take the above pistol, change the barrel, shorten the grip, and out on target grips and sights to beat the change in import rules. Good shooter, but the finish is well worn and the barrel shows wear.

(4/18 & 4/19)

I have a CNC Warrior VZ58 rifle for sale.  This rifle comes with a LOT of extras!  I’ve had it since 2013 and have put a lot of money and time into it.  Unfortunately I need to move onto other projects and I never shoot it.  Selling it would help me do just that.

I changed out the composite wood stock, grip and fore grip with polymer ones so I could fit optics, etc.  I also liked the tactical look on the rifle better.  I fitted it with a single point sling attachment and AR stock tube kit so I could use an adjustable stock (includes Magpul STR stock in black).  

Once the stock and extra kit were fitted I wanted to get more into suppression.  Since the VZ has a thinner barrel and odd thread type I had to have the barrel re-done.  I had it shortened and an AAC 51T muzzle device welded on at Rocky Mountain Weaponry in Colorado.  This rifle did start out as a Century Arms VZ2008.  Since the Century rifles use all Czech parts (barrel/internals/gas system) and the receiver is the only part manufactured by Century, the rifle was disassembled and the receiver was then replaced with the CNC Warrior unit (Look up CNC Warrior in North Carolina, these units are VERY sought after, have great feed ramps and excellent quality, perfect spec and very hard to find).  The rifle and all 5 magazines were all then cerakoted and reassembled.  

***NOTE***
THIS IS NOT AN AK-47/74 OR A VARIANT.  Parts, magazines, etc. are NOT compatible between the AK and VZ platforms.

All private firearm sales will then be required BY LAW to be conducted at a gun dealer (FFL), who will collect a fee AND perform a background check. It's estimated that the cost will be a minimum of $35 to the dealer and another $10 for the Oregon State Police. In reality, the gun dealer can charge whatever they choose. Avoid this extra $50-$75 fee and make your private firearm purchases today.

Currently, a private sale to anyone age 18-21 is legal in Oregon. SB941 will effectively end that. If you are under 21 and want to make a private pistol purchase, you really have a very short time to do so. When SB941 passes, all firearm transactions in Oregon will require a FFL, who will collect a fee and perform a background check. Current FFL laws will no longer allow anyone under 21 to purchase a handgun.

SB941 is constitutionally wrong and amounts to nothing more than a comprehensive list of Oregon gun owners.

I got it in trade a few years ago and it doesn't have any sentimental value so it's the one that has to go.

The serial number on the main frame housing doesn't match the serial numbers on the trigger frame, grip strap and the barrel.

The markings on it are:
Barrel: Top Side- Address Col. SamL Colt New York US America
Right Side- There is an H with a slash below it
Left Side- Above the screw it has ""GG""
Under Plunger: There is what looks like an S or a 5
Back by the cylinder nipples is a ""B""
Bottom back by plunger: ""S 8""
Back(where it butts by the frame): What looks like a ""C"" and a ""2""
Cylinder:
-LTS Patent No 2634, PAT Sept 10th 1855(I believe it says 1855, but the second 5 is a little faded so I'm not 100% sure)
-G
-H
Trigger Strap:
-Back: Col. F. B. Stone, USA I362(Possibly 1362, the 1st number/letter is a bit faded)
-Bottom: Serial Number
-Top by Trigger Frame: The inspection mark is pretty faded, I think it has a ""C""
Frame:
-Where cylinder butts up against the frame there is a R
- Left Side has ""Colts Patent""
-Under has the serial number

There is some pitting, a bit of rust, and the silver plating has rubbed off in some areas. The wood grips are in decent shape, some nicks and scratches but overall about 90% condition. Barrel is pretty clean considering the age, and the rifling is still fully visible.
The hammer sticks sometimes, i think its because of the different frame but this is more a collectable than a daily shooter so that shouldnt be too big a deal.
Like I said, I really need cash and no reasonable offers will be turned down so make me an offer and we'll see what kind of deal we can make."

From my research it appears Mr. Brown only made 88 1911’s that year (reference: Annual firearms manufacturing and export reports). It’s my understanding he was still sourcing frames and slides from Les Baer and their supplier. This Brown has very tight slide to frame and barrel lockup. Easy to tell it hasn't had many rounds through it.

 Upgrades when purchased would have been ambi safety, magwell / checkered mainspring housing and front strap checking instead of scales.

It is a Mustang XSP purchased brand new by me last month and has only had 100 rounds through it (with 0 malfunctions). It comes with original Colt case, paperwork, lock, and two Colt OEM magazines. 
I like it quite a bit, recoil is mild, accuracy is great, trigger is a crisp 3-4 pounds, and fit and finish are top notch. Unfortunately, due to my current financial situation I am looking to consolidate my calibers.
I would like to trade for a full size pistol in 9mm. I am mainly interested in something SA/DA with a metal frame. My top choice would be a Beretta 92, but I would also be interested in a CZ-75 and other similar items. I would also be interested in a Ruger GP100 4"" or 1911 .45. That being said, I will consider most any reasonable offer.
I will also sell for $500 FIRM- these retail for $600-$800, so I feel my price is more than fair.
I am not able to use my phone from 2-9PM, so armslist message is the best way to reach me at that time, otherwise the best way to reach me is by text to 316-619-9eight5four. I have my CCL and can sign a bill of sale if desired. FTF Wichita area only."

This AR-10T has fired less than 200 rds. In all likelihood it has had less than 100rds. All either bench or firing at coyotes with a twilight scope. 

It has a made in Japan 10x42 adjustable to distance/focus SWFA Classic ""Super Sniper"" Scope. This scope was made by the company that made the Bausch and Laumb Elite series scope for Bushnell. This scope has an NSN assigned to it- the Navy used them in testing, thus the NSN number. This one was mil-surp but never been mounted. They are nitrogen filled and the environment/temp/etc does not effect focus.

I am an a-hole in a hat when it comes to semi-auto bench rest shooting, but it honestly shoots like a bolt gun in terms of accuracy. I've shot into a pack of coyotes and dropped one dead and the resulting pass through crippled another and I got him later.

The G43 is our new single stack 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCK history. Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size. Fit & Feel When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users. Caliber 9x19 has become a standard in personal defense nationwide and for militaries throughout the world. The G43 is designed for any 9x19 round the civilian or law enforcement communities see fit to use. From the 64 grain to the 147 grain bullet, the all new G43 will function within the full spectrum of available ammunition.

I bought this brand new and it has probably less than 200 rounds through it, not even broken in yet. I simply do not use it enough to keep it. Comes with everything you would get if purchased new from a dealer, as seen in the pictures. Owners manual, certificate of authenticity, gun lock, three genuine Sig 15 round magazines, and I'm throwing in a nice Ace Case holster that holds an extra magazine that I used. It was thoroughly cleaned after each use and put back in the case. This Sig has factory installed night sites (which are still very bright), the Department of Defense UID (Unique Identification) and the engraved Navy anchor, all the internal parts are treated with anti-corrosion coating . For those not a aware, this pistol is identical to the ones issued to and used by the Navy SEALs and Special Warfare Operators. This is the real deal and it shoots like it too.
