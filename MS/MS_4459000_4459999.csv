This rifle has had exactly 20 rounds fired to verify functionality, 10 subsonic and 10 supersonic.  This upper is very light weight and compact for maximum mobility and maneuverability, it balances with a standard lower very well.  Would work great for a gun to take hunting or hiking. The muzzle is threaded to take any standard 30 cal muzzle device (5/8x24).  Rail internal diameter is 1.56"", so any 1.5"" suppressor or smaller will fit.  Also very accurate (my 10 supersonic rounds gave me a nice 1.2"" group at 100 yards with a 4x ACOG).  

I won this in a raffle, and already have 2 other 300 BLK AR15s so I do not need a third."

In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period.     

Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of  match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92FS its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class....mode of payment should be Money order, cashier checks or money gram"

This rifle is a Bulgarian AK-74S with a triangle stock built by Tim at Gewehr works, it's a custom built rifle on a matching parts kit.  This is NOT a Waffen Werks rifle, this is a Gewehr Works, it's a custom shop like Rifle Dynamics... actually very comparable in quality to Jim Fuller's shop.  I did swap out the PG for an Izhmash PG.  It has a tapco FCG and the usual US made parts for 922r to keep it kosher.  Gun's KG gunkote finish is in great shape, every lines up, no rust or corrosion anywhere on it.  I don't know how many rounds are thru it, I bought it secondhand during the Sandy Hook craze, but I haven't shot it much if at all and I only use Silver Bear, so non-corrosive ammo.  Comes with one 30 round Russian Plum mag.  If you want a 45 round Bakelite, please add 90$ to the sale price.

Price is 950$ for the rifle and one Bulgarian ((21)) mag.  I'm taking a fairly heavy loss on this... like I said, I bought it during the gun scare, so I'm losing about half the value in the rifle.  

Fine print: If you want to ship, price's less actual cost of shipping, I can take USPS MO/PP (you pay fees)/Check.  If you want to do an FTF pickup is in Raleigh, NC.  No, I'm not willing to part out magazines or parts off the gun.  NO TRADES.  I'll repeat that, NO TRADES.  Must provide proof of age and the gun must ship to an FFL for purchase.  You must be legal to purchase this rifle, no sales to suspicious individuals.  No, I won't break the law for you. You MUST sign a bill of sale before you take the rifle away.  No exceptions."

Whether you want to do hunting, wildlife observation, or hardcore military/marine operations, the Steiner Marine 7x50 fits the bill. Even in very poor light conditions, the multi-coated optics of these Steiner binoculars gives a light transmission of about 90%, so you can see clearly. Get a complete view of the field with the long 20mm eye relief of these multi-coated lens binoculars. The BAK-4 prism of the Steiner Marine 7x50 accounts for supreme brightness and clarity even in dimly-lit conditions. The rugged, completely waterproof, shockproof and fogproof Steiner Marine 7x50 can be used in any kind of pathetically extreme conditions. You can now focus automatically from 20 yards to infinity with the sports-autofocus system of these Steiner binoculars. The tough black rubber armoring of these multi-coated lens binoculars maintains your grip even when it is soaked wet."

However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies aross the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use.The CX4 jsut begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization.Features:Caliber: 40 S&WCapacity: 14Barrel Length: 16.6"" Finish: BlackAction: SingleOverall Height: 7.5""Overall length: 29.7""Overall Width: 2.5""Sight Radius: 12.9""Weight: 90.8 oz."

I bought it years ago but never fired it. Kept in safe  in gun sock and lubed and cleaned regularly. I did remove the safety and gave it to a friend since i was not using this gun, so it is missing. I also upgraded the barrel to a mossberg barrel.  Action is silky smooth. Has very slight safe wear but nothing that could show up in pictures. I added a top folding tactical stock that can hold a shell saddle (cost me 100 back then). Again this is the MAGNUM version. Great for home defense and its very short with the stock folded for close quarters/home.

You will also have 5 range passes at no additional cost. (You get those for purchasing the bow in his shop as opposed to a competitor.) I ordered it special from the factory because they didn't have ANY left hand models in stock. I don't have much time for archery with my shooting habits, so it must be sold. I paid $650 for it brand new. I will be selling it with everything you see in the pictures for $550 FIRM. Included will be the following.

-12 Gold Tip XT Hunter Arrows cut to length ($80+$1/cut)
-Black Hole Archery Block ($40 and shot less than 100 times)
-Bow Stand ($30 worth of PVC and glue) holds 12 arrows and 2 bows
-Original box and paperwork for the bow and arrows (no actual monetary value but it might make you feel better)

This bow is literally in perfect condition. There are no scratches, scuffs, or blemishes of any kind. It's never been out in the elements. It has been in a Plano hard case since it came home. 

I will shoot the bow to demonstrate that everything works properly. Pickup will be at my house. I will let you shoot it if you present cash. (Just on the off chance that you dry fire it.) Text/Call REDACTED if you're interested. The only trades that I'm interested in are 1911's or Smith Revolvers. No archery, speakers, x-box, etc. (I'm not trying to be rude, but I'm just not interested.)"

I'm selling my pride and joy.... Unfortunately she's become a safe queen and it's time to let go. This gun has 325 rounds down the tube, all shot by yours truly as I am the only owner of this rifle. The last time I shot this at the range I was ringing steel at 800 yards with 149gr ball ammo! This gun is incredibly accurate especially with 168 SMK's... All work was completed by a gunsmith and finished by Springfield Armory. No cost was sparred while building this tack driver as you can see by the details listed below. Asking price was $4,230 for everything  listed below NOW $3,900....$2900 without the scope (which is me eating the cost of all the gunsmithing so prttye is pretty firm). 

I'M NOW OPEN TO TRADES FOR A SCAR 17!!!!

(Please note the scope pictured in the outdoor pic is not the Mark 4, I just added it to show a couple more angles on the gun) Will ship FFL to FFL. Shipping costs will depend on location, we'll work that out at sale.

The rifle is in post ban configuration with removable wire stock. It was designed to use slightly modified UZI magazines. There is a small notch cut into a standard UZI mag, which is very easy to duplicate. An interesting feature of this rifle is that it was intentionally made to break down allow it to be stored in a compact space. Great camping or back pack rifle. It would also make a really cool SBR project if you want to get a tax stamp and cut the barrel down.
     I've heard and read a lot of great things about these cool little carbines and they have a reputation for being extremely accurate for what they are. I haven't tested it myself. Check out the beefy thick barrel.
     The rifle comes with 4 mags total. One 20-round Feather factory magazine that could use a new follower, one pre ban uzi mag that it looks like someone altered at home, it actually fits and feeds very well. Plus two unaltered pre ban UZI mags that haven't been notched yet. You can do it yourself if you're even remotely handy, or just bring them to a gunsmith and have it done professionally.

The gun is being sold AS IS. The lower price reflects that.
I have never fired it or bothered to take it to the range because I noticed that it has a problem extracting a round from the chamber. It's a very tight fit and you have to pull the round out by hand, this could probably easily be solved by reaming the chamber, an easy fix any competent gunsmith can do for a reasonable price. The condition of the weapon is good used. It has a good shiny bore, but has the usual little scratches and imperfections from range use. It's not a safe queen. The price listed is very fair for it's condition and what it is. I'd like to see this stay in mass versus listing it on an auction site, but if nobody bites I'll just list it on gunbroker. 

These are still being made by a company called FeatherUSA and parts are available. 

Not interested in trades unless you have something thats rare and interesting. (Hard to find non mass compliant handguns, antiques, and collectible firearms) your Ruger, Smith M&P or 3rd gen Glock that grows on trees isn't rare.

I have had this one sitting in my gun safe for a while and am looking to sell some project guns I don't have time to finish, as well as free up some space in the safe. This isn't a fire sale so don't waste either of our time with low ball offers.

No other shotgun feels like a Model 12 going to your shoulder, weight and balance is superb. All Model 12's are ""slam fire"" capable. This particular gun was manufactured in 1939 and is in excellent condition. I would put it at 98%. It is a 28"" barrel in Modified choke. It has been kept in my safe for many years and I am selling to pursue other projects. This shotgun would make a great hunting gun or just to add to your collection. They were made in 12, 16 and 20ga. They are hard to find now in this condition and especially at this price. Not interested in trading."

(Information below was taken from an NRA article on NM Garand's. I added a few “added notes” as to this Rifle for your information.)
Between 1953-1955 Springfield Armory produced the first of the NM series rifles the NM-1 (Type-1), serial numbers will be between approximately 5,800,000 and 6,100,000. 
Most of the unaltered original Type 1 NM rifles will exhibit the following characteristics
-Markings on right receiver leg: Drawing number, “6528287-SA;” Heat Lot, T 1 to T 10 - Z 5 to Z15 (added note: This Rifle receiver drawing no: F6528291 Heat lot; Z6A, Which matches Springfield Armory records for NM receiver. Left side receiver is stamped with ""S"")
-Barrel: Marked “T” for (targeted); “P” for (proofed); “SA F6535448” (Add Note: This Barrel is marked ""SA F 6525448 drawing number with two ""S"" stamps over the F); Month and year of barrel production; Heat lot code, “m” (magnetic particle testing) and Defense Acceptance Stamp (Added Note: This Rifle has additional inverted ""P"" with punch mark center ""P"" loop which was used as early NM marking).
-Bolt: “6522887-SA” (with heat lot code) (Added Note: This rifle Bolt ""6528287-SA)
-Windage Knob: “DRC”
-Elevation Knob: “WCE” (Added Note: This rifle has ""DRC"" Elevation Knob)
""""It should be noted that the early production examples (1953-1955) may have different parts from those listed above."""" Stocks for NM-1 Rifles were not glassed, but rather hand selected for tight fit and uniform wood grain.
Springfield Armory engineers and armors worked closely to prefect the Nation Match 1 rifle.  
The exact number of Type 1 National Match rifles made is unknown. There is a much-published chart purporting to give a breakdown of M1 National Match production from 1953 to 1963. 

This is a rare find for the shooters or collector. NM-1's are rare in this condition.

Note: Buyer Pays: Shipping and DOJ registration fees
I will consider reasonable offers. 

This is a nice accurate shooting rifle in excellent condition and all the marking as stated above.. For Shooter or Collector. Rare find!
