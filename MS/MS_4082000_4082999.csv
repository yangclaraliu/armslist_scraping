Factor in the Ruger reliability and they are the best value on the market.
Convertible models come equipped with an extra cylinder and are popular with shooters who appreciate the classic single-action revolver but opt for the versatility of being able to use more than one caliber in their handgun. With its interchangeable cylinder, Convertible models can be easily converted from one caliber to another without the use of tools. This versatility allows avid shooters of autoloading pistols to enjoy shooting a classic American single-action sidearm with their favorite pistol cartridge.
   We have 2 in stock, and have them priced to sell quickly for just $519 each.

You can get an SKS in much better condition for a lot less money.  But this SKS rifle was made in 1957 or 1958, making it exempt from Colorado's stupid background check law, because it’s more than 50 years old.  See explanation at the ar-15.co link below.


I got this in a trade a few years ago, and it's been sitting in the safe since then.  I recently put 14 rounds through it, just to test functionality before putting this up for sale.  Why 14 rounds?  I intended to shoot a single 10-round magazine's worth of ammo, but had 4 extra loose rounds in my range bag.  The picture of the target below is 10 rounds fired at 25 yards.

The finish on this rifle is worn to the metal in many spots, and the stock is extremely rough.   Given it's age and condition, at first I thought I might have gotten lucky and obtained a Vietnam War trophy by accident.  But then I noticed the Century Arms International import markings on the barrel

CHINA SKS TYPE 56  7.62 x 39


Serial numbers match on receiver, bolt, trigger guard, and magazine.  Serial number on the receiver cover does not match the receiver.

The conventional wisdom for determining the date of manufacture of an Arsenal 26 SKS is to add the first-digit prefix of the serial number to 1956 (the first year they were made).  eg, sn 1,000,000 = 1 + 1956 = 1957, sn 2,000,000 = 2 + 1956 = 1958, etc.    See Yooper John's ""Dating Your SKS"" at http://yooperj.com/SKS-24.htm

Other sources claim the that the ""2"" prefix (in the 2 million serial number range) indicates 1957.  See ""Topic: Q: When was my Chinese Type 56 SKS made?"" at http://sks-files.com/chinese-sks-military/17/q-when-was-my-chinese-type-56-sks-made/360/  and  ""Jianshe Arsenal /26\"" at http://chinesesks.weebly.com/arsenal-26.html

This poorly-written turd of a law known previously as HB 13-1229 and now known as CRS 18-12-112 specifically exempts antiques and curios and relics from the private-party background check requirement. It does not require the transferror or transferee to hold a C&R license for the exemption.

CRS 18-12-112:
(6) THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION DO NOT APPY TO:
(a) A TRANSFER OF AN ANTIQUE FIREARM, AS DEFINED IN 18 U.S.C. SEC 921(a)(16), AS AMENDED, OR A CURIO OR RELIC, AS DEFINED IN 27 CFR 478.11, AS AMENDED;

27 CFR 478.11:
Curios or relics. Firearms which are of special interest to collectors by reason of some quality other than is associated with firearms intended for sporting use or as offensive or defensive weapons. To be recognized as curios or relics, firearms must fall within one of the following categories:
(a) Firearms which were manufactured at least 50 years prior to the current date, but not including replicas thereof;
(b) Firearms which are certified by the curator of a municipal, State, or Federal museum which exhibits firearms to be curios or relics of museum interest; and
(c) Any other firearms which derive a substantial part of their monetary value from the fact that they are novel, rare, bizarre, or because of their association with some historical figure, period, or event. Proof of qualification of a particular firearm under this category may be established by evidence of present value and evidence that like firearms are not available except as collector's items, or that the value of like firearms available in ordinary commercial channels is substantially less.

So for any firearm 50 years old or older, or on the C&R list can still be bought and sold freely, privately, just like before 7/1/13!"

Due to the high rate of attrition of permit holders renewing. I have decided to put a real push on getting permit holders to renew.

I'm just guessing, but I think it is because of the unknown cost to renew the permit.

So here is the deal.

Solano County Permit holders, your total cost to renew will be $160.00.

That includes, State & County fees, range fees, targets, training fee and qualification with one handgun (10.00 for each additional handgun).

The only other cost you will incur is ammunition. If you are a decent shot, the course of fire is 35 rounds.

You can purchase this deal any time for long as your Solano County Permit is valid (current). Roughly three months prior to your permit expiring, you will take our Solano County renewal training & qualification course. You will then schedule filing your renewal application with the sheriff's office approximately two months (eight weeks) before your current permit expires.

I don't think this process could get any easier in California.

When you take our Solano County CCW Renewal Course, we will supply you with money orders or cashier checks for all of the State & County fees, during the course.

I took it apart and cleaned it up and got it working again. The magazine valve cap is missing. So I borrowed one to test it and it fires alright, but you have to manually use the bolt handle to eject the shell and to get another one in the chamber. It is suppose to be a semi-auto. It's not pretty, some things have been changed on it. One may want it for parts, or use it the way it is, or fix it up. I have read this is the same gun as the Winchester 1400. It is what it is. I will try and answer any questions. Make me an offer and come and get it."

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT:  Six great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR Conversion Kits for the GLOCK pistol.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.

6.  ONE YEAR FACTORY DIRECT WARRANTY
Warranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship. (Excluding S&H Charges).

-------------------------------
COMPATIBILITY OF OUR CONVERSION KITS FOR GLOCK PISTOLS
Our Conversion Kits are made to work on FACTORY STOCK Glock frames.
Note:  Aftermarket parts such as trigger bars and connectors, especially the Ghost Connector, can adversely affect the function and reliability of your conversion kit."

Our incredibly popular 527 Carbine now has a youth variant. Though the action and barrel stay the same, the Turkish Walnut stock has been shrunk in nearly every dimension. With a 12.75” length of pull, smaller pistol grip with tighter radius and a thinner forend, the Youth Carbine makes an ideal first deer rifle. Chambered in .223 and 7.62×39, both cartridges are more than capable of taking deer-sized game and deliver little felt recoil compared to many youth offerings on the market. Paired with our smooth micro-Mauser action and single set trigger, a standard Carbine stock can be added as the shooter grows, so its small size won’t relegate it to the back of the safe a few years down the road.
Built to CIP specifications, our 7.62×39 chambers are ideal for shooting steel-cased surplus ammo. Designed to shoot .311 bullets, some American brass ammo may not perform as well as the imported steel-cased variety because of SAAMI brass dimensions and varying bullet diameters.

Wikipedia write up---> The Tanfoglio Combat or Standard, also known as T(A)95 or EAA Witness Steel, is an improved version of the Czech CZ-75 pistol. It is made in Gardone Val Trompia (Brescia), Italy by Fratelli Tanfoglio S.N.C..

The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard was introduced in 1997. The pistols are imported into the United States by European American Armory Inc. (EAA) and called the ""Witness Steel"".The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard models are evolved copies of the famous CZ-75 pistol design, with manufacturing improvements. Tanfoglio introduced the firing pin block before CZ, and its operation is different from what is employed in modern CZ's. The firing pin block is kept in an upwards position, blocking the firing pin until the trigger is pulled. This causes the pin to fall, allowing the firing pin to move. As a result, the overall trigger operation is improved by the block (the CZ design actively pushes the block out of the way when the trigger is pulled, increasing overall weight to the pull). The Browning-style safety is improved to allow operation with hammer cocked or down (the CZ allows the safety to operate only when the hammer is cocked). The frame is simplified by omitting the magazine brake, reducing complexity as well as simplifying machining."

Government agencies working as the greatest salesman ever.

The new M855 A1 round is now the round of the military.
They have decided that the old M855 is less effective and less (environmental friendly)

So the billions of surplus lake city ammo has to go somewhere and FAST.
On top of that let's get as much money as possible for it.

Let's create a scare to the citizens (sheep).
We will tell them its banned and will never be made available again.
They will rush out and buy up all our antiquated ammo.

Bonus they will be armed with the far less effective M855 then are fancy M855A1 rd.
It does not matter whether we actually go through with the BAN or not.
We'll scare the shit out of them for 30days and move a crap ton of our  ammo we no longer want to use any ways.

Regardless Lake city ammo has a Government contract to produce the majority of their  ammo. So they will be tooled up to crank out billions of RDS a year of the new M855A1.
With close to 80% (us made) of the M855 coming off the lines at lake city (just relabeled a different brand). No ones going to make it anyways.

As we have seen many times this leadership is the GREATEST gun salesman ever.
Think about all the scares in the past 6 to 8 years.

I'm sure there is more to it but this is just food for thought.

IMO there is billions of surplus RDS they need to move and fast.
What a genius way to get the private sector to buy it up.


I by know means suggest just sit back and smile.
But think about it before you rush out and pay over a dollar a round!"

At the heart of the 93R17 TRR-SR design is the simple yet ingenious Savage AccuTrigger system. For the the vast majority of shooters, a lighter trigger pull equates to greater accuracy. The pull weight of this rifle is user adjustable from 1.5 to 6 pounds without the fear of it going off if dropped or bumped. At the center of the AccuTrigger mechanism lies the AccuRelease, which is a thin blade that rides within the main trigger to prevent the sear from releasing unless held all the way rearward. It only requires a pound of pressure to move the AccuRelease to the rear, where the finger then engages the trigger. The pull weight can be adjusted with a tool provided with the rifle.

The Savage 93R17 TRR-SR's receiver is tubular and has the barrel sleeved within. In the rare instance a case ruptures, it has twin gas ports under the front bridge to help protect the shooter. The bolt configuration is tactical oversized for easier loading. This is a rear locking bolt design that cocks on open and has a fixed blade ejector. Traditional dual rimfire extractors provide maximum cycling reliability, while the rifle's two position safety is conveniently located behind the bolt. 

To release the bolt for disassembly and cleaning, remove the magazine, double check to make sure the chamber is empty, then place the safety in its forward position. Pull the bolt back while depressing the trigger and it will separate from the back of the action. Similarly, replacing the bolt also requires the operator the squeeze the trigger. The matte finish black compliments the tactical appearance of this rifle extremely well, while the 93R17 TRR-SR's hardwood stock prevents swelling and warping, plus has been treated with a coating akin to a truck bed liner. Besides looking really cool, this surface finish should prove highly resistant to inclement weather. It is also less susceptible to scratching or dinging than traditional wood stocks, plus includes dual front and a single rear swivel stud for mounting your favorite sling and bipod. A Monte Carlo rise in the comb offers the shooter enhanced cheek weld when using optics. 

The rifle weighs in at 7.8 pounds unloaded and has a detachable five round box magazine, whose release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. Grooved for accepting standard rimfire rings, the receiver is with Weaver style bases for attaching optics. Offestting Picatinny forend rails provide attachment points for adding accessories such as light or laser.The bottom iron is carbon steel sheet metal, where the trigger guard is constructed of impact resistant plastic. A 22"" heavy fluted barrel barrel has been threaded to accept suppressors and includes the thread protector. For service and repair, the Model 93R17 TRR-SR is backed by a 1- year warranty. Overall, Savage Arms has enjoyed a well deserved reputation for building accurate rifles and the 93R17 TRR-SR will provide years of reliable varmint hunting enjoyment."

Russian eagle stamped on receiver and R for Remington on the underside of the tang, the number 4 stamped on bottom of butt stock. The floor plate of the magazine has the only serial#, and this was used for the books. I've added a non serial# bolt, hand guard, and new Russian web sling. The bolt will not close with the extractor attached, but will close with it removed, this is common. These were not intended to be shot. Rifled and smooth bore barrels were used in making these rifles. The last one on Armslist was a smooth bore going for $300.00. Most of these were beat up by the kids at the schools and later parted out. This one is in fine condition with a great rifled bore, and would make a great addition to a MN collection or can be used to make a nice sporter by gunsmith, a beautiful American Nagant.

 Most effective all around brake for m92                                February 24, 2015
Cannot say enough good things about the CNC Warrior 4 pc brake for the PAP M92. Kills 95% of muzzle flash, reduces felt recoil and projects the report down range away from the shooter and away from those on the firing line next to them. I have shot a lot of boosters, brakes and flash hiders of other makes, models and designs and this brake has been the overall best performer."

I'm pretty open, What do you have?

In very good condition, pristine bore, no rust, there is a mark on top of the receiver from the old scope mount. Throughly cleaned and greased after every session. A few minor handling marks and scuffs, the brass is showing a nice even patina.

The TC Scout is a rather odd duck, is it a traditional or is it an in-line, it kind resembles a lever gun without the lever. On one hand, they are highly sought after because of their compact size and great handling ability. On the other hand you can only use a #11 cap and it kicks like a mule but then it's a small light rifle that trows a huge hunk of lead. I have not shot it in years and it is just taking up space in the safe.


Lets call it a $225 cash value.
I'm open wide open to offers.

With a small overall profile, the Zastava PAP M85PV is also an excellent choice for hunting varmints in heavy underbrush. Even though it's relatively lightweight, the efficient muzzle brake means that excessive recoil is simply not going to be a problem. The gas system is inspired by the legendary AK-47 rifle, and will chug right along under even the dirtiest of conditions."

This particular gun took me almost 3 years to find, why you ask, simple, every one you find has a dark bore and dull rifling, this one is a shiny bore with nice sharp rifling, wasn't an easy find. Since then it has gone through some major changes, as you can see it has been drilled and tapped for a scope mount, bolt has also been machined for a turn down bolt handle, it has had a trigger job done, and 6 inches has been removed from the barrel and it has been recrowned and recessed 1/8 inch so it cant be damaged. It has a fully floated, fully adjustable arc angel stock with 5 round detachable mag. Gun has had the proper head space set as well as bolt mods to keep the notorious bolt lock up from happening. If you don't know much about these guns generally all you ever get out of them is 3""-5"" groups at 100 yards, this one consistently shoots 1.5"" with surplus ammo, it truly is a great shooter. I hate to get rid of it but I have some things I want more so I'm parting ways, no expense has been spared on this gun build, only thing left that I wanted to do was have it cera coated but it doesn't need it. Any questions just ask, comes as pictured minus bi pod and with 740 rounds of 7.62x54 ammo. I will not deliver or meet up, if you want it you come get it, price is firm, no trades."
