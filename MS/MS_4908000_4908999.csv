If you are a collector or hate finger grooves this is the Gen 2 for you or if you want a cheaper Glock to make a project out of,Will come with one factory 15 round Glock mag.

Gun was 359 plus 11% tax plus a 15$ transfer that makes it 425$ I replaced all the springs with factory OEM glock springs that cost me 36$ so I am taking a loss but only a little one.

Selling solely to grab another Gen 3 19 and Only a Gen 3 19.

I bought this from AIM this year as an LEO trade in and replaced all the springs with Glock OEM springs except for the trigger spring It now has the better designed but heavier OD green trigger spring (7LB) it came with the Red spring (10lb) which I still have.

Overall its in great condition unless cosmetics bother you but it is in no way beat to hell like most LEO guns... on the plus side it's serial numbers don't require the six part ""Upgrade"" Glock recommends for Gen 2's and even better it has the forged flat faced extractor which is stronger then Glocks of today.

This gun is slightly rare in that it has all the better forged minor parts but not so that it makes it 1,000$ Glock or anything this would be great if you are looking for a cheap collector piece or just an all around tank of a handgun i'm selling it to get another Gen 3 19 as I already own one and want another."

The micrometer rear sight is complete and correct. The front globe sight is functional but does not have its correct insert or threaded retaining piece. This rifle sports the nice polished blued finish that Brno gave to their later firearms; unlike the earlier Brno rifles had a dull parkerized finish. The moderate benchrest stock is clean and unmolested, fitted with sling swivels and a checkered steel butt plate. All metal is undamaged, bluing is strong, and screw heads all undamaged The cons: The European hardwood stock is in very good shape overall, clean with a few small dents and dings from handling. There is a ‘ y ‘ shaped hairline crack at the back of the action inletting, top of wrist. This does not appear to extend into the mass of the stock, but a part of it can be seen inside the inletting. A quick sanding and re-finishing would probably hide this flaw, but that wouldn’t be honest, would it? The globe front site is missing its knurled retaining nut that holds the inserts in place and the insert in place is homemade. It is retained by a piece of plastic that is a slip fit. Believe it or not this cobbled-up solution seems to work quite well (and could easily be improved – and kits of inserts are available inexpensively from several sources such as Brownells). I may have another, complete Brno globe front around here somewhere, and if I find it the price for the rifle will be adjusted upward accordingly.\ More pics available on request. Price: NOW $999Would prefer to sell in-state but will consider shipping to FFL - you pay for hard case and shipping costs."

Asking what I paid, nothing more nothing less. $135.00


Here's what LWRC has to say about it:

The LWRC International UCIW (Ultra-Compact Individual Weapon) stock system shortens the overall length of the firearm by a full inch, as compared to a standard AR. The system’s components were designed to work together and should be installed together for reliable performance. The stock is lightweight and features integral sling attachment points, easy one-hand adjustments and excellent cheekweld. The rubber buttpad prevents slippage during firing. The receiver extension has four positions to adjust the length of pull. Derived from our UCIW project, it is a great option for shortening the overall length of your rifle."

bass pro description:
A small, lightweight pistol ideal for concealed or backup carry, the Kimber Ultra Crimson Carry II pistol features a compact aluminum frame with short grip for easy concealment. Like the Pro Crimson Carry line, Ultra Crimson Carry pistols combine Kimber quality with a Crimson Trace Lasergrip for greater accuracy, confidence, and value. A lightweight pistol ideal for carrying all-day/every day, this 1911-style handgun is built around a lightweight aluminum frame machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. The Ultra Crimson Carry's steel slide and match grade steel 3'' bushingless bull barrel aids concealability while still delivering Kimber accuracy. One of the finest laser sights available, Crimson Trace Lasergrips project a bright red dot downrange, to help shooters of all levels learn the advantage of proper grip and trigger control immediately, helping them improve accuracy and reduce time between shots while training. Extended thumb safety and beavertail grip safety for fast positive action."

Pistol has seen little use or holster carry, stainless steel barrel is bright and shines. Caliber is 380 auto and also called 9mm KURZ . I am selling to raise cash for health expenses. 

P230 has a reputation as a well-built firearm, and competes with the smaller Walther PPK. With its relatively narrow slide and frame it can be carried in an ankle holster or beneath body armor. This pistol features a blued steel slide and a matching, anodized aluminum frame. The trigger comes from the factory with a 24 newtons (5.5 lbf) single-action pull, and is capable of both single-action and double-action. However, this trigger has been adjusted by profession gunsmith Buckhorn Firearms, Idaho and, now reads single-action 3.5 lb on my Timmey Trigger gauge. In single-action position, making for a very short trigger pull, with minimal take-up. The double-action pull is longer and much heavier. Like many Sig’s it has a de-cocking lever; using the de-cocking lever in order for the round to discharge, the full double-action pull would have to be completed, which allows for the pistol to be carried reasonably safely with a round chambered. The sights are of the traditional SIG design and configuration, with a dot on the front sight and a rectangle on the rear sight. $475 for the entire package."

Chrome Molly is a Machine Gun Steel, and Nitriding is harder and more lubricious than the common Chrome Lining. The result is a more accurate, and more durable barrel. 

In our Model: SST Ar15 we have been using Lothar Walther Stainless Steel Barrels and then Nitriding them for durability and accuracy. A few months back we took a rifle that has been on Centennial Gun Clubs range and tested for accuracy, as well as did a visual inspection to see how the lands and groves were holding up. You can see our published results here: https://double-d-armory.com/25k-rounds-later/ 

New Double D Armory Barrels

With this barrel you are getting a Chrome Molly barrel which is harder than Stainless Steel, and getting the added benefit of Nitride. What is ""Nitride"" you ask? Here is a link to read about the ""Nitride"" process used on our barrels: http://www.blacknitride.com/whatis.html

This barrel will give the end user a long lasting and accurate barrel, good for thousands of rounds. 

These barrels are the same barrels used in our more popular ""Forged Rifle"", the Model: SSTF. We stand 100% behind all of our products, so rest assure you will be happy with this purchase!

It's Christmas and I need Christmas money! I hope you are looking for a great gift! :) What I have for sale is an AR-15 built on a spike's tactical lower. It's been a safe queen ever since I built it. I was hoping to do an SR-25 conversion on it, but I ended up just building an SR from the ground up. I'm not selling it for more than what I have in it. The upper receiver alone costed me well over $500. Hasn't been shot in over 6 months and it's collecting dust. Less than 1,000 rounds through it. As said before, PRICE NEGOTIABLE. NO LOW BALLS. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE MY TIME WITH A TEST FIRE IF YOU ARE NOT A SERIOUS BUYER. Again, thank you for looking! :)
Will throw in 2 PMAGs with it!

DESCRIPTION

The SUB-2000™ is a semi-automatic rifle chambered for the 9mm Luger or the .40 cal. S&W cartridge. Different versions of the SUB-2000™ rifle will accept most double column handgun magazines (see list below).  By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000™ rifle can instantly be reduced to a size of 16.25 x 7 inches for ease of storage.

The polymer of the weapon is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel.  Two integrated Picatinny rails come standard on the SUB-2000™ forend for mounting compatible accessories.  The forend also includes five mounting slots per side, configured for various M-LOK™ accessories. 

The stock can be adjusted to three different positions for shooter's comfort.  Each position adds approximately 5/8 of an inch to the overall length of the weapon, with a total extension of 1.25 inches in the further rearward position.  The stock includes a single point sling loop attachment, a slot for adding a nylon sling loop (1.25"" wide is ideal), and a Picatinny rail on the bottom for adding small accessories. 

The SUB-2000™ features a push-bolt safety located behind the trigger on the grip assembly.  The bolt can be locked in the rear position by cycling the bolt to the rear and rotating the operating handle up into the cutout on the receiver.  The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. 

The thread protector on the SUB-2000™ is removable, if the shooter desires to replace the thread protector with a compatible accessory for the 1/2""-28 threads (9mm model) or 9/16""-24 threads (.40 cal S&W).  The SUB-2000™ can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

The .40 SUB-2000™ can be configured in the following magazine types: GLK22.

It is used but in very good condition, I bought it new and still have the box with it. I've only used it for plinking and have put less than 500 rounds in it. Comes with the adjustable accutrigger, which is very nice, I just wasn't interested in playing around with it. Comes with a Simmons 4x32 scope. Very, very accurate. Cones with 5 round magazine and can feed 22 shorts reliablly. Savage sell lots of aftermarket stocks that are very nice, and if I'm correct different barrels as well. Can also get 10 round banana magazines.

$140 OBO as well as open to trades 
Would be interested in trading for a NAA mini revolver and I could throw in some cash. As well as a DB380 or 9mm. Or a Hi Point 40, or 45 or any 22 pistol.  I'm pretty open minded

Chambered for 7.62x51 NATO (.308). Those of you who are familiar with the Hk-91 already know that the manufacturing quality, reliability, and accuracy of these German-produced rifles is unmatched. A ban on the import of these rifles took effect in 1989, so whatever made it into the U.S. prior to that is what's available on the market. This is one of the 48,817 Hk-91 rifles that were imported from 1974 - 1989.

The bore and chamber are mirror-bright and in excellent condition as you'd expect. The muzzle end of the barrel is threaded to accept the flash hider or other accessories (note that the factory flash hider's innovative locking design permits it to be installed / removed by hand and does not require any tools). The bolt carrier and bolt head are 'IB' coded.

The furniture is German Army surplus, taken directly from a G3 service rifle. It matches nicely and looks menacing on this Hk-91! Definitely something that will turn heads if you decide to take this out to the range! If you really want to take this rifle to the next level, the receiver is factory-designed to accept a Hensoldt Wetzlar 4x24 scope and claw mount.

Included with the rifle are three G3 magazines (two of which are unissued, new-in-wrap), an original G3 canvas sling, and an original cover for the flash hider to keep dirt and debris out of the bore when you're trekking across the African savanna.

Asking $2550 shipped for the lot."

I have all boxes and paperwork that comes with all the parts listed (those that came in them) as well as tools and magazine that came with the rifle. This is everything you need to start shooting tight groups in an ultra-reliable factory rifle. The trigger on these is amazing & the ergonomics of the stock is second to none. I wouldn't sell this but I'm taking the season off from long range shooting so I won't be using something like this for at least a year. I'm bummed I won't get to shoot it but someone else will be able to get more use out of it. Never fired other than whatever they do at the factory. The NEAR base was bought new and mounted. The IOR scope (newest version: FFP 3.5-18x MP-8 A-5 reticle, digital illumination, side focus, 20-22mils of reticle travel) was also purchased new and mounted with the rings and it's ready to be zero'd and used. I bought the scope because of the reviews & I wasn't disappointed. The reticle on this optic is amazing and I've read that they replace defective optics with brand new optics no questions asked. The glass is amazing on this thing and the reticle is one of the best designs available at any price. This whole setup was selected so that every part complimented the intended use.

I have a slightly used Sig Sauer “LIMITED EDITION” P238 .380ACP single action, two tone Micro 1911 with ambidextrous thumb lock! This handgun has GOLD INLAY ON THE SLIDE; On the top of the slide there is a gold inlaid coiled Copperhead snake & on the side of the slide it has “Copperhead”, also in gold inlay! The frame is a copper color with a Nitron black slide. It comes with Siglite Night Sights which are very bright as the gun was manufactured in Oct. 2010! The only reason I’m able to offer this piece at such a low price is because it has been carried and there is very minor holster wear on the corners of the slide & the slide itself. As the pictures below confirm, it is minor wear, however it can no longer be valued as a collector’s grade. My price is firm to the penny on this item, as they are a rare limited edition which was taken out of production approximately 2 years ago. It comes with the original box, papers, OWB molded poly holster, lock & original flush 6 rnd mag.
