Will be cleaned/lubed before I hand off, though it did sit in its case for a long time (been like 4 months since I last shot) so it should be good to go. Dont need to sell so I'm not gonna go lower than asking price, but I would also like for it to go to someone that can get more of a use than I do.

I bought this from the original owner who said he put about 150 rounds through it.  I have shot about 100-150 rounds through it myself.  Cleaned after every trip to the range.  The rifle is in very good to excellent condition.  There are no marks on the steel with the exception of the take down levers.  The wood is in very good shape with very slight nicks here and there.  Cosmetically, the rifle is very clean.  All original.

Around 500 +/- rounds of steel .223 55gr ammo. Looking to trade only or trade with cash. Trade interested are 3006/7mag/300mag/308 bolt guns, preferably rem 700 synthetic and a 12 gauge remington 870 super mag. Will trade for both straight up (depending on condition and value of yours) or 1 of them with cash on your end. Riffle has been shot 90 rounds with no malfunctions. It shoots around 2"" @ 100 yards with the 3moa red dot. It would get 1"" or less with a scope easily. I have $175 in ammo, $105 in mags, $90 in the red dot, $20 in the sling, and around $775 in the rifle itself. Thats about $1100 total so i would say $1000 trade value since it has had 90 rounds threw it. Let me know what you got, thanks!"

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.
The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver."

I traded for the upper today. Previous owner is original owner. Said to have never been fired but close dis-assembly and inspection revealed a tiny bit of residue on firing pin, so that it APPEARS to have been fired, but looks to have only had maybe less than 100 rounds through it. Looks barely broke in. I put 20 through it and it functioned flawlessly. Barrel is a 1:8 twist. Website is out of stock of this upper and it appears they only sell it with a 1:9 twist now, but the specs online are as follows:


    16"" 5.56 NATO Chamber
    1:9 twist rate with rifle length gas system (barrel reads 1:8 near flash hider)
    4140 Chrome Moly phosphate finished or 416R Stainless steel barrel(Has chrome moly phosphate barrel) 
    Light weight profile .625"" Diameter under the hand guard
    Gas block secured in place by dimpling the barrel
    Extended M4 feed ramps
    15"" Key Mod free floating rail 
    Includes 1 key mod rail section
    Low profile gas block secured in place by dimpling of the barrel
    Your choice of MPI Tested Carpenter 158 Mil Spec or Nickel Boron Bolt Carrier Group (has the MPI Tested Carpenter bcg)
    Assembled 100% U.S. made parts
    1 year warranty again malfunctions
    Test fired to ensure function

Includes a set up flip up backup sights and extended charging handle.

Listed price of upper is $700 but I will take $625 for it.

If you want the entire rifle, I will sell it for $800. The lower is a Palmetto State that I received from them this past tuesday, 8/18/2015. Has Magpul furniture. Functions flawlessly. It's listed price is $150, but that's before $25 shipping, $30 transfer fee(for me at Bass Pro in Nashville), and $10 background check cost. So you'd basically be paying for lower and shipping, no transfer fee cost if you bought from me. It is brand new, not even a week old.

I will not sell just the lower. I will sell just the upper for $625 or entire rifle for $800.
I will listen to offers but be reasonable and don't expect to get this rifle for free. Name's Dillan, text 731-307-733six with questions or offers"

With the 2 3/4"" shells it holds 7 rounds in the mag and 1 in the chamber. Adjustable rear ghost ring sight sitting on a picatinny rail and a high visibility orange dot front sight.

I have not tested any other loads in this other than the high power slugs and buckshot and it runs like a champ on them. I will say it does not like cheap crap like Perfecta buckshot.
