HK VP9 Pistol and Accessories

H&K was the original creator of striker-fired pistols in 1970. HK 9mm handguns are backed by more than 65 years of solid engineering, and when it comes to striker-fired pistols, no one offers a better firearm.

2-15 round mags 
Interchangeable grip panels
Superior trigger system out of the box
Trigger and hammer drop safety features
Indicator easily shows when the gun is cocked

Heckler and Koch 9mm pistols are world-renowned, and the VP9 is no exception. The simpler striker design makes this firearm highly affordable while offering all of the quality one can expect from HK."

C15A1 SPORTER. I am the second owner, never fired it, used it for my vietnam display in honor of my father. The person that owned it before me only fire one mag through it. This is set up exactly as it would have been carried in vietnam. It came with a2 butstock and grip. I replaced it with true military issue harware via colt. The butstock has no trap door in rear which is correct for period and the grip has a gold flake in the mold which is rare and correct for period. If you research this rifle you will find out that this is mostly colt with the exception of the lower. It has colt markings on the bolt and upper receiver. This was originally an original colt m16a1 that the government utilized. They were full auto. Century arms purchased these as surplus and tossed the lower auto receivers away putting a DPMS lower with their name on it via century arms. If I was going to keep this I was going to purchase a Nodak spud lower to make this 100% vietnam period. I believe the nodal spud is approx 140 unfinished. Take the hardware out of this lower and switch it over. Get it engraved with the colt markings and this would be an amazing rifle. The rifle comes with a gi sling period correct, a 1970 dated bandoleer and 4 colt mags and 4 rare m16a1 marked magazines. My dad in vietnam was a combat MP and they didn't wear ammo pouches on their waist. They put the mags in a bandoleer which you see in my photos. Anyway, awesome set up. I know what i paid for it, not sure what the market value is today. Can't find anything recent on the Web to see the value. I paid 1050.00 for the rifle not including the vietnam correct butstock and grip. I purchased that seperate off ebay. Can't remember what I paid for it. The mags and bandoleer I believe I paid around 200.00 for it. Everything is in beautiful condition. A must have for a collector, rein actor or just to shoot.  Shoot me a offer. Text me REDACTED"

The original manual is dated 2012 so I guess that was when this guy was made. Very clean with heavy canvas tote and receiver block to fit an aftermarket folding stock if you want such a thing. Dont want the block I'll knock $30 off the price and sell it on ebay.

It has the side mount quick release scope mount with new BSA Red-dot optic installed on top rail [pictured NcSTAR 4x30 compact scope sucked]. Tapco compensator and trigger. Very smooth shooter. Not at all like a military trigger. I dont know if this is aftermarket or original to the weapon.

I also have 4- new/near new Tapco 30-round magazines, two used metal 30 round unmarked steel magazines, and a 47 round polymer Wilson magazine. Also has three sets of clamps [jungle clips] to join most original double stack mags. Work fine on the steel ones here, not on the Tapcos. Gun will accept most any double stack AK mags.

Designed specifically for wild boar hunting, Winchester Razorback XT Centerfire Ammo delivers the deep penetration and maximum expansion needed for wild hogs. The one-piece, lead-free, gilding metal bullet features a beveled profile for optimum weight retention and strength to drive through a hog's tough hide and bone. Then the deep hollow point expands the Razorback XT to its maximum potential for extreme knockdown power. Powered by flash suppressed powders that reduce muzzle flash, this cartridge works great in low light hunting or after dark with night vision technology. The Razorback XT's nickel plated, re-loadable brass shell case feeds and functions smoothly in both high performance bolt-action rifles and modern sporting rifles.

This new generation CZ 75 SP-01 pistol especially adapted according to suggestions from Law Enforcement, Military and Police communities worldwide with an additional input from Team CZ shooters Angus Hobdell and Adam Tyc.

 The CZ 75 SP-01 SHADOW features:

New style sights consisting of fiber optic front and Competition Style rear promote faster and more accurate target acquisition.

Shadow is fitted with a newly redesigned hammer originating from the CZ 75 Champion. This hammer is slightly wider and has modified sear engagement for smoother release and more positive ignition.

85 Combat style slide without firing pin block helps to smooth the trigger pull and improve distance of trigger reset.

85 Combat Style trigger with over travel adjustment helps to remove excess rear ward trigger movement.

Higher cuts beneath the trigger guard and beaver tail enable a higher grip on the gun, which helps to reduce felt recoil and muzzle flip.

Lighter recoil and main springs originating from original CZ 75 Specifications help to create a smoother more consistent action.

Safeties as found on the CZ 75 SA are fitted as standard; these provide a larger surface area for better positioning of the thumb.

Extended Magazine release allows for ease of reach and more positive ejection of magazine under stressful situations.

Fully beveled magazine well, substantially improves speed and ease of reloading.

Pistol is supplied with three 19 round magazines and rubber grips. We will swap for 10 Round Magazine for appropriate states

The Kel Tec SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. This version of the SUB-2000 will accept Glock .40 S&W magazines.
The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun.
The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price.
The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16″ x 7″ to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

This little motorcycle is 174cc's of pure cool. It makes 20 HP at 9500 RPM making it the most powerful 175 engine made. I got this as a bucket of rust and bolts and turned it into what you see today. It runs, but will need some carb tuning to run great. It will also need a new front brake cable, and new tach/speedo cables. All of this is about 30 bucks. The paint was done by me and was amazing... but I spilled some gas on the tank before I had the chance to put a gas resistant coating. I did a quick repaint but didn't get around to sanding and recoating, so you may want to do that as it has some run marks. It has loads of aftermarket parts and custom made adjustable rearsets specifically for the bike. The seat is a little wonky as that was a quick job as well, so you may want to get an original off ebay. Other than that it is a fine little bike.

640,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4304640,For Sale:  DS Arms AR-15 Bull Barrel Flat Top Larue Mount,"Sacramento, California, United States","$ 1,200","Listed On: Monday, May 4, 2015",Rifles,Rock River Arms                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"An excellent condition AR-15 by DS Arms. 
It has a 20"" free-floated bull barrel that measures 0.95"" diameter across the full length.

The trigger is an excellent Rock River two-stage match type. The first stage is about 2.5 lbs and the let-off is about 4.5 lbs, very smooth. The Rock River triggers are well regarded and often used in NRA high power competition.

The handguard is a rubber overmolded type by Hogue and has one hole drilled at the front end for a sling swivel or bipod mount.

This rifle was not thrown together recently to make a few bucks. The current owner has had it for a couple years and shot it occasionally at the range. It hasn't seen any high-volume squirrel or prarie dog hunting.

The bolt is chrome plated, making it very easy to clean, and is in good condition.

The scope mount is an SPR 1.5 LT104 from Larue Tactical. It's a quality piece, made in USA and guaranteed, not an imported copy. I believe this model sells for about $225.

The scope is a Simmons Whitetail Classic, 6.5 x 20 power, with a 50mm adjustable objective lens and a standard duplex type reticle. These inexpensive scopes are a good value, and typically get good reviews from people who have bought them. Take a look at the customer comments on this model at the Midway website. The rifle may be sold without the scope and mount if you like.

With the scope and mount, the rifle weighs about 10.5 lbs. Not too heavy to carry around yet with more stability than a lightweight AR."

You can also buy elsewhere a completed RPK-74 or RPK-47 receiver or receiver blank or flat.

This is not one of those ""gimmicky, maybe collectible guns"".  To the contrary, it is a collectible as there are only 1050 available and when looking at the gun's serial number, it actually starts with ""NRA""

Besides the fact that it is a Kimber, and thus renowned quality being built in, here are some other features that this gun includes:
First and foremost, it is made in the USA
24k Gold plated and etched decorative scroll work on both sides of the slide
Custom Crimson Trace Master Series laser grips
Match Grade bushingless 4"" bull barrel

This gun is a really nice piece and is new in the box as I cannot bring myself to shoot it.
This is the sole purpose for selling this gun, as I am a shooter, not a collector.

I am a reasonable person and I will entertain reasonable cash offers and trades plus cash.

It should go without saying, but I will say it anyway.  If you are not able to legally own or posses a firearm, do not contact me.  As it stands now, if you have a current CCW AND Drivers License, we can do a bill of sale.  If I have any reason to suspect that you are not honest and up front about this, I will ask that this be done through an FFL where you will have to pass an NCIC check.

Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."
