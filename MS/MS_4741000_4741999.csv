Rifle is Sub-MOA with 168gr BTHP at 2800 FPS. Easy 1 hole 5 shot groups at 100yds. NO issues whatsoever with this rifle. I purchased from the original owner 1.5 years ago. I have shot a total of 10 rounds through it -:) lol. I never intended to let it go ever but I have a purchase coming very soon so cash needs to be generated. Previous owner grouped .780 @ 300 yards!!!

Cash Price is $1100 for the RIFLE ALONE (bi-pod and everything included except scope/rings for 1,100) or $1750 with the Vortex Viper FFP 2.5-10x32 (scope is NEW and unused. Only Mounted for the photo) with box, paper work etc. Warne 30mm rings included. You can also do a 3-9x40 Trijicon Accupoint w/Green Triangle reticle if you prefer it to the Vortex (same price either way).

Really only need cash on this one since I am only selling to make another purchase. HOWEVER, I have listed a few items below I could possibly swap for plus cash if someone is interested in the Entire package. I will have a few other items up for sale so whichever goes first....I will keep the other -:)

I love the Bond Arms. Best made Derringer out there. All stainless construction, and built like a tank. I wouldn't depend on it as a personal protection daily carry, but they do make a really nice back up, boot gun. These are more a novelty, and just plain fun to shoot. This one is chambered in .45 long colt, and also shoots .410 shotgun rounds. You can purchase many different calibers, and easy to change between them. Simply remove barrel, and install anything from .22 up to 45acp, and anything in-between. You can purchase barrels from Bond Arms, or get them on Ebay for around $100 for other calibers. These are cool little hand cannons.  Includes the leather holster that I had custom made to my specs. 

I am not looking to sell this hand cannon, but would like a .45 Long Colt Single Action Revolver. Prefer Ruger, but will consider others. Might consider double action, but NO Taurus Judges (Have one already). Will consider S&W Governor though, but prefer a single action ""cowboy"" revolver. 

All local & federal laws apply. This is considered a Firearm, so PP or CPL required. I am a CPL carrier so transfer on my end is easy, and you will need to comply on your part as well."

Short review:  works GREAT outdoors, and indoors where the light is directly overhead (e.g., the shooting range), but did not provide much benefit inside my house,where the lighting is very poor (I don't have overhead lights, but floorlamps).  These are an improvement over the factory plastic sights, but the tritium TFO sights are better.

These do not require a gunsmith to install.  There are plenty of videos on YouTube showing how to install them DIY."

It has the deluxe stock that`s adjustable for length of pull as well as height on the cheek comb, so you can really get it adjusted to fit your needs. The scope is a Vortex 6-25 power of magnification, it has duplex cross hairs. I purchased this early last spring around Feb. or Mar. I believe. The original owner who I purchased it from said it has had around 200 rnds. fired to date and this is still the same as I have not fired it myself.

I have seen these guns actually sell in the $5000-$6000 range in this condition. I unfortunately just need a quick sale because I have a baby on the way. Make offer. 

Has vintage redfield scope on it. Original sights are included as well. 

This gun has been in a gun sock within a wool case for the many many years.  It looks as if the gun has only seen light for a brief period of time to show off to a friend or family member. 

Everything matches on gun, all original. Will send additional high resolution pictures if you message me. The resolution on uploaded pictures doesn't do gun justice. 

Will include a few boxes of .30-06 ammo, but I've never personally shot it and do not recommend you do so either. It is too pretty of a gun to shoot as far as I'm concerned.

Taken from Marlin forum:
The Goose Gun

Introduced in 1962 as the standard Model 55 was being phased out, this is the ultimate evolution of the 12-gauge Marlin bolt gun.  A 36-inch long (yes, the same length as a yardstick) full-choked cylinder bore barrel; it was nearly five feet long. It's receiver was factory tapped for aftermarket sights and it was equipped with double extractors. This version has been in more or less permanent production for 35-years and was the last model shotgun still made by Marlin when they stopped production in 1997. Today these go for anywhere from $200-$400 on the open market depending on condition and age as referenced in recent sales in online gun marketplaces. (2006)"

594,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4741594,For Sale:  SCAM !!! Colt anaconda is a SCAM.,"Lyons, Savannah, Georgia",FREE,"Listed On: Thursday, October 1, 2015",Rifles,Colt,no type,no type,no type,"Below I have listed a little of what happened when I contacted the guy with the colt anaconda posted. I only included a couple brief examples of how I knew it was a scam but have about 30 or so other tell tell signs he is a scam. If you want to know or at curious please text me at REDACTED or call after 6 and I can tell you more. I did not include everything because I didn't want him to know the things to change and get better at scamming people on armslist. I do a lot of business on armslist and to see a scammer on here pisses me off. I had this happen on another site not to long ago and before I sent money I luckily realized it was a scam and told him he had messed with the wrong gun nut. That I had the resources and could and would track him down and pay him a visit. The guy ended up admitting it and gave me a full run down. Told me everything about how these scams work and everything. I know most people will not send money but some old timers I know personally have been gotten by these scams. People shouldn't have to be hurt just because they are trusting. It's sad that used to when someone told you something they meant it but today's technology connects us to people all over the world who will not blink at the opportunity to steal from a trusting person. Now back to this situation.  The colt anaconda I have seen listed on here is a scam. I talked to the guy for a while. The first thing I will point out is when you do contact him he will reply via email or text if you provide your phone number. But pay attention to the broken English this guy uses. When I spoke with him via text his text were awkward and at first I couldn't put my finger on it. The bells went off but I didn't know why. Now days we are so used to abbreviating or shortning words in text or using slang. So at first I figured it was just that. But then I realized that's what was wrong. There was no slang or abbreviation words would just be missing. But what was there was just, well TOO proper. Almost like school proper. Then I asked the guy about meeting and he said he couldn't meet because he did not live in Georgia but would be willing to send via FFL. I asked where he was and he told me he was in Arkansas. I told him that that wasn't an issue because I was going to be ""Passing through Arkansas on my way to Texas to visit family and would love to meet then. Well then it got really strange. He said of course he would have no problem meeting but I would have to western union him the money firs to prove I was a serious buyer. And that's when I became 100% positive. I have done a ton of business on arms list and FFL transfers. And never in my life have I ever heard of someone requiring you to send a western union to show you were serious before you meet. I offered other solutions but he wasn't hearing it. I even offered to send the money via a cashiers check through the bank or through the mail or a pay pal transfer. But he said no to all of them. Now I knew long before this that it was a scam but wanted to string him along. But he said why not just send the western union you can send it to Arkansas and I can only pick it up in Arkansas. Well here's a clue people if you were not already aware if you send someone a western union it does not matter where you put the destination. They can pick that money up anywhere they have a western union. I know this because I had a family member that fell for a scam and sent money to California that when he went to western union later they told him the money was picked up in Nigeria. Which is probably where this guy is. If they have the transfer number they really don't even need an ID to prove they are the person you sent the money to. Especially in these shady countries known for scams. With just that number they can pick the money up anywhere. I can't tell you what to do but myself I will not use western union unless I am sending the money to family. Anyone selling a high end gun on one of these sites that are legit are gun people and gun people know how stuff works so if they seem to not have a clue ask more questions or even lie to them and see if they catch it or go along with it and give you an excuse. I told the guy that my FFL would do a cash on delivery. When the gun gets to my location They would call me I go up there and have to pay them whatever he is requesting in order to pick the gun up and they would send the money back to him however he wanted to receive it western union or whatever. He said he couldn't do that."

The only thing included in this package that is not TOP OF THE LINE, is the Sight Mark CCO, which is a clone of the USGI M-68 CCO also sold on the civilian market as the Aimpoint Comp 2. The rifle is a Sig Sauer 516 patrol. Rifle is all mil spec to those who know what that entails (ie 1:7 twist, Mil Spec buffer tube, 1913 piccatinny, 5.56x45mm NATO, ect) these rifles sell for between $1500 and $1800 new. This one has visited the range one time where I ran 4, 30 round magazines totalling 121 rounds of m855 NATO green tip ammo through it. This is not your average AR15. It is short stroke piston driven, with adjustable gas valve to allow use of subsonic or lower power ammunition to aide in sound dampening when using a suppressor. The piston makes for a more reliable closed gas system and overall an easier to clean rifle as it contains the gas and fouling in the piston and under the handgau rd as opposed to DI rifles which blow that fouling directly into the bolt carrier and reciever area. Ultra reliable in any condition, these rifles are incredible. With the rifle I've included 5 magazines, 1 pmag, 1 lancer smoke transparent mag, and 3 steel usgi mags made by OKay. Also, sig sauer BUIS ( folding back up iron sights), a sig sauer 2 point sling with quick release mounts, upgraded Magpul MOE-SL stock (used by Special Forces), Magpul MOE- VFG foregrip, Magpul billet aluminum oversized trigger gaurd, sight mark red dot sight with batteries, a US Army issued SureFire M952 weapons light with ARMS quick release mount and both intermittent and pressure switch cap with batteries, and a Sight Rite laser boresighter for 223/556. Rifle will come in factory box with all factory information and I have included 120 rounds of m855 penetrator ammunition. My asking price is very firm for cash. I will accept partial trades for sig sauer, H&k, glock, springfield, and FN handguns chambered in 9x19mm or .45 ACP ONLY. The only trades I will take that don't include cash are a Kriss Vector carbine, H&k Mk23, Sig 716, or a nice Springfield Armory M1A. It never hurts to ask though. I prefer text or phone call at REDACTED. Valid TX ID, CHL, LEO or military/veteran ID is required, NO EXCEPTIONS. Thanks for your time, God Bless, and Happy Shooting. -Cory

Now I am selling it with or without the Leupold 1.5x-5x VX-III dangerous game scope and quick disconnect rings.  I had the barrel shortened and re-crowned and the open sights put on it for back up.  This is a great shooting rifle that is lightweight, but not overly bad on recoil.  I also have ammo to go with it.  The Rifle is $750 and the Scope and quick detach mounts that will return to zero are $300 to add to it and I can throw in some of the ammo with the purchase of the scope and mounts with the rifle.

I have (2) Ruger Precision Rifles. (1) in 308 with 79 bullets through it, and (1) New in Box 6.5 Creedmoor. I couldn't find the Creedmoor so I bought the 308. My special order for the 6.5 finally came in but I don't need both guns. I'm so happy with the 308 that I decided that which ever sells first, I'll keep the other. This gun is REALLY hard to get your hands on and they are selling online for $1600+ for the 6.5 and then add CC fees, Shipping, & FFL Fees. The 308s are going for $1400+. 

So... I'm firm on the cash prices of $1550 for the(New) 6.5 Creedmoor and $1300 for the 308 which isn't even broken in yet. No Trades Please! I bought the $308 for over $1400 (2) weeks ago and have properly started the barrel breakin. It's gonna be a shooter once I get the load right. So far with Berger VLD 215 Hybrids and 38.2 grains of Varget... she's doing .8x moa @ 200 yards and that just on the first load test. I'm sure it's going to be a sub .5 MOA gun when I find the node. Both 6.5 and 308 come stock (no scope or fat grip... will remove if 308 sells and put the new stock grip on). FIRST ONE WITH THE MONEY FOR EITHER GUN GETS IT.
