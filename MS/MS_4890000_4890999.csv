The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.STRONG, LIGHT WEIGHT CONSTRUCTIONThe Kel-Tec PMR-30 weighs only 13.5 oz. empty. It's slide and barrel are 4140 steel and frame is precistion machined from 7075 aluminum. The PMR-30 grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Dual opposing extractors improve reliability, heel magazine release aids with magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight allows easy windage adjustment. The PMR-30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.LOW RECOIL, RAPID FOLLOWUP SHOTSPMR-30 uses a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system that seamlessly adjusts to fit the pressure of the cartridge. Recoil buffer and dual captive co-axial recoil springs combined with the crisp, short-reset trigger allow high rate of aimed fire. The barrel is fluted for light weight and effective heate disssipation. A picatinny rail is provided for mounting lights and lasers.COMES WITH TWO 30-ROUND MAGAZINESThe Kel-Tec PMR-30 and two Zytel magazines with 60 rounds total of powerful 22WMR (70% more kinetic energy than 22LR) weigh only 25.5 oz, far less than a ruger Mk III (34 oz) or a Browning Buckmark (36 oz) with one 10-round magazine of 22LR each.Free layaway option available.  I sell new firearms with full manufacter's warranties for less then many dealers are asking for used guns.

It is the ultimate tactical style 22, it blows away the S&W MP15-22, and all others. If you are not familiar with these check out the link below. MSRP on it is $670 from Ruger and they are hard to come by. This one will hold its value and no 10/22 collection is complete without one. All factory built with standard 10/22 reliability inside a high quality Nordic Components aluminum chassis. Super accurate rifle, with a true free floated heavy barrel straight from Ruger. This is the better model with the threaded barrel and collapsable stock (not the California legal version). Also has Ruger brand flip-up sights. Never been fired, comes brand new in box with everything, and still in the plastic. Takes all 10/22 mags and even internal upgrades, because it has all standard 10/22 internal components. I hate to let this rifle go, but I will for the right offer. Mainly looking for a high end handgun for it, but I will consider all offers for any other cool/interesting trades that you may have. *Not really looking for a cash sale or I would have listed it that way, but since I get asked constantly for a cash price if you just want to buy it outright then THINK MSRP (see listed above). So you don't need to ask ""how much"", that is my cash price.LINK: http://www.ruger.com/products/sr22Rifle/specSheets/11134.html"

Nikon P-223 3x32cvAR RiflescopesThe new P-223 Series broadens Nikon’s line-up of precision optics for AR rifles. Designed for extreme sighting speed and superior long-range accuracy for AR platform rifles and .223 cartridges, the P-223’s entire optical system is fully multicoated for extreme brightness and provides light transmission up to 98%.The P-223 3x32 Carbine is an incredibly compact optic designed specifically for fast-handling, shorter barrel ARs. The all-new, fast-sighting BDC Carbine reticle was developed specifically for the 3x32 and .223 Remington cartridge to make engaging targets quickly and accurately both in-close and out to 600 yards. With tactical-style turrets with Zero-Reset feature to simplify field adjustments, the 3x32, like all Nikon AR riflescopes, is optimized for use with Nikon Spot On Ballistic Match Technology. Spot On allows you to discover all of the exact aiming points on the BDC carbine reticle for your exact ammunition and load.

22 LR (still cheap to shoot)

Two magazines – one 10 round flush and one 10 round extension

3 and 5 inch barrels

Small enough for conceal carry.

Some say a 22 is not a good self defense caliber, but I guarantee, a shot or 10 quick shots will deter even a bear.

I've seen these shoot through a two by four and half way into the next two by four.  That shoud do the trick.

What's better?  This or nothing. Or, something that you or your loved ones won't or can't carry (like a 9mm).

This pistol is great for teaching due to its low noise and no recoil (not snappy) pain and it's easy to rack the slide for those with weaker or painful hands.

Nickel finish is better than black and looks better.

Includes: HP22A Sport/Target pistol with 3'' barrel & 5'' extended VR barrel & black checkered grips, one extended 10-rnd. magazine & one standard 10-rnd. magazine, pistol lock, and custom-fitted, locking, transport case. 

Some websites offer this at good prices, but you'll still have to pay taxes, ffl cost and shipping.

This gun is 114 years old and still running strong, it has the octagon barrel and it is chambered in .22 WRF. The rifle has been professionally refinished to ensure longevity. Considering how old this rifle is the bore is decent, it still has rifling but is worn. The action is clean and ready to be used, it is a fully complete rifle, no missing sights or screws. It feeds bullets with no issues at all, very smooth pump action. The 22 WRF ammo is widely available and considered the early 22 magnum. The 1890 was the gallery gun used in carnivals, since the 1890 depression most boys got a single shot Flobert, but some saved for the 1890. Great chance to own an iconic .22 pump! SN#101002

Looking to sell a blued finish Ruger MK III Target. It's in great condition and will come with 3 magazines, a 525 round value pack of Federal 22lr, and the original box/paperwork. I'm the second owner and it's probably seen around 1,000 rounds in it's life. Works great, I just don't shoot it much and I'm looking to buy a 9mm. 

Asking $325 for everything. If you're interested you can contact me through email, or call/text me at REDACTED. Thanks for looking."
