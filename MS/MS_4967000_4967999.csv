Up for sale is my 1895 Chilean Loewe Berlin Mauser in 7x57 (7mm Mauser) for $300 OBRO. The gun is in perfect working condition with ALL matching serial numbers. I have owned the gun for 10 years and only ever put 4 rounds through it to test it using Federal ammo. The gun is VERY clean with no pitting, rust, warps, cracks, or breaks. The bore is very shiny and kept oiled.

The gun has been taken completely apart by my qualified and professional gunsmith. He went through it, cleaned it in detail, greased the contact points on the trigger/sear, oiled the necessary spots with CLP, cleaned the action, cleaned the magazine box, cleaned up the barrel, and spent two hours carefully wiping down and cleaning the stock. This was after I obtained it, cleaned it myself, and shot it. The gun has always been stored in my Liberty safe in my temperature controlled house. It is as original as they come and VERY clean for its age. This thing has been gone through meticulously and doesn't have an ounce of dirt/cosmoline/gunk in it. Even the inside of the bolt is spotless. All in all it has always been well loved and has the original cleaning rod.

I am asking $300 OBRO. After months of watching them on here and GunBroker it would appear that in this condition the average sale price is $350 - $400, sometimes going as high as $450. It kills me to sell this thing but being that its my only 7mm Mauser I can't say I have an interest in buying ammo for it and my safe is almost completely full. Its been a safe queen for years and only ever removed to be cleaned. If you're a Mauser guy, this one is for you."

Time for some toys to go.

This is a great full-size .45. Comes with 3 Factory 10-round mags, 37 rounds of Hornady Custom 45+P 230gr XTP hollow points, the Factory H&K canvas case and a G-Code holster with paddle attachment. 

This still has the factory blank tall sights, and the G-Code holster is designed specifically to give clearance for these sights. The mags show wear to the finish, and the gun itself has holster wear and usage wear. Being realistic, this gun is likely in the 3k-4k round count range, and is good for more than three times that. Absolutely no FTFs, FTEs, etc etc while I've had it, and eats any .45 I've ran in it, and I'm cheap.

I do require a bill of sale at time of purchase (CYA for both you and I), and will either want to see a TN HCP or a TN DL at time of purchase. I'm more than happy to meet in my suburb, or anywhere near the Walker Springs Walmart. Cash only please, unless you'd liked to trade me a years worth of daycare."

Make: Winchester 
Model: Model 70 XTR (push feed) 
Caliber: .300 Weatherby Magnum 
Scope: I’m unsure of the make / model of this scope. 6x24-50mm (the picture closely resembles a Leupold but it isn’t) It is a very solid rifle scope and hold it’s zero. 

Extras: Leupold bases and scope rings, (20) rounds Hornady SST 150 grain ammo, soft case.

Additional Info: This rifle was manufactured in the early 90s and in very nice condition, jeweled bolt in VGC, great bore; crisp rifling and accurate. The barrel has been “Mag-na-Ported” to reduce muzzle flip during recoil and a Pachmayr Decelerator recoil pad has been added. 

This rifle has normal use and in VGC, rifle bore is very good as is bluing and stock finish. No more than (60) rounds have been fired from this rifle."

The V1 is one of the hardest to find and most sought after P30's, below is an explination of the trigger:

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol"

I had some trijicon HD night sights ($130 just for the sights) installed on day 1 and they look great easy to see at night and day because of the black ledge and orange front dot. The gun has seen maybe 200-300 rounds as it got quite expensive to shoot .45 for me. I cleaned it after every range visit. Gun is immaculate with all original paperwork, accesories, and case.

I'd prefer an officers or commander but anything will work.  Also prefer stainless but blue is OK as long as it's all steel; no alloy frames.  Missing parts are OK as long as you have frame, slide, and barrel.  If the barrel is shot out, I may still be interested.  So if you've got a beater, send me a picture and your asking price.  

Due to the loads of stupid offers I've received in response to this ad, I'd like to make a few things crystal clear:
- this is not your opportunity to display your self perceived gun trading wizardry by trying to pass your junked up 1911 clone that you ""melted"" with a Dremel and used JB Weld to get the sights on on to me as ""customized"" or ""super rare.""
- I will pay wholesale or better depending on condition.  If you have a ""Frankengun"" I will pay what it's worth to me.  But...if you've shopped your gun around to various dealers and were told it's worth considerably less than you had hoped, I'm probably going to tell you the same thing.
- I'm pretty sure I'm not stupid and just because you put a Wilson (or any other brand), part on your gun doesn't make it custom.
- I will not cheat you.  Please show me the same respect."

As seen in the pictures, the gun is in very good condition. There is a slight sign of wear on the front of slide from being carried in a cloth holster but is very minimal and almost not noticeable. The barrel has slight signs of wear from racking and re-racking carry loads in out of the chamber. Other than that I have fired 100 rounds through the gun. The chamber and bore of the barrel is immaculate and in new condition. The slide has no scratches, dents or discoloring. Sitting on top of the slide are Tru Dot green night sights and light up bright in low light or dark conditions. Comes with two 10 round magazines; I do not have the box for it.

***VIA AAC wbsite***
A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. 

The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition."

The pen guns have rapidly and steadily increased in value due to the low supply and high demand of the item. It is common to see the more common 22 caliber range from $1100 all the way to $1600 with this being the 25 caliber it can be of much greater value depending on the collectors prefrence to model. I am looking to get $850 for my R.J.  Braverman silver 25 cal. Pen Gun . Just to own this unique firearm is worth  the asking price of $850.
