And if you are interested, PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH ON IT and learn about it first. The last guy who came to look at it wasted a lot of money on gas and came hours out of his way to look at it for nothing because he thought the extractor was broken. It does not extract the ammo when you rack the bolt manually, none of them do. Racking the bolt is for clearing jams and stove pipes if they ever occur. They need the pressure from the spent round to eject properly. You must fire it to cycle it correctly. IT WILL FIRE CHEAP OR QUALITY AMMO WITH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL, although it prefers high velocity ammo, it specifically states that on the receiver as you can see in the picture. I will show you exactly what I mean if you do not understand. Im sure he's going to flag my posts from now on, but THERE IS NOTHING WRONG AT ALL WITH THIS WEAPON and im more than happy to let you shoot it if you have the cash in hand. His ignorance and loss, your gain."

This SP2022 can be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action-Only configuration through the unique integral fire control unit, and it is packaged with an extra grip plate.

Just let me know what colors you like and the gun/ideas you have. I also do field stripping, cleaning an bore cleaning for rifles. No handguns please unless it's a glock or Springfield XD. I can also install some AR and AK47 parts, and other guns. Hand guards, quad rails, upgraded pins, triggers, etc. Can help with anything I am capable of. Can also do barrel polishing and some rust removal!

Product Details:
Shoot silently without the suppressor!

This is a cartridge that contains no gunpowder. The little 20g. bullet is solely propelled by the powerful Eley priming mix. For this reason, it does not generate any significant pressure. Due to the lack of noise when fired, the .22 Colibri may be shot indoors, even in the living room, provided a proper back stop is available. The .22 Colibri may be used to eliminate pests such as rats. It may be fired in any .22 LR rifle or pistol, however, it will not cycle the slide or bolt of semi-automatic guns. Has a Solid Point Made of Lead.

Bullet details....40-grain copper plated lead round nose bullet. Screaming hot and hard-hitting! Gives 1470 fps with a 40 grain bullet. Normal High Velocity 22LR ammo goes about 1250 fps with a 40 gr bullet. ""Hyper Velocity"" ammo uses a lighter bullet to go even faster: (For example, the hyper velocity CCI Stinger uses a 32 gr bullet and goes 1640 fps.) So, the Aguila Interceptor delivers the hard impact of the heavier 40 grain bullet at a velocity almost as high as Stinger--an excellent combination of knock down and trajectory. 5% more energy than CCI Velocitor at the same bullet weight and the same energy as CCI Stinger with a 25% heavier bullet! Perfect fodder for semi-auto pistols and rifles that need high energy for reliable cycling. Eley Primed! Ballistics Information: •Muzzle Velocity: 1470 fps •Muzzle Energy: 192 ft. lbs.

Bullet details....40-grain copper plated lead round nose bullet. Screaming hot and hard-hitting! Gives 1470 fps with a 40 grain bullet. Normal High Velocity 22LR ammo goes about 1250 fps with a 40 gr bullet. ""Hyper Velocity"" ammo uses a lighter bullet to go even faster: (For example, the hyper velocity CCI Stinger uses a 32 gr bullet and goes 1640 fps.) So, the Aguila Interceptor delivers the hard impact of the heavier 40 grain bullet at a velocity almost as high as Stinger--an excellent combination of knock down and trajectory. 5% more energy than CCI Velocitor at the same bullet weight and the same energy as CCI Stinger with a 25% heavier bullet! Perfect fodder for semi-auto pistols and rifles that need high energy for reliable cycling. Eley Primed! Ballistics Information: •Muzzle Velocity: 1470 fps •Muzzle Energy: 192 ft. lbs.

There are two small handling marks on the wood grips, but otherwise this gun is pristine.  This was someone's home defense gun, as it shows very little signs of wear and absolutely no abuse.  This gun has the pinned barrel and recessed cylinder.  If you know anything about S&W, then you know this gun is worth every penny I am asking, and quality revolvers of this vintage are getting scarce so the prices are rising.  

I know what I have here, so don't haggle with me over the price.  I don't want to spend my entire weekend emailing you 100 times, answering all your questions only to have you tell me you want to think about it and never hear from you again.  Don't waste my time with all that.  If you want to see the gun in person, I will meet you at a spot in southwest Springfield of my choosing.

The purchase price of this gun is $600.  No trades.  Serious buyers can email me one time with all their questions in one email.  Sorry to be such a hard@$$ but I am tired of people wasting my time."

The 40 of course is original to the pistol, the 357 and 9mm are lone Wolf Conversions.  The 357Sig is threaded and the 9mm is extended and compensated.  The difference between the Gen 2.5 (the first Glock 27, there was no Gen 1 or 2 Glock 27) and Gen 3 Glock is that there are no ridges between the front finger grooves of the grip.  It has a velvet grip wrap installed, but can easily be removed (i like the feel).

Comes with green Fobus holster, 3 9 round 40/357 mags and 1 KCI 9mm 15 round, tupperware glock box that is original to the pistol, manual, loader, cleaning rod and brush.

The 357Sig and 9mm (never fired) conversion barrels are $125 each through the Lone Wolf website.

I can trade (preferred) or sell as a whole or just as you like.  So if you want the gun only, or the gun and both barrels, or the package let me know.  The gun has been carried and holstered so the slide is worn but I can put you in touch with a local gentleman that will duracoat the slide only in flat black for less than $50.

Price:  Glock 27 only $450 (with box, contents and holster).  357Sig threaded barrel $125.  9mm compensated barrel $125........3 guns in one.  To change caliber just change the barrel.  Also have 200 rounds of 357Sig for $100 available."

I have an absolutely incredible rifle for sale...It is Spikes Tactical's 10th anniversary edition SL-15 (Spikes limited 15). This rifle was developed over a period of 2 years and was released to a select group of retailers in late 2011. Only 100 completed SL-15's were ever built by Spikes, so this rifle is as rare as it is WICKED!! No detail was overlooked in terms of design and functionality! It has a fully fluted Lothar Walther barrel and a titanium Dynacomp flash suppressor, and the receiver and internals are coated with nickel boron (NP3) for superior protection and a constant state of lubricity...just to name a few features.  It is truly an amazing piece of hardware that will only increase in value! When these were released about 1.5 years ago, they were sold for $2500...now that they are all but impossible to get...they have greatly risen in value. The most recent listing I was able to find for a completed SL-15 was on gunbroker about 6 months ago and it went for $3700...I am asking $2850 for mine...(which is exactly what I have in it). Mine is un-fired, which was very hard because this gun begs to be shot!! It comes with a large black soft molle case with spikes logo and the American flag embroidered on it...the manual and dog tags that come with the SL-15 are still sealed in the package. I have the orange tags from spikes indicating the name of builder as well as the date of build. I also have emails from the chief operating officer at spikes that show my SL-15 rifle (via serial #) is 1 of the 100 rifles made and built by spikes tactical for their 10th anniversary. I am including a link to a facebook page that is devoted to this rifle...there are a few paragraphs that contain great details on the gun itself as well as 20 or 30 really good pics...please contact me via email if you're interested...I will also take partial trade on a good .45acp handgun...thanks for looking.  copy and paste the link below for more info and pics.

Ugly as it is, ya gotta love it. Easy to work on and, because of its simple innards and “Micro-Groove” rifling, ridiculously dependable and accurate.

And it MIGHT just be the ultimate SHTF weapon: easy to take apart, easy to feed and 500 rounds of  22 lr takes up a lot less space than any other caliber in your backpack.  And, with or without a scope, a good Model 60 is a tack-driver. An autoloader that fires every time you pull the trigger

So... do you have one lying around? Pull it out. Take a look at it. There's promise in that old hunk of metal.

Save BIG BUCKS. Instead of going out and buying something in this picked-over, over-priced, crazy seller's market, turn your old Marlin into firearm to be reckoned with.

Bring us your old, fuddy-duddy plinker from the 60's and we'll turn it into a smooth-firing, gorgeous hunk of perfection. It'll be so cool-looking people at the range will politely ask you what the hell that IS you're shooting.

We'll start with a custom-laminated stock in your favorite color and style. Thumbhole, Monte Carlo or Sniper. 

Then we'll get rid of all the nicks, scratches and chips by restoring the factory finish on the receiver and the barrel.

Then we'll thoroughly dis-assemble the action and the bolt, replacing all the worn parts and replacing the old, worn-out springs from the 60's with custom 21st-century chromium silicon high-performance springs (which don't weaken or bend over time).

We'll re-condition or replace the feed throat and recondition the magazine and feed tube.

Then, we'll micro-finish all the interior “friction” surfaces micro-finished for smoother, quieter operation.

Then we'll install a new LARGER E-Z-grip tactical charging handle (see pics) so your fingers don't slip off that old charging handle like they used to.

Scope? No scope? Optical? Red Dot? Iron sights? Your choice. Just tell us what your preference is and we'll zero it in at 50 or even 100 yards. You choose which. 

Then we'll supply you with a couple of our own custom SpeedLoaders that'll let you reload your 14 - or 17 – round tube magazine (whichever model yours happens to be) faster than your buddy with a Ruger 10/22 ever could. You'll be firing again while HE's still mashing cartridges into his itty-bitty magazine with his thumbs (don't get us wrong; we LOVE Rugers – and have several – but in the .22 rifle category, we think the tube-fed Marlin's got just a little bit of an edge).

And we can do all that for less than the cost of a new rifle.

Sorry – if YOUR Marlin's an AMC, can't help you there. But you gotta classic...

Will consider trades for a nice Glock or S&W handgun (especially looking for a gen 4 G26) plus cash. Shoot me an offer...worst I can say is no. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for looking"

 .40 S&W 100 rds 6.00
 .45 ACP 100 rds 7.90
 If you want it cleaned and polished it I will do it for .02 a round.

 I'll ship it to your front door by USPS priority mail. I use the ""if fits it ships"" priority mail boxes: You can ship twice as much 9mm as .45 acp in the same box, but generally as a rule:
 100-500 pcs will cost 5.80 to ship.
 500-2000 pcs will cost 12.65 to ship.
 2000-4000 pcs will cost 16.50 to ship.

 Your welcome to mix and match any quantity of any size. Example:
 500 pcs each of, 9mm, .40 S&W and .45ACP = 1500 pcs and would ship for 12.65.

 If you reload several sizes, than you will do well here, You can mix your numbers any way you want.

 Payment: I prefer PAY-PAL, but I have a store front business and take credit card orders over the phone every day but Sunday and if need be will take a money order. If you prefer a personal check that is fine also, but it will delay your shipment till it clears the bank. 

 Swap: I love to swap. I am a gun enthusiast, re-loader, hunter, and all around outdoorsman. I will swap you for any gun you are not using, or ammo you have no gun to shoot it out of anymore, or about anything else. I like it all. I am a fair trader and will give you fair market value on whatever you might have to trade. All you can do is ask, and I’ll I can say is yes, or no, but it doesn’t hurt to ask.

 E-mail me at: mwandrla@yahoo.com and I’ll be glad to give you any information you may want including my phone number to call me at.

 Thank you, Mitch."
