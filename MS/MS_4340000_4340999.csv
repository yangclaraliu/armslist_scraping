Vortex Viper PST Rifle Scope 1-4x24mm Illuminated TMCQ (MRAD) Reticle - Tactical Turrets

The Viper PST (Precision Shooting Tactical) riflescope boasts features associated with top-tier riflescopes, yet comes in at a street price under the $1,000 mark. Matching reticle and turret measurements allow accurate, fast dialing of shots. The one-piece 30mm tube, precision-machined from a single solid block of aircraft-grade 6061-T6 aluminum, offers ample windage and elevation adjustment. Born from an intimate understanding of riflescope design, forward-thinking engineering, and open ears to a market incredibly vocal about what it wants in a riflescope, the Viper PST series delivers the performance and features tactical shooters demand at an economical price. 

Features
Extra-low dispersion (XD) glass increases resolution and color fidelity, resulting in crisp, sharp images.
Proprietary coatings increase light transmission with multiple anti-reflective coatings on all air-to-glass surfaces.
Second Focal Plane Reticle retains the same ideally-sized appearance at all magnification levels. Reticle sub-tensions used for estimating range, holdover and wind drift correction are accurate at the highest magnification.
Glass-etched Reticle is protected between two layers of glass for optimum durability and reliability.
Illuminated Reticle provides precise aiming under low-light conditions.
Waterproof, shockproof, and fog proof!
Precision force spring system for maximum repeatability and easy adjustment.
Precision glide erector system ensures smooth movement through the magnification range under the harshest conditions
MAG-View fiber optic inserts provide a highly visible reference for fast indentifcation of the magnification setting.
Radius bar fiber-optic insert on turrets provides a highly visible and tactile reference point for turret rotation.
Fast focus eye-piece!


AR-PEPR QD Scope Mount

The Burris AR-PEPR 30 millimeter Quick Detach Scope Mount with Picatinny Tops make it easy to gear up for different applications or shooting disciplines. The PEPR stands for Proper Eye Position Ready for combat. The ring bases are milled as a single, tough unit. The top of the rings feature the Picatinny rails for mounting additional accessories. The two Quick Detach levers make it easy to change optics or switch to iron sights and still maintain return to zero reliability.

Can be used as a handheld unit or with the included headmount.  Has been used in the house for a total of maybe 30 minutes over the couple of times I played with it.  It's a pretty astounding piece of tech especially for the price.  It amplifies the lowest ambient light to a useful image and with the built in infrared emitter it can be used in absolute darkness.  The only thing that kept me from listing this as ""like new"" is the fact I elongated the mounting holes in the head mount so I could angle the unit to line up better with my eye (see the 3rd picture).  Once it is tightened down it won't move and the modification in no way alters the function.  While I'm on the subject of pictures, all the pictures are of the actual item I'm selling except for the first one which is a stock photo.

I’m only selling because I need to replace my HVAC so I am not interested in trades. I have the DD hard case as well as most of the packaging for everything else as well to go with it. For an additional cost, I also have a Pelican IM3100 Storm case and a Blackhawk Sportster Modular Weapons case with pouches. Both the rifle and upper have been stored in these instead of the factory case. I also have 556 and 300 blackout ammo that can be sold with it.

Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product. TECHNOLOGY We use the same grade steel used in making cannon barrels — for its rifle barrels. Using the famous HK cold hammer forging process, this advanced technology manufacturing produces a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end.

All guns are in great condition with low round counts. 
There is no specific brand of dirtbike I am looking for. I just want something that is mechanically sound, that will serve we well trailriding, and starts up and rides every time.
I can spend a little cash as well to get me to a certain price if the guns dont add up as well. 
Please email for pictures of specific guns but as I said, they are all new so looking up a stock photo will show you the same gun. 
Thanks! Looking forward to seeing what you have!"

Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.

I’d prefer to sell them together as a matched pair for $1,000 total, but I’ll sell them individually for $525 per gun.

Each of these two G43’s has only 13 rounds fired through it (to verify function of each gun and each magazine). As expected of Glock pistols, they both performed flawlessly.  Then I cleaned them and they went back in the box.  Otherwise, they are brand new and have not been carried so they have no wear marks or scratches. 

These feel great in the hand and are ideal for concealed carry.  You’ll especially like the Glock trigger...they’re sweet shooters and very accurate.

Each of these comes in its original factory box with all paperwork and all other items from the factory including unopened test fire envelope, both factory mags (one with pinkie extension and one with the original flat baseplate), mag-loader, childproof lock w/two keys, plus the Glock cleaning brush & rod. 

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TN driver’s license or permit.

Cash only please.  Once again, I prefer to sell them together as a matched pair for $1,000 total, but I’ll sell them individually for $525 each.  I’m not looking for a trade or low-ball offers.

Besides being light, small and concealable, it offers easy use, adjustable sights, an ultra-reliable low-recoil mechanism and a tough, durable finish that--with proper care--will give you a virtual lifetime of service. Weighing only 11.5oz unloaded, this double-action-only (DAO) pistol is comfortable and unobtrusive to carry, no matter your preferred mode. The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts. The Pico is soft-recoiling and makes target recovery lightning-quick after every shot, thanks to its minimal barrel tilt. This feature also makes feeding utterly reliable, even with more open hollowpoint designs or the hotter .380 commercial loads. This means that when you need it for concealed carry or home protection, the Pico will always deliver the performance you expect of a Beretta. Like its slightly bigger brother the Nano, the Pico is engineered to be easy and intuitive to take apart and reassemble. Its heart is a serialized modular chassis, meaning that the frame can be easily swapped to accommodate the user's preferences. Shipped with a storage case and two 6+1 stainless steel magazines (one flush, one with grip extension), the Pico features adjustable, quick-change sights with no gunsmithing required. It also offers ambidextrous magazine release, as well as a super-low-profile slide-release lever to keep the slide open when desired. The Pico is made in USA and brings all the reliability and quality of Beretta as the leader of a new generation of concealed-carry firearms.Please visit our online store at www.fnafirearms.com.

A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome.

I had this rifle's serial number researched by the Springfield Research Service, and it was shipped to the 30th United States Volunteer Infantry (Company C) in the spring of 1898, just before they left to fight in the Phillipines. This infantry division was stationed in Illinois.

This rifle was made in March of 1898, and the 30th USVI left San Fransisco for the Phillipines in October of the same year.

Condition:

This Krag is in good condition. Not great or excellent. There are a couple of drawbacks with it:
There are some scuff marks on the buttplate and barrelbands. I'm not sure where they're from, they were there when I bought the rifle from an old man outside of Altoona.

That same old man told me he got the Krag from a local VFW that used it for burial ceremonies. During these ceremonies, they shot black powder blanks out of it but never cleaned it which ate up the bore. The bore is in rough shape, but I did have it professionally ""ultra-sonic"" cleaned. After that, I shot it and the best 5 shot group I have gotten out of it was about 5"" in diameter.

Aside from that, this Krag is in perfect functioning shape. There's nice patina all around on it, with sharp, crisp proof marks in the metal.

Included in the sale is an 1898 dated bayonet w/ scabbard, .30-40 loading dies, and about 20 pieces of brass.

I'm asking $1,000 for this package, but am open to offers. Please, text me with any questions you may have at REDACTED. Thanks!"

Scope is Nightforce NXS 5.5-22 x 56. This is a ""Law Enforcement/Military"" model that is not available for purchase by someone without credentials.

Performance: The gun has a 3/8 MOA guarantee from the factory. It exceeds this. I shoot 168 grain HPBT with Varget Powder. A beginner can get behind this rifle and ding targets at 650 yards. An advanced shooter can do much more. Look in the grouping picture at the bottom and it will give you an idea. In my opinion, this is the best set up money can buy. It is the best rifle I have ever handled in a personal or professional setting. There is a reason Chris Kyle talks about these guns in his book. I have fired exactly 98 rounds through the rifle with all of them logged in a data book.

It is a 16 barrel with 1:8 twist rate. Constructed of 4140 chrome moly steel with a threaded muzzle (5/8-24) the barrel is Melonited for ultimate surface protection. The melonite coating provides a thinner surface than chrome-lining so bore friction is reduced for better accuracy. In addition melonite is harder than chrome-lining providing a longer wear life. The YHM .300 BLK barrels are designed to perform with both subsonic (220 and 208 gr) and supersonic loads. The gas port has been tuned to lock the bolt open on the last round when using subsonic ammunition with a sound suppressor or supersonic ammo without a suppressor. This barrel is an excellent choice for a general purpose AR rifle build. It is perfectly suited for use at the range in a 3-Gun match or in the field pursuing game.

I had this rifle's serial number researched by the Springfield Research Service, and it was shipped to the 30th United States Volunteer Infantry (Company C) in the spring of 1898, just before they left to fight in the Phillipines. This infantry division was stationed in Illinois.

This rifle was made in March of 1898, and the 30th USVI left San Fransisco for the Phillipines in October of the same year.

Condition:

This Krag is in good condition. Not great or excellent. There are a couple of drawbacks with it:
There are some scuff marks on the buttplate and barrelbands. I'm not sure where they're from, they were there when I bought the rifle from an old man outside of Altoona.

That same old man told me he got the Krag from a local VFW that used it for burial ceremonies. During these ceremonies, they shot black powder blanks out of it but never cleaned it which ate up the bore. The bore is in rough shape, but I did have it professionally ""ultra-sonic"" cleaned. After that, I shot it and the best 5 shot group I have gotten out of it was about 5"" in diameter.

Aside from that, this Krag is in perfect functioning shape. There's nice patina all around on it, with sharp, crisp proof marks in the metal.

Included in the sale is an 1898 dated bayonet w/ scabbard, .30-40 loading dies, and about 20 pieces of brass.

I'm asking $1,000 for this package, but am open to offers. Please, text me with any questions you may have at (570)-772-2560. Thanks!"
