I have  a some used electric / electronic locking pump shotgun racks for sale. If you want more than one, email me, and we can try to work out a deal.These retail for $200.00 new. Handcuff key not included in the listed price - if you want a key, let me know and Ill throw one in for $5.I will be selling these on eBay as well if youre not local. I will take PayPal, free local pickup, $15 shipping to continental US, combined shipping available on multiple orders. Shipping outside the 48 states can be worked out via email.These racks are are in varying cosmetic condition, but all function perfectly. The locking mechanism can be opened with either a standard handcuff key, or by supplying 12v power to the attached leads. These were mounted inside law enforcement vehicles, with a dashboard button connected to a timer that would supply 12v to the lock release solenoid for 10 seconds if the vehicle was on. These racks do not come with the switch or the timer, however they will work just fine with any standard pushbutton switch from Autozone / Advance Auto, etc.. Both the manual handcuff and 12v release have been tested on all of these. Fits most standard pump shotguns, but please do some research and verify that this item meets your needs. These are all very adjustable: you can change the angle of all brackets and the locking mechanism itself, and the brackets are fairly malleable, so that you can widen or tighten them for a perfect fit. According to the manufacurer, these will fit:Remington 870 (except Express, Marine Magnum or Wingmaster) Mossberg 500/590   (w/o heat shield or vent rib)H&K FP6 Ithaca M&P Winchester 1300 Marine and 1300   Defender, with Standard Trigger Guard (and probably more) Again, these are used - some have foam that it is good condition, some will need some foam reattached or replaced. This type of closed cell / adhesive backed foam can be easily found online, and probably at Lowes, Home Depot, Cabelas, etc...    Anyhow - check out the pictures, and if you see anything you like, shoot me an email using the link above.... no no no... the other one... the one that says ""Reply"".My approximate location is included in the CL ad. It is. I promise. I even checked it myself, I really, really did. I take CL responders on a first come, first serve basis. If you are trying to schedule a time to come see or purchase something, I will notsell it ""out from under you"". I will answer any questions that you have - unless youre asking ""Where are you located"" / ""How much are you asking for it"" or any other questions that are ALREADY ANSWERED IN THE FRIGGIN AD! If youre picking up from my residence, I will tell you my exact address once weve corresponded and settled on a time. ""No-show-ers"" and ""cancellers"" are not given second chances, unless compelling cases are made with an appropriate amount of grovelling and humility. Oh, and ca$h. Throw money at me... that usually works wonders.Anything I post on CL is exactly what I describe it as - my pictures are designed to show every positive attribute of the item, as well as illustrate any and all flaws. Lowballers may be ridiculed, ignored, or drawn and quartered.If you want to come and bring your gun for a test fit, thats fine, just be aware that my premises are under video surveillance, so no shooting me, please. and...

A truly fantastic factory build. sub MOA performance from a freefloat barreled action with great style and feel. Everyone who has seen this has begged to borrow it, and we all know how that would play out. Attatched is the screen shot from the online build in February. The actual stock is a slightly different color, it is more of a earth tone. The rifle and scope are in immaculate condition. I have shot this just 5 times in order to test the factory adjusted accuracy and 2lb adjustable trigger. And it is 100% spot on at 100 yds. No adjustments needed. I have the 15 round partial box and 2 full boxes of premium match ammo that will be included. The total for this build was $1,031. I paid extra for the Hogue overmolded aluminium pillar block chassis stock and the 6x18x50 Nikko illuminated retical scope. I will throw in a few surprise extras aswell. This is sure to be someone elses favorite. Simply too much goodness to list here! 700 cash or I will trade for a gas piston AR with adjustable gas block and will add cash to make everything fair or a well built direct impingement AR. Also interested in 1911 trades. Below is the build order.

The sub 2000 is in 40 cal Glock. It gas the taticool bolt tube cover and charging handle cover installed. I purchased it new a couple years ago and have put 200 rounds or so thru it.  The p07 i got on a trade so i dont know how many rounds have been in it. I have put less than 200 myself. Both guns are in great shape cosmetically and functionally. Not looking for any hunting rifles or shotguns but other handguns and ak ar style rifles will be considered. Will be out of town for a few days so i may be slow to reply but i will get back to all serious offers. Thanks for looking

How Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-Have The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel.  This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case. Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology1.It allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round.2.Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols.3.Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot.

Brand new in box with all original paperwork. This pistol was purchased new for myself, and customized and tuned with all the above listed upgrades. The pistol has had 3 magazines fired through it for testing and tuning. The Travis Haley trigger is completely adjustable and gives the Glock a 1911 style trigger. This pistol is ready to compete, it needs nothing, only a shooter behind it. It comes with a Glock factory threaded barrel ready to accept your suppressor. The Warren Carry fiber optic red front sight and plain rear sight make for quick target acquisition even in low light situations.  The extended slide and mag release make function operating super quick and easy. The Recoil Rebound guide rod features a heavier guide rod and recoil absorbing spring that keeps you on target for quicker follow up shots. Ive also included a matching Blackhawk Serpa level 2 holster in FDE also. I will also include all the original factory parts that were removed for the upgrades. If you have any questions please don't hesitate."

It did well and had a lot of people impressed with my caliber choice and they were happy to see someone bringing the caliber back although I did have an off day of shooting I was shooting with some of the top shooters in the country . The rifle has 165 rounds put through the barrel I count every round meticulously because j won't shoot a rifle in a comp until about 300 rounds to get the barrel close to a break in . Therefor barrel is not broke in yet and recommend shooting about 200 rounds for better consistency and a smaller deviated spread in velocity . I load my own Ammo and this rifle comes with HORNADY dies that are already setup so all you have to do is screw into loader and go . it only deviated .001 up and down when I hadn't checked cases for all the same length but all shot .25 Moa and .25 Moa out to 433 meters on ar-500 gong minimal wind . Also send the de primer with head space already setup . Dies will be 100 percent screw in and starting punch rounds out .Barrel is 26"" 1:10 twist factory barrel in factory r-700 action with x-mark pro adjustable pro trigger that is also modded and is at 1 pound 12.7 oz which is close to the r-700 timney 517 triggers which are at 1lb 6oz . I will also send 100 once shot HORNADY brass with 60 once shot federal brass will send 25 rounds of my load to shoot with rifle . I've done all the work and proofed rifle so someone can Finnish what I've started and show people this round is back and that was the goal in mind . Also more specs rifle comes with bell and Carson stock aluminum bedding block then I needed it further to totally blue print stock to receiver . Stock is torqued to 45 in pounds added black hawk riser torqued to 25 in pounds and night force rings torqued to base at 65 in pounds and rings to leupold optic at 25 in pounds . Optic is leupold mk4 ER/T FFP 6.5x20 power and 50 mm objective lense with tactical mil reticle . Has M5 turrets 1/10 mil adjustment elevation and windage . All components on this rifle are brand spanking new condition no scratches or use marks because they are all two weeks old as of April 5th . Also made a cheek riser with it which has worked universally for 5 different people . But it is made of foam pad then wrapped in carbon fiber and hardened so their is no give and is a bit squared off to ensure proper eye and parallax alignment . Then for added comfort I camo wrapped it doesn't need the wrap the carbon fiber is smooth but It is still cold up here so wrap keeps cold off the face . Anyway thanks for reading this rifle is one of a kind and pretty amazing caliber that I would like to get out there for not only hunting but see more of in competition next rifle I will do is .257 Roberts and you will see it posted after next competition also.

Nano 9mm - Comfort and Power in Concealed Carry and Personal Defense

The Nano was designed with one goal in mind: creating the ideal micro-compact pistol for concealed carry and personal defense. Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing.

Easy to Conceal

Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.

Personal Protection Made Easy

The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.

Easy to Use and Maintain

The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA.

My carpet cleaning business is being expanded and this money from this sale will be used for advertising and website design. otherwise I would not sell it.

ARMALITE is the original AR Style Rifle Manufacturer and has been supplying the Military/LE/Security & Civilian Markets for over 50 Years, they are the one of the only AR Rifle Manufacturers using both fully forged upper & lower recievers that fit together with precision, the Armalite AR10  is built significantly stronger than most Rifles on the Market today and will last forever with basic/minimal maintenence, this hIgh-powered workhorse can take down anything in the hands of a decent marksman and has several advantages that no other .308/7.62 AR Style have including superior componenents that are patented and exclusive to Armalite including a much stronger and robust Bolt Carrier Group and improved firing pin assembly to ensure it always goes bang every time, superior gas ring, gas block, key, extractor, buffer design, barrel nut, & many more exclusive features making them one of the Highest Quality 7.62/.308 AR Style Rifles Available.  These are Highly Sought After and have been nearly Impossible to find New or Order from Armalite for nearly a while because they simply take longer to produce due to their Strict Quality Control so they aren't able to be quickly produced in huge quantities like many other Rifles. This AR10 A4/B  Gun has a Flat Top Upper Receiver with Built-In Forged Aluminum Picatinnny Rail for a very strong surface that allows easy mounting of optics, lasers, and/or any other accessories you choose and the Front Dovetail-Mounted Gas Block has a Picatinny Rail Top Surface with more surface area for a stronger mount than the competition to allow the mounting of a Standard Sight Post or a Front Flip-Up Sight that can be folded out of the way so that it doesn't interfere with your sight picture in any way when using a High Powered Scope or any type of Optic. Armalite is the Original Designer/Founder of the M16 and it's Civilian Version we all know and Love- the AR15,  However, Before the M16/AR15 Armalite designed the AR10 to replace the U.S. Military's main Rifle at the time which was the M14. Ultimately the Military wanted a smaller & lighter Rifle that had a greater Ammo. capacity for our soldiers to carry to the jungles of Vietnam and the AR 10 was scaled down and the AR 15 was born. Armalite designed and developed the M16/AR15 and sold the rights to Colt Firearms, the ""AR"" in AR15 stands for ""Armalite Rifle"". HOWEVER,  The term ""AR10"" is a Trademark of the Armalite Corporation, they have been manufacturing the larger caliber AR10 (7.62/.308) since the beginning and have really perfected the design over the years and that's why an Armalite AR10 is much more expensive than a Bushmaster .308/7.62 AR Style Rifle,  a Smith & Wesson M&P10 or a D.P.M.S. AR in the larger caliber 7.62/.308. There are many other manufacturers of Very Similar Rifles and many are Very Expensive Specialty Type Guns but the Armalite AR10 is the Original AR and is great, American Made, top quality RIFLE that delivers Excellent Accuracy and Reliability, THIS GUN COMES WITH A LIFETIME WARRANTY FROM THE MANUFACTURER,  THESE ARE HIGH QUALITY RIFLES AND ARMALITE STANDS BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS.  THIS RIFLE AND THE SCOPE, MOUNTS, & BIPOD COST OVER $2000. I HAVE EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL BOXES & OWNER'S MANUALS FOR THE ARMALITE AR10 AND THE 4-16X44 MIL-DOT SCOPE WITH THE ILLUMINATED RECTICLE,  THE ENTIRE RECTICLE AND MIL-DOTS LIGHT UP RED TO GREATLY INCREASE VISIBILITY WITH BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS FROM LEVELS 1-11 AND WHEN THE ILLUMINATION FEATURE IS OFF YOU HAVE THE NORMAL BLACK MIL-DOT RECTICLE, IT'S A GREAT FEATURE THAT YOU CAN USE WHENEVER YOU WANT, THE BI-POD IS VERY STURDY AND WORKS GREAT. PLUS- THE GUN INCLUDES THE RED/GREEN DOT COMPACT 30MM SCOPE THAT'S SO VERSATILE & PERFECT FOR ANY LIGHTING CONDITIONS. WITH BOTH THE HIGH POWERED 4-16X44 ILLUMINATED MIL-DOT SCOPE AND THE SELECTABLE  RED/GREEN DOT SIGHT YOU'LL BE EQUIPPED FOR ANY TARGET NO MATTER HOW CLOSE OR HOW FAR AWAY AND ALL THE NEW OWNER NEEDS TO DO IS SIGHT BOTH OPTICS IN TO THEIR PERSONAL PREFERENCE  AND THEN USE WHICHEVER OPTIC THE SHOOTING SITUATION CALLS FOR- BOTH HAVE QUICK ATTACH/DETATCH MOUNTS AND THE UPPER RECIEVER IS NUMBERED SO YOU CAN REMOVE EITHER OPTIC AND THEN MOUNT IT BACK IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT VERY EASILY SO GETTING ON TARGET WITH EITHER ONE SHOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE- JUST REMEMBER
(OR MARK/WRITE IT DOWN) WHICH NUMBER THE SLOT ON THE RECIVER CORRESPONDS TO THE MOUNT FOR EACH OPTIC'S MOUNTING POINT(S) AND YOU SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM GETTING YOUR SCOPE OR RED/GREEN  DOT SIGHT IN IT'S ORIGINAL POSITION WHERE IT WAS SIGHTED IN
AT AND YOU'LL HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY OF SWITCHING BETWEEN 2 DIFFERENT SIGHTS- ONE FOR CLOSE-MEDIUM RANGE AND THEN THE HIGH POWERED SCOPE FOR MEDIUM-LONG RANGE SO YOU'LL HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS BY SIMPLY CHANGING YOUR OPTIC IN LESS THAN 1 MINUTE!""YOU COULD ADD AN INEXPENSIVE SET OF FLIP-UP SIGHTS ALSO AND INCREASE IT'S VERSATILITY BY EVEN MORE. THE SKY IS THE LIMIT WITH OPTIONS LIKE LASERS,  FLASHLIGHTS,  AND ALL KINDS OF ACCESSORIES,  IT'S UP TO THE NEW OWNER TO PERSONALIZE IT HOWEVER THEY PREFER FOR IT TO BE. 

***ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE THE ARMALITE AR10 HAS IS THAT IT'S COMPATIBLE WITH HANDGUARDS AND STOCKS FROM THE AR15 PLATFORM- YOU CAN CHANGE THE HANDGUARD IN 30 SECONDS WITH NO TOOLS AND THE STOCK CAN BE REPLACED WITH WHATEVER YOU WANT AS WELL AND THE PARTS ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE.  THIS IS AN AWESOME GUN PACKAGE AND A PIECE OF AMERICAN HISTORY AS WELL.

I have checked and this is about the cheapest Marlin 120 in the US right now, and is one of the best condition ones. I am selling it because I have too many shotguns for the amount of time I have to shoot them. So this one can go someplace where it will be used. Barrel is 28 inches and the choke is modified. So a great all-around gun that can be used for turkeys, doves, rabbits, quail, or just about anything else.

You can email me with your phone number or text me at REDACTED so we can meet in Santa Fe. I am firm on this price, but might consider an interesting firearm trade. I'm not a gamer, so I don't need an X-Box, thank you, lol!"
