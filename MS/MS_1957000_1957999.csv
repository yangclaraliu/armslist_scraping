Shoots great, potential collectible. Not many of these still around. Walnut stock has some nicks and gouges but overall in good condition. I buffed it down and put a coat of Tru-Oil on the stock and looks pretty good, as pics show. Bore/rifling excellent, no rust or pitting on barrel. Someone before me drilled and tapped it for a side-mount scope, possibly a Weaver No. 1 I shot only with iron sights, never scoped it. The screws are 3 inches apart and apparently one was off a bit so another was drilled right next to it to accept a side-mount base. Great gun for anyone starting out or who just enjoys a good old plinker that's well made and will last for years to come. Add $38 shipping from my FFL to yours."

It is the COMPACT model and It is chambered in 40 cal. Great gun but I need to fund another purchase so I am considering letting this one go. HK made ONLY 500 of these in OD Green so they are near impossible to find. I have it priced at lower than the norm if you can find one (the last one to go on Gunbroker went for 1,300). I have carried it some so it does have a little holster wear but it is in good condition. Wonderful gun but like I said I need to fund another project. The box, gun and two mags with finger plate will be included. Mine is the V1 configuration (DA/SA with decocker & safety) In 40c. It has standard sights as well. In addition I will include a kydex OWB holster (Fobus). Buyer will need a CCH or permit.

Prefer a cash sale. However, I will consider trades of quality firearms. Thanks for looking $1,100 cash or $1,150 trade. Light not included in picture. Thanks!"

Here's the deal. The gun works fine. The last time I played, I oiled it too much and shorted the motor contacts. I cleaned what I could without dissassembling it, and let it sit on end to drain the excess oil out. It's been around 2 months since then, but I don't have a charger to charge a battery to test it out with. Either way, between the parts gun and the nice one, you'll have a working gun with lots of extras. ABSOLUTELY NO TRADES. I'm getting out of this game. $250 OBO."

 heres the story, grandpa bought it for dad, dad never shot it. it was a present when heading to basic and ww2 so it was put in gun cabinet and waited there. dad never came home so it was given to the son after grandpa past and he got the house. father was said to be a POW so in a sad way son waited entire life, never shot it. waiting on dad? I don't know. so never fired, beautiful 94, a little sun spotting on wood where the glass would be on a cabinet. finish is impeccable, stiff as new, no pitting to firearm, a little fading to blueing at muzzle like was sitting in felt part that holds barrel.(I'm said to be the only one to hold since father left for war. this thing looks better than any-pre 94 i've ever seen.)

This is an older 742 in great shape. No rust, pitting, and the finish is in great shape. Even the wood is in excellent condition, with nothing more that a few nicks and scuffs. 

The scope is old, and is what originally came on this gun so it will probably need to be replaced. Its just not near as clear as the modern glass, although there is absolutely nothing wrong with it and it functions perfectly. 

This is a very nice rifle, and is in great shape for its age. Will make an excellent deer gun for many generations to come. $450 obo / open to trades
