Turkey is one of the oldest gun makers around and their weapons are gaining popularity here in the US. CZ75 parts and mags can be used on this firearm. It comes with 2 17 round Mec-Gar mags who also make mags for Beretta and Sig. Also included is the original box, lock, manual, bore brush, and spent casing from the factory. I have put on smooth black pearl CZ75 grips which contrast nicely with the brushed stainless finish, and have the original grips that will be included as well. I have run about 400 or so rounds through it and it shoots fantastic! Accuracy is second to none and it is an all steel pistol so there is very minimal recoil so follow up shots are easy. 

I am only selling this pistol because i am switching away from 9mm to cut down on the variety of calibers I have to stock. That being said, i am including all my 9mm ammo. I have 25 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense rounds and 194 new remington factory loads.  Buds gunshop totally sold out of them as they are such a great deal compared to a CZ. I have shot this and a CZ and I would take this over the CZ even if the price was the same, but I am including over $150 in accessories and ammo.

While no parts are interchangeable with the M1911 platform, several parts – such as the slide, barrel, and recoil spring – are interchangeable with certain Glock models. While advertised to be chambered in three, separate calibers – .45 ACP , .40 S&W , and 9×19mm Parabellum – production models are only known to have been chambered in .45 ACP, with very few prototype models in .40 S&W. All models of the Spectre feature a match-grade 416 Stainless Steel barrel, 7075-T6 billet aluminum frame, and 20lpi scalloped slide serrations and grip contours.

The pistol was advertised as “the safest pistol on the market”, due its five separate safety systems, four of which are in wide use by other firearm designs:

There is a frame mounted manual safety…a “high grip” safety of the beavertail type…a drop safety that prevents the firing pin from disengaging until the trigger is fully depressed…a firing pin block that disable the firing pin until external safeties are disengaged and the trigger is fully depressed…

And one safety unique to the Spectre line of pistols:

…a “keyed internal-locking device” that is built into the bottom of the grip…operated with a security key and renders the firearm completely inoperable when set…to render the gun safe when stored and not in use…

Despite its innovative features and “safe” design, the company which produced the pistol – Alchemy Arms, Co. – ran into financial troubles within a few years’ time and was abandoned, delaying further production and service to the Spectre line of pistols indefinitely.

When it was originally released, it was believed by many to be the true ""hybrid"" between a Glock and a 1911. In reality, it is entirely custom, but mimics the internals of a Glock (slide, barrel, bolt, take-down), with the feel and function of a 1911 (grip-safety, thumb-safety, slide release, trigger, magazine release). The magazine is a modified, 10-round EAA Witness mag. From what I can see, the only modification is a small v-shaped groove cut in the back of the top of the mag where the bolt picks up the next round.

Overall, I paid $845 for the pistol in its original box, with one magazine, instructions, and keys to unlock the integrated frame lock.The model I purchased has a titanium slide, stainless steel barrel, and anodized aluminum frame.super clean excellent condition with 1 mag, OE box and all the papers .. exceelnt gun shoots perfect super light recoil and a true collectors Item

Comes with the 6"" pinned barrel and a six round recessed cylinder. The barrel ends are fantastic and there is very little holster wear and some slight freckling from storage. This gun has a serial number of S243XXX and has been researched to be manufactured in 1965. The gun is in very nice condition for being fifty years old. The Eagle target grips are relieved, and they come with silver medallions. They show very nicely and the rich wood contrasts beautifully with the bead blasted top strap and blue frame finish. The finish on all the model 28's top straps have been bead blasted to deflect any glare in bright conditions. The condition of the bluing is very well preserved with only the most limited signs of age. Smith & Wesson released this model as a lesser option variant of the 27 and quickly became a favorite among service personnel and those in the line of duty. This 28-2 also features the checkered semi Target Hammer with a serrated Trigger and both have been finished with distinctive case hardened coloring. If you ever had the desire to add one of these to your collection of fine iron, I got a 6"" for your consideration. All engineered mechanics on this model 28-2 function perfectly, and as with all Smith & Wesson revolvers of this generation, she comes pinned and recessed. This revolver carries a very rich tradition and has a strong following by those individuals that were looking for function over form. All business all day long. This highway Patrolman honors all those American servicemen and women who dedicated so much in the line of duty. $600"

I intended to using the rifle for a series of hog hunting trips that never came about, so I re-purposed the rifle as a bench shooter. It's a great shooter, as you'd expect from LaRue. Unfortunately, since purchasing an LMT MWS, it doesn't do much but sit in my safe. 

This rifle does not come with the LaRue MBT, rather it comes a Geissele trigger. I purchased this rifle before LaRue introduced the MBT. Despite LaRue's picture, irons are not included with the rifle (they don't come with them NIB). 

I'm looking to get ~$2,750 cash, a SCAR 16s + cash, or SCAR 17. I'm not too concerned about the round count on trade rifles, but don't offer me a rifle with <5,000 rounds through it!"

The RPM is an Egyptian rifle made with Egyptian parts, and is the closest we will probably get to the Russian AK47.

One of the only semi-automatic Kalashnikov imported into the United States, in almost every regard, an exact duplicate of the Russian AKM. During the 1950’s the Soviet Union, as part of its military aid program, established the production of Soviet-pattern small arms in the Arab Republic of Egypt.

Comes with ATI Fiberforce black Synthetic stock set, I.O. black clubfoot style stock set and very nice wood stock set, plus 2 original and hard to find Egyptian Maadi 30 round steel mags, 2 Tapco 30 round mags.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."

The title says it, this is a carry package for sale/trade. What I have is a lightly used Glock 27 with several extras. First off, it comes with a lightly used Lone Wolf 9mm barrel which has run 100%. I also have the stock Glock barrel as well. As far as the add ons and extras, I have Truglo TFO night sights installed, pierce grips on the 9 round .40 magazines, a Glock 23 magazine and a Glock 22 magazine. In case you are wondering, the .40 mags WILL run 9mm ammo which is a huge plus. Truthfully the reason I am selling/ trading this package is due to wrist issues not allowing me to shoot as frequently as well as wanting to explore new avenues in shooting. I do welcome any serious offers or buyers/ trades. Ideally I would like to have a 9mm handgun. Again thank you for taking a look at this advertisement and I will respond either via email or phone and hope to be in touch with you soon.

 This is a quick run down of the details of this rifle as I believe to be true:

 Now to the tough stuff, history and provenance. I know very little about these rifles but I do know some individuals that do, one in particular, that has knowledge of these rifles and I have his opinion of the rifle's origin.  I trust his word and he has spent a good bit of his time just to help me out in finding information based on markings and numbers.  In any case this is what I believe to be the history with this rifle.

It appears that it is a kit from a South African manufactured FAL that was issued to the Rhodesian Army. That is where the RA comes in one the bolt. They are a lot like the FN/Imbel. The Rhodesian FN FALs were popular rebuilds several years ago. Several companies were able to get the kits for a short while. Most of the ones you see have been painted to match the Rhodesian Army camouflage theme. It is rare that you see one that has not been painted. This is a fine example of one and whoever built it did this several years ago and it appears to be very well done."
