Also paid $300 cash for a S&W shield 40 cal from the same place. I always thought sporting good stores cost out the ass for firearms but now I understand I was way wrong. All I'm saying is if you really want to sell your firearms then don't ask 2x more than their worth. If you can make $50 profit off a firearm now days your doing damn good. But buying a rifle for $400 then waiting 5 years for it to sell for $900 is not a good investment only if you could find someone really dumb or a felon would pay that. 

So I am offering $350 cash for a used sar 1 or wasr 10 for my younger brother. If you have one that is worth buying and not a canned Ill pay you $350 cash money. I won't ask you to lower the price because you live far, I don't wine and cry over the price, I offer you cash money no BS. If you got one let me know."

I am sure most are aware of PTR Industries moving to Aynor, SC from Connecticut, their reasons behind that move, and the production of this series to commemorate said move, but I am attaching links to literature about that, and the specs of the rifle. Obviously, she is a very low serial numbered rifle (SC0031...Governor Haley was given SC0001), and is considered 100%. Priced to sell at $1100.   I prefer to sell, but would entertain quality single or multiple gun trades greater than $1200 that can move quick, and yield ME more cash in the end. That way, you get what you want without pulling out cash, and I get the opportunity to further fund our family Disney Vacation, since we cut up all of our credit cards!

I do not buy any AR's off the shelf, all are custom built using top manufacturers no corners cut. From experience, buying one then stripping it down months later spending another thousand bucks and still aren't 100% satisfied with what you have, happens 90% of the time. And don't be fooled by those $400 complete uppers online theirs a reason why they're so cheap. I have most of the original pamphlets/ packaging that came with the muzzle, barrel, hand guard etc. I have the upper sighted in currently for the 100 yard range with the standard 55 grain 223 for the general shooter, but it easily will do 6-800 yards with a little higher performance ammo (preferred Hornady 75 grain BTHP Match). Asking price is 1600, not interested in trades and please don't message me either saying you can buy a sport rifle for cheaper this isn't made for first time buyers."

This is an Ak platformed rifle that is built as ""sporting"" rifle to allow easier import into the USA. Although the receiver is stamped .223 alone it does allow 5.56. This was done to bypass the restriction on the importing of military chambered firearms. The rifle comes with 1 10rd magazine and 1 30rd magazine and sling. FYI the magaiznes for this rifle are specifically made for a Saiga so you cannot just use any AK type mag and are a little more expensive. I will only sell to PA residents (so please don't try if from another state) and if you are from PA I am willing to go to or meet within a 20 mile radius, any further and you will have to do the rest of the driving. I am willing to consider trades, I've had my eye on some H&K's lately(cash on my end depending on model) and also a lever action .357/.38 would be awesome ....NO A/R's!!. Also, please refrain from offering me any dime a dozen or junk guns, don't waste either of our's time. Thank you."

Nazi Waffenamts or proof marks (WaA 140) with Nazi Eagle over a circled swastika. Serial # (5655b my research shows the # was produced in 1944 when the Germans had to fall back to the East out of Belgium) matching slide, barrel and frame. Officer bring back with no import marks. Also a CLG 44 period leather holster made the same year as the pistol (1944) with a name written inside in ink. One original unmarked aluminum magazine which is correct for pistols in the serial range and a new Mec Gear 13 round.  I fired 50, 115 Federal standard pressure rounds through and it cycles fine followed by a full cleaning. Barrel looks good with strong rifling and original  wood grips without any chips or cracks. No rust or pitting. Most of the bluing is gone which is normal for P 35s in that the Belgium factory workers where not concerned wth quality due to the German occupied forces. 
The FN P35""HI-POWER"" had been in production since 1935. It was John M. Browning last firearm design before his death. The P35 was the first pistol to use a double stack magazine design in which it could carry 13 rounds of 9 mm, hence the name ""high power"". At that time the 1911 could only carry 7 , P.08 Luger and P.38 held 8 rounds of 9 mm. These were carried by German S.S. and paratroopers. Great piece of history to add to your collection. I am asking under market price, due to including a good condition leather holster with a few cracks and scuffs for its 71 yr age, original mag, owners manual and a hard to find extra internal extractor. $875 cash OBO .

Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD and XD(M) lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there. The XD-S is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches.

We all grew up hearing the phrase, ""Faster than a speeding bullet...,"" but not when it is fired from Smith & Wesson's new Model 460XVR, with the highest muzzle velocity of any production revolver on earth. The Model 460XVR is so revolutionary that it required an entirely new designation...XVR, X-treme Velocity Revolver.

Starting with their Extra Large Frame, the Smith & Wesson engineers worked to deliver maximum velocity - over 2,300 feet per second - to reach the target faster than ever before. The 460XVR™ has interchangeable compensators to accommodate every load and its ""gain-twist"" rifled barrel means superb long-range accuracy (beyond 200 yards) with every shot! Only Smith & Wesson could deliver this much power, this much velocity and this much accuracy in a precision, production revolver."

Oversized MAX Locking Bolts and End Bolts resist pry attack better than round bolts. The slick exterior finish and subtle graphics add beautiful security to any room in your home.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEMThe Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.DPX STORAGE SYSTEMIncludes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access. Pouches and pockets organize other valuables.DPX SCOPE SAVERWith the Scope Saver, long guns with optics now fit on the DPX rack without taking up space inside the safe body. The optics are also protected from the bumpsand dings of guns going into and out of the safe.MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTSMAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. Browning ProSteel designed most of their Locking Systems utilize a cam and linkage system that diverts pounding and prying forces away from the lock.HARDENED PIN LOCK PROTECTIONThe heart of a safe's securty is its lock, and that's why all Pro Series safes feature Hardened Pin Lock Protection. The lock is protected by two 1/4"" hardened steel plates and features four 1/4"" hardened steel pins designed to deflect or break drill bits during a drilling attack.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.PRY-STOP END BOLTSMore than two and one-half times longer than door bolts, they attach to angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack. The top and bottom lock bolts on the door secure the critical door corners.BROWNING PRO SERIES GRAND 26 DIMENSIONSExterior Dimensions [H x W x D] : 60"" x 30"" x 25""Cubic Feet: 26Weight: 700 LBS.Locking Bolts: 9Gun Capacity: 29 Total (11/22+7)SECURITY FEATURESBody Thickness: 11- Gauge SteelDoor Type/ Thickness: 1"" FormedLocking System: Force DeflectorLocking Bolts Side Coverage: 3 SidesPry-Stop Bolts: 2 Pry-Stop MAX End BoltsInner Plate Specification: Full 10-Gauge PlateLock: S&G Mechanical or ElectronicLock Protection Features: Hardened Pins, RelockerReinforced Door Frame: 4-Sided, Full ReinforcementFIRE PROTECTION FEATURESInsulation Thickness- Door: 1(3/4)""Insulation Thickness-Body: 1(7/8)""Insulation Thickness-Ceiling: 1 (7/8)""Fire Seal: PalusolFire Rating, NEW ThermaBlock: 1680F/90 MinutesAPPEARANCE FEATURESInterior Covering: Beige CarpetHandle: 3-Spoke, ChromeCONVENIENCE FEATURES180 Degree HingesLED LightingElectrical OutletRaised FloorStorage Solution: Axis Shelving, DPX with Scope SaverDPX Handgun Pouches/Hooks: 2 Pouches, 5 HooksAxis Accessories Included: 5-Gun Pistol Rack"

Product Description: 
remington The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gun making expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Remington's Exclusive ArmorLokt process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3-1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built- in. Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18-1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail."

It's been a family gun and I'd guess it's had less than 200 rounds through it.  We used to hunt whistle pigs with it, but lost access to that farm so it's only been an occasional use gun.  Wood and metal condition is 90+.  It's been carried and handled, but with great care.  The scope has been ""dinged"" not indented or bent and operates fine, but cosmetically it's taken a fall. It's all original with a 4 screw butt plate and the Walker trigger, set to 2lbs pull or around there. It's a very sharp rifle that operates perfectly.  I just don't shoot at ground hogs anymore and when I do I just end up using my 25-06...The scope is clearly used and been with the gun as long as I've owned it.  It's a variable Tasco, 40mm with 4-16x magnification.   Mounts are also Tasco with Tasco rings.  Everything is tight and nice and it holds zero perfectly.
Please ask questions and be assured that this is a real sale.  I have not taken photos from Gunbroker and I prefer to deal locally and in cash.  Therefore, shipping is available at the buyers cost with USPS money order payment.  The gun can only be shipped across state lines to an FFL, no exceptions.  FTF is for a cash deal to an Ohio resident and I'm not looking to trade at the current time, thanks.  Appreciate your interest but don't expect a reply if you make me an offer other than 800 for the complete rifle or possibly a little less for the gun minus the scope.  These are not made anymore and the build quality is very good so, no low balls please."

It takes Sig sights, has an aluminum frame, steel slide, steel guide rod, Rail, and black plastic grips. Smooth DA to SA Trigger. Comes with 3 13 round magazines in a soft case. I got it on trade and while it is a surprisingly high quality pistol, I simply don't like it. I let some of my police buddies shoot a mag through it and they really like it, unfortunately, I do not.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.
The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Oversized MAX Locking Bolts and End Bolts resist pry attack better than round bolts. The slick exterior finish and subtle graphics add beautiful security to any room in your home.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEMThe Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.DPX STORAGE SYSTEMIncludes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access. Pouches and pockets organize other valuables.DPX SCOPE SAVERWith the Scope Saver, long guns with optics now fit on the DPX rack without taking up space inside the safe body. The optics are also protected from the bumpsand dings of guns going into and out of the safe.MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTSMAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. Browning ProSteel designed most of their Locking Systems utilize a cam and linkage system that diverts pounding and prying forces away from the lock.HARDENED PIN LOCK PROTECTIONThe heart of a safe's securty is its lock, and that's why all Pro Series safes feature Hardened Pin Lock Protection. The lock is protected by two 1/4"" hardened steel plates and features four 1/4"" hardened steel pins designed to deflect or break drill bits during a drilling attack.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.PRY-STOP END BOLTSMore than two and one-half times longer than door bolts, they attach to angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack. The top and bottom lock bolts on the door secure the critical door corners.BROWNING PRO SERIES GRAND 37 DIMENSIONSExterior Dimensions [H x W x D]: 60"" x 43"" x 25""Cubic Feet: 37Weight: 875 LBS.Locking Bolts: 9Gun Capacity: 43 Total (22/33 + 10)SECURITY FEATURESBody Thickness: 11-Gauge SteelDoor Type/Thickness: 1"" FormedLocking System: Force DeflectorLocking Bolt Size: 3""x(3/4)"", MAXLocking Bolts Side Coverage: 3 SidesPry-Stop Bolts: 2 Pry-Stop MAX End BoltsInner Plate Specification: Full 10-Gauge PlateLock: S&G Mechanical or ElectronicLock Protection Features: Hardened Pins, RelockerReinforced Door Frame: 4-Sided, Full ReinforcementFIRE PROTECTION FEATURESInsulation Thickness- Door: 1(3/4)""Insulation Thickness- Body: 1(7/8)""Insulation Thickness- Ceiling: 1(7/8)""Fire Seal: PalusolFire Rating, NEW ThermaBlock: 1680F/90 MinutesAPPEARANCE FEATURESInterior Covering: Beige CarpetHandle: 3-Spoke, ChromeCONVENIENCE FEATURES180 Degree HingesLED LightingElectrical OutletRaised FloorStorage Solution: Axis Shelving, DPX with Scope SaverDPX Handgun Pouches/Hooks: 2 Pouches, 5 HooksAxis Accessories Included: 5-Gun Pistol Rack"
