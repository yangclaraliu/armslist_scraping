It has the 20"" heavy barrel. This rifle is extremely accurate. The stock has a beautiful finish and is fully bedded which made a big improvement in accuracy. By fully bedded I mean the action is supported with aluminum pillars and a full Devcon epoxy bed. This was done correctly and looks nice. I have removed the action from the stock multiple times and it has ALWAYS returned to zero after reinstalling the action screws with a torque wrench. i use 30 in lbs. The stock probably has a couple minor marks from having a bipod mounted, but is in overall excellent condition. The ONLY reason I am selling this is that I am getting into shooting suppressed and this barrel is not threaded. The gun shoots too well to cut and thread. I plan to buy another with a factory threaded barrel. The bipod, scope, and rings are not included.  

 We can meet at my FFL in broomfield who charges 5 dollars for private party transfers. The price is firm thanks! Email is the best way to get a hold of me. I can send more photos of the rifle and bedding job upon request.

Attached is a picture of a 100 yard 5 shot groups with bulk ammo (Arms list limits you to 3 photos - I have plenty more ~ MOA 100 yard group photos).

I was trying real hard to like 1911's, but again, no luck. This thing is beautiful though and does shoot great if you like 1911's. It's chambered in .45 and is less than two months old. I do have copies of receipt from where I purchased it. Paid around $1550 plus tax, shot about ten to fifteen rounds through the magazines to try it and just felt too much like Sig 1911's. It was very accurate though and considered one of the best 1911's on the market. Please no trades and no haggling. So it is basically brand new and available for inspection prior to purchase. I have every thing it came with and it is all unused. Also, I was actually selling it to a friend but he wouldn't show id. This has happened a couple times to me already with past guns I have sold.

121,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4551121,For Sale:  Enfield No4 Mk1T sniper made by Long Branch in 1945,"TEXAS, Texas, United States","$ 2,000","Listed On: Sunday, July 26, 2015",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This No4 Mk1* (T)sniper rifle was manufactured at the end of WWII by the Long Branch Arsenal during 1945 which manufactured a total of only 992 No4 Mk1* T's. It has matching serial numbers on the receiver, magazine, forearm and bolt. It has an excellent 25 inch 5 grooved bore with bright and sharp lands. The headspace is good on a 0.067"" armourers gauge with a No '3' bolt head. The firing pin protrusion is 0.045 inch. The action is very good, tight and clean. The metal shows 99% of the blue finish with a little wear on the edges. It has a good BLO finish to the walnut stock with no cracks or major dings. The butt stock is stamped with the serial number of the scope it was set up with (1890 over another which is illegible). The scope mounts are original with no indications of the screws being re-locked (piened). The scope was produced by REL (Research Enterprises Ltd) with excellent optics and adjustments, complete with original leather lens cover with the broad arrow marking (maybe British as most Canadian equipment was marked C broad arrow). This appears to have been refurbished. Some witness marks of usage on the tube from the leather scope cups are present. The REL scopes were thought by some to be superior quality to the British scopes. The Brits may be excused as they were being bombed during production by the Germans. The wood forearm and hand guards are dark walnut wood. The rear hand guard has a arsenal repair applied at the rear. The butt stock is lighter in color and is stamped and painted with numerous numbers. The cheek piece appears to be of oak wood. This rifle has seen service in the Far East WWII theatre (India) from little patches of green paint on the metal which they used as a secondary protective. It has a serialized standard ten round magazine. This excellent condition is commensurate with one of the WW II Enfields' which has seventy years service. This will complete a collection with a rare Long Branch sniper. C&R eligible. ...

The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols."

I bought this unit earlier this year in hopes of doing alot of predator hunting but things just haven't panned as I thought they would. I have used it exactly one time! It is loud, crisp, easy to operate, and has more features than you could ever imagine using. Foxbang, Foxmotion, and Foxpitch are all features that make this Foxpro's most versatile and compact model to date. I have the box and a printed instruction manual in a 1"" folder as pictured. I'm even throwing in a Foxjack decoy which attaches directly to the call for an all-in-one predator hunting nightmare (if you're the predator). These retail for $49.99 in most places. If you are even thinking about predator hunting, look these up and compare for yourself. Every place I could find sell these for $499. Save yourself some money and get out there ridding your deer and turkey woods of fox, coyote, and other mangy beasts! Foxpro has the name and reputation in the electronic calling business for reliability and product support. Call or text.

Safe, ""forced trigger reset"" and normal ""precision mode"" 
In the forced reset mode the hammer pushes the trigger forward a little and helps with rapid fire shooting. With a little practice you can bump fire in normal holding position. 

I just bought this trigger and it works great and as advertised but with my shooting style it's not for me. 
You have to hold the rifle very loose to have it bump back and forth. I just don't like that style of shooting. 

It's a very well build trigger, very very easy to install. Just not for me. It has only seen 100 rounds.

The Maxpedition case is made from 1000 Denier ballistic nylon fabric. It’s water and abrasion resistant. It has a Teflon fabric protector which makes it resistant to dirt, water, oils, etc. It’s very easy to clean when it gets dirty. Just wipe is off with a damp rag. I like things that are easy to clean.

The zippers are heavy duty and lockable. The case is stitched with high tensile strength composite thread. This is much stronger than ordinary nylon thread. This case or rug is almost bullet proof.

On the right is a padded and zippered compartment to hold one pistol. My Glock fits perfectly. The padding protects it from the elements, bumps or a drop. The opposite side has 5 elastic retention loops for magazines, flashlights, multi-tools, knives, etc.

The handles are made from tough 1.5″ webbing. They are over kill for this small pistol rug but guarantee non-breakage. The handles are comfortable and well made.

Slide Fire SSAR-22 Stock Kit with Trigger for Ruger 10/22 Polymer Black

INCLUDES A: BATFE Approval Letter.

The Slide Fire Solutions SSAR-22 Bump Fire Buttstock Kit utilizes the same groundbreaking design and technology as the SSAR-15 line of stocks, offering the same level of performance, reliability, and superior craftsmanship for the classic 10/22 rifle. The SSAR-22 allows the shooter to safely bump fire their 10/22 rifle from the shoulder, effectively and legally simulating fully automatic fire, and allowing for an unprecedented measure of control that is severely lacking when attempting to bump fire a rifle in the traditional, ""from-the-hip"" manner.

The SSAR-22 features a shelf that positions the shooter's index finger in a fixed position in front of the rifle's trigger. To fire, the rifle is moved forward with the support hand pushing on the forend, thereby bringing the trigger to the shooter's finger and discharging a round. The rifle's recoil causes it to move rearward, allowing the trigger mechanism to reset. When the right amount of constant forward pressure is applied, the rifle will continue to fire as the trigger is brought forward and depressed by the shooter's stationary index finger, causing the gun to Bump Fire. Only 4-6 lbs. of force is required, allowing shooters of any stature to enjoy the fast paced fun of the Slide Fire 10/22. With a little practice, the shooter will be capable of delivering accurate single shots, bursts, or even full magazine dumps on demand using the SSAR-22. 

The SSAR-22 employs a simple stock locking mechanism that allows shooters to select between their preferred firing methods easily and quickly. In the extended or ""Open"" position, the rifle's receiver is allowed to freely slide rearward during the recoil impulse into the stock, thereby allowing the gun to be bump fired. The stock may also be locked into a collapsed, or ""Closed,"" position into which the buffer tube attached to the chassis is held in place within the buttstock and unable to move, thereby facilitating semi-auto function. 

The SSAR-22 is designed to be compatible with the Ruger 10/22 and clones. SSAR-22 Kit includes the chassis system platform, match grade trigger assembly, SBS stock, handguard with flattop rail for optic or sight mounting, interface block, nut retainer, hex key, mounting hardware, instructions, BATFE Approval Letter, and a lifetime factory warranty. Also included is an A2 pistol grip and collapsible, M4 buttstock for converting the 10/22 to a standard M4 configuration if extended semi-auto operation is desired. Made in the USA.

This kit includes a Complete JARD MATCH GRADE TRIGGER ASSEMBLY. NEW and Unused Condition.
Technical Information:

    Model: SSAR-22
    Stock Material: Reinforced High Strength Polymer
    Compatibility: Ruger 10/22


NOTE:
The Right Hand Model has a fixed finger shelf located on the left side of the stock. The trigger will be blocked by this shelf and inaccessible when fired with the left hand.

Please be advised that we cannot accept a return on this item.

Quality Mil-Spec (QMS) Trigger is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the QMS is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however the majority of the associated grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the well known reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs.

1. Performance Advantages for the Shooter
• The ALG Defense QMS trigger pull is smoother than a stock trigger. This is accomplished by honing the sear surfaces smooth while not removing metal below the valleys of the stock surface finish.
• Sear geometry has not been changed from standard so the high reliability that the stock trigger is known for is unchanged.
• Trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy steel military specification castings, correctly carburized, quenched and tempered for high surface hardness.
• Disconnector is 1070 High Carbon steel properly Austempered into the spring range of hardness
• Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications.
• A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all type of ammunition.
• Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 Chrome-Moly steel that has been quenched and tempered. Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the weapon lower receiver.
• Pull weight is above the U.S. Military minimum pull weight of 5.5lbs but does not reach near the upper limit of 9.5lbs. Generally, the pull weight is about 6.5lbs.

2. Advantages for the Armorer
• The ALG Defense QMS trigger is an enhanced standard trigger so maintenance and installation procedures are unchanged.
• There is spare parts commonality between the QMS and stock triggers
• Trigger assembly parts may be interchanged between triggers, there are no matched sets.
• Since it is a trigger meeting the U.S. Military trigger specifications for the M4 Carbine, the ALG Defense QMS can be substituted for lower performing stock triggers while still staying in compliance with Unit or Departmental requirements."

If you pump enough rounds from a shotgun yes your barrel gets hot and this prevents you from getting burned....its an awesome setup just tired of spending so much money on it....last thing it needs is a good set of ghost ring sights....doesnt come with sights. The barrel was a vent rib barrel and cut it down flush with mag extension so its a 20 inch barrel. Good length for hunting or home defense! Let me know what you have...only interested in ar15."

It cycles smoothly, the trigger pull is fine, and there are no scratches or dents. It looks brand new. 

As far as extras, I added Blackhawk swivels to the stock and mag tube, a Blackhawk sling with space for 15 shells, and a Tacstar 4 shell side saddle (the 5 shot ones are too long and you can't pump it). I also have a box of slugs, 2 boxes of Home Defense buckshot, and a few dozen light load target shells. I removed the barrel plug, but I still have it and the screws if you want to take the side saddle off.

1. Easy steps to quadruple your money - buy a stainless gun use a dremel and some polish compound and polish that turd to a bright stainless. 
2. To double your money , buy a $300 rifle paint it and bake it in your easy bake oven - make sure you pick the hot color right now bronze or sniper gray ( FDE is always a good one too ) 
3. Buy any polymer pistol and take a soldering iron to ""stipple"" like a professional butcher , if that isn't good enough get the trusty dremel out and reshape the grip because we all know a gun company can't get it right - THIS RUINS your firearm removing material off of the grip ( and frame ) will weaken it

So, back to smith it went. The gun returned with new stocks, great fit on the side plate and what can only be described as a classic Smith and Wesson bright polish.

I used a scope mount to mount work on my rifle after seeing someone do the same on a youtube video. It works well and it's very solid. But if you're looking for a better solution Cobray still has the mounts in stock. Just give them a call/email and they can hook you up.

I have For Sale or Trade a LNIB Sig Sauer P229 SAS Custom Shop Pistol. It has the SRT Trigger and the E2 Grips. This is the Latest Generation/ 2nd Generation Sig Sauer Pistol. Test Fire Date: Aug 2014.   This gun is in excellent condition, with minimal use and maximum care. The compact size of the P229 makes it ideal for every day concealed carry.

FEATURES:  The P229 SAS comes standard with SigLite Night Sights, a Short Reset Trigger(SRT), Standard Reach Trigger, Nitron Finish, and E2 (Enhanced Ergonomics) Grips. The Sig P229 SAS also comes with three (3) “Made in Italy”-Stamped, Standard-Capacity Magazines.

NO TAX NO FFL     I am in Madison, AL I will meet /drive half-way for the exchange. Serious inquiries only, additional pictures upon request.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

(a.)   Just to be sure the weapon would work with standard, “Classic” grips, I removed the one-piece modular E2 grips and installed a set of old-style Sig factory two-piece grips from another of my P229s onto the weapon of course they worked fine.  

(b.)  The P229 SAS does not come with a manual safety and when carried with the hammer down on a loaded chamber, it can be fired in DA (double action) when your trigger pull breaks the 10lb mark. After the first DA shot, the P229 SAS shoots SA (single action) and at that point it only takes 4.4lbs to release the hammer. All mechanical parts functioned smoothly and flawlessly. It went bang every time I pulled the trigger.

(c.)   The Sig Sauer P229 is also used as a duty weapon and is carried by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Immigration and Customs (ICE), U.S. Coast Guard and many other federal agencies"".

FINAL THOUGHTS: I can’t think of any other handgun that will do so many tasks so well as the Sig P229 SAS – Every Day Concealed Carry, Home Defense, Open Carry, Target Shooting, Woods and Trail Defense Against Predators Two-Legged or Four, Hunting or Targets of Opportunity – the Sig P229 SAS will rise to the occasion, whatever you may ask of it."
