This mounts in front of your daytime optic, giving you instant nighttime capability with no re-zeroing required.  It has a powerful IR laser illuminator that is invisible to the naked eye but makes the device useable out to 4-500 yards in pitch black conditions.  With a little ambient light, i.e. starlight or moonlight, it is useable without the illuminator.  This digital night vision device has enough resolution to provide a clear image even with high power magnified optics.  It includes a mounting bracket for attaching to a wide variety of scopes.  It also has an A/V jack which allows you to attach a video recorder to film your kills.  This is perfect for night time hog/predator hunting, or for Second Amendment purposes of course.

I'm asking $1795, in a discrete private sale with no tax.  Partial trades for firearms or other optics/gear/accessories will be considered, but I do need a substantial amount of cash with any deal.  Feel free to make an offer -- I need to turn this to cash quickly.  Potential buyers will of course be able to inspect and test the unit before purchase to verify function.  This comes with a nice factory Pelican-type case and all paperwork.

Comes with blue S&W hard case, S&W original rosewood grips, spare Pachmayr rubber grips, manual, papers, warranty card, trigger lock, key, out of waistband belt holster and two bags of full moon clips. Revolver is practically new in box, the ultimate safe queen that's been shot very little and that has been well taken care of.

Clint Smith of Thunder Ranch was instrumental in getting S&W to do a special run of these to re-release the S&W 1950. Not a normal catalog item and very rare on the used market.

If you are not familiar with this revolver ...
http://www.handgunsmag.com/reviews/featured_handguns_model22_102406/

Uses full moon and half moon clips for extraction, but will function and fire without them. Just aids in extraction. Is the perfect revolver to add to a S&W collection, for home defense, concealed carry, as a backup gun for hog hunting/semi-dangerous game hunting, as a hiking gun and myriad other uses.

Price is $800, I paid $950.

Would prefer a face to face sale in the Garland area of Dallas/Ft Worth Texas, but I will ship out of State if you pay for 50% of the shipping/insurance/tracking and just so long as your FFL accepts transfers from a private individual. For a face to face sale in Texas a CHL is given preference, but a TXDL and statement saying that you're a non-prohibited person will work as well.

Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. The rifling is finely tuned to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sight, fiber optic front sight and Taurus ""Ribber"" Grips, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law. 

This would be a perfect revolver for home or automobile security use, and I'm throwing in plenty of ammo for that purpose. How about giving this as the perfect Christmas gift for somebody special. Contact me so we can meet and let you inspect this revolver. I know you won't be disappointed. The price is $500 Cash only, and you must show me your Oklahoma Driver's license."

Ruger doesn't make these any more! There is absolutely nothing wrong with the weapon, perfect operating condition. I really love this gun, no cheap plastics, just good, solid stainless steel and laminate. Perfect for hunting in less than ideal weather without any worries. I am willing to FTF or ship at buyer's expense.

It has less than 100 rounds through it so the magazines and the action aren't even fully broken in. Function has been 100% out of box with several types of 5.56 and .223 ammo. I never benched it out to 100 yards, but it is definitely more accurate than I am with iron sights.

The laminated stock is a very nice black/grey with a slight greenish tint to it. I believe it was made under contract by Revolution but is a slightly different pattern from their Explorer stocks. I've made a few modifications to the stock for better ergonomics as it originally left much to be desired. The stock has a very few and very small handling marks, still in very good condition. It also has an excellent non-slip recoil pad.

Also included are two practically brand new Ruger factory magazines: one 20 rounder and one 30 rounder. Stainless steel scope rings, an upgraded handguard made by Choate for better ventilation and weight reduction, 120 rounds of mixed Tula and American Eagle, and three 5.56 dummy rounds by Magpul as an extra. 

The stock alone is worth around $200, the mags are between $35-$40 each, and the Choate handguard was $20 well spent, and ammo is worth around $50. All together it's worth a good $950."

I had it checked by a gunsmith who declared it possible to shoot, keeping in mind that is was designed for black powder or early low pressure smokeless powder, NOT modern ammunition.

Trades:

About the only want I can think of right now is a Sig P938.  I've seen a couple models that sell new in the low $500's, so one of those would be perfect.  Let me know what you are adding to the deal in cash or other.  Also, would like a nice AR-10 with 16""-18"" barrel, something like the DPMS Recon G2 and I'll add cash or other.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice trigger groups etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.

This shotgun is in very good condition, and has a 20.5 inch barrel with a big #4 brass bead front sight installed. The gun was reblued some time in its past, but it's over 90 years old and it looks to have been done a long time ago. It's got a new firing pin, and the lockup between the receiver and barrel assembly is nice and tight. This gun also has the ability to ""slam-fire"", letting it be fired it as fast as it can be pumped. The stock has a recoil pad installed a long time ago for shooting comfort, and it has a shorter length of pull as a result. The barrel was cut down awhile ago and is the perfect length for a ""Trench Gun"" clone. $450 cash. If the ad is up, it's still for sale."

He put 315,000 miles running up and down the highways of GA. He can't drive anymore so he sold it to me. It is a nice pickup with little foundational issues. However, any vehicle with this many miles will have some issues. The ones I'm aware of are:

1) Missing front plastic skirt that mounts to the front bumper
2) A/C needs recharged
3) Power steering pump makes noise when turning steering wheel. My dad claims that it has done that since it was one year old. He just never fixed it. 
4) crack in windshield

It drives just fine and has many more miles left on it. Dad changed the oil religiously. I just performed a tuneup on it by changing plugs and wires. I changed the oil about 300 miles ago. I've been using it just to drive into town locally as this wasn't my primary vehicle. Just wanted to keep it fresh."

545,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4822545,For Sale/Trade:  Charter Arms AR7 Survival Rifle and Scope,"North or Northwest Side, Indianapolis, Indiana",$ 150,"Listed On: Saturday, December 5, 2015",Rifles,Henry Repeating Arms                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Since 1959, the AR-7 has been used by U.S. Air Force pilots that need a light-weight, small-caliber survival rifle. This AR-7, made circa 1987, was manufactured by Charter Arms.  While Charter no longer makes this model, it is the same basic model as the current AR-7 made by Henry.  The barrel, magazine and receiver disassemble in seconds without tools and fit inside the waterproof butt stock.  The rifle will float if dropped in water in either configuration.  The magazine stows in the butt stock loaded or unloaded.  It has a thumb safety and adjustable sights.

This is a great little ""back pack"" rifle for taking camping, etc.  It also makes a great first rifle.

This particular rifle has fired only about 300 to 500 rounds (very little use over the years - that is why I am selling it.)  Back when it was used, there were no failures to load or fire that I can recall.  As with all AR-7’s, it should be very reliable if you don’t use under-powered ammo.  The 8-round magazine (which contains the feed ramp) is in great shape and should feed well.

This rifle has just been completely disassembled, inspected, cleaned and lubricated and is in great shape.  It has light cosmetic wear marks - mostly on the shiny plastic stock.

While this rifle wasn’t originally designed to use a scope, I had fitted it with one and I am including it and the mounts in the price.  Honestly, the scope is only OK and the mount doesn’t fit it well but I have no other use for the scope so it is included. This is probably obvious but the receiver won’t fit in the stock with the scope attached.

The price is firm at $150 for a face-to-face transaction.

If I need to ship this, I will only ship to a FFL and the cost will be $150 + $40 to cover the additional fee that my local FFL charges me to process and ship."

Face-to-face cash sale for those able to legally purchase firearms and/or ammunition in the state of Wisconsin. Please include your telephone number with all inquiries. Open to traveling a short distance within the area to meet buyer. Sorry no trades. Thanks for looking."

...sorry, no box nor papers, kept it in my truck since its so tough and indestructible, though this caused me to ignore the box and papers...reckon I lost track of 'em during a move...or one of the kids snagged it for their Hot Wheels...

As is usual with these firearms, functions flawlessly with ALL ammo. ...  

A REAL firearm, not one of the modern poly-framed (aka ""plastic"") firearms so popular right now...a real MAN'S 9mm...  Full-size Stainless Steel frame, slide, and barrel; has the adjustable rear sight...and is accurate as HECK !!!

Indestructible, tough, accurate, and functions flawlessly...What more can one ask for..!?

I love this shotgun and hate selling it, but life threw me a curveball, so....$1,450 buys it!

Legion makes a slightly upgraded Saiga (all part of the same company, kind of like Chevy and Buicks). This comes with a Hinged Dust Cover, Top Picatinny Rail, Auto Sear Pin, Bolt Hold Open button.

Please note the FCG has not been converted. It is original--it shoots 10 shotgun shells in under 4 seconds so I postponed converting it. 

I have put a lot of time and money into this Saiga: The reduced recoil spring so this Saiga reliabliy shoots birdshot to buckshot to slugs. Auto gas plug--you can shoot 8 shot, 4 shot, 00 shot and slugs with no manual adjustment. 

I've used this for home defense and shooting clay pigeons--it does great at both. I've shot about 400 shells through it. 

Polymer tri-rail allows for vertical grip (VG not included), laser, flashlight, etc. The polymer is strong but won't rip up your hands like aluminum rails will. 

Magazines: Original 5 Round Mag and 3 Pro-Mags, 10 rounds each. 

The Dragunov Stock is a Love It or Hate It on a Saiga. It is wonderful for HD; shooting from the hip is more accurate, allows for faster follow up shots. The Dragunov Stock allows the shooter to have firm control of your Saiga in turning corners and coming out of doorways. 

Shipping from my FFL to your FFL. S&H fee is $35 to Lower 48 States only. I can accept credit cards and will split the 3% credit card cost with you. 

If you don't want everyone at the range asking you what you do you have there? Is it legal? -- You don't want this Saiga. It is an attention getter!

As you know, Saiga's are now banned. I hate to part with this gun--fun, dependable, & reliable. Can't ask for much more out of a gun. 

I can text or email more photos of the Saiga to you
