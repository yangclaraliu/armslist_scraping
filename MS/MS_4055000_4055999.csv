Arsenal Bulgarian SAM7UF. CHF Chrome lined 16"" barrel, Hammer forged milled receiver. 1200$ Or best offer. Sealed AK Pmag included. 

Each SAM7UF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability.

Has an illuminated reticle and a tremendous amount of eye relief, giving you both the benefit of a medium-range rifle scope and the functionality of a red dot in a lightweight, compact package. 30mm tube lets in a whole lot of light. Battery life on this thing is ridiculously long due to a built-in motion sensor that shuts off the illuminated reticle after 5 minutes and instantly turns it back on upon any sort of motion. The turrets are customizable to your specific caliber and load (you must purchase any custom turrets from Leupold). The SPR reticle is awesome, and is the most expensive reticle Leupold makes for this line of scopes. Includes front and rear Leupold aluminum ultralight magnetic flip covers, which cost $50 each. No box or paperwork. Price is $500 cash, firm. I will throw in a Burris PEPR QD mount for an additional $25 (will not sell PEPR mount alone for $25, only if scope is purchased for $500). Any cash offers for less than $500 will be ignored. Will trade for Eotech XPS2-0 plus $100 cash on your end. Buyer must pickup in Lake Highlands area. Thanks for looking."

Indeed, the two magazines I fired through it with bulk-pack ammo functioned flawlessly and I was surprised by my 50 yard groups.  I've recently decided to purge myself of my collection and have decided to stick with a single-shot for rimfire instead.  I've never fired an MP5 before but evidently, the GSG is mechanically similar and it shows with the craftsmanship.

I have for sale or trade 450 rounds of Federal XM855 in 150 round bulk packs and 900-some rounds of ZQI SS109. If you aren't aware the SS109 is the ""Penetrator"" type projectile or bullet that the ATF is seeking to ban, while M855 or XM855 refers to the entire loaded cartridge. The ZQI ammo is loaded to NATO spec and is identical to the XM855 other than it does not carry the same headstamp or a painted-green tip. This is the ammo that the ATF / BATFE is seeking to ban from import, manufacture, and sale!

I do not collect this type of weapon so have decided to test the market. The abalone work is amazing. Even though the pieces look the same no two are exactly alike. There is a hole in the barrel from the pan. It would have taken a long time to make this. Each section has a thin strip of what appears to be brass lining it. Some of the mother of pearl pieces are missing and I would say overall condition is fair minus. But it is very old and has survived many years and would make a great display. The price is OBO.

They are one of the earliest imports if not possibly even the first semi-auto AK47-type rifles to hit the US. This is a preban 100% Made in China by Norinco and imported before they started importing other Norincos and Polytechnology rifles. They were available with a standard fixed stock (black fiber-reinforced phenolic), or as an underfolder. The fixed stock guns were made at Ling Hua Arsenal and had polished bolts and bolt carriers. Included is the numbered matching detachable AKM style bayonet with scabbard, original cleaning kit, original mag and sling. I fired only two mags out of my AK47 many years ago and just cleaned the bore, bolt & carrier. The rest of the rifle still has the original cosmoline on some of the parts (see pics). 100% all original and numbers matching. Overall condition 98% +. The Clayco's are rumored to have been manufactured as close to Chinese military guns as possible.These Chicom rifles were featured in the September 1984 Edition of Soldier of Fortune Magazine.

I have dies for 45ACP and 9mm, with an extra hot-swap die tray for another caliber of your choice. I have two powder administration modules and everything, so you will truly have a hot-swappable setup for .45 and 9mm without needing any additional components.

In addition to the complete press and components, I also have a primer flip tray, and vibratory case cleaner, along with an extra container of media for the cleaner.

Press is like-new. 9mm reloading components are new. Only loaded 45ACP, and less than 500 rounds at that. Bought from a buddy that barely used it, and I never acquired the components to reload my brass. He gave me everything a new reloader could need, minus the powder, primers, bullets, and brass. I am willing to let this whole lot go for $550.

This would be a perfect setup for somone who is fresh to reloading. All the hardware you need to start reloading is here - just pick a powder and primer, collect some brass, and buy the bullets. I was planning on adding a set of 40s&w dies to have three very popular calibers on tap.

A Williams peep sight was added and it also comes with a scope base and 1"" rings. I have the scope base screws but not the screw dummy plugs for the receiver. The rear band screw is not period correct but does the job. I have not fired it but have cycled rounds through it and it ejects very strong with no hang ups. I know the guy who did the bluing work and he fired it a few times with no issues. Overall this is a very nice looking rifle. I am located in Pocatello and am looking for a local deal. I am not interested in lowering my price because you have to drive from far away. I will consider trades in bolt action only 25-06, 270, 30-06, 270 wsm , 300 wsm, 300 Win, 338 win or 300 Weatherby and I can add cash for the right rifle.

These Steyr rifles were of a incompatible caliber with German Mauser rifles, so the Steyr guns were used largely as home guard weapons. Germany continued manufacturing ammunition for the Steyr rifles, in several runs during WW2, which is what is being offered in this lot of 6 complete original boxes of WW2 ammunition.

Each box contains two charging clips with 5 original rounds each of Nazi waffenampt marked Steyr ammo. There are a total of ten rounds and two proofed steel charging clips in each box. Most of the steel charging clips have a standard nazi waffenampt mark, however some of the clips were recycled by Nazi Germany and these bear austro-hungarian marks or austrian arsenal mark stamps.

You MUST have and present a valid Illinois FOID card at time of sale. No exceptions.

I've shot it on two different occasions, definitely not a tack driver, but the accuracy is decent for a gun that has been around the block for 100+ years. The flip up konovalov sight is measured in Arshin, and is much better than the notch and post on the regular 91/30.

This is not an M91/30, and this is not a $100 rifle. Handguards themselves can go for $50 (if you find someone willing to sell theirs).

Has anybody else tried to purchase this handgun?  They wont meet anybody and all they want to do is ship it. And of course they want there money first. I did lots of texting and was planning on driving over. Then all the excuses came and they said they had to ship it. I asked them to take a picture of the gun with todays date on a picture and they wouldn't do it. Be careful with this one!

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry.
 
Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

Though neutral during the war, high ranking fortress troops, artillerymen and numerous ground forces had been guarded solely by this rifle. 

Unfortunately, I currently have no means nor need to keep this rifle any longer with me due to moving on to more modernized versions. This one is a 1933-1958 Winchester.308 caliber (sports) version used primarily for training purposes within the Swedish military. Though I’ve kept it close for years, it is an exceptionally great shooter, has been cared for dearly and well maintained to uphold an astonishing condition (especially for its age). It features a tight bolt-action and flip-up yardage sight. This bolt-action rifle has an exceptionally well-maintained bolt and was made for great firepower using specifically the .308 round.
While its initial price can range anywhere from $400 - $500, I am currently requesting $225 and will be willing to make the sale in person.

Hey everyone,
	After mulling it over for a while I’ve decided that I want to pick up a AK. More specifically, I am looking at the newer series WASR10’s with the solid wood stock and the side mount accessory/scope rail that takes 30rd mags (not the lo cap versions). I know that they supposedly aren’t as good as some, but it is well within my budget and i want to start with it and work up from there. I can pick them up brand “new” (or as new as a AK really ever can be haha) with 2 30rd mags, threaded barrel, “angled” compensator,  shipping, and FFL fee for $525 from online. So if you want more, then there needs to be some kind of extras or some other factor. Here is what it “must” have for me to consider it:

-must have wood stock (or be a common model that  wood stock can be easily replaced and cheaply)
-Must have the side mount for accessory rail
-Must be capable of standard double stack AK mags
-Must not have canted sights or substantial mag wobble (not really an issue on newer version)
-Need to be able to meet in or very close to norman. 

I am reasonable and if you have extras, ammo, or other upgrades I’m willing to pay extra for that, but I’m not willing to pay more to buy yours than i could buy the same thing for new and just wait 3 days for shipping. I have cash in hand. Please post any offers on here, shoot me a PM, or a text at REDACTED and we can go from there.  Im open to other models as well if the price is right, but i want to stay in that price range (unless yours already has a scope mount and scope then i will pay more). Il also be looking for extra mags, sling, and other various AK accessories if you see this and may have some laying around. Only ammo i really would want is 123r HP ammo as that is what all of my SKS guns are already sighted for and want to keep it the same. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

Outstanding condition, really well cared for, shoots sub moa groups with cheap ammo.  Perfect hunting rifle.  Freefloat handguard, 2 stage match trigger (4.5 lbs), best trigger I've ever used on an AR15.  Comes with all original items including hard case, 1 mag, scope risers, and paperwork/owners manual (bipod not included but can sell for an additional $30).

Retail price is $1,430 but the lowest online price I've found is $1,050 so I'll beat that by $100, plus you don't pay sales tax, shipping or FFL fees.  Price is $950 cash. I can accept a credit card through paypal, but you pay the 3% comission.

I've received a lot of inquiries about people wanting just the upper. I can sell the upper alone for $800 (because it has all the good parts in it, and I doubt I could sell the lower for more than $150).  But at that price you may as well buy the whole gun.

The ONLY trades I will consider are a Kimber Solo Carry +$300 cash, or a Sig P938 +$300 cash.  Maybe less cash on your part if you have extra mags and/or holsters for it, but since I can get either of those guns NEW for $650, I think that is a fair trade."

I don't reload .45 ACP so these are all retail shot brass of various kinds. Doing the math of 83 cases per pound, there should be around 1,700ish cases.

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
 
The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.
 
The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."
