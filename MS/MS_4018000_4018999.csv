Get it before the prices start to go up (more)!

Semi-auto 12 ga shotgun made by Izhmash in Russia. Full poly stock with 19"" barrel threaded on end. (Easy to add a muzzle brake)

Bought it from a guy that had FTE issues (using low base bird shot) and he had not shot a whole box through it.
I put on TAC-47 Auto gas plug. Cycles everything now, no problem. (Hence, the second box of low brass shells). This gun is really made to shoot tactical stuff like 00Buck, and will shoot even better once it is broken in.

Shotgun does not have original box, but I do have the cleaning kit and original 5 round magazine that came with it. (Also have the original gas plug)

This also includes (10) 10-round magazines! (In case you feel the need to go Rambo on someone!)

Terms: FTF in the Hillsboro/Beaverton area during the week, either before or after work. Can meet in Seaside or Astoria on weekends. (Live in rural Clatsop county). Must be of legal age, an Oregon resident with ODL and legal to own a firearm. Bill of sale for my records."

I couldn’t even get them to show up in pictures and I speculate if you looked at them you would wonder why I even mentioned them.  The rifle has fired exactly 23 rounds of factory ammo, which easily shot under an inch at 100 yards.  My normal test of milk jugs at 50-yard increments out to 250 yards resulted in one-shot hits.  I have not worked up any loads and have rarely fired this rifle.  It is gathering dust.

If you haven’t looked through a thermal sight before you are in for a treat.  There is no comparison between this thermal sight and Gen 3 autogate night vision.  The big differentiator is that you can see through objects which night vision technology will not all you to.  For example, I could see my buddy clear as day behind a bush the bush he was hiding under, while looking through my Gen 3 monocular, I had no idea anyone was there.

If your serious about doing it right, this is the game changer.

Asking 1500 Obo
Used on my tavor to walk around my house and check it out. Left it on the gun for a few weeks and decided to sell. 
Up for sale is a new armasight CO-Mini ID Night Vision Mini Clip-On System Gen 2+. This can be used as a monocular or mounted in front of your scope. Want a night vision scope? Those are big money, but now you can have that and more.

Auto brightness control
Simple and quick conversion of daytime scope to night vision
Mounts in front of any daytime scope with no rezeroing required
Powered by a single alkaline 1.5V AA or 3V CR123A lithium battery
No export outside of the US

Designed for short-to-medium ranges, the Armasight CO-Mini ID is the most compact commercially available Clip-On Night Vision Device. The CO-Mini ID uses image intensification technology and is designed to convert most low-to-mid power daytime sights, scopes, or binoculars to operate at night. The CO-Mini ID can be mounted in seconds and without tools. It can be attached in front of a day rifle scope (using its quick release Picatinny mount) or directly onto the day scope (or binocular/telescope) objective lens with an optional adapter. CO-Mini is suitable for use with most commercial and military specification day time sights, telescopes or binoculars (up to 6X magnification). Because the CO-Mini ID is mounted in front of your own day scope, the shooters eye relief is not altered, and shot release and follow through all remain intuitive. The clip-on device is factory bore-sighted to better than 1 MOA accuracy, so no alteration in zero is experienced. The Armasight CO-Mini ID is intended primarily for use by the most demanding hunter or short range assaulter, where field of view and ease of use is more important than high magnification. Whether your day scope is a well known brand or not, the Armasight CO-Mini ID will work just as well at magnifications 2-6X. The Armasight CO-Mini ID utilizes a high performance Improved Definition Gen 2+ image tube providing resolution of 47-54 lp/mm. The CO-Mini brings high quality clip-on night vision within everyone's reach.

I am looking to trade my truck gun for an SKS. This has been a great carry gun, (lol) but I am wanting a rifle. I am looking to trade for a milled SKS with a wood stock in great shape. I don't want an SKS that bubba had a field day with. Factory would be perfect for me, maybe with a 30 round mag. I'd prefer a 20 round mag though. I would love a paratrooper model. I will not trade straight up. I expect cash with the deal. I would like 300 unless it's a paratrooper model then I'd take 200 with it. Let me know what you have. I'm a little flexible on price.

An integrated shooting table, adjustable seat and super-stable tripod legs team to create a comfortable shooting platform.

The 34""L x 23""W table surface is made of sturdy, chemical-resistant polymer with two integrated carry handles. Two gun-holding forks are included, and they fit into the table's carry handles so you have a safe and stable place to clean your rifle at the end of a long day of shooting. Leg adjustments let you keep the table and seat parallel to the horizon, even on terrain that is not flat. Both the seat and table pivot around the central shaft to engage targets at nearly any angle. The reinforced welded-steel frame is strong, stable and easy to set up.

Factory Description:

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each R.E.P.R. rifle comes with one barreled upper, but extra uppers are available in light contour 16.1” and heavy contour 20” configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications.

New for 2012, we are offering the 16” R.E.P.R. with a spiral fluted barrel. The spiral fluting shaves weight while relieving longitudinal stresses that can cause ‘stringing’ in barrels with conventional linear fluting. 

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

Caldwell's DeadShot FieldPod Max is constructed of rugged, easily portable, lightweight aluminum, allowing you to take a rock-solid rest into the field so you can confidently pull down on that buck trying to sneak out of range. Adjustable height from 20"" to 48"" is perfect whether you're kneeling for a shot at a bull of a lifetime or lining up on a wise old whitetail from a ground blind. Plus, since each leg adjusts independently, it's easy to use the bubble reference to ensure a perfectly level shooting platform. Supports the weight of your firearm at both the forend and the stock, enhancing both accuracy and safety. Innovative design is compatible with crossbows, rifles and shotguns so you can take it along during every season from spring turkeys to late-season muzzleloader deer. Dual-tube frame doesn't get in the way of detachable magazines. Carry strap included.

This is identical to the larger .380acp variant with the exception of 2oz of slide weight. This was my training pistol for a bit since I carry a Bersa .380 but I find that I just end up shooting the .380 more anyway.

This is a great pistol for anyone looking for a light concealed carry piece or just a fun plinker. The full-feeling grip and adjustable 3-dot sights make this a really shootable gun for its size. The grip is a bit larger than a Walther P22's and unlike many .22lr pistols made today the slide is steel and not some zinc alloy. Google ""P22 cracked slide"" if you want to know why zinc alloys are bad.

Magazine capacity is 10 rounds and three (3) magazines are included with the gun. Trigger is DA/SA.

I am not interested in trades and I will not give my phone number until a deal has been reached. The price is firm at this time and I am located in Stillwater. I am very responsive to emails and check them multiple times a day.

H-S Precision sets the standard in performance and quality when it comes to stocks. Each stock features a 3-piece design. At the heart of every H-S Precision Stock is a CAD/CAM designed CNC machined aluminum bedding block chassis. The shell of each stock is comprised of woven Kevlar™ cloth, woven fiberglass cloth, uni-directional carbon fiber, an epoxy-based gel coat and a laminating resin. The core of the stock is reaction-injection-molded polyurethane foam and reinforced with fiberglass. The aluminum bedding block requires a simple tightening of the bedding screws to secure the action to the bedding block. No messy bedding compounds or time consuming work involved.

Finally, a .22 LR tactical training rifle that looks, feels and handles like its full-size counterpart. The ARX160 is a rimfire version of the ARX100, Beretta’s celebrated .223 Rem tactical rifle. But aside from the caliber, this .22 LR rifle is virtually identical to the centerfire version as far as operations, controls, accessorization and customization options. A training rifle that will never let you down, the ARX160 is an extra-durable piece of gear that will satisfy even the most demanding tactical shooter.


Ambidextrous Controls

A serious training rifle should always mirror the “real thing” in the way its controls work. This is why the ARX160 features ambidextrous two-position safety, magazine release and cocking handle. With this rifle, you can easily train and shoot with either hand dominant and improve your skills without breaking the bank.


Limitless Accessorization, Customization Options

This training rifle is a great base for building the tactical system of your dreams. It comes out of the box with four Picatinny rails: on top, a full rail enables you to easily attach your favorite sighting or optics system, while on either side and on the bottom of the fore-end additional rails let you add other accessories such as tactical lighting. Other customization options include the telescopic folding stock: you can adjust the length of pull at the touch of a button, while the stock can be folded partially or all the way to accommodate most firing situations.



Durable, Easy to Shoot and Maintain

The ARX160 is built to be durable and super-tough, being constructed of superior steel and technopolymer. Its flip-up sights are just like those on the full-caliber rifle—super-light but rugged, and featuring a rear diopter for quick and accurate target acquisition. Maintenance is easy thanks to the simple way in which it comes apart and is reassembled without any tools. Whether you use it on its own as a rimfire tactical rifle, or as a training tool to improve your handling of the full-power counterpart, the ARX160 will always turn heads at the range and will never let you down."

The Springfield Armory XD Service Model pistol is an outstanding choice for duty or personal defense. It has a comfortable feel in the hand and ""points"" naturally. Trigger reset is positive and gives both tactile and audible feedback, contributing to faster follow up shots. This polymer framed striker fired handgun is equipped with a grip safety and Springfield's Ultra Safety Assurance (U.S.A.) action trigger system, along with tactile/visual cocked and loaded chamber indicators. Felt recoil and muzzle ""flip"" are both reduced by the V-10 ported barrel. The XD-40 is a perfect example of a pistol that works with your body, not against you. The natural pointability of the XD, combined with the compact size and shape of its polymer grip, makes it feel more like a natural extension of your body than an object in your hand.
