Normal wear, and not a lot of it either. Wood, metal, and bluing are all in perfect shape. Any ""blemish"" in the pictures is just oil. Very good quality shotgun. The wood is a bit darker than in the pictures, it just looks brighter because of camera flash and lighting.

The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs."" This one was made for the friends of NRA and had a special Sig Sauer Pelican case, 3, 15 round magazines, 2, 18 round magazines, a Sig double mag carrier and a Tagua quick draw holster. Some other added features on this one is a special NRA UID military identification label, as well as a short reset trigger that has been lightened to 3 lbs in SA and 6 lbs I'd DA.

Cleaned after each range trip. Includes all original accessories/XD gear, as well as two additional 13rd magazines with #1 X-tensions (for a total of one 10rd standard mag and three 13rd extended mags). 

Also up on the block is 1472rd of .45ACP ammunition: 1175rd 230gr FMJ + 69rd 230gr JHP Federal Hydra-Shok + 228rd 230gr (+P) JHP Federal HST. The FMJ is a combination of Federal, Remington, and Winchester. 

I am looking to consolidate my calibers and am doing away with my much beloved .45ACP. I know what I paid and what it's worth. I'm not going to charge you new/more than new prices for a pre-owned gun (amazing how many people here on armslist try that.) I'm not looking to make any money on this, but I won't give it away either. I will consider selling the XD(m) minus the ammo, but not the other way around.

As for trades, the only firearms I will consider are an equal condition XD(m) 9mm 3.8"" compact, Glock 19 gen 4, or Glock 23 gen 4. Of course, ammo for ammo trades are welcomed (kill two birds with one stone).

Thanks for looking. FTF only. Cash only. Some travel will be considered for the right deal. No shipping or out of state transactions. Must have a WI license (CCW preferred) and complete a bill of sale/trade."

 Price is:

 .38 Special 100 rds 6.00
 .40 S&W 100 rds 6.00
 .45 ACP 100 rds 7.90
 If you want it cleaned and polished, I will do it for .02 a round.
Nickel Plated is also .02 more than un-cleaned brass.

 I'll ship it to your front door by USPS priority mail. I use the ""if fits it ships"" priority mail boxes: You can ship twice as much 9mm as .45 acp in the same box, but generally as a rule:
 100-200 pcs will cost 5.80 to ship.
 200-2000 pcs will cost 12.65 to ship.
 1500-4000 pcs will cost 16.50 to ship.
Plus Insurance.

 Your welcome to mix and match any quantity of any size. Example:
 500 pcs each of, 9mm, .40 S&W and .45ACP = 1500 pcs and would ship for 12.65.

 If you reload several sizes, than you will do well here, You can mix your numbers any way you want.

 Payment: I prefer PAY-PAL, but I have a store front business and take credit card orders over the phone every day but Sunday and if need be will take a money order. If you prefer a personal check that is fine also, but it will delay your shipment till it clears the bank. 

 Swap: I love to swap. I am a gun enthusiast, re-loader, hunter, and all around outdoorsman. I will swap you for any gun you are not using, or ammo you have no gun to shoot it out of anymore, or about anything else. I like it all. I am a fair trader and will give you fair market value on whatever you might have to trade. All you can do is ask, and I’ll I can say is yes, or no, but it doesn’t hurt to ask.

 E-mail me at: mwandrla@yahoo.com and I’ll be glad to give you any information you may want including my phone number to call me at.

I fired it for the first time yesterday and it's a nice accurate shooter. Manufactured in 1979. It has a few scratches and the bottom of the grips show some wear. However, it doesn't seem to actually been fired much at all, although there's a turn ring on the cylinder. There's zero flame burn on the top of the frame. There's a light scratch behind the recoil shield on the left side and three tiny dings on the right front of the barrel. I tried to show the imperfections in the pics. The marks aren't all that noticeable. The pics also make the flaws look worse than they are.

The trigger pull in double action is stagey, but in single action it's like glass breaking and wonderfully fast and clean. The trigger pull is what leads me to believe that it hasn't really been shot much. I think it was carried a bit and not used. There's no holster wear at all. There may be some freckling starting on the frame, or it just might be my old eyes. All the white specks are T-shirt lint.

$400. FTF in Grants Pass.

The gun has about 200 rounds through it before it was cleaned and placed inside the safe. It was refinished from matte to a mirror finish and has an awesome trigger job done by gunsmith. The firearm has a full set of wolf springs so you can set it to whatever trigger pull weight you prefer. It also comes with a hogue mono grip and the stock grips. It also has its original box and all original paper work.

Its a ton of fun to shoot and will miss it dearly but it has to go due to some financial troubles.

I have about $870 in the revolver as of now ( Ruger = $583 (with tax), polishing to mirror finish = $200, trigger job = $70, hogue grip = $25)

The first picture was prior all the work and the rest are obviously after. Thanks for reading, please don't hesitate to ask any questions.

I have had one person be very offensive under the assumption I should sell my ammo for the store price or less. Apparently working for the money to buy my gun is a horrible thing for a young man to do. I guess some people would rather me steal it, borrow it or wish for it. I'm doing you a service. You need ammo and I'm doing the dirty work driving around to find it all morning while you sleep. If you don't like it, well I guess I'll see you in line at 5am. 

The following is what I have and the price I'm asking. Please feel free to make me an offer but I have these priced at what I see in the market for those of you that don't want to get up early and stand in line hoping they'll be getting them in. If you want store costs again I'll see you in line. If you want to offer me less feel free. Your helping me and I'm helping you.

My old one has wood permanently attached to it (I tried getting it off but don't want to damage it further) so am in need of a second one. Don't care where is from as long as it isn't rusty.


Edit: Yes, I know how to take off a gas tube, thank you for the how-tos. I cannot remove the wood I have on it at this point without damaging it as it is already beginning to splinter when I try. I'd rather not break it."

300 Rounds through the gun. No problems with it at all, he picked it up in a trade, and would prefer an M&P40 or to sell it to buy a new 1911.

Would prefer to keep it local to Harrisburg/york/etown areas. But will drive upto an hour to meet.

Asking 525$ cash or try to work a trade for an M&P40 full size or maybe 40 pro size.

Im also selling 40 ammo, and extra mags in their respectable listings. Can work out a deal if you wanted any of those items while they are still for sale.

Buyer pays all fees, As it obviously must be transfered at an FFL.
