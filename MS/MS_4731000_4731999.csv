Also would be interested in a .44 similar to these, both in style and cost, as I'm sure there are many different types out there.

I would also consider a Ruger Black Hawk Hunter with the 7.5"" barrel. (Bisley or regular edition). 

I have cash, a valid PTC and can meet anywhere in the metro for the right deal. 

I have 2 revolvers to trade for or towards one of the above if that is more of interest. A windicator .357 6 shot, 4"" barrel with just under 50 rounds through it, great shooter with no issues, just want the .44. The other is a 9 shot .22 revolver with 2.5"" barrel, also good shooter with no problems. I can send photos of the .22 on request, the Windicator is listed here on Armslist.

This M-1 replica is an awesome weapon and it’s cheap to run because it’s chambered in 9mm. It’s been to the range one time – and then my husband discovered the CZ Scorpion and decided to sell the Chiappa to buy up to the Scorpion. Nothing wrong with it – it was bought brand new by us and has maybe 50 rounds through it. It was cleaned before and after its one trip to the range and comes with the original box, manual, lock and two 10-round magazines.

The M1 carbine is a lightweight, easy to use semi-automatic carbine that became a standard ﬁrearm for the U.S. military during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and was produced in several variants. It was widely used by U.S. and foreign military, paramilitary and police forces, and has also been a popular civilian ﬁrearm. A total of over 6.5 million M1 carbines of various models were manufactured, making it the most produced small arm for the American military during World War II. The Chiappa Firearms’ M1 series is a fine replica of the M1 carbine, featuring a blowback system and an adjustable rear sight, which can be removed to leave guides free for optics mount. The barrel and bolt are made of solid steel, the trigger guard and magazine of polymer. Components are CNC machined and are interchangeable with original M1 parts. The 10-rd magazine is compatible with that of Beretta 92 pistol."

This is a used FNX 40 bi-tone in great condition. The gun is mechanically perfect, no issues. I ran a box of JHP through it and every shot was perfect. The gun does have some wear on the top and bottom of the barrel from use, but the frame and slide are cosmetically perfect and the barrel does not show heavy use. One thing that I really liked about this gun is that it has full ambidextrous controls, safety/decocker, mag-release and even the slide release.

I got this as part of another trade and I am not a .40 S&W guy, so this has to go to make room for something else. Gun is very clean, bore is super bright and everything looks great inside and out. Shot very well and if it does not sell soon, I think I have a family member that wants to buy it off me.

This is a genuine Colt AR-15, not a home-built rifle. I have made some slight upgrades to the gun, but they are all ""bolt-on"" and are minimalistic and assist in the control and usability of the gun. I have used high quality parts throughout, no UTG or Baraska here. All internals are stock and have not been touched.

This gun has only had about 200 rounds run through it. I've only ever taken it out to the range twice. For some reason the AR platform just isn't my thing for a small caliber rifle like this, and I find myself shooting my TAVOR or AKs more. This mostly just sits in my safe.

I do not feel like dealing with parting this out, so it will go with the optics and the light as well as all other mentioned parts.. I have all the stock parts (grip and charging handle) and they will come with the gun, along with any paperwork I can find and the manual. This gun is in excellent shape. I have always kept it excessively clean after both uses and it has almost no cosmetic wear, since it has seen so little use.

Let me know if you have any questions. Also, please check out my other ads. I will cut you a better deal on all items if you want more than one thing."

This is a very nice example of a Saiga AK-47. As most know these are now illegal to import and only will only gain value over the years. This example is un-converted and in factory order and I am including 3 magazines, 1 original 5 rd, and 2 converted 30 rounders for your pleasure. They all work and feed fine, although I have only fired this a very few times. This is as good as it comes, it is in perfect conditions and working order. These will be impossible to find, very soon and is a bargain priced weapon at this price

I prefer not to engage in any kind of website comparison, pricing war or conversation about finding it cheaper. I am selling as advertised but will listen to reasonable offers. 

I am just trying to reverse finance some other projects and need to thin the herd a little. If it doesn't sell or nothing peaks my interest I don't mind putting her back in the safe. I also have other firearms and miscellaneous related items I will be listing soon as well so keep your eyes open for some other cool stuff."

As far as I know, this knife never went into production and I have never been able to find another one out in the world or even digging around online. The blade is about 4"" long and is made of AUS8A steel, it has a DLC type coating on it, but I cannot be exactly sure of the coating since it was a factory sample. It has the KERSHAW and DESIGN by KEN ONION markings on the blade. Then handles are a hard polymer, but actually feel very good in the hand, similar to a GEN 3 Glock. The overall shape and design are top notch, not sure why this one never went into production. The knife comes with a knydex sheath that is stamped with KERSHAW on the back. A friend of mine picked this knife up directly from Ken Onion for me about 10 years back. It's seen some light duty around the house, but nothing more serious than cutting open a box or two. Cosmetically it's probably a 90% with very light wear on the hard edges of the blade. I would prefer to trade this to another collector, since it's rare in the knife world. The materials aren't anything special, so it's hard to put a price on something like this. I think what I have listed as far as cash value goes is fair, but I would prefer to trade this one, if I can. Please see my other ads. I am cleaning out a lot of nice knives and other items.

This is the hunters point model with the additional rear serrations (or leg grabbers as the TOPS guys call them). This thing is a BEAST from tip to tail. It has gray/charcoal micata scales that are perfectly matched to the tang. This knife is super overbuilt and designed to withstand anything that you can throw at it. I have never carried or used this knife, as I tend to use my Ontario RTAK-II as my goto. IMO this knife is much nicer than the Ontario, made with better quality materials and much cleaner machining, but for some reason my RTAK has never failed me and I just can't replace it. The TOPS comes with a ballistic nylon sheath with kydex insert. It's a MOLE compatible sheath and it very well made. I also have a certificate of authenticity that I might be able to dig up for this bad boy. I'm selling this for way below retail and even undercutting the Amazon.com price on this one because I simply don't need another knife of this form factor. Check out my other ads.

Btw, Below is some history of the police pc4:

The Ruger Police Carbine is a pistol caliber carbine designed as a companion to the Ruger P Series pistols. It is a semi-automatic carbine using a blowback action. The Carbine uses the same ammunition and magazines as the Ruger P Series .40 S&W caliber pistols.

Both the PC4 (.40 S&W) is patterned after the highly successful Ruger 10/22 carbine. The Carbine is intended as a shoulder weapon for police use, although it is available for sale to civilians as well. The intent is that an officer will carry a Ruger P Series pistol as a sidearm, and keep a Carbine available (for example, in his/her patrol vehicle) as a shoulder weapon if needed. Since the carbine has a 16-inch (410 mm) barrel, it provides more power with the same ammunition used by the 4-inch (100 mm) barreled pistol. The carbine also provides additional accuracy and range over the pistol.

The Carbine has some unique design features. The action is a simple blowback design, which requires a fairly massive bolt to handle the pressure of the .40 S&W. To prevent the gun from being too unbalanced by the large bolt, the bolt consists of two parts; the main body of the bolt is fairly light and located in the receiver, while the other part is just a weight located under the forend of the carbine. These two parts are held together by strong, rigid steel bars. The combined mass serves to hold the breech safely closed during firing, while keeping the center of gravity forward, so the gun handles well. 

In addition to caliber, the Carbine also comes with a choice in sights. The standard model uses notch and post sights, while the GR models are equipped with ghost ring sights. The ghost ring sights cost more, but they are generally considered better for defensive purposes, as they allow faster sighting under poor lighting conditions plus a longer sight radius for greater potential accuracy. The Carbine also has Ruger style scope bases built into the receiver, allowing optical sights to be easily and securely mounted."

The front trailer axle was a new build replacement at a cost of $350, said to be rated at 3,500 pounds. I do not know the rating of the rear axle.

The Trim Tab fluid reservoir is small and consumes a small amount of fluid that has to be topped off, when the level drops. I do not know how long it takes to consume enough to affect operation of the trim tabs.

From web:
The A-100 resembles the SIG P228 and is similar in overall size and dimension, but differs in several respects, the most visible being the location of the take-down/disassembly lever on the right side of the frame (from the shooter's point of view) as compared to the SIG design, in which it is located on the left. The A-100 is also slightly heavier than the SIG, owing to its all-steel construction. Additionally, the A-100's chamber contour as visible when the slide is fully forward is rounded whereas the SIG design is squared. The configuration of the hammer is also different, with the A-100 having a rounded hammer provided with a lanyard hole and the SIG having a more conventional spur hammer. Magazines are not interchangeable between the A-100 and SIG pistols, however many holsters made for the SIG P229/228 fit the A-100 satisfactorily."

There's a few light scratches at the tip of the barrel, probably from keeping it in the backpack, but overall in very good shape. You probably know that these frames were designed to take the force of a 454 casull, so 44 mag is a walk in the park.

I had the trigger worked over to ""lightest safely possible"" which is somewhere under a pound. I have put about 300 handloaded rounds through it and it shoots very well. The scope isn't anything special, just a Chinese 6-24x50. I also have a Dereelight Nightmaster scope mounted light with red, green and white interchangeable LED ""bulbs.""  With this light, I have shot coyotes at 250 yards at night.  I really like this rifle but I got my regular coyote rifle back and am funding another build.

Light will come on automatically when a shot is fired (shock sensor activates it) or via the grip button.

I bought it new and figured it was the perfect gun for the coyotes that were harassing our livestock.  But once I got it, for the next 12 years I never got a shot off; they left Dodge, must have known I had their number.  So I put less than 50 rounds through it doing target practice and sighting it in.   The other 99.9% of the time it guarded the underside of my bed.  It’s in perfect condition, just like it came out if the box.  I’ve sold the ranch, can’t use it (legally) in this gated community, so I’m looking for someone who can put it to good use.  We both know what it’s worth, be the first to make me a reasonable offer close to my asking price and it’s yours."

I would say, (conservatively) that this is in 95 to 98% condition. I am the original owner and I have shot it right at 40 times in its life. I have given it periodical cleanings over the years. The trigger is buttery smooth and the finish is like Smith used to put on a gun.. gorgeous deep blue. I never carried it in a holster so there is no holster wear on it and it has light turn rings on the cylinder. It also has the all black target sights with the front being a Patridge style. I worked up a good handload for it and remember it being an extremely accurate revolver. I have another model 19 and a couple of 66's and just do not shoot or need this one. It has been in my safe for the last 12 years. I originally purchased this revolver around 1974 (give or take a year) It still has the original Smith box with it and the registration card. If you think you see a smudge on the finish, it is just from the silicon cloth cleaning I gave it right before I took the pictures cuz this finish is in near mint condition with no scratches of any sort. This is a GREAT collectible shooter. It would be awesome for deer hunting and could easily be sighted in for a 50 to 75 yard shot. Also with a bit of gunsmith work you could mount an optic very easily on it for much longer range. The barrel is in excellent condition as well. If you'd like additional pictures or would like to see it just message me. Thanks for looking and God bless!"
