Manufactured by L3 Insight, the makers of eotech sights, this thermal handheld monocular is amazing for finding living heat signatures in total darkness or in full sunlight. This unit is about the size of a can of beer and weighs under 12 ounces. It has 2 power zoom and white hot/black hot functions. The IR laser works great for two man teams. The person with thermal can scan an area and if they find a heat signature they can use the invisible IR laser to show a team member using night vision where the heat is located. If you ever night hog or coyote hunt, these will up your game. Or even use them to spot other game pre dawn. The tactical applications are endless. 
Includes all the original accessories including remote pressure switch for IR laser and down loading cable to transfer still photos from the unit to your computer.

2 original Taurus 12 round mags. I put electrical tape on the lower part of the mags because they have a bit of wobble when inserted into the gun. (Doesn't affect performance but I think it's annoying)

But, they’re usually pretty expensive and the value doesn’t keep going up, just down. It’s a lot like driving a car off the lot.
I recommend a Makarov or a Makarov type of pistol. They’re more powerful, hold more ammo (higher capacity) and much more accurate than any .380 and they’re as powerful as, maybe even more powerful than as 38 Special Snub noses. The 38 special long barrels and 38 special +P are a little more powerful, though. But, the Maks are much more accurate and also have a higher capacity. And, since Maks are Military and Police Grade weapons, they never jam. No failure to feed or eject. 38 special snub noses and 380 don’t get enough speed coming out the short barrels to expand hollow points. So you might has well be shooting FMJ.
I have a very rare German Makarov ($600) and a FEG PA-63 ($350).  Both shoot the great 9 X 18 Makarov ammo. Academy has round nose FMJ, box of 50 for $10.99 and Hornedy JHP box of 20 or 25 for $20. So, ammo is no longer hard to find. Maks price are going up and up and up.  Go to gunbroker.com. Enter Makarov.  They’re cheap. That is until the last day or hours of the bids. Then you’ll see how much they really cost. Then you add taxes, shipping and the cost of getting the gun from a FFL. You can add another $80 to $100 to the shown cost.
I’m open to offers or trade, but don’t get ridiculous. 
Armslist will only allow me to upload one picture. So if you want a picture of The FEG PA-63, you can either look further on Armslist (I have it posted separately), or you can request it, and I'll send it to you."

Starting with a Limited Deluxe, takedown Winchester 1886, Turnbull converted this modern rifle to its original platform, making it a TRUE Winchester 1886 Deluxe takedown. To do so, the good folks at Turnbull Mfg. removed the top tang safety and filled the opening—eliminating the tang safety. They then converted the hammer to the original half-cock style safety notch, and the firing pin was converted, too. The receiver, hammer, lever and forend cap are finished with traditional Bone Charcoal Color Case Hardening. Some of the finer parts were then fire-blued. In addition to the coloring, the rifle received their trademark flattop rear sight, an option that helps in quick sight acquisition. To top it off, the stocks are Grade III/IV Fancy Walnut with the traditional Winchester H-Pattern. This is truly work of art and a steal at the asking price. The pictures do not do it justice. Barrel is 26” and is chambered in 45-70."

Ive owned both multiple 10/22 takedowns and multiple marlin papoose' and i must say , this gun fits the 'survival' backpacking rifle bill over the 10/22. Nutnfancy says the same in his review on this gun.  Its just so much lighter and more compact. Stainless steel.  Very reliable, accurate etc..  Not junk like the henry ar7. Have only fired this gun about 50 rds. I have several and figure id see if anyone wants to trade for somthing else. .

The Type II Model A has a nickel-finish, a striker-fired, single-action 6.35 cal, with a six-round magazine capacity.   A unique feature on the first variant of the Type II Model A is the design of the firing pin spring guide, which has a small pin projecting at a right angle from its rear section.  This pin locks into a recess in the top of the slide and prevents the striker and spring from flying out when the slide is removed froom the frame.

The pistol has some wear on the nickel plating and could use a deep cleaning.  Other than those minor cosmetic issues, it is in excellent working order.  It has been fired within the last year and comes with a 50 round (minus 4 ) box of .25 cal ammunition.   I am asking $250 (OBO)"

The EOLAD-1V is a state-of-the-art sighting system that combines the battle-proven benefits of the EOTech 552.A65 HWS with the pinpoint accuracy of an integral aiming laser module. The holographic reticle of the 552 sight allows the operator to employ the preferred heads-up-both-eyes-open combat stance, while the aiming laser provides visual confirmation for surgically precise shot-placement.
Because the integral laser system is powered by the 552's battery, The EOLAD delivers all the speed and stealth of the 552 HWS, with only a marginal increase in size and weight.

This particular EOLAD is configured with a 635 nm visible aiming laser."

The XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact Model is an amazingly slim and ergonomic pistol that packs even more amazing capacity. Featuring the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact is a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry.From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact is a pistol that squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry’s slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact offers 9+1 rounds of .45ACP or 13+1 rounds with an X-Tension™ magazine. This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3” barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal.Like all XD®s, the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol.And of course, GripZone™ ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2™ apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you’ll probably find that you’ve got a new favorite to carry."

Is it possible for a pistol small enough to carry every day to have all the features and capacity that you’d expect in a larger pistol? If that pistol is the XD-S® from Springfield Armory®, the answer is yes. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack 9mm offers so much that you’ll be astonished that it all fits in the small, concealable profile.
The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Use your XD-S® Single Stack with an X-Tension™ magazine and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there.
If you’re looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in 9mm. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

The rifle is unfired ands complete with a brand new Bravo Company KMR hand guard upon a standard M4 upper receiver. Some people jump to conclusion about the strength of the magnesium alloy used in the lower receiver and hand guard, but since they are not in any way associated with the force generated by round in the chamber, I assure you there is no danger. The rifle is unfired and is complete with a brand new Bravo Company KMR hand guard upon a standard M4 upper receiver. I went ahead and used a standard M4 receiver instead of a magnesium one to add strength where it counts. This rifle is similarly priced to those on Mag Tactical's website, but way better looking and just as light. I did not have the trigger installed in this rifle for the pictures, as it had just been cerakoted and was not installed at the time; it will come with a mil-spec NiB trigger group installed to match the NiB FailZero bolt carrier group.

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!
Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver."

Shoots increadibly well, though I purchased it more as a wall-hanger than a shooter.  It's a piece of Americana that every red-blooded commie-hating flag-waving American aught to own.

Comes with the Viking Tacticals sling you see on it and I'll include 5 en-bloc clips for the gun.

The PPU stuff is loaded with 150 gr spitzer bullets and matches the pressure of original M2 ball almost exactly, so you won't damage the gun.

Price is 1200$ for the gun, price is firm.  It's an exceptionally nice Garand for that money, and no import marks.  I can meet in Raleigh, Cary, Apex or Durham, or ship on your dime if you'd like to have it sent.  You'll need a NC DL for local pickup."
