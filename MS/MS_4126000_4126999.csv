Advice:
If you actually wanna sell, stop asking what you bought it for, and cut your losses. Armslist is filled with overpriced stuff as it is...

PS: I wouldn't be surprised if these people were the same asshats who spend every morning going store to store buying up all the 22lr just to sell it for twice what they paid for it on here. Just a theory ;)

Thanks for reading my rant."

 Fairfax, Va. – The National Rifle Association (NRA) was instrumental in stalling the Obama Administration's initial attempt to ban commonly used ammunition for the most popular rifle in America, the AR-15. The announcement that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) will suspend its proposed framework to ban M855 ammunition validates the NRA's assertion that this effort was nothing more than a political maneuver to bypass Congress and impose gun control on the American people. 

""Today's announcement proves what we have said all along – this was 100% political. President Obama failed to pass gun control through Congress, so he tried to impose his political agenda through executive fiat. But every gun owner in America needs to understand Barack Obama's hatred of the Second Amendment has not changed,"" said Wayne La Pierre, Executive Vice President of the National Rifle Association. 

Chris Cox, Executive Director of NRA-ILA criticized the dishonest campaign to ban this common ammunition: ""The lies used to justify the ban were shameful. This proposal was never about law enforcement safety – it was about the Obama Administration's desire to pander to billionaire Michael Bloomberg and his gun control groups.  Since they haven't been able to ban America's most popular rifle, they are trying to ban the ammunition instead.""

Since the BATFE announced its plan to ban commonly used ammunition less than a month ago, the NRA rallied its five million members and tens of millions of supporters across the country in strong opposition.  In addition, the NRA worked with congressional leaders in both the U.S. House and Senate to oppose this misguided proposal.  

""The NRA would like to thank House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and House Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman John Culberson for leading the fight against this unconstitutional attack on our Second Amendment freedoms,"" continued Cox.  ""This was a significant victory for our five million members and tens of millions of supporters across the country. 

""Make no mistake, this fight is not over. We will remain vigilant and continue to fight against President Obama's attempt to dismantle the Second Amendment,"" concluded LaPierre."

Right now, there are a lot of scams on Armslist.  I'm sure they are doing their best here on the site to take them down as fast as possible, but it is still very important to be careful.  When I logged on this morning and searched under the ""over and under"" section, 8 of the first 10 posts of the day were clearly scams.  This is a crazy amount and makes it hard for people to actually find a ""real seller"" to buy a gun.

Things to look for in identifing a scam:

1) Price - they are almost always way too cheap to be a real deal.  If a gun is listed for 50% of its value, its probably a scam.

2) Listing the location twice - I have noticed that almost all the scams will have the location listed twice.  For example, it might say ""LaCrosse, LaCrosse, Wisconsin"", or ""Madison, Madison, Wisconsin"" or even ""Wisconsin, Wisconsin"".  This does not always mean it is a scam, but it is a large red flag.

3) Phone contact - Always attempt to make phone contact with someone.  Scammers love to hide behind an email.  Also, dont give your phone number to them, request the seller give theirs to you.  A true seller will have no problem with this, scammers will not usually give you a number.

4) If ever possible, meet face to face - This is the obvious way to avoid any fraud."

By popular demand, Buffalo Bore is introducing five new 38 Super+P loads. With three different expanding loads and two penetrating loads, we have covered the basis of anything you'd like to accomplish with the 38 Super+P cartridge. These are full power 38 Super+P loads. All five of these loads feature flash suppressed powders so the shooter will not be blinded if firing in low light. Feeding, function and accuracy was very good in all three of our test pistols.

I am primarily looking to trade, I will only consider selling at market value so please no low ball offers.  I have the following available:

- Colt Series 80 1911 Pin Gun - Gun was set up as a bowling pin gun (race gun) in the 90's, it has been worked over in most possible ways, including a trigger job, flared magwell, threaded barrel with compensator, drilled scope mount with newer Tasco Pro Point red dot, hogue grips.  Super accurate and very light on the recoil. Also comes with original Colt barrel, several Chip McCormick mags (5?) original grips, wood grips, and a bunch of spare parts and springs.

- Kel-Tec PF9 9mm pistol.  New in box, has been handled and mag loaded, but never fired. 

- Thompson / Center Venture, 30-06 bolt action rifle.  Guaranteed 1 MOA accuracy or better from the factory, has been fired less than 50 times.

- Hi-Point 9mm Carbine - original model before the current design, is outfitted with the Beretta CX4 style stock from ATI.  Really fun gun, super reliable.  I have a 10 round mag and I think a 15 rounder also (I will need to check).  Comes with pic rail as well as stock iron sights.  A little rough around the edges but would make a great range toy or truck gun.  Has probably less than 250 rounds through it."

This pocket rocket has performed well, but want to slim the herd down. The gun is a little less than a year old, has nightsights, melt down, front strap checkering, and awesome grips. The gun is as advertised, to shoot large grain 9mm only.  I have shot about 200 rounds through the gun. MagTech 147, 124 NATO, and Hornady 125 steel match, as well as 124 Federal HST for personal defense. It will not cycle 115gr or lesser 124 ammo. It is a handful to shoot and since it is so ammo specific it is not a range gun, Shoot it a little each time you go out and that is about what I can stand. Very accurate though! The gun comes with factory box etc, I include 4 extra mags and a Desantis pocket holster. I am the original owner. You must be legal to own and willing to sign a bill of sale. Will meet reasonable distance. Thanks for looking, no trades as I already ordered a 1911 9mm."

For a cost of about $100 it can be smelted down to a bar of pure 24k gold in the weight of about 1.9756 ounce. Market value of it is about $2300 depending on when you do the calculations. 

With gold value always changing I'm setting my trade value at $1600. If I get a chance to take my gold to the smelter before trading it off the price will change. I just wanted to try listing it before I smelt and ell it outright. 

No I will not just sell the gold as is. My plan is to try to trade it or next week I'm going to smelt it and have it poured into a solid 2 ounce bar.

Now for what I'm looking for. I'm really looking for guns, AR's, bolt actions, lever actions, pistols. I will also trade for ammo, reloading supplies, gun safes, hunting equipment. As for specifics..... I'm looking for a 458 socom, 50 beuwolf, 338 federal, 454 casull revolvers, single action 357's, Winchester model 70's, Remington 700's, 1911's, 338 lapua, long range 308 or 300 win mag. I'm sure there's a lot more so email me any trade offers."

With mold, you get 582 bullets. These bullets were cast from pure clip on wheel weight lead and quenched after casting and powder coating for a harder bullet. This is a project that got shut down before it even started. This mold design is intended for 7.62x39 but is used by many for use in other calibers. This bullet was not a keeper for use in my 300 blackout so Im just sticking with a heavy 230 grain bullet.

The mold casts pure clip on wheel weight alloy  at .3105-.311"". I have casted about 700 bullets with the mold.

Bullets included with this mold:

260 As cast, water dropped .3105-.311 diameter

It is a True Jungle Carbine, not a put-together from a number one or number four.  Notice the ""lightened"" bolt etc. - research a bit so you don't get screwed buying one that has been converted! [I just did a search on ""armslist"" - most if not all are ""made-up"" jungle carbines!]  I have used it for my ""Bad Weather"" Deer Rifle for about the last 20 years or so.  It was packed with cosmoline when I first got it - I think it's about gone now!  It has an import stamp just behind the flash hider on the barrel, and I think this one made it through to the US from Maylasia, which was sold surplus from the UK after WWII.  The bluing is in pretty decent shape, but the stock finish is a bit scratched up - nothing deep.  It should refinish nicely - I don't sand the stocks on my guns, as I like to keep them as original as possible.  I think the Mayays kept them in a gymnasium sized room and tossed them from one side to the other every two or three years or so, accounting for the stock scratches.  It's in pretty nice shape otherwise.  The bore is excellent.  I have never had a bit of trouble with the ""wandering zero"".  I find it to be very accurate myself, and my Hornady 150 grain loads print 3"" high at 100 yards with the open battle peep sight, and a nice, tight cluster.  I managed to shoot my 2nd largest buck with this rifle - a running shot at ~ 7 seconds after he came running over a hill, and was about to disappear over the next one!  I was able to shoulder quick, acquire the sight picture and shoot within that 7 seconds.  I also have a spare magazine (Savage marked) for an extra $50, and if you need dies, reloadable brass and bullets, that's available too.  If it sells, I'll miss it - I think it is about the perfect hunting rifle, more or less like the ""new"" Ruger Scout rifle, only with history!  Keep it in good shape, and the value will only go up!  Ignore the ""Springfield"" Manufacturing listing.  They don't have a listing for Military Rifles - no Enfield or Fazakerly etc."

All online reviews of the Summit re-mfg.'d French BMG are good from what I could find. I have reached out to Summit for more info on them like ME, MV, primer and powder specs, etc. and will update this listing if I get any more info.

Prefer to sell all 300 rounds in one go, I have it packed up 150 rounds in a .50cal ammo can, 150 rounds just fills one can if the rounds are stacked neatly.
I am willing to ship at buyers expense but would prefer a local FTF sale for simplicity.

I will trade two rounds of BMG for one round of M855.... what? Not banned now? Nevermind on the M855 trade, cash only :)

Asking $1000 OBO for for all 300 rounds, comes with 2 .50cal ammo cans.
Willing to sell just one can, but I don't really want to sell less than 150 rounds at a time."

There were only 1,000 of these imported and sold.  This one is in EXCELLENT condition.  It does not appear to have ever been fired.  It has the original hard shell case, 2 factory 10 round magazines and original literature.  

These do not become available very often due to the small amount that were imported.

Roughly 1000 of these Swiss made ASAI One Pro .45's were imported by Magnum Research in either .45 ACP or .400 Corbon.  Pictures are of exactly what you will receive!

Designed by Martin Tuma for Advanced Small Arms Industries (ASAI) in Solothurn, Switzerland, it is manufactured by Oerlikon in Zurich, Switzerland and imported by Magnum Research of Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Aimed initially at meeting the demanding requirements of Special Operations Command units, the One Pro 45 pistol will no doubt find favor with civilian fans of “big-bore” double action semi-automatic pistols. The One Pro 45 combines proven short-recoil operation, all-steel construction and large caliber with a modern single-action/double
action trigger, a frame mounted decocking lever and a patented, automatic firing pin safety. Accuracy and service life are enhanced by the full length rails—interior on the frame and exterior on the slide—and the slide and frame of chromium nickel- molybdenum steel.

Out of the box, the One Pro 45 offers one of the best trigger pulls for a factory pistol. Single-action pulls are light and crisp with very little slack or creep. Double-action pulls are of moderate weight with linear loading and a predictable, crisp let-off. No doubt accuracy is greatly enhanced by the excellent qualities of the trigger.

ASAI claims that the One Pro 45 will find favor among shooters with small hands. Despite the double-column magazine, the girth of the grip frame remains comfortable for the small handed. Shooting comfort is enhanced by a slight recurve at the bottom of the grip frame and recurved magazine floorplate extensions. Stocks are two-piece molded, black polymer with a lightly marbled outer surface.
