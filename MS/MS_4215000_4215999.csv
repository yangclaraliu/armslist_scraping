The M&P is in good shape, and will come with all of the factory stuff, box, backstraps, two factory 17 round magazines that came with it and an extra for 3 magazines total.  Also has factory night sights on it with plenty of life left and it has had some trigger work done on it, so it is a bit smoother and lighter and breaks much better than a stock M&P trigger.

Absolutely no problems with it, I'm just wanting something a bit more compact for carry purposes.  I would like to trade for a similarly equipped Gen 4 Glock 19 with night sights and a like number of mags.  Would still consider a Gen 3 if it has the features mentioned above.

Rifle is in great shape for its age,  has a very smooth action,  good rifling,  and shoots great.  Also, this was not imported by CAI but the actual importer (PW Arms of Redmond, Washington) was not an option. 

Ill take $200 FIRM for the rifle and 100rnds of ammo. Could you find another Mosin for less??? Sure you could...Buds for example, (using buds because I've had several dealings with them and would highly recommend them) usually has them for around $179 with free shipping plus your ffl transfer fees. But unfortunately, anytime you order a surplus rifle sight unseen, you are rolling the dice as far as what quality of rifle you will receive. And unless you are wanting Finnish, you'll most likely prefer a Tula hex as they are generally the rifle your fingers will be crossed for. Then theres always your local gun shop. Don't know about you, but the going rate on a Mosin in my local gunshops is about the same as buds price, around $180 for a good example plus tax, ammo, etc. Now lets say you know where another Tula hex is that's in excellent condition, good trigger, good bore, all numbers match, blah blah blah and they want $120 for it. My question to you is simply, then why the hell are you looking at mine? By all means go buy that one! 
          What Im trying to say here is this... Im sorry, but the day of the $100 Mosin is LONG gone and the price I have on mine is fair and firm. I have no interest in negotiating with you or hearing about how much Bubba Ray sells them for, go buy one from him if his prices are so great. I do not need the money, I just simply do not need the rifle. That being said, if you are interested in the rifle, please send me an email ONLY when you are ready to pick it up around the Mt. Olive NC area. Thanks for looking and have a great day!"

I am not going to pay anyone what they have into their weapon,as a used item ( some exceptions) you will loose money when selling. Call it the price of ownership. If you payed say $1100 for your gun and all the goodies that you decided needed to go with it, guess what your going to loose a few hundred bucks. Your other option is to take it to a store and loose 60%. Oh and to the guys who watched some utube video and now built his (custom high end) ar 15. Using parts from r guns and achme mil spec tactical come on get reall. Oh and the 1911 builder who has put 6,000 hours of his time custom fitting all the pieces, and now wants you to pay for it.

From the factory:
1301 Tactical: Ultimate Reliability for Home-Defense, Law-Enforcement

The 1301 is Beretta's new gas operated semi-automatic shotgun designed for law-enforcement and home-defense.

1301-Tactical-intro

Engineered to be ultra-reliable and easy to use, it has all the features that a modern tactical shotgun should offer—and more. And thanks to its compact size (barrel length: 18.5”), it is ideal for negotiating tight spaces as well as for being safely stored away when not needed.


Easy-CustomizationEasy Operation, Plenty of Features

Right out of the box, the 1301 Tactical features an oversized charging handle, large textured bolt release and an oversized reversible safety button. This makes it easy to use under most weather or lighting conditions—your hands will always be able to positively and safely grip it and operate the controls. Also, the aggressive checkering on the fore-end and stock makes it easy to gain a secure grip even while wearing gloves. As far as sighting, the 1301 Tactical features a robust, protected ghost-ring system with an interchangeable front sight, giving the user the opportunity to adapt it to its intended use, whatever the conditions.


Easy Customization to Most Shooters’ NeedsEasy-Operation

Although perfect out of the box, this tactical shotgun is easily adaptable to most users’ needs, body type and shooting posture. The stock is adjustable for length of pull with provided spacers, so that you can ensure it will always come up naturally to your shoulder and point easily to where you are looking. Drop and cast are adjustable as well. And for extra flexibility in customization and accessorization, the receiver offers a MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail, making it a snap to add tactical accessories without any gunsmithing or modification to the shotgun.



Super-Fast-ShootingSuper-Fast Shooting

The integrated BLINK gas operating system, featuring a cross tube gas piston, allows the 1301 Tactical to cycle 36% faster than any other shotgun on the market. This also makes it ideal for three-gun tactical competitions: when shooting the 1301 Tactical, you will simply and objectively have an edge over your competitors. And regardless of the use, with a 1301 Tactical you will always know that you have the best of Beretta to rely upon—with its unmatched 500 years of experience, passion and know-how.

Also available is the 1301 Comp, a version of this shotgun optimized for 3-gun and tactical matches.


NOTE FOR U.S. CUSTOMERS: In conformance to federal law, the magazine-extension tube is available only as an after-market accessory that the customer may purchase separately and install."

Like new Glock 42 for sale. I have upgraded the sights to Trijicon HD night sights. It includes 3 mags, the original box/paperwork, and a 380 boresight. I have shot the gun from a bench rest and it is dead on with the new sights. If you havent seen the Trijicon HD sights in person, then pictures wont due it justice. The yellow paint around the front vial glows like a fiberoptic big dot in day light and the night sights still have 100% of their glow. I have 500 rounds through this with no malfunctions of any kind (except a limp wrist related failure while shooting weak hand gangster style).There are some marks on the rear sight from installation that are hard to see in the pictures. 
Also the boresight is the size of a 380 cartridge so it can be used to practice presentation. 
Night sights are apparently difficult to take a picture of in the dark.
Located in Champaign. Asking $450 OBO. No trades. Messages asking for my bottom dollar will be ignored. If you want it make an offer.

The Pelican case has a custom interior that was made specifically for THIS gun. The items were laser scanned and the foam was cut with a waterjet. Case has storage for all 3 mags and room for accessories. The lid of the case features a replaceable VCI capsule that releases a corrosion inhibiting gas to prevent rust, even if moisture is present. The case itself is waterproof, rated to be submerged 10' for 30 minutes with no ingress of water. Case also carries a lifetime ""any excuse, even abuse"" warranty from Pelican.
This is really the ultimate ""just in case"" setup, run it over with your car, toss it in a lake, the contents will be fine.
With customization the case goes for over $200 new.

200 rounds (4 boxes) of Remington & Blazer target ammo and one magazine worth of PMC Starfire JHP included. I paid $60+ for the target rounds alone.

909,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4215909,For Sale:  Turnkey - Quality Ammunition Manufacturing Business (includes 3 days of start-up!),"midtown, Oklahoma, United States","$ 38,000","Listed On: Tuesday, April 14, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Want an ammunition business that you can scale to your needs?  We have just the investment for you.  Wondering why this business is for sale in today's market?  Being absentee business owners for this business is something we are no longer choosing to sustain.  

This proven business model can run successfully with one person alone.  That individual  can make 50,000+ rounds of high quality ammunition per month easily.  If you have the ability to manage up to 5-7 people, you can easily make 500,000+ rounds per month.  We have proven methods of manufacturing from dealing with the supply of mixed range brass to packaging high quality boxed ammunition.  This entire business can be scaled to match your comfort level or growth requirement.  

Purchase will include 3 complete days of start-up and training by a production manager with over 40 years of loading experience.  NOTE:  Travel and expenses are additional.  We will cover his time on site.

Additionally, if you need the basic materials to get started (primers, powder, some projectiles and brass), we have them for an additional cost.  

All of the load data, load recipes, time studies and testing data will be included in this purchase.  We have comprehensive data for safe and accurate loads within the SAAMI specification for all the calibers we load.  We have a large amount of detailed notes that you can use to replicate our process, especially if you choose to design your own loads.  

Additionally we will provide you with all the key contacts and pricing for supply chain and distribution.  Finding the right people to get components from at the best price took literally years to develop.  So we know how hard it is to build the most cost effective and dependable pipeline to make your ammo business successful.

Calibers currently available to build:
.380 ACP  (100 grain)
9mm  (115, 124 and 147 grain)
.38 Special  (125 and 158 grain)
.357 Magnum  (125 and 158 grain)
.40 S/W  (165 and 180 grain)
.45 ACP  (200 and 230 grain)
.45 Colt  (255 grain)
.223 REM (55 grain)
.300 BLK  (110 grain Super Sonic)
.300 BLK  (208 grain Sub Sonic)
.308 WIN (150 grain)

Equipment that comes with the business:
6)  Table mounted fully automated Dillon 1050's powered by Forcht Auto Drives with press monitors and bullet feeders (lots of spares for maintenance and speed changes).
4)  Dillon RF100's (plus ton's of spares for both Large and Small priming)
9)  Dillon Complete Spare tool heads w/ dies (processing vs manufacturing)
1)  Industrial Brass sorting machine (processes 75 pounds of range brass per hour)
2)  Rotary ""wet wash"" brass cleaning machines
1)  Desco industrial brass dryer 220v.  
1)  Complete large tool box with all tools needed to maintain equipment

There are many tools, spares, trimmers, annealer and more to list.

The brass processing system alone can generate a revenue of $1000 - $2000 per week with just 1 person running it (after taxes, labor, material and brass purchase).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete current inventory available for additional purchase:
Ammo:  129,000 rounds ($35,000 retail)
Projectiles:  7,700 pieces ($850 Retail)
Brass:  660,000 pieces or 6000 lbs of sorted clean brass ($38,000 retail) 
Primers:  192,000 pieces ($5,000 retail)
Powder:  725 lbs of powder ($16,000 retail)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Website:  Fully functional E-commerce website ($11,650).  This is user maintainable for inventory and has been populated with all of the restrictions by zip code for locations in the US where it is ""not legal"" to ship ammunition to (certain locations is NY, IL, CA, MA, etc.).  We can help you change the website to accommodate your needs and name change.  It is currently setup to supply ammo, brass and projectiles within the 48 contiguous and beyond for non restricted items.  Adding primers and powder would require you to complete your HAZMAT training and that product line can be easily added.

Equipment:  Plan on spending in excess of $47,000 (plus shipping and taxes) to purchase new equipment.  Then factor your time to setup and work bugs out (and we promise there are a lot of bugs).  Let us help you make your business successful and following your passion of making ammo.  This is a great starting step before going into a Camdex or an Ammo Load/ Ammoload machine.  Those machines are very costly alone and the the cost to feed them is more than double what you will spend on this start up.  Also they typically require a Scharch sizing and reaming machine (that does not exist any longer) for the brass alone.  We have figured out how to make high quality ammunition without having to use a Roll Sizer or buying processed brass.

This is being sold as a complete business.  The value of all combined components, equipment, website and proven recipes and loading practices would easily exceed $145,000 plus the time to do all the development.  

If you are interested in everything, we do have a ""discounted"" package price so you can start production immediately and actually start selling complete product the day of acquisition.

NOTE:  AMMO, BRASS, PRIMERS and POWDER are extra, not included in sale of equipment.

We will entertain serious offers only.  Be prepared to prove qualifications to purchase.

Please email REDACTED for more information.

Serious inquiries only.  Manufacturing ammunition to resale requires an FFL type 06 at minimum."

EOTech created the XPS2-RF specifically for the non-tactical, traditional rimfire, or air rifle platforms. This light, streamlined holographic weapon sight makes rimfire shooting easy and fun.  The EOTech sighting system offers an incredible advantage to people with ""aging eyes"".  The large viewing window and illuminated holographic reticle make getting on target fast and easy.  A Youth Shooter can really appreciate the reduced weight of this optic as well as the rugged durability.  Beginning and experienced hunters of all ages should look to the XPS2-RF for small game hunting, high-speed target shooting and plinking.

The XPS2-RF only fits the 3/8” (11 mm) dovetail rail with no cross bolt; and does not work with 1” Weaver or Picatinny rails.

Designed with tactical shooters in mind, the XPS2-300 offers a 2-dot ballistic drop reticle that allows the shooter to zero either subsonic or supersonic rounds in the same reticle pattern.  Offered in the XPS2 platform, it is the shortest and lightest HWS sight available.  Its size and weight make it convenient for hunters, military and law enforcement officers to carry.  The single compact lithium 123 battery configuration opens up more space on the rail for rear iron sights or magnifiers.  This sight has the same body style as the XPS3™ model, but the XPS2 does not have night vision-compatibility.

Arguably the most sought after 1911 in the world. I ordered this pistol in late 2012 and it just arrived yesterday.

The Professional is a full custom pistol that begins with a national match frame which has the oversized slide rails cut into the frame in the Springfield Geneseo machine shop. It uses all custom parts, including the Springfield Custom tool steel hammer & sear, S&A mag well, Wilson ambi thumb safety, Novak low mount rear sight, dovetail front sight, match skeletonized trigger, standard guide rod system, and 6 specially tuned Metalform 7 round magazines. These pistols are hand assembled by custom gunsmiths in the Geneseo custom shop, under the supervision of master gunsmith David Williams. The Professional models meet or exceed all specifications of the FBI SWAT contract, including the accuracy requirement of 1.5"" or better at 25 yards with Remington Golden Saber ammunition. The civilian pistols and the FBI pistols are built at the same time, with the gunsmiths never knowing whether a civilian or FBI agent will be using the pistol. These pistols are built approx. every 45 days, with the FBI order being filled first and civilian orders getting all of the remaining from the production run. These pistols do not have front cocking serrations or full length guide rods because the FBI chose not to have these features on their pistols. (Front cocking serrations catch on clothing and full length guide rods require additional tools for disassembly.) These pistols are finished with the Black T finish done by Walter Birdsong in MS."
