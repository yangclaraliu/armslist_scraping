Comes with the original Smith & Wesson case, lock, documentation and 3 brand new moon clips.

S&W introduced a new Model 442 as part of its “Pro” series. The Pro line is positioned between the basic models and the high-end Performance Center models, as a cost-effective upgrade to the most critical “professional” features.
The 442 for the Pro series was named the Model 442 Moon Clip to emphasize its most unique feature. The newest 442 is equipped with a cylinder designed to use moon clips for increased speed and efficiency in loading. The use of moon clips requires additional machining on the face of the cylinder to accommodate the width of the metal clips. While this is an attractive feature for those shooters who prefer moon clips, the modifications do not affect the ability to load the revolver in more traditional ways—like using dump pouches, speed strips, or speedloaders.
Interestingly, the 442 Moon Clip also features a stainless steel cylinder rather than carbon steel. Since the entire gun is finished in matte black, that change is not readily apparent. Also of interest is the lack of an internal lock on the 442 Moon Clip.

This is for the upper only ****edit To add ran about mag through it to test it an it ran like a clock. Rapid fire with no problems. If someone wants to shoot it before a trade or sale just bring some ammo an we can meet in taylors at my buddy's land*** this little upper runs great and even with the standard birdcage it's very soft shooting. 

This is a unfired upper from andro corp. if you check the reviews on these they are awesome uppers. He has around 500 positive feedback score on ar15.com. Uppers comes with gen 2 magpul sights, quad rail, mil spec bcg and barrel. It's a very nice upper. I can add ammo or pmags to even out trades. Trade value is $425 with the sights or sell for $415. This is an excellent choice for a budget pistol or sbr build. Foregrip, sure fire an mount not included.

I work a job that has varying hours so cannot travel to deliver outside the Kingsport area.  I will travel within Kingsport area for delivery and either way 20 miles, such as Fall Branch or Bristol. Sorry, made too many trips over the years where people don't show or were just browsing. Not interested in hunting rifles; ARs are fine. Only handguns would be a .44 magnum (DA and I will add money) or .45 acp, preferably 1911 but Springfield works also. I will add money for the right trade. Putting back in safe after this week until people start looking for hunting rifles. Search armslist, my price is very fair.Thanks for looking."

From what I can find it was made in 1980. It's in very good shape. I just picked this up in trade an figures I would see if I can find something else I was looking for before I decided to hang onto it. It was part of the personal collection of a local gun store owner. Trades are listed below.

It has a low round count and is in very good condition

Second is a WASR-10 in good condition, it also has a low round count, and a RPK rear sight with WINDAGE ADJUSTMENT

The WASR10 is based on the PM-63, which is itself Romania's licensed copy of the Soviet AKM. 
The WASR10 has one of the best barrels in the AK world: made to spec., cold hammer forged, chromelined, and with 14mm threads at the muzzle.
It is arguably the single best part of the WASR, and known to give the same accuracy as the Saiga or SLR's barrel.
Really, they are great AKs and what old Mikhail had in mind when he designed the platform. They have good barrels, original Romie receivers, take standard parts, and the wood actually can be cleaned up to look very nice.

Up for sale is a new (<100 rnds.) 1911 made by RIA/Armscor. The technical designation is CS Tactical, chambered in the ever popular 9mm Parabellum cartridge.

This spring set up has the trigger breaking at a perfect 3.6lbs. The pistol has also been duracoated HK black. The slide to frame, mainspring to frame, and grip safety to frame fitting is all very well done... pics just don't do this piece any justice.

Compact and easy to maintain, the SR-556 Takedown sets a new standard for the modern sporting rifle.Like the popular Ruger 10/22 Takedown®, the SR-556 Takedown was designed with ease of use in mind. The barrel is removed from the upper receiver by simply moving the slider bar towards the breech, rotating the barrel and pulling it free – no tools required. Installation is simpler yet – just slide the barrel into the upper and twist until it locks. The takedown mechanism provides a repeatable point of impact and employs a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system for a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.The removable 16.1″, chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel is chambered in 5.56 NATO. The headspace is set at the factory so no adjustment is necessary. The barrel assembly includes an elevation & windage adjustable flip-up front sight so that the zero stays with the barrel. The SR-556 Takedown also sports the shorter Ruger flash hider on the ½”-28 threaded muzzle.MSR shooters that desire a larger cartridge will be excited to find that a replaceable barrel kit chambered in 300 AAC Blackout is available on ShopRuger.com. The cold hammer-forged 300 AAC Blackout barrel is 16.1″ long, has a 1:7″ twist, and is capped by a 5/8″-24 threaded muzzle fitted with a Ruger flash hider. This range-ready barrel’s headspace is set at the factory and comes complete with a metal flip-up elevation & windage adjustable front sight and two, 30-round metal magazines marked with “300 AAC BLACKOUT” to ensure easy differentiation.The SR-556 Takedown maintains the best-of-class elements of the SR-556 and comes standard with a host of accessories that today’s shooters demand. The quad rail handguard provides ample mounting area for accessories and provides a stiff and secure mount for the takedown mechanism. The slider bar for removing the barrel is located on the bottom rail under the gas block and is out of the way of accessories. The upper receiver is complete with dust cover, forward assist, and metal flip-up windage adjustable rear sight. All aluminum parts are hardcoat anodized.The Ruger Elite 452™ two-stage trigger is installed in the standard mil-spec pattern lower receiver. At 7 pounds 10 ounces, the SR-556 Takedown handles easily with Magpul’s MOE grip and MOE SL stock on a mil-spec buffer tube.MSRP: $2,049Manufacturer: RugerModel #: SR-556 TakedownType: Rifle: Semi-AutoFinish: Manganese Phosphate/Hardcoat AnodizedStock: Black Synthetic, Collapsible StockSights: Folding Iron SighsBarrel: 16.1Overall Length: 32.75 - 36Weight: 7.6 lbsCaliber: 5.56 NATOCapacity: 30+1Action: Semi-Automatic# of Mags: 3Receiver: Black FinishMuzzle: Ruger Flash Suppressor 1/2X28 ThreadFeatures: Two-Stage Piston Driven Operating System Cold Hammer-Forged MII-Spec 41V45 Steel Barrel"

This rifle is all matching numbers to include the receiver, barrel, stock, bolt and magazine (magazine is a forced match, the others are not).

This is not a Mitchell Mauser. It is import stamped.

Previous arsenal and manufacture markings were scrubbed on this one, but are still visible.
Faintly below the 24/47 markings Royal Yugo markings can be seen, as well as the location of original manufacture (Artillery Technical Institute). This makes original manufacture prewar (1928-31). Hard to get a picture of this as it is so faint, but it is there and I certainly welcome anyone to inspect it in person if they wish.

There are also two scrubbed German acceptance stamps, one on the receiver, indicating that the action (not the rifle as it sits today) was seized and put into German service, and one on the bolt release. So the action certainly saw combat during WWII.

The rifling is nearly flawless. The rifle does have some surface rust on the receiver, but this is limited and there is no corrosion. Not pretty but this rifle has been through a lot looking at the number/type of arsenal marks and stock markings.

Cycles great, shoots/groups dead on (though I don't have anywhere to shoot long range, so a little high at 100 yards as expected).

I have taken pictures of the rifle in and out, including all the markings should anyone wish to see more, ask questions etc.

All and all would make an all matching good shooter with a little bit of history behind it.

(please note, all photos are stock from online. The tan looking holster is the color and style of the one I'm referring to.)

Thanks for looking at this add today. I'm in a bit of a financial bind, just bought this gun a few months ago and haven't even shot it yet. 

It's new, as issued Ruger Super Blackhawk Hunter in the big 44 MAG. Can mount a scope, does come with scope rings. The gun out the door cost me $700 and is un-fired, unused, and un-carried.

All that would be included if I did have to sell: 

Super Blackhawk Hunter Stainless 44 mag.

Scope rings, plastic box, instructions, warranty info, gun lock, etc. 

A NEW UNUSED Simply Rugged Sour Dough Pancake with rentention strap (cost around $105) and the Chesty Puller Strap system (around $60). This holster hasn't been worn and straps are uncut. It is tan in color and superb craftsmanship. 

I would also include the A-Zoom snap caps I bought (about $20 value) and are 44 MAG sized (total of 6). 

Also included would be a 50 rd box of HSM 44 MAG 305 gr hard cast bear load ammo and a 50 rd box of Winchester 44 MAG 240 GR Soft Point Ammo ($50 cost for HSM, $45 for Winchester.) Un-fired, factory ammo. 

I am open to SOME negotiation on price but no low balling please.

My asking price would start at $900. All things added up would run around $1005 in costs and this gun is brand new and been sitting in my safe.

Thank you for viewing this add and have a great day."
