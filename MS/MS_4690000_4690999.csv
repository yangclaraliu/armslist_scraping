This rifle has many upgrades and is a fine piece of equipment, rifle started as an older 700P with a glass and aluminum bedded HS Precision stock. I upgraded to the KRG chassis to give it a little more weight and adjustability. Rifle shoots 1 MOA all day long. Bore is clean and has plenty of life, do not know the shot count but .308 barrels are generally good for around 3,500-5,000 rounds. I doubt it even close to that based on the tight groups achieved with the rifle. The action itself shows (little) pitting from the previous owners neglect but it's really not noticeable. The shot cycle is VERY manageable nothing comparable to a .308 deer rifle. The muzzlebrake makes this a sweet shooter.
I have shot multiple loads through this gun and all perform very well. Inc. hornaday whitetail classic, fusion, S&B, Remington, and hand loads. I did notice some pressure issues when shooting 200grn projectiles. Bolt got a little sticky on cycling but everything under 175gr runs flawlessly. Trigger is stock never changed it because I never thought it needed a new one. Once again this is a serious built precision rifle and anyone who wishes to own it will have no doubts. Message me for any pics or questions. Optics not included, I have a SWFA 10x scope and ringed I could throw in for the right trade/ price."

The bolt carrier works great and was a backup in my M70. The carrier has some pitting near the end by the gas piston. This is merely cosmetic. The Yugo AKs were actually used pretty extensively in the Balkan Wars of the 90s so some parts generally show a bit of use compared to AK parts from other countries. There are two grips included. One is an earlier Yugo M64 grip with a cutout at the top and the other is an M70 grip which has ""Pop"" carved in it (I assume from the soldier that used the rifle it was on). The sling had some rust when I got it on the metal parts and I soaked it in CLP and brushed it. The sling is still fully functional like everything else and has character from use. I didn't include the magazine in the picture, but the black Tapco 30 round magazine works great and I haven't had any issues with it. I am willing to ship these items to those out of the area, but will only ship them to areas that legally allow 30 round magazines.

Up for sale is a beautiful piston driven AR-15 pistol, this will be as close as you can get to having an SBR.

Custom built with $1500 in parts spent on it.

Anderson Arms lower
Palmetto upper with Adam Arms piston upper
8"" Barrel
Noveske Flaming Pig KX5 Flash suppressor
Quadrail (rail is smooth with no sharp edges like Troy)
Blackhawk ergo pistol grip
Shockwave technologies arm brace (can legally be adjusted)
Magpul AFG2 Angled grip (only legal grip for pistol)
A.R.M.S. #71L series, Front and Rear Sights

You won't find this in a Sig or other AR15 maker that is piston driven for less than $2000, get one at a great price.  These piston driven ARs not only run cleaner, they are far more reliable than gas impingement models.  This AR happens to love either steel case or brass, I have fired several magazines through it and never had an issue.

NOTE:  If you are interested you must have an Ohio ID and must meet my conditions below:


I will ONLY meet at the Gander Mountain parking lot at West Pointe Plaza in Hilliard, I will not meet up anywhere else.  I have had 'buyers' email me or text me that they were going to meet up only to never hear from them again.  If you're going to arrange to meet me at a certain time, I expect you to arrive at that specific time or I will gladly leave.  I am in no hurry to sell this nor do I need to, however I have several ARs and do not shoot this one often.

Note:  I have it listed as a rifle since it's easier to search, but it was built and is a pistol.

I WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY TRADES WHATSOEVER.....PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER ME WITH YOUR TRADE PROPOSALS, I WILL NOT REPLY.  CASH ONLY

Price is firm, you won't find an AR Piston Driven Pistol anywhere else for this price."

I purchased this from a Black Powder competition shooter about 4 years ago.  For two reasons.  Admit watching Clink Eastwood movies and getting pulled into the coolness of the gun, but primarily my father is a for reals 7th Cav Company Commander with a huge combat military record, and historian.  He takes his part of the 7th Cav history seriously.  So thought he would enjoy the idea of this.  The weapon essentially sat.  Turns out the weapon has been fired approximately 20 times.  Mainly by my nephew who is on the Harvard shooting team.  He gave it a big thumbs up.  

What else I know about the firearm is that coming from a competitive shooter, he had some custom work done on it.  Have the paperwork that indicates a smoothing of the bore and a couple other things.  I am hardly an expert on these weapons but I get the sense this one is sweet.  It's action is smooth.  It is definitely a solid piece and I would grade it Very Good+ condition.  It is probably better than that but this is my take.  Everything works on it.  

I also have several additions to go with it as shown in a picture.  The black powder container is 80% full.  The Hornady box is 90% full.  And the brass powder flask.  And a leather holster.  And 2 tins of caps also 90% full.  Same for the cloth wads.   I sourced all these additions and it came to approx $75-$90.  Everything is for all intents new.  

It just sits.  Hence I need to get it into capable hands.   OBO."

WALTHER ARMS INC Rimfire

Walther 5120329 P22L Laser DA/SA 22LR 3.42 in TB 10+1 Poly Frame Black

Walther adapted the tactical styling and performance design concepts from their centerfire handguns for the P22 rimfire pistol. Standard P22 models have a threaded barrel for easy addition of a suppressor or to change to/from a 5 in target barrel. The Picatinny rail makes it a snap to mount a light or laser. Low profile three-dot polymer combat sights won t snag clothing and are rear adjustable for windage. The slide has front and rear slide serrations for a non-slip surface with distinctive Walther styling. It has a loaded chamber indicator for quick status inspection, an external slide stop locks back on empty and three safeties - manual external, magazine disconnect, automatic firing pin block safety. Double/single action trigger has an 11 lb. trigger pull for double action and a 4 lb trigger pull for single action. CA compliant models are available in 3.4 in and 5 in barrel lengths.

This is a crisp, great looking Colt revolver featuring matching serial numbers on the frame, barrel, cylinder, backstrap, and triggerguard. The wedge is un-numbered. The gun has a gray patina overall with faint traces of original bluing under the barrel and plum traces in protected areas of the cylinder and breech. The frame and hammer have a slight hue of case color which has turned silvery/brown. There are some light traces of original Silver finish in protected areas of the triggerguard. The Ivory grips are original to the period and fit the gun well. There is some minor shrinkage along the face of the triggerguard and slight swelling along the butt. The grips have a wonderful mellow patina with various age checks and an old crack on the left front toe. Overall the edges of the gun are very sharp, and the cylinder scene is very clear. Notice the holster wear on the muzzle! This gun was certainly used but well taken care of. Serial numbers, patent stamp, caliber marking, and barrel address are all very clear. Original German Silver blade front sight. The action is tight and crisp, it functions perfectly. The nipples are all very clean originals and the bore is very good considering it's age. It has good, strong rifling front to back with light blackpowder frosting, most notably toward the muzzle. I think a good cleaning will improve it. This is just a good, handsome early Colt with a great set of grips that was no doubt used in the frontier!"
