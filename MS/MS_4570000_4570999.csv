MAGNUM CARRY""SF"" FRAME
In 1999 Colt introduced their last double action revolver model.
This was a version of the SF-VI/DS-II series revolvers built on the ""SF-VI"" frame.
This was a stainless steel revolver using the same transfer bar safety-ignition system as all Colts made after 1969.
The new model was chambered for the .357 Magnum cartridge, the first small frame Colt ever to use the Magnum round.
The frame was slightly thickened in the top strap area to increase strength and the gun was heat treated to a higher level.
Barrels were 2 inches, and a few 3 inch models.
Finish was satin stainless and possibly a few bright polish models.
The grips were Hogue Mono-Grips made for Colt by Hogue.These have a pebble texture.
The Magnum Carry was made in 1999 only.
Due to the short production period and the Magnum chambering, the Magnum Carry is sought after by both collectors and shooters wanting a powerful concealed carry revolver."

Some like to cook or garden or make crafts. Some run marathons, some run companies. Some climb mountains, some climb ladders. What makes them the same is their feminine spirit, one that is beautiful inside and out. We’re proud to have captured that spirit in the Henry American Beauty Rifle. Although named after the iconic American Beauty Rose, there’s nothing pink about this rifle. It just happens to be as pleasant to look at as it is to shoot.Henry designed this rifle with the highest attention to detail and beauty. The main panel features an American Beauty Rose embellished with a floral scroll pattern. Beneath the rose is the banner AMERICAN BEAUTY. Hand-cut by master engraver Heidi Roos, the rose and other elements are mechanically transferred onto the nickel plated receiver cover using a hand cut master. This meticulous process helps retain the bright cuts of the original art, which is then further enhanced with 14K rose gold plating so the petals look like they’re in bloom.Like all rifles in our award-winning Golden Boy family it features a beautiful American walnut stock, fully adjustable rear sight, beaded front sight octagonal barrel, and the smooth action Henrys are known for. The buttplate and barrel band are silver. It’s drilled and tapped for easy scope mounting. Offered in caliber .22 S/L/LR."

I found this on another site about the history of the RTF model glocks:

In 2009 Glock introduced the Model 22 RTF2 (Rough Textured Frame 2), which were made with a modified grip texture that uses lots of little raised dots or pyramids set in a grid pattern and it came with scalloped, crescent shaped, or fish gills slide serrations. It is still considered a 3rd generation gun, but some may refer to it as a Gen 3.5. Glock first released the model 22 and later produced the RTF2 in models 17, 19, 22C, 23 and 23C. There is also a 21SF, which is the only model that was never made with the Curved “Fish Gills” serrations. Around the middle of 2010, Glock dropped the crescent shaped slide serrations and started using the standard slide serrations on the RTF2 models. As of January 2011 the RTF2 Model Glocks were available only to Law Enforcement."

Made In Colorado , USA

""The Widefield 3-9x variable power scope had a front objective lens measuring 36x27mm. It was 12.38"" long and weighed 15.0 ounces. The horizontal field of view at 100 yards was 42.5' at 3x and 10.9' at 9x. The optimum eye relief was 3.25-3.0"". The 3-9x variable scope was the most popular all-around choice in the market place. It was suitable for big game rifles in calibers ranging from .243 Winchester to 8mm Remington Magnum, expressly including such all-around favorites as the .270 Winchester, 7mm Remington Magnum, .308 Winchester, .30-06 and .300 Winchester Magnum.

Their field of view is approximately 30% greater than similar scopes and that can matter in the woods, or when trying to track running game. It allows for faster target acquisition, particularly at close range. This can, of course, be a life saving advantage if suddenly confronted by a charging animal.

There is no doubt that a rifle with a low mounted scope handles faster and better than the same rifle wearing a scope in a high mount. A low mount makes it easier for the shooter to quickly align his or her eye with the scope, and allows a firmer contact between cheek and stock comb for more accurate shooting.

Redfield accomplished all of this in their Widefield scopes by starting with oversize objective and ocular lens elements and simply grinding away the top and bottom. The result is an oval lens and something like a TV-format view through the finished scope. The fixed four power Widefield scope, for instance, has a front objective lens 30mm wide but only 22mm tall. This makes for a very compact scope with a horizontal field of view of approximately 36 feet, outstanding for a fixed four power scope.

Redfield's Widefield scopes were traditionally a high quality product. They were the top of the Redfield line for many years, only in the last years of the Company giving way to the Illuminator line, which features illuminated reticles. The actual quality and construction of the two lines appears to be similar.

Redfield Widefield scopes were built on rugged, one-piece, aluminum alloy main tubes. They featured 1/4 MOA fingertip windage and elevation adjustments and fully multi-coated optics. Eyepiece focus was by multiple turns of the ocular housing on fine threads and was secured with a locking ring. Widefield scopes were shockproof, fogproof, and waterproof. All models were available with either a gloss black or a matte black finish, and all models came standard with a Duplex reticle."" Chuck Hawks"

I wanted a rifle with a folding stock and this precluded the AR15 type weapons because of the gas tube sticking out the back. Folding stocks are great for working in tight quarters like a house or car and then easily unlocked and unfolded into the locked position for long range accuracy applications.  Molot Vepr is the highest quality AK 74 made in the world. Just about every component is made better than the other AK 74’s on the market. I never fired it – it is new and unused just as I bought it nearly a year ago. Besides the folding stock, it has an Aimpoint Red Dot Sight. It has other internal upgrades listed below to make it 922R compliant. This means you can use any size magazine or drum you like. The rifle comes with 6 each 30 round magazines.

Also Included are 2160 rounds 5.45x39 Russian Military Surplus 7N6 52 grain FMJ Ammo. This ammo has a steel core for punching through hard objects.

This was my first handgun and I basically bought it for camping and target practice and it has worked well for my needs but I am ready to move on to something different. I am interested in trading for a medium to large frame semi-auto, It would probably need to be in .45 caliber, but I would consider a glock in 9mm. Let me know what you got and maybe we can work something out. I can add cash as needed."

A lot of time and money went into this thing, I really hate selling it but all it does is sit and collect dust. Its got a basically new bsa sweet 22 scope on it (ran on my 10/22 for a week before upgrading), its not sighted in that I recall so will need to be zeroed.

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own."

I added a jp muzzle brake, a cdi precision bottom metal with accurate mag (accuracy international clone) 10 round mag. Custom milled bolt knob thanks to a machinist friend. Optic is just an swfa 10x42 mil mil, ran out of money towards end of build and like a dummy cheaped out on the optic.

I'll even throw in the Tipton cleaning rod, brushes, jags and 123 rounds. Some custom reloads. Some match rounds.

I've broken in the barrel properly. I had a gunsmith friend help me with the process. Fire one round, cool, clean. First 10 rounds. Then two rounds, cool, clean 20 rounds.

**Comes with Sig P220 parts with a couple upgrades:**

**Comes with brand new unused adjustable metal Williams fiber optic ""fire sights"" ($50) (front red, rear green). They are somewhat tall (definitely not ""low profile"") so they could be used with a threaded barrel & suppressor.
(I will also include the used 3 dot night sights the tritium has faded) in case you want them for whatever reason.)

** Brand new unused SRT trigger kit ($50): This is the Short Reset Kit; which (yep, you guessed it) shortens the distance of the trigger reset. These parts are already installed and I can include the factory parts as well in case you ever want to have it changed back to a longer trigger reset.

**Brand new polished solid stainless steel guide rod

**Brand new P220 parts not yet installed ($20): I have a brand new short hammer strut, 17lb mainspring (factory mainspring is 21LB so this will lighten the DA trigger pull a little - be sure to practice shooting a couple hundred rounds through it to ensure proper primer ignition since this is a lighter spring) and the polymer mainspring seat. 
These 3 parts are needed to use more modern grips on your Sig P220 like the Hogue grips or the SLIM Sig Sauer grips, etc.
(These parts will not work with the Sig Sauer E2 grip, however, but when you buy that grip it comes as a kit with the parts you need to use it).

This gun is accurate and fun to shoot. I really enjoy the single action trigger pull, not so much the DA trigger pull but I have never been a fan of DA. These Sig P220's usually go for $600.

This gun has been cleaned after every range trip and stored in the safe in a climate controlled house. I have been deployed for over a year, so the gun is not getting the attention and range time it deserves! It is extremely accurate with very little recoil (my wife who 5'1"", 110 pounds can hit all day at 1,000 yards). The BORS is very accurate and fun to shoot, but you can always take it off and go back to the scope by itself. I am willing to do PPT in Camarillo or Ventura. Price is OBO.

New Made Item: The M2HD Machine Gun, Browning .50 Caliber Machine Gun, is a heavy machine gun designed towards the end of World War I by John Browning. It is very similar in design to John Browning's earlier M1919 Browning machine gun, which was chambered for the .30-06 cartridge. The M2 uses the larger and more powerful .50 BMG cartridge, which was named for the gun itself (BMG standing for Browning Machine Gun). The M2 has been referred to as ""Ma Deuce"", or ""the fifty"" in reference to its caliber. The design has had many specific designations; the official designation for this WWII infantry type is Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2. It is effective against infantry, unarmored or lightly armored vehicles and boats, light fortifications, and low-flying aircraft.

The Browning .50 caliber machine gun was used extensively as a vehicle weapon and for aircraft armament by the United States from the 1920s to the present day. It was heavily used during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, as well as during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in the 2000s. It is the primary heavy machine gun of NATO countries, and has been used by many other countries as well. With the exception of the .45 ACP M1911 pistol, the M2 has been in use longer than any other small arm in U.S. inventory.
