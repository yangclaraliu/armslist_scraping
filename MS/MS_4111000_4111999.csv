Benelli SuperNova 28"" Realtree MAX-4 HD

This shotgun is like new, I have shot sporting clays on two occasions with this gun. It's never been in the mud on a real duck hunt or anything. Less than 200 shells put through it. Includes 3 chokes total, 2 of which are unused, also a matching Field & Stream MAX-4 HD soft case. I'll throw in 3 boxes of shells and 2 hand throwers as well. I paid well over $700, get a basically new gun for $425.

------

Bringing modular design to a pump action shotgun, the Benelli 12 Gauge SuperNova Pump Shotgun can transform to deliver high performance shooting year round. With an optional SteadyGrip™ stock, this 12-gauge shotgun can be transformed into a high-performance turkey gun or mount a fully-rifled slug barrel for tack-driving accuracy on deer. Giving you the sense of having several Benelli shotguns in one, the SuperNova even offers a barrel option with rifle sights for home defense and a SuperNova Tactical fitted with a ghost-ring rear sight and pistol grip. (Additional barrels and grips sold separately). 
At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer for a super-light, super-strong gun that is almost completely impervious to any weather condition. Just as tough inside, the SuperNova sports dual-action bars and two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel, giving you a gun that is rock solid to the core.

Operates smoothly, nice DA trigger on these as the brits trained speed firing with them. Matching serial numbers. Tanker revolver is one of the best Enfield built. This is not a shelf queen, she's a shooter, and built to last, you can shoot this thousands more rounds.

Sparse Enfield markings (E inside D) with 2 stars.

top of the barrel has the date.

That ""D"" with a short horizontal line is the Enfield stamp used from 1941. The ""I**"" next to it (should be 8 or 5 pointed stars) means it's from 1942-45, with the 8 pointed star being early & 5 pointed star being late. P37 web belt with tanker holster and ammo loops.
.
In 1942, Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock, England began production which continued until 1957. A scarce varient was produced by Albion Motors of Scotstown, Scotland. 



After the war, the British War Office announced that the revolver would remain the standard handgun of the army. In 1922,the development of a lighter revolver with a small calibre was approved, but the bullet had to have stopping power nearly equal to that of the .455 (11.5MM). Webley & Scott was commissioned to carry out these experiments, and over the next five years the firm produced a series of prototype models patterned after their .38 (9mm) Mark III - not to be confused with the Government Mark III- and the military .455 (11.5mm) Mark IV.

Unhappy with Webley & Scott's progress, Enfield took control of this project in 1926 and continued to modify the basic revolver design until an acceptable one was approved - Pistol,Revolver, .38 No.2 Mark 1.

This .38 (9mm) Webley Special calibre revolver fired a 13-gram lead projectile, which had a muzzle energy of 200 joules. To satisfy the Geneva Convention requirements, the British in 1938 substituted a 12 -gram nickel jacketed bullet for the lead bullet.

The .38 calibre (9mm) Enfield No.2, Mark 1 revolver was well received by most British Military users, with the exception of the Royal Tank Regiment. Officers of the armored forces complained that the hammer spur caught on the interior surfaces of their tanks when crew members tried to enter or vacate their vehicles. As a consequence, the pistol, the Pistol, Revolver No.2, Mark 1* was introduced on June 22 1938.

It was basically the same pistol as the N0.2, Mark 1, the thumb spur and single-action notch on the hammer were removed so that the pistol could be fired double-action only. The mainspring was altered so as to reduce the trigger pull from 6.5 to 7.5 kilograms to 5.5 to 6.5 kilograms. The Mark 1* had a new pattern grip plate to make the pistol easier to hold and fire.

The 4x32 BROWE Combat Optic (BCO) is a state-of-the-art optic that delivers highest quality optical glass, high precision machining, with a rugged military design. 



The BCO is a purpose designed and built optic ideally suited for tactical scenarios and well suited for military, police and sportsmen.  Its titanium housing is compact and light weight, yet nearly three times stronger than its aluminum counterparts, enhancing its ability to survive the rigors of field abuse under the most severe environmental conditions.



The BCO’s list of evolutionary technology is long and includes such features as:



 Target Light Sensor Technology  

The BCO has a cadmium-sulfide photocell located in the optical path providing great sensitivity and accuracy of the target light that is being transmitted through the optic, not ambient lighting. In tactical environments lighting levels are very liquid and constantly changing. When nanoseconds count there is no time to make manual illumination adjustments or search for a poorly illuminated reticle.  The Target Light Sensor Technology simplifies the operation and allows the operator to focus on the job at hand.  




 Single Intuitive Control (SIC)  

Gives the operator a simple button designed to control the illumination systems and simulate muscle memory.  With a single press of the SIC button the BCO will enter Automatic Mode; this will utilize the Target Light Sensor Teechnology by measuring the light transmission and automatically set the reticle illumination to the proper brightness.  The second press of the SIC button the BCO enters into Manual Mode.  This gives the operator complete control of the reticle illuination with the choice of 10 day settings and 3 night vision settings.



 BCO Utility Port  

The BCO utility port is a sealed port on the backside of the battery housing.  This port can be used to update the operating firmware or customize the existing program.  It can also be used to plug in a remote pressure pad switch, so the SIC button controls can be placed at a secondary location on the weapon.  This port can also be used to import or export power.  This means that accessories such as lasers or mini red dots could be powered from the BCO battery.  Alternatively, the BCO utility port is capable of importing power, to run on an external power source such as a central power system.



 Vibration Motion Sensor  

Designed to conserve battery life by placing the BCO in SLEEP mode if motion is not detected after two hours. The BCO has an average battery usage life of over 2000 hours with a minimum of 775 hours on max brightness.  In sleep mode the battey current is less than 1uA, which will give the BCO a shelf life of over 10 years.



Optical Design  

The BCO optical design is based on an internally adjustable roof prism optical system with an etched glass reticle.  This design was incorporated to maintain a short overall length, a platform that has proven itself successful with currently deployed products.  All lenses are precision ground of the finest quality optical glass available and are broad band anti-reflective coated possessing excellent light gathering capabilities even under low light conditions.  The glass etched reticle incorporates an LED coupled with microprocessor technology and a cadmium-sufide photocell to measure target light levels, automatically adjusting the reticle to match target lighting conditions.

This is the unicorn of Hi-Point pistols - a C9 with the muzzle compensator in 9mm.
The C-9 Comp is the larger version of Hi-Points 9mm handgun, one major difference from the C-9 or C-9 Compact, is that it is ""Compensated"", meaning it has a specially designed ""compensator"" attached to the end of the barrel. The compensator works by forcing some of the hot gases, escaping behind the bullet, to go upward through specially drilled holes in the top of the compensator. The escaping gases push the end of the gun downward; helping to eliminate some of the upward motion caused by the natural recoil of the gun. The Compensator has also been machined on the underside to accept laser sights, or ""tactical lights"" for better target identification in a self defense, or tactical situation.
Another difference between the C-9 and C-9 Comp. is the barrel length. Its 4"" barrel is 1/2"" longer than its sister weapon's providing for better accuracy and balance. 
This pistol has less than 100 rounds through it over two decades.
Still in brand new condition - even comes with the original box!
Pistol comes with the factory standard 8-round magazine plus 3-each 10-round factory magazines, loaded with S&B.

	Hey Everyone,
	I have up for trade or sale a sweet AK47. This is a wasr10/63 Romanian AK with chrome lined barrel. It is in great condition and is already an awesome little setup and is one of the nicer wasr10/63s I’ve seen. It will come with 3 metal 30 round magazines and 1 metal 5 round magazine. I also have some ammo available as well. I have the factory wood furniture i could include for extra or swap out if desired. 
	Also included is an installed collapsible and side folding ATI butt stock with adjustable cheek rest. A installed Guntec USA rail setup that replaces the upper and lower hand guards. This also has the optional optic rail mount on the side of the receiver. Also has the cleaning rod as well from my other AK (this one didn’t have it from the factory). 
	I mainly am looking for cash, but I’m not in a hurry and i don’t “need"" to sell it either. In terms of trades, I am “somewhat” open. Although, I mainly am looking for: AR15 patterned rifle (must be metal upper/lower and a factory unit, not a home-brew setup),  partial trades would include GP100, Security six 357, certain rifles or pistols. Honestly, just shoot me an offer, worst I can say is no! Some trades i can add boot one, some trades will be even, some will require boot on your end. All I ask is you be fair on your value and so will I. Need to meet up in Norman on this if at all possible due to my schedule. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

The Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine is the Tactical Operators answer to demanding situations. The advantage is unmatched. Built to mil-spec standards, no other company combines the quality and craftsmanship that Colt Defense LLC does. The LE6940 demonstrates fresh ingenuity with mil-spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, mil-spec backup iron sight and folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, straight gas tube, and removable lower rail providing modularity for under-mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous mil-spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature provides unmatched repeatability for mounting of optical systems, not found with separate hand-guard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, it provides a true free-floating barrel, giving enhanced accuracy for longer-range acquisition capability.

Also included are the original stock and fore end, as well as all paperwork and boxes for both the shotgun and surefire and 10 rounds of Federal 3"" 12 ga. ammo.  

The shotgun has been owned for a few years and was a bedroom gun the whole time. It's only been to the range once or twice and still looks great. There aren't any major issues with the finish, just some slight scuffs from handling and regular operation. The surefire was put on a few months ago and hasn't left the house; it's basically brand new and shines bright. The action tube was slightly damaged around the threads when the original handguard was removed, but the nut still makes up tightly and is secure. Unfortunately, there is not a picture documenting this. 

The gun was purchased from Town Police Supply in Chesterfield several years ago for $475. They are selling new for $550 online now. The surefire was recently discontinued for a newer model, but are still selling new online for $275-350. Hogue stock retails for around $55 new.

The original intent was to turn this into a home defense SBS. Times and tastes have changed, so it is time to sell.

The tubular magazine topsoff at 7 rounds.Both the straight-grip stock and forearm are crafted ofselect American walnut accented with a brass barrel band and Henry srecognizable brass receiver. All have that crisp, smooth action that setsan authentic American-made Henry apart from other lever action rifles onthe range and in the woods today. The .44 Magnum can also shoot .44 specialrounds, and the .357 Magnum can also shoot .38 special rounds. Whether youre looking for the perfect gun to saddle up with or to hog hunt across theFlorida backwoods the Henry Big Boy Carbine is the big shot in a smallpackage you ve been waiting for.

Beretta® designed the A400 Xtreme Unico Semi-Auto Shotgun, coated with Realtree MAX-4®, specifically for goose and duck hunting. The MAX-4 coating reduces corrosion inherent to goose and duck hunting conditions, and vanishes in waterfowl environments such as: cattails, cornstalks, grain stubble, and marsh grasses. The A400 Xtreme Unico shoots 2.75"", 3"", and 3.5"" shells interchangeably without having to make adjustments, making it an extremely versatile hunting shotgun. To aid hunters in shooting quick flying, multiple targets, the A400 has an action that cycles super fast—capable of shooting 4 shots in less than 1 second. To hold up to long days of pounding magnum waterfowl loads, the A400 Xtreme features several advanced recoil reduction systems, such as Kick Off™ spring-loaded shock absorbers in the stock, and a stock designed to recoil parallel to the cheek mount; these features decrease felt recoil to the shooter by as much as 70%, as well as reducing abuse to the gun itself."

***PhaZZer® Does Not require a background check, activation, or registration (per ATF and U.S. DOJ) except where required by law.  Products are operational immediately upon receipt.

PhaZZer® Enforcer Conducted Energy Weapon (CEW) is a less lethal law enforcement-level self-defense weapon that provides a similar effective take-down power as any Electronic Control Device (ECD) on the market. The Enforcer CEW features an enhanced safety circuit, simplicity of use, comfort, effectiveness, reliability, and consistency at a cost-effective price. PhaZZer® Enforcer offers the following product advantages over the competition:

PhaZZer® Enforcer has implemented a ""safety shut down circuit technology"" that automatically shuts the CEW down at the end of the 3rd five second trigger application or when aggregate exposure to the body exceeds 15 seconds. Most up to date medical studies have indicated that this is the new benchmark for standardizing guidelines for responsible and reasonable usage of CEWs deploying into a live target. The safety shut down circuit can be can be overridden by the user by simply recycling the safety switch to disarm, then back to armed mode in a split second. This design is meant to create a psychological awareness during high stress self-defense and/or public safety situations and will limit liability to the user, LEO and/or Agency.
PhaZZer® has taken a different approach for the Enforcer battery system compared to competitive brands. Enforcer CEW contains a rechargeable and replaceable 7.2 Volt Lithium Ion Battery System that allows for approximately 3000, five second electric shock deployments for the lifespan equating to substantial savings for each weapon compared to battery replacement needs through competitive products. (We suggest you see what was spent in your department or agency on Taser® battery purchases in 2011/2012 and that is the amount you will save in battery purchases going forward).
PhaZZer® Enforcer has received a positive response to the high intensity LED light compared to the Taser®X26®, or Taser® M26®, Taser® models which have a low illumination output LED. The superior Enforcer LED flashlight ultimately eliminates the need to use a separate flashlight in dark areas leaving the operator's other hand free to keep on a sidearm as a backup.
PhaZZer® Enforcer CEW is a more cost effective option than the Taser® X26. While retaining all of the physical qualities, highest quality components, core capabilities, and top of the line workmanship of Taser® ECDs, you will find that our CEW program will provide a police department, security firm, bail bond agency or individual with MSRP savings of approximately 40% in comparison to the Taser® X26 which is the primary ECD of choice preferred by most in the United States LE market.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

This is a fun rifle to shoot and one can only imagine where this has been.  It currently has a S&K scope mount attached, but the original rear sight is also supplied.  The scope mount requires no gunsmithing as it simply attaches to the rear sight mount to keep things original.  The bore and rifling are good and the bolt action functions nicely.  The spike bayonet and scabbard are in good condition.  

The safety has been worn down over the years to the point that it does not stop the gun from firing, so the gun essentially has no safety.  However, there are websites which sell a replacement part to fix it.  The leather sling is a homemade job that someone made long ago.  It has served me well, and I like it, but it is definitely not a thing of beauty.

I do not have all the boxes for the parts as I just moved.  The only piece that's missing is the bolt catch lever because it was missing from the kit they sent me.  This is a very cheap and easy to find part however, I just didn't have the time.  Im asking $350 OBO for it all.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

I am absolutely not interested in any trades. Just so you know up front, I am not desperate to sell any of them and if none sell, then I am fine with that. Again, no trades. I want to ween down, not add more weapons.

Any listed pistol with NIB after it means NEW IN BOX and unfired except at Factory prior to shipment. The other one listed looks brand new. I do not own any weapons that are rusty, scratched up or abused.  The pictures provided are stock pictures. Mine are still all still new in the box as they came from the factory.

I haven't weighted the pull yet but I would put it at 2.5-3lbs. And the reset is perfect. It comes in the original case, with 2 original mags, but I have plenty more 1911 mags laying around that I could throw in to sweeten the deal if needed and I mean quality mags. Chip McCormicks, Springfields, Kimbers, Colts, etc. And last but not least...... It's also equipped with a brand new Crimson Trace Rail Master Pro (the green laser/light and strobe combo). One of if not the best handgun combo lights out on the market. I paid $300.00 for mine and still have the original box with all of the paperwork. I will list the specs below. I have around $1300.00 tied up in this amazing handgun and it is very much worth it.

When up and engaged, it blocks the sear and hammer so the gun cannot fire. This safety also prevents rearward movement of the slide.GRIP SAFETY: this safety prevents rearward travel of the trigger. The gun can only be fired if the grip safety is firmly pressed in when grasped by the hand to then allow trigger movement.DIS-CONNECTOR SAFETY: this safety prevents a round from being fired before it is in the chamber with slide and barrel locked. The dis-connector enables the pistol to fire only when fully locked and trigger is released.HALF-COCKED POSITION: the half-cocked notch in the hammer allows it to be locked in a half-cocked position. This happens in situations of unintentional hammer release or follow through caused by sear bounce.INERTIA FIRING PIN: the firing pin, designed to be shorter than its housing, is held to the rear by a spring and can only protrude to hit a cartridge primer when a fully  cocked hammer blow overcomes the spring force and the inertia of the spring."
