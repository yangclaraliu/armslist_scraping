The EOTech EXPS2-0 has all the great features that EOTech Holographic Weapon Sights are known for in a significantly more compact package. This optic features a 7mm raised base for better iron sight access, and an adjustable quick-detach lever for easy and repeatable attachment and removal. The more compact design only requires 2.75 of rail space! The compact design used by the XPS and EXPS models was created by separating the battery compartment from the base and mounting it transversely. This not only dramatically decreases the over-all size of the optic, but allows the battery compartment to easily clear the delta ring on M4/M16 platform carbines and rifles. The A65/1 reticle features a 65MOA circle for fast target acquisition in CQB scenarios with a 1MOA aiming dot for precise shooting to mid ranges.

The original camera was too fragile and ceased working correctly. It works out better because the gopro camera is much higher quality anyways. The original camera and gimbal are included of course, and if you're tech savvy you could repair them. The remote has a tilt control lever on the back so you can still operate the gimbal's tilt while flying. Flight time is about 20-22 minutes per battery, which is more than enough.

From ruger overview:
THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® and SR-762™ offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

Lightning-fast in close quarters and superbly accurate for the long shot, the compact, short-action Model Seven™ has been a knock-down, drag-out leader in the woods since it was introduced in 1983. Its receiver and action design are based on the Model 700™ and deliver the highest level of out-of-the-box accuracy, strength and reliability in a platform that’s 2 3/8"" shorter overall and weighs just 6 1/2 lbs. (standard calibers).

Key Features:

2 3/8"" shorter overall length than Model 700 counterparts makes the Model Seven perfectly sized for small-statured shooters and densecover hunting situations
Compact design for fast handling in dense-cover situations
Features the same legendary strength as the Model 700 action: “Three-rings-of-steel” with the bolt face, barrel and receiver encasing the cartridge head
Cylindrical receiver design provides a consistent bedding area in the stock.

$860 FIRM in cash or higher in trade for the above stated package. Also, I have a Sig Kydex IWB right hand holster($50 new) and a Blade Tech Eclipse Ambi IWB/OWB holster($70 new). I was going to hang on to the holsters because I may pick up another P239 in the future, but I can add one or both for more $$$ or if you have something of higher value you want to offer. Both are in perfect condition, of course, and I can send a pic if any interest in one or both of these holsters. Just be specific on the trade offer and if you are wanting the holster(s) or just the Sig. 

I don't need anything, but I may look at trades only if it's a good deal, If it's not a good deal, I will politely pass. Mostly interested in semi-autos(AR's-AK's) along with several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects as long as your value on each is realistic, but will consider other firearms. Again, if your trade offer is not a good deal on the value, there is no reason to offer it as I will not be interested, just trying to save everyone some time.

Very cool chassis system for your M1A. Was going to build a Sage EBR clone and have decided to go a different route.

If you are not familiar with it this is a very popular chassis and scope mount as it is what the military has been using to re-purpose their M14's. The chassis increases accuracy and doesn't require a gunsmith to fiberglass or bed the action. Allows easy scope mounting and accessory mounting that you normally cant get with basic M1A stocks. and the adjustable comb cheek rest is very nice when running optics on a M1A. For additional info check out Sage's website:

http://www.sageinternationalltd.com/SIL/ebr.html

Picture doesn't do it justice. The FDE colored chassis is very hard to find and can be up to 6 months backorder.

Rifle has been cerakoted Atomic Burnt Bronze by Atomic Tactical. Gold inlay was done using Forsters gold fill kit, not a crappy paint job. Rifle has a Midwest Industries rail, synthetic Tapco grip and butstock, vertical fore grip and UTG LT-TL 101 flashlight. Rail has low profile rail covers. Rifle was made 922r compliant with Tapco double hook trigger/hammer group (3 compliant parts) (original Chinese components included-pictured in plastic bag). I also installed a retaining plate in lieu of the hook (drop in piece). Synthetic thumb hole stock is included. Will come with two mags. I am not the original owner. I have owned the rifle for almost two years and have only fired it twice: once to test it and once after it was cerakoted. No issues at all and less than 100 rounds fired by me. Smooth as butter! Cleaned after both trips to the range and was been oiled on a regular basis. What else can I say? It's a sweet piece, but I've got some trips coming up that need funding and I just don't shoot this beauty that often. 

 I will only sell/trade to a 21+ year old person with a CURRENT MN PTC or PTP and MN ID. Buyer/trader must be willing to present these at the time of sale and complete a Bill of Sale. NO EXCEPTIONS! I am not willing to ship and prefer transactions around the St. Peter area.

 Any questions, just send me a message. I do work for a living so I usually cannot respond between 8:00am-5:30pm, but rest assured I will get back to you ASAP. Those looking to get this for a WASR price need not waste their time but reasonable offers will be considered. 

 I can send more detailed pics of the cerakote and gold inlay. Just let me know.

This is a Remington 03-A3 chambered in 30-06.  It has a correct 12-43 sniper barrel, a correct sniper stock, and a correct Weaver 330 scope.  I have seen the scopes sell for 300+ on gunbroker.  The scope mount is post war.  The mount fits into the rear dovetail, there is a barrel ring between receiver and stock that has a thickened section with a screw thread that the mount screws into so the receiver HAS NOT been drilled and tapped.  The serial number is under the mount, which would tell you that it is not a 03-A4, which is the military designation of a true 03 sniper rifle.  The rifle is in excellent condition, the proof marks on the stock are still clear.

This revolver is in excellent condition and has not been shot much.  It has several minor marks in the blueing, but nothing major.  I purchased it from an older gentleman who hadn't fired it in 20 years and never shot it much.  I don't think I have put 100 rounds through it.  It has been reliable and accurate though and I have been regularly able to ring the gong target at 100 yards with all of my loads, even with cheap HSM cowboy loads.  If you know anything about these guns you know they are well known for being ultra tough and reliable.  I purchased this gun to use for grizzly bear defense when I moved to Montana and now that I have moved I have no real use for it so I am selling to try out some new hobbies.

The gun can also come with any combination of accessories as well as the original box and hard case as well as manual and even the lock and plastic wrap it came in.  I also have a basic hunter holster for it, a nice cowboy action style western holster and belt and a really comfortable chest holster (perfect for wearing with a backpack).  I have 2 6 round speed strips, 23 300 gr hunting or bear defense loads, and 88 plinking rounds.  In addition I have 44 mag dies and at least 300 pieces of starline brass as well as 250 or so Berry's bullets, 475 Missouri Cast Bullets, and 20 or so Cast Precision bullets that you can make an offer on.

I am asking 450 for the gun, 50 for the Triple K Cartridge Belt and Holster, 75 for the Chest Holster and 15 for the Hunter Holster.  I will sell the gun and all holsters for 550 and include the loaded ammo for another 25.  Make a fair offer for the reloading components, but I won't sell it until I sell the gun.

I am willing to travel to meet you within  Ohio as long as you are a resident of Ohio and not otherwise prohibited from owning a firearm.  If you are under 21, don't contact me.  If you are unable to legally own a firearm, (unable to pass NICS), don't contact me. Depending on how far I have to drive to meet you, please keep this in mind when asking me to negotiate.  

If you live outside of Ohio, your local FFL can provide a copy of his license and I can ship to his address of record after I confirm it.  The cost of shipping will be added to your cost, as will the cost your local FFL charges for processing the paperwork.  If your FFL will only accept shipments from other FFL's, I can arrange that, but it will add to the cost.

This is the whole Package.  It is a DAO 9mm pistol with a threaded barrel, 2 mags (marked with glow-in-the-dark paint), an additional adapter that will allow you to use a mag from a full size P250 in a P250C (it gives you another two rounds).  

The custom case was the case I originally received the pistol in.  The barrel was, of course, not the original barrel, and represented a significant investment over and above the cost of the pistol.  (the original barrel was sold to offset the cost of the threaded barrel)

This pistol also has a threaded barrel.  I have read various articles and was finally allowed to test-fit my threaded barrel into a Sig P320C and YES. IT FIT. 

The grip package, magazines and barrel can be used on the P320.  The Fire Control Group and slide are the only parts that are P250 parts.  

If you're interested in all or part of the package, please let me know.  To a degree, I'm willing to split up the package.

Some shoot well, but some don't.  Despite the fact that it would be the only rifle in my collection that was chambered in 30/06, I bought it anyway.  I liked shooting it.  In spite of the break in the crosshairs (if you're interested in buying the rifle, I can send you a photo of the reticle), it holds a zero very nicely, not just between shots, but between sessions.  

The rifle will make a good coyote (if you're in Ohio) or deer (if you live somewhere else) rifle. It isn't so pretty that you'll feel bad if you scratch it up a little, but it's wood stock still looks good.  

The rifling in the barrel is still crisp (I have a photo of that, too).  It groups nicely.  

If you're interested in a good rifle that is going to deliver when you pull the trigger, let me know.  I am open to some discussion on price, but major lowballing isn't appreciated.  

I am willing to drive to meet other buyers who reside in Ohio and who are not prohibited from owning a firearm for any other reason.  If you are prohibited from owning a firearm, please do not contact me.  

If you live outside the state of Ohio, I can ship to your local FFL after receipt of a copy of his license.  Cost of shipping will be added to your purchase price (open to discussion).  If your FFL only accepts shipments from FFL's, this can also be done. It just adds to the cost.

The BCG is nickel boron so it's a breeze to clean, basically just wipe it with a paper towel and you are good to go. GA drivers license needed, pickup only. 

Will come with:
Nickel Boron bolt carrier AND bolt. 
FDE magpul BAD lever
2 magpul window mags and 2 steel GI mags 
1 box of 62 grain green tip ammo
The hard case shown in the pictures
One bipod (6-9 inch, I think!)

NO SCOPE INCLUDED!!!!!!!


Very willing to negotiate within reason. Asking 900 will go with OBO
