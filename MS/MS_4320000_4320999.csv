I have a Walther PPS for sale. It is a 9mm with the case, lock and 4 magazines (one 7 Rd and three 8 Rd mags). One 8 round mag is still in it's original box. 

It has only been fired a handful of times (no more than about a hundred rounds shot through it). Farthest I shot with it is about 35 yards and she tacks.  I've only had it about 3 months now and I don't need to sell her but I would like the money right now.

I am asking $500 FIRM (mostly because the magazines were expensive (you're looking at 40 bucks a mag and I bought it with only 1).  I honestly have $600 in this but I need to get rid of it.

Please don't e-mail me saying well ""I can buy a brand new one for $450-500 with 1-2 mags"". I understand it's a bit high but again it's best offer and realize it's only a 3 month old gun in immaculate condition with FOUR magazines and a LOW round count. Because after the taxes on the gun and then the extra mags you are going to be spending more than what I am asking. You can pick it up for less than everything seperatly and in one stop. No online shopping, no gunshop, no shipping charges, no anything. Just cash.

I really don't want to ship it but I might if you're serious (I would have to look at the shipping prices first though). I can meet in Lima, or Kalida area. I will not come to you.

I will want proof you are of age to buy a weapon. No-one under the age of 21 and no individuals who cannot own a weapon.

I know I am long winded but just want to make sure I cover every base so I don't waste your time or mine.

You can get a hold of me by either responding to this posting, or texting/calling me on my cell phone at four 1 nine, ate nine 0, six 9 zero seven; name is Dustin

The Tactical Machining AR-15 lower receiver is built from 7075-T6 forgings from the lead forge in the United States. The contour is fully machined leaving no flash marks from the forging and we take extra care when machining our lower receivers resulting in tolerances that are tighter and fits that are better than other lower receivers. We adhere to mil-spec tolerances to ensure that our lower receiver remains compatible with any quality aftermarket parts you can find. After the machining process is complete the lowers are checked for quality and shipped off to our finishing facility for type III hard coat anodizing.

Unit was assembled with a DPMS LRPK-1 kit and a tan/fde adjustable stock. Will be sold through FFL Dealer."

The Pro Tek Story:

The story behind the development of the Pro-Tek models starts like this: Angus always carried a sub-compact model.  Our facility is located in a commercial area and we frequently work the weekends playing catch up mostly. It was a Saturday afternoon Angus heard a banging thought it was someone stopping by with a parts delivery. After opening the door in the warehouse he sees across the street a car with an individual pointing a shot gun at him. Angus drew his sub-compact and took a sight picture realizing now that the short sight radius wouldn’t forgive any inaccuracy in sight alignment he thought better and didn’t return fire. Angus is a well trained in tactical scenarios and also a quite accomplished shooter. If Angus didn’t feel good about the shot could someone with less training make that shot?

The decision was made to go to the Compact models for the additional sight radius and more capacity. The problem was they weren’t comfortable to carry. So the ideas were brewing at that point. We have done lots of 1911 work in the past and melting down the pistol is quite common. We also know that removing some of the mass of the slide will allow the slide to move faster. This allows for quicker recovery and less mass reciprocating. Novak style sights were added for their low drag and resistance to snagging on clothing. We used tritium inserts in the sights since most encounters aren’t in bright light but in lower light situations.

What do we do to the Pro-Tek models? Why do they cost so much? We start with the PCR or P01 model we debur or dehorn the slide frame and controls. We blend the aluminum grips to match the frame so there are no edges to bother the skin or body. To reduce slide mass we CNC cut 45's and flat top, then surface grind for a perfect smooth finish to reduce mass. We machine a Novak cut into the slide for the Champion Extreme Duty night sights. We install a custom made Trijicon front sight. We open up the magwell to make reloads smoother and easier. Most of this work is done by hand (blending) then we send the frames out for hard anodizing. The process takes about 8 hours or so. The result in my opinion one of the most comfortable and easiest to shoot carry guns available."

No Internal Lock, NO MIM parts! This is an extremely nice and rare piece. This is a Smith & Wesson 629 N Frame Revolver chambered for .44 Magnum. This started out life as a 6.5"" barreled revolver with a standard fluted cylinder. After hundreds of dollars later and a few weeks at the S&W factory Performance Center, it was transformed. They swapped out the barrel for a brand new 3"" full lug barrel, as well as replaced the fluted cylinder with a new unfluted cylinder (with newer style extractor too!) Front sight was replaced with a HI-VIZ fiber optic front sight. Generic rubber grips were replaced with Hogue Premium hardwood Lamo Camo grips. Did I mention the trigger is one of the greatest triggers you could find on a revolver? It has a very smooth, light, and clean break- nothing like the revolvers of today. As far as I know, the trigger is factory. Since the new barrel and cylinder, I have had 100 flawless factory rounds through this gun. Definitely a hand cannon, but very controllable and fun. Includes a mint condition Milt Sparks PMK black leather holster that was custom made for this fine handgun. You don't see these very often, don't let it pass you by.

  This is Grandpaws old gun..When he came back from WWI he said he was going to treat himself to a new gun.
  This pistol was bought i 1913..Although it is called a 1903 series..When he passed
away my Father recieved it..The Colt was wrapped in a old rag, stowed away in a
closet ever since it was bought.
  My Father said he couldn't remember if he ever shot it ?  My Grandmother said she never saw it out of the cigar box in all her years. (I sold the cigar box for $45.00)
  Now I have the Colt.  Had it for 35 years..Just like my Father I never shot it..I had
different gun dealers and collectors look at it..They all said it doesn't appear to be fired.
  The grips are a mother of pearl look. The clip has the horse on the bottom. I don't
know where the stock grips are ??  What I do know is that all that looked at it said
it was a 95% plus.  There is a very small gigger chip on the inside bottom grip as shown.  (Sorry for the Crappy photos)
   If you are looking for a as new 1903 Colt pistol ? This is for you.  This is a EXCELLENT EXAMPLE of times past/  I like the pistol but I don't plan on shooting it
and have no one to leave it to.    So herer it is for sale.
  The gun dealers said it is worth $800.00 to $1,100. They offered me $700.00
This is my one shot deal. I want to get at least $800.00 to sell it
  This is a beautiful old pistol that would be great for the collector or just to have."

I am selling because I sold my AK and have these laying around and need to get rid of them. I also have a standard fully functioning AK mag that I will throw in for free because it has a slight bit of pitting on the outside. all of these mags run great with no issues!!! 

Avoid shipping and buy these mags. they are a great commodity especially during times of political change. they will only go up in value.

And that extra magnification means better image resolution and a better view... in complete darkness! Better yet, the Night Owl 5X Night Vision Monocular doesn't sacrifice light amplification for the added magnification like some 1st generation night vision devices do. Nope. Its light-swallowing 50 mm diameter objective lens teams with a high-quality 1st generation intensifier tube and built-in infrared illuminator to pull your target out of the darkest shadows and into plain sight. Nice and bright, clear and crisp.

Purchased this stock kit for a build I'm working on but before it arrived I found a different kit I liked better.  As it is this kit is brand new and unused and ready to be installed. Comes with the buffer tube, spring, buffer, castle nut, and a mil spec carbine stock.  The stock did not come with it but was taken off of a different rifle when I bought it new and was never used.  Buffer tube is mil spec in dimension and the positions are laser engraved so you can see what position your stock is in by just looking at it.  Great choice if you're working on a build right now and it will screw into any lower receiver with standard threads.

I have no use for it so I'd like to sell it for $50, just looking to get what I have in it back out.  Would also consider trades for AR mags or partial trade for quality optics of some kind.

Completely original, this pistol has the correct light grey parkerized finish that was used in the last months of production (after about serial number 2,380,000). All parts are correct/original and the condition is very hard to beat, this pistol is nearly new! It has the correct late serrated slide lock, late 8-rib mainspring housing, HS contract barrel, correct hammer, correct Keyes Fibre grips, etc. The finish is completely original with the ""P"" proofs matching in size/shape and showing the characteristic burnishing, having been stamped after parkerizing. The ordnance crossed cannons, FJA inspectors marking, and the serial number also show the stamped after finish, burnished appearance. As expected, the bullet ramp is bright, milled after finish. The original light grey parkerized finish shows a few normal handling marks, but is one of those rare military 1911A1's that has almost no takedown scratch. The original finish rates about 98% and is free of any rust or pitting. The grips are in excellent condition as well with little wear and no cracks, chips or gouges. The mechanics appear to be in perfect working order and the bore is mirror bright with sharp rifling. This exceptional pistol comes with three original, late WWII General Shaver contract magazines as well as an unissued/original Boyt 45 marked holster w/ lanyard, original pistol belt, WWII double mag pouch (Boyle 1942), and original late war style Carlisle bandage in the original first aid pouch (Brede Inc. 1945).

Completely original, this pistol has the correct light grey parkerized finish that was used in the last months of production (after about serial number 2,380,000). All parts are correct/original and the condition is very hard to beat, this pistol is nearly new! It has the correct late serrated slide lock, late 8-rib mainspring housing, HS contract barrel, correct hammer, correct Keyes Fibre grips, etc. The finish is completely original with the ""P"" proofs matching in size/shape and showing the characteristic burnishing, having been stamped after parkerizing. The ordnance crossed cannons, FJA inspectors marking, and the serial number also show the stamped after finish, burnished appearance. As expected, the bullet ramp is bright, milled after finish. The original light grey parkerized finish shows a few normal handling marks, but is one of those rare military 1911A1's that has almost no takedown scratch. The original finish rates about 98% and is free of any rust or pitting. The grips are in excellent condition as well with little wear and no cracks, chips or gouges. The mechanics appear to be in perfect working order and the bore is mirror bright with sharp rifling. This exceptional pistol comes with three original, late WWII General Shaver contract magazines as well as an unissued/original Boyt 45 marked holster w/ lanyard, original pistol belt, WWII double mag pouch (Boyle 1942), and original late war style Carlisle bandage in the original first aid pouch (Brede Inc. 1945).

Completely original, this pistol has the correct light grey parkerized finish that was used in the last months of production (after about serial number 2,380,000). All parts are correct/original and the condition is very hard to beat, this pistol is nearly new! It has the correct late serrated slide lock, late 8-rib mainspring housing, HS contract barrel, correct hammer, correct Keyes Fibre grips, etc. The finish is completely original with the ""P"" proofs matching in size/shape and showing the characteristic burnishing, having been stamped after parkerizing. The ordnance crossed cannons, FJA inspectors marking, and the serial number also show the stamped after finish, burnished appearance. As expected, the bullet ramp is bright, milled after finish. The original light grey parkerized finish shows a few normal handling marks, but is one of those rare military 1911A1's that has almost no takedown scratch. The original finish rates about 98% and is free of any rust or pitting. The grips are in excellent condition as well with little wear and no cracks, chips or gouges. The mechanics appear to be in perfect working order and the bore is mirror bright with sharp rifling. This exceptional pistol comes with three original, late WWII General Shaver contract magazines as well as an unissued/original Boyt 45 marked holster w/ lanyard, original pistol belt, WWII double mag pouch (Boyle 1942), and original late war style Carlisle bandage in the original first aid pouch (Brede Inc. 1945).

The trigger group is the serialized part of the gun. The magazines that are new in package came from SIG at the price of 46.00$ apiece. The grips also came from SIG at the price of $46.00 apiece. Prices are all listed on SIG Sauer Store on their website. I am open to trades, equal or lesser trade with cash on your end. This gun is in absolute mint shape as are all accessories that come with it. Looking for 900 in cash or trade, this is a large bundle and the two-tone 9mm is worth 600.00 by itself.

These come straight from the range and have NOT been processed or cleaned. 4 bags of 1000ct in each bag and 1 bag with 1070ct. 
I have also added 20 rounds EXTRA in each bag to compensate for damaged brass.

These are military crimped brass. ALL of the brass came off a semi-indoor range with concrete floors.

Mixed head stamps, BUT most of them are Winchester (WCC), head stamped.

I hand sorted & counted the brass and only found 3 or 4 casings that were bad.

$60.00 for each 1000ct bag.
$64.00 for the one 1070ct bag.
CASH only......Please NO trades.....I need the cash more so than trades.

This breaks down to .06 cents per round, and once cleaned & processed, you still can make a profit at .09+ cents per round, once de-primed and cleaned. 

Also you wont have to pay shipping costs, which adds to the cost per round, on the Internet.

This is an ideal find for the ones that reload their own ammo, for any reason, shooting/prepping/etc..

These characteristics have proven highly appropriate for the .50 BMG, allowing shooters to accurately reach to 2000 yards and beyond. It retains a slim profile and is easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems. The superb resolution at high magnification also opens an entirely new world of extended range for the accomplished marksman.

The fact that it's not 7.62x39 & it can fire both .223 & 5.56 ammunition should make it even more attractive! If you want after you purchase you can customize these very easily. There are tons of add ons & modifications available- from sight mounts, to a wide variety of different kinds of grips, folding stocks & more!

This is a great deal, the best price you will ever see for a new rifle like this!!! It should sell fast. The rifle comes with 1 magazine (eventhough two are shown in the pic).

Also have a 33 round mag that is just fun to have, if nothing else. Also comes with a IWB kydex holster. The slide has been white color filled and 1 of the mags also has been to. 
This gun is a excellent shooter, even being the sub compact model with a little range time you can get back on target and get off follow shots pretty quick and with great groups without having to carry a full size pistol. I've carried this gun for about 9 months now and it carries comfortably for my body size through all types of seasons and activities. It also has the Meprolight night sights with white recticles which are easy to identify in full sunlight. Also comes with 200 rounds of brass 9mm.

You may never get another chance to own a German P210.  Get it before I change my mind and keep this!  Want the attention of everyone at the gun club?  Many experts have never even touched one of these classics.  Revered by many as the finest combat 9mm pistol ever produced.  It is widely considered one of the most accurate combat pistols made.  The action is smooth as glass as well as the unbelievable trigger.  Like new with all papers and box.  Any discoloration in the photo is oil.  There is not a mark or flaw on this gun.  When it is gone you may be waiting a long time for another to appear.  I got wind that these will be produced in the US.  Say by to the German made apparently?   2012 date code.  Very low round count about 200 with no wear or issues.  Zero malfunctions.  It is a beauty. Fixed sights.  Prices have gone up on these prompting me to consider selling.  This is the only one on Armslist.  Yes, must complete transaction via FFL in the area.  Buyer pays the FFL fee ($20 or so)  No shipping.  No tire kicking.  This is the unicorn of pistols.  Oh, and yes, this is more accurate and has a better trigger than many will ever feel in a lifetime.  Some are selling for much more.  I will consider at least 2k and possible trade on top.  I like PPQ, Glock, Sig P320, etc.  No flakes!!  I don't need to sell and love it but cash talks.  Anything lower and I would keep it.  It may be months or years before another surfaces here.  There was only one of these on GB and it ended at $2,831 plus ship, tax, and FFL fees.  There are no others listed now.  No, I am not interested in your customized Taurus or custom rifle that is worth 3k to you and $500 to everyone else.  Some of the offers I am getting are unreasonable.  If yours is worth so much sell it then we can talk.  No rifles.  Thanks"

With its lightweight 22 oz. polymer frame, thin profile, and ramped 3.2 inch barrel, the newly designed Millennium G2 is the ideal concealed carry handgun. Available in two compact models—PT 111 and PT 140—the Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment.
Taurus Security System (TSS)s Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Loaded Chamber Indicator Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms. Accessory Rail Features the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessories

The 10.5"" 5.56 is DI LMT barrel w/ a AAC 51T Brake. never fired

The 8.5 .300 BLK is a Noveske barrel custom made for use w/ a MRP platform.

The 12.5"" piston barrel assembly was upgraded with a POF rollercam upgrade which has significantly smoothed carrier travel. And the plug on the piston is not the standard plug it is the upgraded version, that is offered by LMT's, that is for suppressed and unsuppressed fire. The difference between the standard plug and the upgraded plug is the standard plug only has one side that is open for fire the other is closed. Where as with the suppressed and non-suppressed plug there are holes on both sides of the plug to better regulate gas flow for when you are running either non-suppressed or suppressed fire. (The piston configuration was used with my other MRP, ~120 rounds to function test it.)

This is a good build and has been a lot of fun. Very accurate with a lot of life left in it.
The front band screw won't tighten past a certain point but it can easily be replaced for a few dollars and 10 minutes of your time. It still holds the band in place so it's not necessarily a mandatory fix but if it's something that bothers you, it won't take very long to do.

That does not mean that I bought it, fired it and put it back in the box like so many of the weapons on here being sold as new. This is brand new and as yet, unfired. The only thing I have had time to do is to mount a SureFire tac light and a brand new Grip Pod. The tac light is from one of my ARs but is only a month old. It has the remote pressure switch attached to the grip but can obviously be moved. This is my 3rd one of these carbines. They are hands down the best, nicest and most realistic of all the .22 AR replicas out there in my opinion for whatever that is worth. They are all metal, not plastic like the others on the market. It even has a very cool feature where the user can adjust the bolt speed to run different types of ammo. I wish my 5.56 ARs had this feature. Very nice. This sale will include the light and Grip Pod as seen in the pics but I am happy to keep them. I will sell just the Colt for 475 cash with everything it came with, including the warranty card for you to fill out and send in. This is exactly how my first two were set up and it seemed perfect to me. I am looking for cash but I will consider some trades but no crap!! ARs, AKs and 1911s are pretty much all I am interested in but will consider some striker fired pistols. I will meet at any dealer that is close to both of us to do the transfer or whatever it is called now. If it sells before the law takes effect in a couple of months I am happy to meet somewhere halfway for each of us provided it is within reason. I want to see your valid ODL and prefer to deal with fellow CHL holders. If no CHL a simple bill of sale for my own personal records will be filled out and signed by both of us. Thank you for looking at my ad."
