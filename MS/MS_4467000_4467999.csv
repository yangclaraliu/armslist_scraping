ZEV Technologies Match Grade drop-in barrels feature extremely tight tolerances and are manufactured with pre-hardened chromium stainless steel (416R) that was originally designed for use in Match Grade rifle barrels. This material provides high tensile strength and toughness to withstand typical chamber pressures while still being highly corrosion resistant.

ZEV Match Grade barrel bores are some of the most precise in the industry. Every barrel is double honed (rough and finish) until a minimum surface finish of 16 RA is reached. During this process the barrels are held to a final dimension of +/- 0.0002” for consistency and accuracy. The barrels are cut rifled and 100% inspected for groove dimensions and broach finish.

- 416R Gun Barrel Quality Stainless Steel
- 4 inch Match Grade drop in barrel
- Final dimension of +/- 0.0002” for consistency and accuracy

I copied this from WMD guns website so you can see why this coating is so awesome.....

Why NiB-X™?

All Nickel Boron is NOT the same. WMD’s proprietary NiB-X coating process is unique not only in our non-lead-based formulation...but also in how we apply the coating! We've heard from multiple sources that “mom & pop plating shop” coatings are flaking, delaminating, and not performing well.
NiB-X offers the optimal combination of all three key firearm performance factors: hardness, lubricity, and wear resistance. There are no coatings that optimize this combination of performance attributes like NiB-X.
NiB-X achieves a hardness of Rockwell 70 (harder than chrome!) and a coefficient of friction of just .06.
NiB-X is applied in a facility that has earned NADCAP accreditation—the highest level of process control recognized in the aerospace industry! What’s more our NiB-X coating are certified to ASTMB607 and/or AMS2433C.
Remember: the X in NiB-X stands for more than eXtreme durability, performance and reliability—it also stands for eXpert chemistry, processing, application and engineering.

The slide has a lifetime warranty if there's any flaking, pits, rust anything.  A lot easier to clean too.

I couldn't find much about the value of something like this. Although I did have a family friend that is a gunsmith and somewhat of a collector look at it.  He said that if it wasn't modified to shoot the Ackley round, it would be worth about $1,300-$1,500.

So without knowing exactly what I have---my price is negotiable.

I am selling my H&K VP9, purchased in December of 2014 before the SSE ban. It comes with everything the gun originally came with. It is in near flawless condition. Less than 200 rounds through it and always cleaned thoroughly. Never had any problems with the function of the gun and am selling it because I've realized I prefer the weight and feel of a steel gun rather than polymer.

The gun was purchased from an FFL dealer who modified the two magazines it comes with to hold 8 rounds. It doesn't appear to be pinned, just glued at the bottom with what I'm guessing may be a spacer inside to prevent any more rounds from fitting. I guess he did this to be extra safe.

I am also including a Fobus holster. The case has some scratches on the outside from transportation. 

Sale will take place at The Target Range in Van Nuys. Buyer pays all transfer fees.

Thanks for looking."
