The SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace is a shooter's aid that is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols. Now available in Black and Flat Dark Earth. This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil when using an AR-style pistol .Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.
The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator's forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.
Features:
Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.

In rarity the IHC Garands are king. Gap letter IHC's being the second rarest variant only to arrowheads. This one being offered is very nice! It went through Rock Island Armory at some point as evident by the RIA stamp on the stock. It was also re parkerised while there. The surprising part is it retained several of its IHC parts, as well as the IHC stock! The Opp rod is a WWII cut SA, and the gas plug is a make I am unfamiliar with. It retained it's original LMR barrel from 53 with the ordanences wheel stamp, not the DOD stamp. The stock indicates it was a later production 52 via the barrel channel numbers. This rifle would make a true gem in any collection. Please request more pictures, I have several to send. As of Tuesday, I listed this gun on Gunbroker. I figured I would see what was out there in trade before the reserve is hit. Let's see what you have."

	Hey everyone, 
I have up for trade/sale a used but decent shape bolt Action 20 gauge shotgun. This is a Stevens Model 258 bolt action and magazine fed shotgun. It is in decent shape for its age and appears to function fine. About the only problems are that if you bring back the bolt “hard” when opening it, it can slip over the catch and come out. However, this shouldn’t affect the shooting of the gun as it still locks up perfectly into battery aside from that. And the bead is broken off the front (like just about every one of these I’ve ever seen actually haha). I have not shot it, but only because i don’t live where i can easy shoot shotguns and i have not had the time to do so. However, I have no reason to believe it wouldn’t run just fine. 
	This is for pickup in Norman only. I would also consider trades for certain other firearms, 357 magnum brass, or possibly 6.5x55 swede ammo. Just shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting

The perfect compliment to your maglite solvent trap project, or approved form 1 build. These are completely legal, as long as you do not drill through them before receiving approval for your form 1 build and tax stamp from the BATF.

These steel freeze plugs are formed on a 20-ton press to maintain a complete forming, and a consistent shape. These have concentric cones, with a consistent angle and the center point clearly marked for easier installation. The cone is formed at roughly a 50 degree angle to the perpendicular center line of the walls.

I also offer center marked (not formed) freeze plugs.

I do not sell the C-Cell plugs, or recommend that size. It has a dramatically reduced internal volume, which reduces it's usefulness. Also, the plugs being used for the C-cell are flared out to fit. This means that only the outermost point of the plug is making contact with the wall, and leaves it prone to turning out of position if exposed to pressure. In my experience, you'll be much further ahead, and safer, if you use the D-cell instead.

After shooting it a number of times I find I prefer my M1 over it. I am also looking to get an 1903 Springfield that a friend is selling. I have not taken it apart. I just bought it and shot it. I got is as a present to myself for getting a new job.

The obvious stuff is that it is chambered in 30-06, it is a 1903A3 in a straight stock, and it is made by Remington.

The more in depth stuff I have been told by a friend who knows more about these are is it is a really nice greek return with an amazing bore. No pitting or frosting, two groove rifling, and it has a really slick bolt. The only bolt gun I have slicker than it is my No.4 Mk. 1 Lee-Enfield. It has been blued and has basically new fittings. The stock unfortunately has been sanded, but for me it looks really nice even with that. It does come with the front sight hood protector.

Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing in a .45 caliber pistol. With all of these advantages, especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30 is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the US.""

I have owned this pistol for several years and it has been my primary protection piece hidden away inside my vehicle.  I've taken this pistol to the range at least once every 6 months and have fired a box of shells through it to be sure everything was up to having my life depend on it.  I can honestly say that with any brand of factory .45 ACP ammo that I've never had even one single failure of any kind.  Even better, this pistol is as accurate as some of my .45's that I have 4X or 5X as much money invested in.

The sights are TruGlo fiber optic sights (not TFO) that convinced me to go with a different color front sight.  I always thought it looked dumb to have a different color front sight, but I can draw this weapon and fire on target much faster than I can with any weapon with matching sights.  I hate to see my baby go, but I can no longer justify having 2 or 3 of the same pistols sitting around.  Depending on how much you want to spend, I have tons of extra magazines I could add to this pistol.  

It comes with 2 along with the original paperwork, cleaning brush etc. that came with the pistol.  Sitting right next to me I see 4 additional 10 round factory Glock mags, each with the $6 Pierce pinky extension (as pictured with the 2 in the box) as well as 3 of the factory Glock 13 round magazines.  The buyer has the option to buy the 10 rounders with Pierce pinky extensions for $12 each and/or the 13 round factory Glock .45 ACP magazines for $17 each.  Heck, I even found to brand new 28 round .45 ACP mags that I'll let go for $20 to the buyer of the pistol.  You can REALLY be locked and loaded when leaving the house if you buy all the mags with the pistol!!

For a quick sale, the Glock 30 with box, papers and original 2 mags for $449.  You can add to that whatever additional magazines you want.  Buyer must have valid IN driver's license and preferably an IN carry permit."

Product Description
If the thought of carrying a rifle up a mountain or through thick brush is weighing you down, take a load off. The Henry Big Boy Carbine is a modern carry-over of the 'Trapper' classics of the past. It combines all the features of Henry's legendary Big Boy rifle with the quick handling of a shorter, lighter carbine barrel length which decreases barrel weight by almost a pound. It's the ideal brush gun for tight spaces, but don't let its compact size fool you. The shorter barrel gives up nothing in accuracy to the regular Big Boy. And like the classic Henry Big Boy, the attention to detail in the design with great western styling including the large loop lever makes holding this rifle as thrilling as it is to shoot. The 16.5"" octagonal barrel is outfitted with a classic fully adjustable semi-buckhorn rear sight with a reversible white diamond insert and a brass beaded front-sight. The tubular magazine tops off at 7 rounds. Both the straight-grip stock and forearm are crafted of select American walnut accented with a brass barrel band and Henry's recognizable brass receiver. All have that crisp, smooth action that sets an authentic American-made Henry apart from other lever action rifles on the range and in the woods today. Whether you're looking for the perfect gun to saddle up with or to hog hunt across the Florida backwoods, the Henry Big Boy Carbine is the big shot in a small package you've been waiting for.

Single action/double action. Steel frame. Ambidextrous decocker. Firing pin block. 3 Dot tritium night sights. Integral 1913 accessory rail. Rubber grips. Black polycoat. Extended beavertail to protect shooter's strong hand.


The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. 
 Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat fi nish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the CZ 75 Compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry with checkering in key areas on the front and back straps combined with the redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decreases the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transitions.
 The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the fi eld of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

My name is clayton thompson. I strongly recommend that you follow up on this link to oppose the new senate bill against private sale of firearms! Senate bill 941. 
http://www.oregonfirearms.org/no-expanded-background-checks 
I talked with republican senator Doug Whitsett, and this was his response. ""The Second Amendment is the lynchpin of our United States Constitution. I have strongly opposed any infringement on that unalienable right, including any expansion of the mandatory state background check system. I will not change that firm stance.



For the past four years, fourteen Senate Republicans and Senator Betsy Johnson (D) have maintained a 15 vote coalition that has prevented any anti-gun bills from moving through the state Senate. I was instrumental in establishing that coalition.



Two of the fourteen Senate Republicans were defeated in the November 4th election. Although I will continue to strenuously oppose anti-gun laws, our coalition no longer has the votes in the Senate to stop or in any way alter their passage.



May I suggest that you and fellow passionate defenders of the Second Amendment focus your attention on developing two more strong no votes from among the Senate Democrat Caucus?



Best regards,

Also might have some winchester pdx 410 laying around. Not certain but if I find them will give those with. This is/was my only 45lc and or .410 so I have no use for any of the ammo or conversion kit. Price is fair and reasonably firm.

Bought the barreled action and it was sent to Kevin of Weaver Rifles to have them put it all together.  They squared up the action and bolt faces, lapped in the lugs and adjusted the trigger to break at 2.5lbs.  Then High Tech Industries installed a High Tech synthetic stock with Marine Tex bedding, a one inch Pachmayr Decelerator pad and a Recoil Suppressor. Stock is setup for a Ching sling with three swivel studs and is grey with black spots.  Then Accurate Plating and Weaponry matte hard chrome all the metal.  Finally, Wild West Guns chambered the rifle using their match reamer.  Leupold mounts are included.  The rifle has only been fired 40 times for a break-in of the barrel, as recommended by MRC, but never hunted with.  I have over $2500 in the rifle, was selling for $2000 but dropped the price to $1500 plus shipping.  More pictures available.
