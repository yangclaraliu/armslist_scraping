The PX4 Storm SD .45 ACP semiauto pistol was developed to meet the very demanding requirements issued by the US Special Forces Command (SOCOM) for their Joint Combat Pistol. They called for superior weather resistance, three magazines (one 9-round flush and two 10-round extended), dark earth frame, extended barrel for threading, tactical case and additional accessories. Beretta answered the call successfuly, not just by merely rechambering the PX4 Storm to .45 ACP--but rather by redesigning its internal components to meet and exceed all these requirements. The result is a pistol that satisfies not only SOCOM's requirements, but the most demanding shooter looking for the absolute best and most reliable for personal defense, competition or carry.
Special Duty (SD) Tactical Pistol
The “SD” denomination of this handgun stands for “Special Duty.” That means a pistol that will be reliable in the toughest and most demanding conditions. Military trials for the PX4 Storm SD have proven that it will keep performing in spite of salt, mud, water, rain, snow, sand or anything else you can throw at it. This is because every internal component was engineered, produced and treated to function in such extreme environments.
Low-Recoil, Powerful Super-Accurate
The PX4 Storm SD features a rotating barrel system. This means that under recoil, the barrel rotates, thereby dissipating momentum radially, which translates in much lower felt recoil and muzzle jump, even with hotter .45 ACP rounds. Furthermore, the extended cold-hammer forged barrel is 4.5” long and allows the power of the .45 to fully develop before exiting the muzzle. And the out-of-the-box accuracy of this handgun is as good as it gets in a tactical pistol.
Packed with Tactical Features The reversible mag-release, ambidextrous safety, drop-free magazine, commander-style hammer and easy-on-target 3-dot sights are only some of the tactical features of this Beretta .45. An integral Picatinny rail forward of the trigger guard enables easy mounting of tactical lights, laser aiming devices or other accessories. And like all best-quality military arms the PX4 Storm SD takes mere seconds to disassemble without any tools. When the impossible is expected, the PX4 Storm SD is the absolute best companion to have at hand."

Concealment. It has a straight cant, Paul Howe mod, and kydex clip. The Paul Howe mod was a special request by me, which is basically an extended shirt guard that allows you to remove the gun from the holster off body with one hand. The holster conceals very well, and is extremely comfortable. I configured it the way it is for appendix carry, but I have just as easily switched it to strong side occasionally. 

It was used for a few months, and has little to no wear. The draw is incredibly smooth, and Bruce's(the holster maker) craftsmanship is second to none. This is not a cheap Ebay holster, and CC's wait times(typically months) reflect the quality of their work. The holster costs 60 plus shipping new, and you will wait for it.

Like new condition, less than 100 rounds through her. Box, docs, everything like new.The new Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, V9 Lightweight is approximately five ounces lighter than the standard V9. It's designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications. The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Light Weight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTIONLOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

Letting my favorite (and last two) 1911's go due to wrist problems that are not getting any better. It's not much fun to shoot .45 these days so I will be relegating myself to 9mm for the foreseeable future. As a consequence I'm letting these two go. They have ALL the bells and whistles and were custom ordered from what I consider to be the best semi-custom 1911 maker on the planet, GUNCRAFTER Industries.

#1 GUNCRAFTER ""NO NAME"" commander bobtail (aluma grips, flush cut slide stop, reverse crown barrel, etc) This gun has less than 200 rounds on it. It is flawless and these bobtail commanders are rather hard to come by. 

#2 GUNCRAFTER ""NO NAME"" government (this gun has every option from GI). I've probably put about 1000 rounds through this one. 

Neither gun has any scratches or finish issues and neither has EVER had a single malfunction of any sort. Both GI's come with all original packaging and will come with 3 WC 8rd mags each. I also have a ton of extra mags and thousands of rounds of .45 I can offer to the buyer for a great price."

The CZ 83 features an ambidextrous manual safety, magazine catch and slide stop on one side. When the last cartridge from the magazine has been fired, the slide is locked in its rear position. The magazine is of a double-column type with a single cartridge outlet. Due to its favorable caliber to weight ratio, reliability and compactness helps to facilitate the concealed carry of this pistol, thus predisposing it to become a popular sought-after handgun for personal defense. The pistol is supplied with 3 dot sights; tritium sights are available by special order.The pistol comes with one 13 round magazine and included is the leather holster which was the standard issue style.  This was a former Israeli Military sidearm which got little use and I would rate excellent condition as there doesn't appear to be any holster wear or other condition issues.  People who have seen it rate it 98%.  The importer mark is under the frame in front of the trigger guard so it is inconspicuous and doesn't spoil the look of the gun when looking at the side of it.Will have pictures later.These were on sale at Impact Arms new for $467.69These are extremely accurate because the barrel is connected to the body of the gun and doesn't move when the slide ratchets.  Since the barrel is held steady it is easier to keep the gun on target and to hit what you are shooting at.The CZ-83 bears some similarity to the Walther PPK. The PPK had been around for almost 20 years when CZ designed the CZ-50, a predecessor of the CZ-83. Their similarities suggest that Czech designers drew inspiration from 007’s famous sidearm.When these guns were imported, the importer went through thousands of these and cherry-picked the best ones.  They were magnafluxed and all serial numbers match.  The best of the best were sold through the importer and the rest were ""dumped"" on other retailers.An excellent review is here, where the author says one of these is by far a better concealed carry option than a comparable bargain priced gunA great YouTube video review is here!"

They are produced with a classic rifled barrel in 9 mm Browning Short (.380 ACP). The trigger mechanism is of a DA/SA type. The CZ 83 features an ambidextrous manual safety, magazine catch and slide stop on one side. When the last cartridge from the magazine has been fired, the slide is locked in its rear position. The magazine is of a double-column type with a single cartridge outlet. Due to its favorable caliber to weight ratio, reliability and compactness helps to facilitate the concealed carry of this pistol, thus predisposing it to become a popular sought-after handgun for personal defense. The pistol is supplied with 3 dot sights; tritium sights are available by special order.The pistol comes with one 13 round magazine and included is the leather holster which was the standard issue style. This was a former Israeli Military sidearm which got little use and I would rate excellent condition as there doesn't appear to be any holster wear or other condition issues. People who have seen it rate it 98%. The importer mark is under the frame in front of the trigger guard so it is inconspicuous and doesn't spoil the look of the gun when looking at the side of it.We are providing ""stock"" photos showing both sides of the pistol and the same holster we are selling which is made by Zili Praha which fits the 82 and 83 model.These were on sale at Impact Arms new for $467.69These are extremely accurate because the barrel is connected to the body of the gun and doesn't move when the slide ratchets. Since the barrel is held steady it is easier to keep the gun on target and to hit what you are shooting at.The CZ-83 bears some similarity to the Walther PPK. The PPK had been around for almost 20 years when CZ designed the CZ-50, a predecessor of the CZ-83. Their similarities suggest that Czech designers drew inspiration from 007’s famous sidearm.When these guns were imported, the importer went through thousands of these and cherry-picked the best ones. They were magnafluxed and all serial numbers match. The best of the best were sold through the importer and the rest were ""dumped"" on other retailers.An excellent review is here, where the author says one of these is by far a better concealed carry option than a comparable bargain priced gunAnd here is a great YouTube video."

The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 4.5” Full Size is the perfect pistol for those who are looking for full-size performance, sight radius and handling. The XD(M)® 4.5″ Full Size is the perfectly proportional combination of a 4.5″ barrel with a full-sized frame. The result is a service size pistol that’s ready for anything. The XD(M)® includes a number of features that will change your perception about what you can expect from your pistol. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision. Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs – all the way up to .45ACP. Try one today and see for yourself what a polymer pistol can be.

It will shoot 2-3/4"", 3"", & 3.5"" slugs from this premium rifled barrel system which has a BSA HUD display type scope with 4 - different patterns that can be selected mounted on the barrel. It has a synthetic stock with a shoulder strap attached to the gun. There is also a 26"" ventilated-rib barrel that has a ACCU-MAG choke system that has 3 different chokes and a front fiber optic sight that came with the gun originally. The slug barrel is brand new and this gun has not been shot very much since it was purchased brand new by the current owner several years ago. It also comes with a 52"" Plano Protector series hard plastic case with 4 latches and grey egg shell foam inside to protect the gun. These guns have a dual gas venting system which makes them the softest shooting 3.5"" shotguns available in the market. It also has an adjustable stock drop spacer system along with being over bored to 10 GA dimensions to eliminate shot deformation while using shot shells. The 26"" barrel is only chambered for 3"" & 3-1/2"" shells since this is stamped on the barrel.
  I am looking to sell this weapon system as soon as possible for a cash offer and I am not looking to make any trades for the gun, barrels, scope & case."
