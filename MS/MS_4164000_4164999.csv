""Greatest Group 
While I fully expected this rig to shoot right off the bat, I wasn’t prepared for the first 5-shot, 100-yard group fired with Black Hills Ammunition These first five 50-grain V-Max spitzers left doing 2,862 fps with an extreme spread of only 42 fps, and they kept slipping into the same hole­literally! Later, the dial caliper would indicate that the first five shots out of this .223 slipped into a group that measured .322 inch center-to-center! An out-of-the-box stock, shooting factory ammo and I’d just fired the greatest 5 shot group I’ve ever fired! Savage won’t see this one back."""

You Can Never Be Too Prepared. The Ruger SP101® revolver boasts the strength to handle the powerful 357 Magnum cartridge in a controllable, small-framed double-action revolver. Among the most powerful small-frame revolvers on the market, they are engineered for solid performance. Featuring a recoil-reducing grip, the SP101® is comfortable to shoot and perfect for personal defense or field use. Strong and reliable shot after shot, all SP101® revolvers have solid steel sidewalls (no side-plates), making them rugged, reliable, and dependable. This one is Double-Action-Only (DAO) defensive weapon.  Great for concealment or to be carried in a purse.
I am the original owner and have the original box  and all that came with it.  I have fired maybe 35 round through it.  It is in excellent near new condition.  I am reducing the herd since I have not carried this or shot it in over 1 year. 

$550 Cash, gun and original box only; $575 with 50 rounds of range target ammo and an in-the-waist holster.  TRADES ACCEPTED.  I will not respond to low ball offers.

With a 25 year track record of reliability, durability and performance in the field, P-Series pistols are simple, economical, and serviceable and can be counted on to perform in adverse conditions. The P345 is designed to be easily maintained and can be field-stripped into five major subassemblies for cleaning, without the need for special tools. Its black, custom-compounded polymer grip frame has a built-in picatinny rail to accept modern lights and lasers to keep your sighting options open and also features contoured and checkered grip panels, front-strap, and backstrap. The P345's high-visibility 3-dot sight system is drift adjustable on both the front and the rear for faster, more precise target acquisition while its manual safety is ambidextrous and within easy reach of either thumb. Its rugged slide is made of Ruger's proprietary Terhune Anticorro stainless steel. Two 8-round magazines and a hard plastic case included 

I am the original owner and have the original box with all the items that came from Ruger.  This weapon is in excellent condition and comes with an additional Ruger magazine making a total of 3 Ruger magazines.  The ramp has also been polished and I have about 125 rounds through it with the only issue of problems traced to bad crimped reloads not allowing the bullet to fully seat.

I also seem to be able to get quicker follow up shots with this rifle, in comparison with some of my other traditional bolt guns.  I recently installed the XS SIGHT SYSTEM: PART # RU-5000R-N, XS RUGER GSR RAIL ($90.00), which offers a full length scope rail, fully adjustable rear aperture which is integrated into the rail, and allows for expanded versatility over the factory mounted shorter rail, allowing for red dots, rmrs, scount scopes, and traditional optics.  All original paperwork, packaging, and lock are included with this auction. Also included will be the original 10 round mag that comes with the rifle. Please note: Questions or concerns, or for more pics, feel free to email anytime.

Cosmetically, you're looking at a rifle in 99-100% condition, and with a hair under 100 rounds down the barrel, it's barely broken in. 

 I paid close to $900 for this rifle back when I bought it, and they weren't yet readily available.  Today I see a lot more of them around for better pricing, so I'm looking for a trade around the $750-800 range, I'm willing to trade up or down, given it be the right deal, and I'll accept trade plus cash, or trade and give cash, but again, has to be the right item, and the right deal (Please Note:  it's nothing against you or what you're offering for trade, if I don't have interest in what you have to offer, I'm looking for some pretty specific items, worst thing I can do is tell you no, so please tell me what ya got, even if it isn't listed below, doesn't mean I wont have interest, I'm a collector, more than anything, and have interest in many firearms).  I'll do face to face only.  Since its a rifle, I don't expect an FFL transfer on my end, but do require to see a valid Drivers License or CCW permit.  If you want to buy the rifle outright, with no trade, I'm asking $750 OTD, Ill accept payment in 2 different ways, CASH, or I can accept CC's via SQUARE Card Processing for an additional 3% to cover processing fees.

Trades I would consider: 
***in NEW or NEAR NEW to excellent condition:  preferably with original box, etc***
Keltec KSG 12 Gauge (fde, od green, or patriot brown only)
Vepr .223 16"" (converted or not converted)
Saiga (factory conversion preferred) .223 16""
Keltec PMR (fde, od green, or patriot brown)
Ruger Super Blackhawk Stainless .44 Mag Hunter Model
S&W: Magnum Hunter/Stealth Hunter/R8/Thunder Ranch or similar
1911's:  Kimber, Sig Sauer, S&W
Factory Built Ar15's:  Colt, POF, LWRC, Troy, Daniel Defence, Noveske, etc
Springfield M1A Socom 16 
Other higher end or quality rifles or handguns (bolt, semi, wheelgun)

(Keep in mind, I know what all of the above items I've mentioned for trade, are currently selling for.  With that being said, I'm speaking of online pricing, where you're looking right now, not what they cost a few yrs ago, and not what your local overpriced gun dealer thinks he's gonna get, so please don't try to insult or pull a fast one on me, I'm not looking to screw anyone here, nor am I willing to be screwed myself, just looking for a fair trade:  up, down, or even, however it works out.  I consider myself a very fair and reasonable guy, and I'm open minded to all sorts of trades and offers, but if you think what you've got is worth gold, then you should probably keep looking for someone else to argue with bc that's not what I'm here for.  I'm also willing to travel to a certain extent, depending on the deal, and whatever we might happen to work out.

Also, a couple of other items, I'd consider throwin in, if your trade is of higher value & if you're interested:

Leupold VX-R 2-7x33 Firedot (LNIB) &/or
Eotech 552.A65 (Excellent with all original box and paperwork) &/or
Burris Fullfield Tac 30 1-4 Illum Ret w/ P.E.P.R. Mount and Fastfire III (LNIB) &/or
<<>>

*****If you're interested in my RUGER Scout Rifle, lemme know what you've got for trades folks, thanks for the interest and have a good day!

View with confidence, this rifle is next to new!  Thanks for the look, & God Bless!"

Full size, no front cocking serrations. Upgraded with Les Baer 1.5"" Guarantee (Please ask if you don't know what this is!)

Comes with the following:
- Pistol
- Manual, Patch, and all Materials included with the gun
- 3x Les Baer Magazines (unused, came with the gun)
- 6x Chip McCormick Power Mag Plus (Purchased new with the gun)
- Factory thin wood grips and screws (removed before the gun was fired)
- VZ Grips (installed, pictured on the gun below)
- Fired Casings (signed by Les himself, apparently Mr. Baer did the factory testing)
- UTC Pistol/ Mag Case (pictured)

Fired casings show a date of 9/30/13. 1450 rounds through the gun. I purchased the gun new, and followed the recommended break-in using the recommended ammunition. True to form, the UTC is just starting to loosen up. Very, very tight. Barrel, bushing, etc show clear marks from custom fitting. This gun is stupid accurate. Truly, you won't believe how tight the groups will be, even at distance. The UTC is essentially the same as the Thunder Ranch Special, without the cosmetic markings. 

I won't walk through the features of the gun except to mention that it does have the factory installed night sights. The only changes I've made are the VZ grips.

New this gun retails at $2,215, if you can find one. The 1.5"" guarantee adds $295. Add the grips, case, and mags, and this package is over $2,750 new.

In a split second, The Eliminator: Ranges your target, calculates your trajectory, Illuminates your perfect holdover
Eliminator lights a 1/3 MOA illuminated aiming dot showing exactly where your shot will go. With the Eliminator, just Range, Aim, and Fire.
Inclination Compensation
Wind Read Out
Extreme Range Ballistics
Parallax adjustment
1200+ yard ranging capability
Starting with the field-proven and bright crystal-clear optics of the original Burris LaserScope, The Eliminator provides a sophisticated yet very simple and accurate means of tailoring the scope's trajectory compensation to virtually any cartridge.
Sophisticated Technology Made Simple, Simple, Simple. Simply enter one of the 123 drop numbers into the Eliminator. In a split second, the Eliminator factors in the distance, the angle of the shot, and the ballistics of your cartridge or load, and presents a lighted dot for the perfect holdover. Ballistics Tables Made Simple. All you need to know is the drop in inches at 200 yards when sighted-in at 50 yards, or the drop in inches at 500 yards when your cartridge is sighted-in for 100 or 200 yards. Burris provides this drop number for more than 1,900 commercial cartridges. With your drop number established, you decide if you need or prefer to sight-in at 50, 100 or 200 yards. Precision Made Simple Sight-in your gun at your selected sight-in distance of either 50, 100 or 200 yards. Then verify point of impact by actual shooting at 200 or 500 yards. Depending on the exact ammo performance, your gun's barrel length, the elevation, and any extreme temperatures, you might need to increase or decrease your Drop Number by a couple of digits for exacting performance. Life Made Simple Your programming is stored in the scope no matter the condition of your battery and it will still remember your programming with no battery at all. The Burris Eliminator LaserScope is in a league of its own No other riflescope combines this level of quality, technology, accuracy, simplicity, repeatability and effectiveness. It will greatly increase the distance at which you can be confident in making an ethical shot. You do the shooting, the Eliminator will do the memorizing and calculating. The Eliminator is affordable and of a size and weight that's welcome for everyday field use. The revolutionary new Eliminator is a brilliant riflescope innovation that ensures long range success. Ultra Low Mounting System A proprietary mounting system developed by Burris allows for the lowest possible mounting of the LaserScope. Other mounting systems tend to position comparable scopes as much as two ring sizes higher, which inhibits natural shooting posture. Remote Activation The Burris LaserScope is a fully functional, self-contained unit. For maximum operational efficiency and fingertip control, a remote activation switch included with the LaserScope can be attached to the rifle's forearm. Programming Made Simple 1. First, push the Main Button (left side of scope) to turn on the electronics. Then push the Main Button once more to get three dashes in the range area. 2. Next, push the Forward Arrow button (right side of scope) then the Main Button. Hold simultaneously for 6 seconds to enter Set-Up Mode. 3. Select either (Y)yards or (M)meters, press the forward button. 4. Select a (0) 50 yard sight-in, (1) 100 yard sight-in distance or (2) 200 yard sight-in distance, then press the forward button. 5. Select the two-digit Drop Number (04 thru 90) and press the back button. You're done!"

Competitive shooters and tactical operators prepare for serious state-of-the-art technology. XTR II riflescopes feature a five-times zoom system, 25% thicker tube construction, dimensionally-matched precision adjustment knobs, and Zero Click Stop technology. Superb, high-performance optics offer Hi-Lume® multi-coated lenses, optimizing target resolution, contrast, and low-light performance. All hand-fitted internal assemblies are triple-spring tensioned for absolute shock-proofing, even under severe recoil, and vibration resistant, even on extended vehicular patrols. True to brand principles, Burris XTR II scopes deliver far more than the modest-for-category price tags, and are protected forever with the Burris Unconditional Forever Warranty. Front Focal Plane Reticles Front Focal Plane (FFP) systems (sometimes referred to as First Focal Plane systems) place the reticle in front of the erector assembly or zoom mechanism. This allows the reticle to change size as magnification is adjusted. In FFP systems, when magnification is increased, the reticle size grows; as magnification is lowered, the reticle size shrinks. Because the reticle is changing with magnification, the measurements of the reticle are always correct and proportional to the target no matter which power setting you may be on. This is very useful in tactical situations when reticles are used to determine size and distance to a target, and when using the reticle for trajectory compensation at multiple magnification settings. G2B Mil-Dot™ Reticle

The G2B Mil-Dot is a mil-based reticle with hash marks in between the mil dots for more precise aiming, distance measurement, holdover and hold-off for wind. It is a versatile, combat proven reticle that is ideal for mid-to long-range tactical shooting. This reticle is available in the new MTAC line of riflescopes.

I got them for a project that I was working on but sold the rifles instead. You can see one issue with the stock. The previous owner did not know how to protect it when fitting a recoil pad. The good news is that he did not know enough to cut it down before trying to add the pad. So you can cut an inch off to add the pad to maintain the right pull or try refinish the end for the metal plate. What I would like in partial trade is a synthetic forend (stock is optional) to fit a 740. I would even consider a solid used wood one rather than using this nice one on an ATV gun.
