The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.DepartmentHandguns › Semi-AutomaticTypePistolActionSingle/DoubleCaliber40 Smith & WessonBarrel Length5.25""Capacity16+1SafetyCrossboltGripsSyntheticSightsFiber Optic front/Adj rearWeight29 oz"

Also, please don't contact me asking for details without at least shooting me an offer of what you have. There's nothing I hate more than when people ask me for a thousand details and then offer a firearm I could not careless about.

Thanks for viewing!"

The revolver looks much better in person that with a camera shot!  It is stainless and never had any marks or rust of any kind.

I've shot about 150 rounds thru it without one hiccup. Very accurate. I'm only selling because I'm going a different direction with my AR build (less tactical, more predator hunter). Sorry I can't sell the complete rifle due to the fact that I built the lower myself out of an 80% lower receiver so I'm stuck with the lower half for life. The Bushnell BTR-1 1-4x24 red dot optic does NOT come with it. I'm not really interested in selling it, but if you buy the upper I'll sell it to you for an additional $150 (costs $224 on Amazon)."

A mechanical recoil reduction system is incorporated in the design, reducing the recoil force felt by the pistol and the firer by some 30 per cent. The frame is made from a polymer plastic material, the slide is a one-piece machined component and the barrel employs the Heckler and Koch polygonal bore. The polymer box magazine has a capacity of 12 0.45 ACP rounds and the ammunition fired may be standard 0.45 ACP or Olin +P 185 grains JHP. The performance specification for this pistol called for service life of 30,000 rounds with minimal parts breakage and a reliability of 6,000 mean rounds between stoppages. Accuracy is required to be an average extreme spread of 365 mm for each five-shot group at 25 meters, with a total of 272 groups fired. The suppressor is required to have a 15,000 round service life with a noise reduction of 24 dB dry and 33 dB wet (5 cc water) using M1911 all ammunition. Flash reduction has to be 75 per cent using M1911 ball ammunition. The point of impact change is less than 51 mm after attaching the suppressor.

-----------------------------

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

I have four rifles that I'm willing to sell or trade (one or a combination of the four) for a Snapper riding mower in good condition.

The first is a 1954 M44 Hungarian Mosin Nagant. I've removed the bayonet bracket the right way and reblued the barrel. I've also stripped and refinished the stock so it looks nice. It has a new sling. It has also been steel bedded. This is a very nice M44. Not one of those jobs....you know what I mean. It has a slightly pitted bore but shoots really well. I'll throw a box of ammo in with it. $300

The second is a Chinese T53 Mosin. It was nasty when I got it. I cleaned it up, threw away the trashed stock and put it in an aftermarket with a sling. It's nothing fancy and the bore is mediocre. I'll throw in a box of ammo with it. $200

Third is a sporterized 98 mauser. This was a German 98 from the WWI era that was resold to Turkey. It's not a crappy Turk. It was a German. The stock was shot when I got it so I built a nice walnut. It has a Timney trigger, professionally bent and polished bolt, new mag spring, new firing pin and spring, leupold rings, sling, shortened barrel and a new blue job. The bore is slightly pitted but it shoots nice. $450

The last is a No1 Mk3 Enfield. The stock was also bad on this one and I replaced it with an aftermarket. It has scope mount and sling. It was shortened and the whole thing was cleaned, beaded and reblued. Bore is a little dark but it shoots well. I haven't shot it for awhile. Scopes are not included. I will throw in a box of ammo with this. $350

I also have two AKC Chihuahua puppies. One male, one female with champion bloodlines. They're listed on NextDayPets for $490 each.

I also have a mess of ammo that I'm going to sell. 7.62x54, 8mm, 303 British and ????

In the picture, the top rifle is the Enfield, the third from the top is the Mauser, the bottom two are the Mosins. Thanks

I will sell any of these or trade one or a combination of the four for a good running Snapper riding mower. I'm not really interested in guns at the moment."

The all-LED M900V gives you the additional ability to choose either brilliant 150-lumen white light or invisible infrared output for use with night vision devices—with no need for IR filters or spare lamps. Simply twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between output modes. In either mode, the M900V's TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for short- to medium-range applications. The high-efficiency LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break. 

Three switches control the primary beam, in either spectrum: two momentary-on grip pressure pads (one on each side for ambidextrous operation), and a constant-on rotary switch. The M900V also features low-output white LED navigation lights that are activated by a momentary-on pressure pad thumb switch. A rotary system-disable switch turns all lights off to prevent accidental activation during covert operations, transport, or storage. 

The M900V clamps solidly to any long gun equipped with a Picatinny rail via its integral M93 Swing-Lever™ rail clamp, which self-adjusts to off-spec rails and features a lever lock to prevent loosening from vibration or recoil. Weatherproof O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out the elements. Made from extremely tough Nitrolon® polymer and CNC-machined aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing

The all-LED M900V gives you the additional ability to choose either brilliant 150-lumen white light or invisible infrared output for use with night vision devices—with no need for IR filters or spare lamps. Simply twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between output modes. In either mode, the M900V's TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for short- to medium-range applications. The high-efficiency LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break. 

Three switches control the primary beam, in either spectrum: two momentary-on grip pressure pads (one on each side for ambidextrous operation), and a constant-on rotary switch. The M900V also features low-output white LED navigation lights that are activated by a momentary-on pressure pad thumb switch. A rotary system-disable switch turns all lights off to prevent accidental activation during covert operations, transport, or storage. 

The M900V clamps solidly to any long gun equipped with a Picatinny rail via its integral M93 Swing-Lever™ rail clamp, which self-adjusts to off-spec rails and features a lever lock to prevent loosening from vibration or recoil. Weatherproof O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out the elements. Made from extremely tough Nitrolon® polymer and CNC-machined aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing

THE ONLY THING KEEPING THIS RIFLE FROM BEING IN PERFECT CONDITION IS SOME VERY SLIGHT RUSTING ON A COUPLE OF THE BOLTS BUT IT IS SLIGHT SURFACE RUST AND CAN BE EASILY CLEANED:)

THE BOLT ACTION MECHANISM WAS RUST FREE AND EASY TO OPEN AND CLOSE.  

BELOW IS SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THIS MODEL OFF OF WIKEPEDIA -

The Model 67 had a 27 in (690 mm) barrel with a simple post front sight and a buckhorn rear sight that was drift-adjustable for windage. 
When it was first introduced, the rifle could chamber .22 Short, .22 Long, or .22 Long Rifle cartridges interchangeably. (THIS APPLIES TO THE RIFLE I'M SELLING)
The rifle featured a stock made of plain uncheckered walnut with a pistol grip and finger grooves, and was a takedown design; the barreled action was easily removed by turning a screw under the stock using a penny. 
A composition buttplate was used.

EVERYTHING IS FULLY-FUNCTIONAL AND READY TO HAVE SOME FUN:)

THE MODEL 67 WAS MANUFACTURED BETWEEN 1934 TO 1963. NONE OF THE GUNS HAD SERIAL NUMBERS BUT I HAVE EDUCATED MYSELF ON DATING THIS WINCHESTER AND THIS IS WHAT I'VE FOUND-

SINCE THE RIFLE I'M SELLING IS MARKED 'MODEL 67-22 SHORT, LONG AND LONG RIFLE MEANS THAT IT WAS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO JANUARY 8TH 1938.

I BELIEVE THE TAKE DOWN SCREW IS FULLY RECESSED INTO THE FORESTOCK WHICH MEANS IT WAS MANUFACTURED IN NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER OF 1937. (LIKE I SAID I'M NO GUN EXPERT BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO JANUARY 8TH 1938:) 

IN SUMMARY FOR A WINCHESTER RIFLE THAT IS BETWEEN 77-80 YEARS OLD, THE BODY AND MOVING PARTS ARE IN REALLY GOOD CONDITION!

THE PRICING I'VE SEEN ON THE INTERNET DEPENDING ON THE YEAR AND CONDITION VARY FROM $100-$700

I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THIS RIFLE BEING AN EARLIER MID 1930'S MODEL AND THE OVERALL CONDITION OF THE GUN THAT $200-$250 WOULD BE A REACHABLE PRICE FOR MY WINCHESTER BUT I'M A REASONABLE MAN AND ASKING $175 OBO:)

NOTE- I ALSO HAVE A 1930'S GERMAN CADET .22 RIFLE FOR SALE.  IT IS A MODEL 1 DEUTSCHK WERKE-WERK ERFURT. (WILLING TO SELL BOTH GUNS FOR $250 AND THE POST FOR THIS GUN IS VIEWABLE ON ARMSLIST AS WELL:)

This model was made completely by Walther, it has all the proof marks from Walther on the frame, slide and barrel, all numbers match. The gun does still have the original night sights that are faint but still visible in the dark. On the inside, bottom of the trigger guard it looks like someone tried to reduce the size of the hump on the guard, it does not effect the way the gun functions, I actually think it feels better without the full hump inside the guard, I'll include a picture of the guard, it's hard to see in a picture.
