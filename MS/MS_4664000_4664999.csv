The 22/45 utilizes Ruger's proven internal cylindrical bolt and fixed barrel design, that provides a higher accuracy potential over designs with a moving slide by ensuring the pistol's sights stay in permanent alignment. The 22/45 Target semi-automatic pistol comes with a precision rear target sight that's fully adjustable for windage and elevation, and a vertical post, modified Patridge-style front sight; the sights are easy to see and allow for precise shooting at small targets. The top of the receiver is drilled and tapped for easy installation of the included Weaver®-style scope base if the shooter desires to use optical sights. The weight of the bull barrel aids to hold the pistol steady; though, with a lightweight Zytel® polymer grip frame, the 22/45 carries comfortably in a field holster. The grip frame features a serrated front strap and backstrap, and integral checkered panels that provide a sure hold in any type of environment. The 22/45 has several safety features, making it one of the safest handguns on the market. A loaded chamber indicator on the side of the receiver indicates when the chamber is loaded by sight or touch. A manual thumb safety locks the sear, while allowing the pistol to be loaded and unloaded when engaged. A magazine disconnect prevents the pistol from firing once the magazine is removed. And, an internal key lock renders the pistol totally inoperable. The Ruger 22/45 Target is a great Semi-Auto Rimfire Pistol for teaching shooters how to handle a handgun safely, small game hunting, and of course target shooting. Comes with two 10-round magazines. Made in USA."

Although designed from scratch by Polish engineers, the P-64 is very similar to German Walther PPK and is sometimes described erroneous in western literature as it's clone. Frame and slide are made of steel and the finish is blue. The barrel is fixed to the frame with the recoil spring wound around it. The controls consist of a slide mounted safety lever and a magazine catch. The safety lever has two positions: up for ""fire"" and down for ""safe"" and decocks the hammer (if cocked) when put on safe. The safety mechanism allows the slide to be operated with safety on. Unlike the Walther, the P-64's magazine release is located at the bottom of the frame, slowing down the reloading process. The single-column magazines hold 6 rounds. The slides locks back when the last round from the magazine is fired but there is no external slide release. Double-action trigger pull is heavy: 110-120 N (25-27 lb). The sights are fixed and set at a rather exaggerated distance of 50 meters. A loaded-chamber indicator is located in the rear part of the slide, just above the hammer. Grips are checkered black plastic."

They are easy to spot with the bulged front trunion for added strength. Brand new USA made receiver and barrel with a beautifully hard finish, not the normal crappy bluing.

This AK-47 M70B1 PAP 7.62x39mm rifle features a 16"" barrel, black poly stock set with black synthetic pistol grip, Yugo pattern RPK heavy duty receiver, combination grenade launching sights/gas cut-off valve, a slant cut muzzle brake, and bayonet lug.  Also includes the original (rare!) grenade launching muzzle attachment with the repro rifle grenade, the cleaning kit, and a tactical soft case.  Comes with 2 30-round hi capacity magazines.  The kits were manufactured in Serbia in the famous Zastava Military Arms factory and sent to the US for builds into complete 922R legal rifles. Accepts all standard in spec AK magazines for 7.62x39 caliber. 

I fired one magazine through this, although you'd never know it because it looks better than most new AK's on the store shelves - the safety/selector lever has barely started to wear the arc into the finish.  I've never used the grenade launcher muzzle attachment or the grenade.  The trigger and action are awesome, easily the slickest and best I've ever felt on a stock AK.  This very rare package can be yours for less than most people are asking for their used WASR's on Armslist.  Impress your friends and scare the he** out of your neighbors at the same time!  I'm not going to be sad if this doesn't sell (at least I can tell my wife ""I tried"") so no trades or lower cash offers at this time.

I can add ammo for extra cash, but it don't have any blanks to launch the grenade.  I can also add a brand new 75-round drum or 40-round mag for extra ($75 and $20 respectively)."

 Price for both can't be beat, not on E-bay or other web sites. Price is fair and firm, if you want to post you can get it cheaper somewhere else, then get it. This was purchased and put in safe for use with a rifle that I do not have anymore. Price for scope alone is above asking price for both Scope and mount. Mount is between 90 and 140 depending on where you get it and the Optic is between 599.00 (ebay) and list price of 1149.00 (MFG suggested) LOL, 749.00 (optics planet)."

The walnut stock and handguard are in very good condition and have small handling marks and minor blemishes in the original oil finish, as well as a crisp cartouche on the left side of the wrist. The top of the receiver is clearly marked MODEL 1895 SPRINGFIELD ARMORY. It has a 30"" barrel, a side loading 5 round box magazine, a long range folding ladder rear sight. According to the serial number this is the lot right before the rifles were given to Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Spanish American War. The Springfield Model 1892-99 Krag-Jorgensen rifle is a Norwegian-design bolt action rifle that was adopted in 1892 as the standard United States Army military longarm, chambered in U.S. caliber .30-40 Krag. All versions and variants were manufactured under license by the Springfield Armory between 1892 and 1903. The U.S. Krag was replaced beginning in 1903 with the introduction of the M1903 Springfield rifle. A piece of history for the Military Collector. Shoots well. Time for me to pass it on."

I ordered a Lone Wolf 460 Rowland conversion barrel kit and compensator. I have the original barrel, recoil assembly and striker spring. I added Ameriglo Pro I-dot sights for excellent daylight as well as night shooting. 

I have 20 rounds of 230gr Underwood ammo advertised at 1400fps and 1001 ft/lbs energy. 
I also have 11 rounds of Johnny's Personal Carry from 460 Rowland.com advertised at 1560 fps. (no energy figures from their site.)
This Glock now runs 45ACP, 45 Super and the ultimate-460 Rowland cartridge.
It shoots a ragged hole at 10 yards and with the compensator, you can unload 45ACP with the pistol barely moving off target between shots.
I have run 50 rounds of the 460 and about 100 of 45ACP through it.
I am only selling because the grip is just too wide for me. I carried a Glock 17 for a decade and I guess I am just too used to that grip size. I hoped the SF version would be small enough, but I feel I am fighting the gun when I shoot it instead of just naturally holding it.
I have almost $1000 into this set up and it is tuned perfectly for a carry gun."

This rifle was manufactured in 1921 and is the precursor to the popular K31 rifle. For a rifle that is 94 years old this is in EXCELLENT shape. The bore is mint and the action is buttery smooth. It is also matching numbers and includes the very rare original leather sling. It retains 95% bluing and I'd rate the stock overall as 90%. This is NOT a CAI import and does not have the huge ugly roll mark on the side of the receiver. This is a true collector rifle that even includes the matching magazine!"

Original factory box and docs with it. The rifle has less than 200 rounds through it. The charging handle has been replaced with an upgraded all aluminum handle so no polymer to break here. The muzzle brake has also been replaced with a PWS FSC556 which is the exact same brake as used on the SCAR so the gun practically doesn't move when shooting. There have been some rail covers and a red dot added which I'll throw in for free. Comes with 1 30 round PMag, but if you want more or some ammo we can always talk about adding things. For those that don't know much about this rifle you can break it down, even removing the barrel, in less than 1 minute. It is the easiest to clean rifle I've ever owned, and it is NOT ammo picky at all. Using a piston means that it will stay clean and cool near the bolt, and hell with it I'll toss in the Magpul VFG that is on it for free as well. The folding stock is very robust, much more so than the SCAR stock, and it has multiple sling attachment points including quick detach mounts.

The SR-556® and SR-762™ offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles. Features:The takedown barrel is removed from the upper receiver by simply moving the slider bar towards the breech, rotating the barrel and pulling it free - no tools required. Installation is simpler yet - just slide the barrel into the upper and twist until it locks. The takedown mechanism provides a repeatable point of impact.MSR shooters that desire a larger cartridge will be excited to find that a replaceable barrel kit chambered in 300 AAC Blackout is available on ShopRuger.com. This range-ready barrel's headspace is set at the factory and comes complete with a metal flip-up elevation & windage adjustable front sight and two, 30-round metal magazines marked with ""300 AAC BLACKOUT"" to ensure easy differentiation.Ruger® patented chrome-plated, two-stage piston with multi-stage regulator provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. The two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier.The Ruger® Elite 452™ AR trigger is a two-stage trigger that offers a smooth, crisp, 4.5 lb. trigger pull. The Ruger Elite 452™ features a full-strength hammer spring for consistent primer ignition and a lightweight hammer that enables a 30% faster lock time over standard MSR triggers.With front and rear folding iron sights, the SR-556® Takedown is ready to go to the range right out the box. The front sight is both elevation & windage adjustable, meaning that when you swap barrels, the zero stays with the barrel.The lower receiver is fitted with the Magpul® MOE grip and MOE SL collapsible buttstock on the mil-spec buffer tube. With a length of pull ranging between 11.1""-14.4"" the fit can be perfect for most any shooter.Precision-rifled, chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel ensures accuracy and longevity. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided and the ½""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.Supplied with three Magpul PMAG® 30-round magazines (a lightweight 556 NATO magazine).Also includes a rugged, ballistic nylon case; three rail covers and lock."

These make for great base guns due to the steel used to forge the frame and slide. More specifically, they use railroad steel, which is extremely hard and durable, so much so that gunsmiths abhor it because it ruins their tool sets. However, the benefits of it for a firearm are obvious. Gun was customized by a certified gunsmith. It started out as a basic GI configured gun, and was customized as seen here. I picked up years ago, and after using it in a few competition matches, stuck it in the safe where it has sat. I got in a trade, already used. I will not lie, the gun is used, and it reflects use, which is why I am asking for a fairly low price. However, please not that it was not abused, just used. The previous owner allowed a patina to take hold of the slide, and its one hell of a patina. If you don't like it, you can get it refinished. I do not know the parts list, but in addition to obvious after market parts, the gun has been very finely polished on the inside. It is very smooth, and the trigger has been so fine tuned that it is one of the best I've come across. Gun is very reliable and durable. It'll outlast you and run all day long. It just isn't pretty anymore. If you're looking for an old 1911 to make a project out of, or want a beater that'll run, here you go. If a project is your fancy, I'd suggest you don't screw with the action and trigger, but it's up to you. Comes with one old Ed Brown 8 round magazine and zippered soft case.
Trade or sell for $450 OBO. Gun was easily worth 8+ after custom work was done to it.

Please google if you dont know where that is. Occasionally I get out to Orlando or Apopka too or Haines City, just north of Lakeland. 

FS/T Aimpoint Micro T-1 2 moa with LRP riser quick release mount new in box with papers, new battery and tool. Never mounted! Only put battery in today to make sure it worked. I had to wait to get this one from Aimpoint directly from promo so I got a different optic sooner and don't need this one.  

The Best price I could find on Amazon and other sites that compare prices on all the gun sights was between $700 and $800 for the set up.  This is the baddest micro red dot out there.  Crazy long battery life and nearly indestructible.  Look it up before you make me an offer.   I don't need to sell it. It's just an extra for me so please no low ball offers.  

 Prices and trades listed below.  If trade. Tell me what you have, the extras and your best offer please to save us time. I'll just say yes or no. Thank you.  

Asking $625 obro.... cash gets best deal or trade toward one or more of guns below.   

 If you can get it cheaper, I understand there's occasionally deals that pop up but I don't need to know about them or your opinions. If you aren't interested then please move on. I'm open to cash or gun offers that are reasonable. 

All trades must be new or like new fully functional perfect working order 

Right now my main interests are a Glock 17 or 19 Vickers or Gen 4 plus cash .....Prefer gen 4 but open to RTF models in 9mm  Other Glocks would really have to be a deal for me to consider but only 9mm, 45 acp or maybe .40 and again prefer Gen 4.  No stippling or frame modification please.  This could be great opportunity for someone with a lightly used blue label. 

Also would consider a 2014 or 2015 Ruger Lcp $250-300 range with multiple mags unless modded plus cash.  

Ruger 22/45 lite pistol 22lr Mark 2 (ii) or Mark 3 (iii) or maybe a similar 22 semi auto target pistol plus cash. Nothing over $450 

Or an LCR 357 or 38 ($350-400 range) plus cash 

Last might consider a full factory Spikes 5.56 Ar pistol or rifle if cool looking and even trade.  

That's really all I'm interested in but if it's a higher quality gun that's a great deal for me. I might consider.  

I can add a little cash or ammo if necessary in multi gun trade As long as one gun is listed here and other is quality.  

No keltec, high point or similar or hunting, bolt action, military surplus, cowboy or junk.

This is a pre-lawsuit GSG-5. It's the original model 5 (not the 522) which GSG stopped making because of patent infringement of the similar H&K model. It's the rare titanium finish 1st anniversary edition. The receiver is engraved with this designation. This was made for a very brief period of time in 2009 for the 1st anniversary of the introduction.

Very good condition and comes with (4) 22 round mags, and scope rail. Has ambidexterous safety. Runs perfectly. Barrel shroud is removable but not the type that the ATF ruled as a suppressor."
