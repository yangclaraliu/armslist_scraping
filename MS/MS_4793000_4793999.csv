I will also throw in a box of ammo.  This is stock, with no modifications. Face to face sale, no shipping.
I purchased this new in January 2014. Included is everything in the pictures. It is in excellent condition. It has been cleaned and lubricated after each visit to the range. My best estimate is 200 -300 rounds have been fired through it. Not a single misfire or jam. If you want more pictures, please ask. Emails answered usually within a day. Please include your number. I will be calling you back from an 847 number.
Must have FOID. All laws followed. Cops, you know the rules, please don’t BS me. Yes, it’s been attempted before.  The 3 days start when we come to terms, and you send me a pic of your FOID.
We can meet at a mutually agreed location, relatively close to Palatine. My home is fine. I will send you a pic of my FOID prior to meeting.
The 5 inch 1911 is this most accurate handgun I’ve ever fired. There are many reasons this model  is still popular after more than 100 years.
I’m open to trades, but would prefer cash. I would consider brand name ammo, .380, 9mm, .45, & .223. No steel, aluminum, or reloads. I’m not really looking for any additional firearms at this time. I will consider offers, but semi autos only, no revolvers.
If you are not familiar with the inner workings of a 1911, I will be happy to show you how to field strip & reassemble, at my home or at the range only. We must not frighten the villagers in public.
I am not a motivated seller.  I purchased this for nostalgic reasons. I carried a 1911 in the Army as an MP. I am the original owner.  I am not a collector, but this one basically sits in my safe. I just don’t fire it often, and it’s being ignored.
A few other gun buying tips in general for the newbies.
Calling something rare does not mean it has value. Discontinued models were discontinued for a reason. Usually nothing that would work in the seller’s favor. Do your research. 
So many here seem to have “never fired” guns for sale. Really? Or the “it didn’t fit in my or my wife’s hand well after firing only 3 shots”. Again, beware, use common sense.
Know the weapon before you purchase it. YouTube is a great resource. Don’t be afraid to disassemble it & inspect the inner workings to look for rust & excessive wear."

It shoots 7.65 mm, which is 32 auto. All serial numbers match and the gun is in great condition, especially for its age. Gun still functions flawlessly, if it wasn't a collectors piece, it could even make a great ccw! I have fired about 50 flawless rounds through the pistol without a hiccup. There is great history behind the pistol; it most likely started its life at the end of WW1, its serial number denotes that it was more than likely carried by an Italian officer. These pistols were reliable and saw action into the Second World War. Everything is original on this firearm down to the magazine and wood grips. Someone who is more into history then me could probably tell a lot more by the markings and serial numbers. I do not want to sell the gun, but bills need paid. I hope to get $600, but will entertain all offers and take the best one. You can reach me anytime of the day through texting or calling 513-545-1487. I can answer any questions you may have regarding the pistol."

I had this rifle built to shoot my .308 suppressor for Hog Hunting ,ect. It has a 16.1"" barrel, AAC 51T Breakout brake/flash hider. It accepts AR Mags. It comes with 1 factory 10rd mag, 2 10rd Pmags, and 1 20rd Pmag. It also has Nikon Prostaff 3X9X40 scope with anti reflection device and flip up lense cover, Caldwell bipod, 5.11 VTac sling and padded double rifle heavy duty sniper drag bag case. 
Finally the rifle sports a custom Camo paint job. Everything was purchased new and professionally installed. For what it's designed for, there is nothing this set up is missing. 
The only reason I am considering selling this rifle is to purchase a Sig M400 AR (witch is the only trade considered) for future work and I don't have the funds to buy one. There is a sale on one now with one left so I want to grab it. If it sells before I sell this it goes back in the safe. I was never planing on parting with this rifle. It is immaculate and only has 35 rds thru it. I am willing to lose some money on this build for a quick sale to purchase the AR. 
Asking $975 OBO cash. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED!!! 
Thanks

One of the earlier conversions stamped 1915 in fair /good condition. Like many of these rifles the stock was sporterized but they stoped there and didn't touch any of the metal. The receiver and all metal parts are in original condition as most of these I see have had the stripper clip guide or whatever it's called has been cut off when sporterized so if a new stock is installed it will be in original condition. These firearms have so many stampings on them it looks like a story was engraved on them and I have taken pictures of them all but I can only download a couple for the ad. Some tiny pitting one the rifle that would be underneath the stock and typical of these guns. Its in good condition overall.  Missing the box magazine but all they had were a gutted 303 magazine.

Great shooting gun. It has had a few alterations; its previous owner was into quick draw competitions and had the trigger ring filed down a bit and the top where the rear sight is has also been filed down as he didn't use the rear sights. The grip is a homemade job but a new grip can be purchased for $15-45. I have replaced the rear sights with the Ruger original adjustable sights.
 It also has some cylinder wear from regular use (turn ring). otherwise it's in great shape and shoots and functions exactly how it should. Contact me here and we'll exchange numbers when I know you're serious. I am open to REASONABLE offers. Thanks."

The main reason for this folly is the false notion that the Type 53 is of inferior quality when compared to its counterparts. Nothing could be further from the truth, but this very common opinion still seems to dominate collectors circles. The quality in manufacture of the Type 53 is quite high and the Type 53's place in history rivals any of the Model 1944's. In fact the combat use of the Type 53 may well be greater than any of the M44's."

All AK's are not created equally. The fit and finish on this rifle are top notch. You can really feel the quality in this rifle when you hold it. The rivets look amazing, the stock, when locked in either position, is solid with very minimal wobble. The sights have no cant that I can see. The finish was professionally distressed by FA guns in AZ. This distress job is SOLID! Definitely not done by a rookie.

It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.Calibers: 9mm LugerWeight unloaded: 12.7 oz. Loaded magazine: 2.8 oz.Length: 5.85"" Height: 4.3"" Width: 0.88"" Barrel Length: 3.1"" Capacity: 7 + 1Trigger Pull: 5 lbs"

The upper portion of the end mill, the collet area of the shank, is reduced to 1/4"" diameter to allow for use with compact routers which are commonly equipped with a 1/4"" collet size. The remaining length of the end mill, including the cutting surface, is 5/16"". 5D Tactical is the only jig manufacturer to offer a custom designed, oversized end mill for this purpose. Through our extensive testing, we determined that the 1/4"" diameter end mills offered by other jig manufactures are not optimized for their intended use, leading to slower milling, constant chattering, inconsistent finish quality, and frequent tool breakage. For more in-depth information, please read our 5/16"" Hybrid End Mill Analysis which outlines in great detail the performance benefits of our end mill design.Every facet of our end mill design was considered and refined during an extensive prototyping and testing phase. From the proprietary material makeup, to the design of the cutting surface and flutes, we achieved optimal performance and maximum tool durability. In conjunction with our Universal Router Adapter, the end mill remains supported by a bearing in all directions at all times, further reducing end mill flex and the opportunity for premature tool breakage.Please Note: 5D Tactical AR-15 and AR-308 Router Jigs require the use of our custom end mill. This end mill is custom designed and manufactured for 5D Tactical, and is not available for sale elsewhere by any tooling supplier or manufacturer."

Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle.
