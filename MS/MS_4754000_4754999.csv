In times of scarcity, the Blackhawk Convertible will function with 3 types of common handgun ammunition: 357 Magnum, 38 Special, and 9mm Luger. This is not only a great handgun for big game hunting, self-defense, and rugged outdoor adventures, but it also makes the perfect sidearm for anyone who takes being prepared for emergencies seriously. The 357/38 cylinder can be replaced by the 9mm cylinder by simply opening the loading gate, pushing on the base pin release button, and sliding the base pin forward. No tools are needed and there are no small parts to loose. 

For the Blackhawk Single-Action Revolver, Ruger incorporated the classic lines and inherent strengths of the US military service revolver used in the late 1800s with modern steel and manufacturing techniques to make the safest and most rugged sidearms made. The Blackhawk is built on a robust, all-steel frame made to withstand modern magnum cartridges, and uses all coil springs in the mechanism that retain their power for ultra-durability (instead of leaf-springs). Ruger's transfer bar ignition system provides an unparalleled measure of security against accidental discharge, allowing the shooter to carry the revolver safely with all 6 chambers loaded. The Blackhawk's traditional western-style grip is renown for being one of the most natural pointing grips ever designed, enabling shooters to instinctively draw and shoot, as well as stand and take aim. The rear sight is protected by integral frame topstrap ribs, and is click adjustable for both windage and elevation, allowing user to make precision adjustments when changing types of ammunition. The front sight is an improved Partridge type that provides a good sight picture, and allows for snag-free withdrawal from holsters. The Ruger Blackhawk Single-Action Revolver Convertible is a well-designed, reliable firearm that utilizes the widest range of ammunition of any single handgun available. Made in USA."

(the owner's manual incorrectly states a weight of 1.10 lbs.) • 5.50"" barrel length (the owner's manual incorrectly states a 6.87"" barrel length) • 11"" overall length (the owner's manual incorrectly states an overall length of 11.50"") • Includes 6 shells (each shell is loaded with one steel BB). • There's an error in the owner's manual. It says you must first put the gun on safe and then pull the hammer to half-cock to load the gun. That is incorrect. Once the safety is applied, the hammer does not move. So, don't put the safety on to load the gun. It must be on fire. The highly revered Colt Peacemaker Single Action Army .45 revolver looks, feels and handles like the famous firearm it copies. Like the famous revolver that changed the West, the cylinder does not swing out. Each shell is inserted singly thru the loading gate on the right side of the cylinder. Pull back the hammer to the half-cocked position. Then, rotate the cylinder and insert a loaded shell. To remove an empty shell, open the loading gate, pull back the hammer to half-cocked and push on the ejector rod. Speed loaders don't work on this gun because the shells are inserted by hand one at a time. To load BBs in the shells, insert one steel BB in the TOP of each. The safety, CO2 cylinder screw are cleverly hidden from view. This is the best finished, most authentic and nicest air gun I have ever seen. It is “out of stock” all over the internet..The demand for it will just get greater and greater. BUYER PAYS $11.50 USPS PRIORITY SHIPPING. YOU MUST BE 18 TO BID ON THIS ITEM.

(the owner's manual incorrectly states a weight of 1.10 lbs.) • 5.50"" barrel length (the owner's manual incorrectly states a 6.87"" barrel length) • 11"" overall length (the owner's manual incorrectly states an overall length of 11.50"") • Includes 6 shells (each shell is loaded with one steel BB). • There's an error in the owner's manual. It says you must first put the gun on safe and then pull the hammer to half-cock to load the gun. That is incorrect. Once the safety is applied, the hammer does not move. So, don't put the safety on to load the gun. It must be on fire. The highly revered Colt Peacemaker Single Action Army .45 revolver looks, feels and handles like the famous firearm it copies. Like the famous revolver that changed the West, the cylinder does not swing out. Each shell is inserted singly thru the loading gate on the right side of the cylinder. Pull back the hammer to the half-cocked position. Then, rotate the cylinder and insert a loaded shell. To remove an empty shell, open the loading gate, pull back the hammer to half-cocked and push on the ejector rod. Speed loaders don't work on this gun because the shells are inserted by hand one at a time. To load BBs in the shells, insert one steel BB in the TOP of each. The safety, CO2 cylinder screw are cleverly hidden from view. This is the best finished, most authentic and nicest air gun I have ever seen.

Gen 3 Glock 19 with Trijicon nights sights. Two factory magazines, case and kydex holster. There is some holster wear on the slide, but it's not bad. Also, Glock's tennifer finish penetrates into the metal, so there won't be any issues just because a little black coloring has worn off. I did go test fire it to make sure everything is running smoothly.

For Sale: the very best German Zeiss military binoculars, built for the outdoors, crystal clear optics. If you want top quality mil-spec optics and are willing to pay the price, these are for you. Many cheap binoculars have olive drab rubber armor, but one glimpse through the lenses will convince you that these are worth the price. Only the best lenses will let you see bullet holes or read license plates at distance. All have artillery scales on the lenses to help judge distances or determine position. I have one pair each of:

10x50 General Officers Binoculars, excellent condition, a few tiny specks that do not disturb vision in the least. $500 or trade for firearms

Infrared Night Vision Binoculars, good condition, with Infrared Lens included to fit your spotlight, but any infrared light source will do, more or less visible depending on your needs. Examine at night if you want to see how they work, as daytime use will destroy them. Original price to the German Government was $9000. $600 or trade for firearms

8x30 Binoculars, excellent condition, $350 or trade for firearms

Sales are final, no refunds, as I have no control over what you do to them after you buy them. You may inspect them thoroughly before purchase. They are made to take punishment, but any fine optics can be broken or misused.

It features a polygonal bore profile for increased velocity and easier cleaning. The cold hammered barrel ensures long service life and outstanding shooting accuracy.

I also have a 45 colt I'll sell for 600.00.  (details in other listing).  They don't have a selection for 41 magnum so I put it in the category of 44 magnum.  But this is a 41 !!  rare for gun collectors !!

This is a very gently used CZ-75 compact pistol that I intended to use as a carry gun, but never got around to it.  The gun is a full steel construction, and makes for very enjoyable, and accurate use at the range.  Size-wize the gun is a little bit smaller than a Glock 19 (but obviously much heavier)  I've been told that this can be a proper carry gun, but requires a good belt, and the right holster.  I have fired roughly 500 rounds through this gun, all brass cased ammunition, with no failures.  I have also installed the lighter, Cajun Gun works piano wire US made trigger spring, giving it a lighter, better single action. 

This gun includes its original box, manuals and warranty information, as well as two all steel, 14-round magazines.  The pistol itself shows no signs of use, it looks basically brand new, as it has never been in a holster.  The magazines show minor scratches where they have been used, but are not dented or dinged anywhere.  

Truth be told I don't entirely want to part with this gun, as it is a very solid, well constructed firearm, however as I have only ever used it at the range, it has become nothing more than a range toy to me.  However, I would have trusted this gun with my life, and I believe it will serve it's next owner just as well!

The mako foregrip are the most widely available foregrips for the VZ platform and sell for over 80 bucks. They were only lightly used and only installed once when I purchased them and were then removed. The rails points on the upper guard are removable with a simple hex key. The only portion of the grip to be use was the lower rail in conjunction with the T-Pod below. 

The fab defense T-Pod is a real one from israel and not a cheap knock off from ebay. The grip is a great combo of foregrip and bipod. Pressing the two buttons together extend out the legs and the legs are independently adjustable for length. The whole rig is very sturdy and it all worked great on my own VZ 58 while plinking out at Fort Dix.

Only reason I'm selling is because my buddy offered me a good deal on a Kimber Mountain Ascent and that one is even lighter. I like light rifles as I do a lot of back country hunting. Anyways, this is a Cabelas exclusive right that has an upgraded, lighter weight stock than the standard T3 light. I also added a $150 muzzle break that makes the groups even tighter and reduced to recoil to nearly nothing. Kicks less than my 25.06 now. Also, the aftermarket, machined to fit, kick ez recoil pad helps a lot with that also. The Vortex Viper scope seen in the picture is no longer on the gun and is NOT included. I have a Nikon 4-12X40 on it right now and that is included in the price. I will take $100 off the price if you don't want the scope. The rifle probably has ~200 rounds through it."

Designed to fit any Mil-Std 1913 rail, this product can withstand punishing abuse mounted on weapon systems from the M4 Carbine to the Mk. 48 SAW.
Vertical fore grips are often called upon to mount pressure switches for lasers and tactical lights. In the past, Velcro or adhesive tape were less- than satisfactory methods of securing the pressure switch to the grip. Heat, rapid movement and heavy gloves often rip the switch loose with obvious consequences. The Tango grip features a novel pocket that appears when needed, to positively mount pressure switches without movement or damage. Just remove the threaded end cap, slide out the filler panel and place inside the grip for storage. Just replace the panel with your pressure switch and replace the end cap to lock the switch in place. Quick and easy, allowing fast mount and dismount of lights and lasers.

The Tango grip has internal storage to spare, for spare weapon bolt assemblies, extra batteries, medical supplies or any other mission specific items. The threaded end cap has a large diameter O-ring to protect its contents to 66 feet. 

Please note: TangoDown vertical grips may be very tight on YHM or MI rails and may have to be fitted for installation.

I believe Marlin no longer makes these amazingly accurate guns. Price is $1200 obo. The second rifle for sale is a very nice Italian Armi Jager (Remington Zouave Copy) 58 Cal. This gun is an excellent reproduction of the Remington and in near mint condition. It also only weighs in at 9lbs which is fairly light for a 58 cal.

(1) Winchester Model 12 pre-war (1941) 16ga pump action shot gun,
Popularly-named the Perfect Repeater, With forged and machined steel parts, the ultimate reason for discontinuation in 1964 was that it was too expensive to produce.
This gun is in really good shape, especially for being 75 years old, retaining 90%
of its original finish on both wood & blued finish, I recently had it appraised at H&H and was told that it should go for between $700 to 1200, and in its current condition should go on the upper end of that (surprised me) but I am going to ask $700.00 obo for mine and see what happens, as I just don't use it, and likely won't.
If you like the model 12's you may never find another one in this condition.

(2) New Old Stock (box says 2006) I have two Winchester Model 9422 Tribute Legacys one in the .22 LR and the other in the .22 magnum, the guns are in brand new unfired condition, comes with the original manufacture box and box sleeve as well as owners manual paperwork and extras. both have beautiful dark wood finish,with the Pistol Grip stock and were the last of the true Winchesters made in New Haven CT. and the Final Tribute to the 9422's. The Barrels are engraved 1 of 9422 and has the horse and rider engraved on one side of the receiver and  model 9422 Tribute on the other side. I am asking $1200.00 for the .22 LR and $1500.00 for the .22 magnum, but will consider reasonable offers.
(I didn't have any pics of them so the one shown I found on the Internet, but just like
that one, mine is new in the box)"

Gary has been hand-forging knives since the 1980's - not made from mass-produced blanks, each knife is truly one-of-a-kind.  Exceptional craftsmanship by a local master!

I purchased this knife from its original owner, and I have never cut a single thing with it.  It's in as-new condition, as the original owner wore it on his belt for over twenty years but never abused it.  It would be hard to find a knife of this quality for under $300.

This sharpened portion of the (hollow-ground) blade measures 3.75"" in length, with an overall knife length of 8.75"".  ...blade is 3/16"" wide at the backbone, which runs full-length and a full 3/16"" width all the way to the pommel, which has a brass insert for a lanyard.  I can't positively ID the wood species, but I do know that it is a laminate formed under pressure.  

The blade is zonally-hardened, with the business edge somewhat softer & more ductile than the backbone, for a super-keen edge.  The backbone is tempered for higher stiffness - somewhat like the famed Nihonto a.k.a. Samurai swords, for the best balance of edge retention and superior overall durability.

The scabbard is hand-made to fit by Gary's wife, out of 1/8"" thick saddle leather, and shows some nicks and scrapes from being carried/worn for so long. All stitching is intact, and the retention is perfect - it will not drop the knife when shaken upside-down, but the knife is drawn easily when needed.  

I hate to part with this piece - but bills and other interests force me to give up my little treasure.  I'm sure the lucky buyer will appreciate its beauty and workmanship, and maybe pass it on to a child or grandchild.  As Gary may not be in the hand-forged knife business for too many more years, due to age, this knife can only appreciate in value and desirability.
