You can send offers but idiots will be ignored. We all know what this means.

I am looking for cash but would also trade if it interests me at this time. A couple things that come to mind would be an M1A or a garand, possibly a H & K VP9. You can send me offers and the worse that can happen is I say no.

I decided not to put pics up here. The serial numbers are listed and all my conditions are very accurate. If you are seriously interested send me your cell and I will text you pics. Please only serious buyers though

Thanks for reading,

With ambidextrous controls, easily-replaceable barrel and virtually endless possibilities for customization and accessorization, the ARX100 is adaptable to any firing scenario and is perfect for today’s most demanding tactical shooter.Ultimate Reliability and Ease of MaintenanceThe ARX100 features a constant contact/short-stroke gas piston system that makes it feed and fire under the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight technopolymer receiver allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricants. To make maintenance easy and trouble-free, this rifle has no pins and can be completely disassembled in a matter of seconds with no tools at all.Ultimate VersatilityThis rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction.Ultimate AccessorizationThe possibilities for accessorization on the ARX100 are limited only by the user’s imagination. It comes out of the box with a full-length Picatinny rail on top, which is perfect for attaching a variety of optics and other sighting systems.

This is among the most desirable of the 686s: it has solid machined trigger and hammer, firing pin is on the hammer, beautiful finish on all parts, super smooth trigger action, the classic locking system. The only thing it doesn't have is a recessed cylinder--which they only made on a few 686s. In other words, this is a better firearm than a brand new S&W 686.  Operating in single action, you only have to think about squeezing the trigger and the gun goes off. And that is without any custom work (which can easily be done on this revolver; more recent 686s do not have the quality of triggers and cannot be customized as well). It shoots straight, of course. I'm not a great shot and I regularly put 6 shot groups within a 50 cent piece at 25 feet with this gun.  It comes with classic S&W wood grips. Two leather holsters are included. 

Here's the story behind this 686:

This gun was given to me 7 months ago by my father in law. He acquired it in the early 80s right as he quit hunting. So it served as a home defense weapon--and just sat there for 30+ years.  I doubt he put a hundred rounds through it (partly because I've known him since the late 80s and I've only seen him fire the gun twice--with me, at my urging, and partly because he gave me two half full ancient ammo boxes along with the gun).  Since I acquired it I've shot almost 500 rounds (85% of which were .38s). 

It's a lovely gun. I just don't really like the ergonomics of the S&W as much as I do other pistols.

Trying to finish my AR build and I realized I don't need 2 AKs.  Someone else should give my Saiga the love and attention that it deserves.  It has the bullet guide modification done to it already so it takes regular ol' AK mags wonderfully. She just requires the trigger mod (unless you like the original sporter configuration) It comes with 3 mags and the non convert-pistol grip/collapsable stock on it.  She shoots pretty well...it's an AK they shoot!  I've put about 2-300 rounds through it without any problems.  I do like the old gal but I don't have the time or patience for multiple projects.  I tend to do that quite often and now I'm just attempting to rid myself of one.
Just for your fyi, I do not ship, nor do I take monthly payments and don't low ball me with a 300 dollar offer, I'll just fart in the phone and hang up! I'm not dumb or in a need to sell.  I could always finish the project, be happy with it and just keep it all for me!  
email me with your celly phone number, I'll be more than happy to send pictures!  I'm just too damn lazy to put them up right now
Thanks for looking folks and have a super duper day!

241,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4577241,For Sale:  1945 Winchester M1 Carbine,"Spring Lake, Fayetteville, North Carolina","$ 1,500","Listed On: Tuesday, August 4, 2015",Rifles,Winchester                                                                                ,30 Carbine                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I never shoot it, I feel bad that she just sits in the safe, so here she is. This is my 1945 Winchester M1 Carbine. Everything on the rifle is correct for a Winchester, has the Winchester markings such as the ""W"" in all of the right places. 

On the stock, the correct cartouches are present, the stock is the right ""type IV"" stock. In the pictures, you should be able to see the cartouches pretty clearly on the handguard and the stock itself inside the sling well. 

All of the metals are Winchester and proofed as such. The only discrepancy on this entire rifle is the bolt. Some people say it should have a round blued bolt, some say a round parkerized, some say a flat bolt. So, since I can't find anywhere that is 100% on the issue, I consider it correct because the patina on the bolt I have matches the receiver 100%. I'm in the military and can clearly tell you through observation that we almost never match things up identically and constantly mix things up and just ""roll"" with it. Besides, no one here (or so I assume) was with the rifle when it was built so no one knows for sure. The oiler bottle has the correct markings for a Winchester WWII circa and is original, not reproduction. 

The rifle comes with all magazines pictured. Some have markings, some don't. Some are USGI, and some I couldn't tell you for sure. There are 9x 15-rounders and 2x 30-rounders. If I come across more they will be tossed in. The sling is about all that isn't ""correct"" as it is a Korean marked sling, again, this rifle could have been used during the Korean War for all I know. 

Anyways, I have quite a bit consumed into this Carbine, I've had to acquire a few parts to ""correct it"" to where it is. If you want a beautiful carbine that has a beautiful stock, here's your chance. I'm a fan of originals so I had to have a Winchester since they did produce the first carbines. I'm asking $1500 for the Winchester with everything pictured. I feel that's reasonable. If not, I'm not in a hurry to sell and keeping this wouldn't be an issue. I appreciate everyone's time in reading this!"

505,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4577505,For Sale:   Lifted 1998 Jeep XJ 4x4,"Champaign, Champaign / Urbana, Illinois","$ 3,500","Listed On: Tuesday, August 11, 2015",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"1998 Jeep Cherokee Classic XJ in very good condition with about 150k miles. Almost no rust, underbody and enginebay are extremely clean. What rust it did have has been treated and filled. The bottom half of it has been coated in bedliner to protect it from the salts in the winter. It has power leather front seats, power windows/locks, keyless remotes, etc. Interior is kept very clean with no weird smells or anything. I shampoo every new car I get, and am meticulous about keeping them clean. Everything works. It shifts into 4wd very smoothly, and will get you out of almost anything. Last winter during the major snow storms, it was the only vehicle in the neighborhood that could get it self out of the snow and down the road before the plows could get the couple feet of snow cleared. I've never been able to get it stuck, but the winch is there if it ever does.

It has the following aftermarket/custom/replaced parts:

- 4.5 inch rough country suspension lift
- 30'' tires on stock wheels, as well as a second set of black steel offroad wheels
- Warn front bumper (900 new)
- Warn driving lights(1200-1400 new)
- Badland winch
- Pioneer bluetooth head unit w/new speakers
- Husky floor mats(great for the mud/winters)
- Custom rear bumper w/tire carrier and full size spare
- K&N cold air intake(300 new)
- Brand new windshield
- Bushwacker fender flares (Not installed. Holes are drilled for them to mount to, but filled with rivets. Easy enough to remove the rivets and bolt on the flares if you like.)
- Etc

There are probably a few things I'm forgetting about.

Only con is that it pulls slightly to the left, and I haven't been able to figure out why. It doesn't really effect drivability too much though, and I drove it every day over the winter without any issues. No death wobble or anything that XJ's are notorious for.

I am asking $3500, but I would really like to trade for a 4x4 truck. I love my XJ's(this is my second), but I need a truck. I really like Toyota Pickups, or anything else interesting. Let me know if you have any questions, want to see it, or just want to throw me an offer. I'm willing to discuss any reasonable offers."

The LCP utilizes a double-action only, hammer-fired mechanism, with the hammer recessed into the rear of the slide to prevent snagging. The double-action only firing mode makes it simple to use in stressed situations—no levers or switches to remember—just point and shoot. The LCP features low profile front and rear sights integrated onto the slide that do not snag on clothing when pistol is drawn from a concealed position, and all sharp edges have been eliminated on the LCP to aid in concealment and to reduce wear on clothing. This LCP model features an alloy steel slide with a blued finish. Right-handed shooters can comfortably reach the magazine release on the LCP with their thumb, while left-handed shooters have no problem using their trigger finger. The mag release pushes in easily, but not so easily that the magazine pops out unexpectedly. Unlike many small semi-automatic pistols that operate with a blowback action, the Ruger LCP operates on a locked-breech system, which mitigates recoil and does not necessitate the user to pull the slide back against an excessively heavy recoil spring during loading. The LCP also has a manual slide hold-open latch for inspection and cleaning. The Ruger LCP is a well-designed, reliable Semi-Auto Pistol that one can count on in an emergency."

P3X-B-BK
The P3X Fury has a virtually failure-proof ultra-high-output LED that delivers your choice of either 1,000 blinding lumens of perfectly focused light or 15 lumens of useful light. The 1,000-lumen output — with peak beam level of 22,000 candela — is enough for searching, signaling, or to overpower the dark-adapted vision of a threat. The 15-lumen output level is perfect for general work at close-to-medium distances and lets you greatly extend the flashlight’s runtime on a set of three lithium 123A batteries, a valuable feature when in the field or in remote locations without easy access to spare batteries. At either setting, a precision reflector delivers a smooth, far-reaching beam with a brighter central area and generous peripheral light to help maintain situational awareness. 

The P3X Fury is activated with a click-type tailcap switch: press for momentary-on low, press further to click constant-on low, return to off and press or click on again within two seconds for high. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is smoothly sculpted for a comfortable, secure grip in all kinds of weather and is coated with a Mil-Spec hard-anodized finish for extreme resistance to scratches, abrasion, and corrosion in even the harshest environments. 

For a single-output version of this flashlight with a tactical tailcap switch, see the P3X Fury™ Tactical. For a smaller, lighter-weight version of this flashlight with a lower maximum output, see the two-battery P2X Fury™.
Features
Virtually indestructible, ultra-high-output LED emitter regulated to maximize output and runtime
Two output levels — high for maximum light, low for extended runtime
Precision reflector creates smooth, optimized beam with plenty of reach and enough surround light for peripheral vision
Coated tempered window resists impact, maximizes light transmission
High-strength aerospace aluminum body, Mil-Spec hard anodized for extreme durability
Dual-output tailcap switch—press for momentary-on low, click for constant-on low, return to off and then press or click again for high
Tailcap switch locks out to prevent activation during transport or storage

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own."
