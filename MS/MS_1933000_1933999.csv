Improving on the FNP-45 Tactical, developed for the U.S. Joint Combat
Pistol Program, the FNX-45 Tactical is the latest in technological
advancements in handgun engineering, offering .45 ACP performance and a
host of unique features that no other handgun can match. The checkered
polymer frame is offered in Black and Flat Dark Earth and has a low-bore
axis for reduced felt recoil and enhanced operator control. Two
interchangeable backstraps come standard to quickly customize the grip
feel. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous for ease of use. The
5.3  cold hammer-forged, stainless steel barrel has a threaded muzzle to
accept sound suppressors, compensators and other accessories. The stainless
steel slide has high-profile combat night sights and includes two mounting
bases to accept multiple styles of optional red-dot electronic sights.

A nice example of a hex receiver.
Blueing is very good.  Rifling is strong. This seems to be a pretty accurate rifle. I have used it once only - apart from that, this rifle has been a gun safe ornament. Took it out to test accuracy from bench rest and I can consistently hit a 5 inch round steel plate with it from a measured 200 yards - iron sights. Apart from using it once, it has sat in my gun safe being bored. It deserves a better home! Reason for selling is, just trying to simplify life (less rifles in my safe). Will need to do a bill of sale with this, and record your DL number, and I will record my DL and my name. You will get a copy of the Bill of Sale. Also will need to verify that you are not out of State. I can meet in RTP, Cary, Apex. I will be happy to send more photos, if you are interested in seeing more. All numbers match. No sling, no bayonet, but you can pick these up cheap. It has not been counter-bored. It is from the Izhevsk arsenal, which apparently made some of the best pre-WWII hex mosins."

The front sight post has been replaced with Midwest industry low profile gas block; this is to accommodate scopes and red dots, even at low power. The new gas block is an ""extended nose"" model to cover what is some times refereed  to as ""front sight post scars"". 

I don't have an accurate round count but its likely 1000ish plus or minus 300ish. Foreword assist works but not will. There is some wear on the upper receivers picatinny rail anodizing, from mounting optics. This is purely a cosmetics issue and it will not interfere with mounting your optics.   Other then what is mentioned above, the upper runs flawlessly and functions like new.Cosmetically, aside from some of the uppers anodizing, I would rate it as very good. If you want a new right out of box upper receiver and forward assist I can replace them both. I have the parts and tools available. 

the lower seen in bottom picture has been sold, that sheen seen in that same image is just oil.

I will ship, at buyers expenses, directly to you, for thoughts that don't know the upper is not the serialized part. I will take discreet Paypal (+3% or gift) or money order."

It was only imported into the USA from 1985-1989, and is no longer imported, making it very difficult to find, and highly prized among collectors and shooters.  It  accepts any standard AR-15 magazines, in 10-15-20 and 30-round and above capacity.   It features a collapsible stock, battle-field reliability and easy take-down.  The K1 assault rifle was developed circa 1983 by the South Korean company Daewoo Precision Industries Ltd (a division of the large industrial corporation DAEWOO International Corp.) as a replacement for the license-built M16A1 rifles, used by the South Korean Army during the 1970s. The improved version, Daewoo K2, appeared circa 1987 and replaced the K1 rifle in production and service.  At the present time the K2 assault rifle and K1A1 carbine are the general issue shoulder arms with the South Korean Army.  Semi-automatic only, export versions of the K2 rifle, known as a Daewoo DR-100 (pre-1994), DR-200 (post-1994, both chambered for .223 Remington cartridge) and DR-300(post-1994, chambered for Russian7.62x39mm cartridge), are intended for the civilian and police markets. The earlier K1 semi-automatic versions were exported from Korea as Daewoo MAX-1 and MAX-2 rifles (both in .223 caliber). The K2 rifles were designed as improved variations of the M16 rifle. While retaining most of the M16 design features, Daewoo designers replaced the direct gas system of the AR-15/M16 rifle with the more common and reliable gas piston system, and made several other improvements, resulting in very good combat weapon. 
Technical details: The Daewoo K2 is a gas piston operated, selective fire, magazine fed weapon.  The K1rifle and K1A1carbine differs from the K2 rifle by different gas system, shorter barrel with different muzzle compensator / flash hider (K1A1 carbine only), and different type of buttstock. The K2 gas system features a long stroke gas piston, located above the barrel. The bolt group is more or less similar in design to the M16 design, with a rotating bolt that has7 lugs and locks directly into the barrel extension. The cocking handle is attached to the right side of the bolt carrier and reciprocates when gun is fired. The return spring with its guide rod is located behind and partially inside the gas piston rod, and, unlike the M16, does not take space in the buttstock, allowing for folding or completely retractable butt to be used. The receiver is generally similar in design to the M16 rifle, and is made from two halves, upper and lower, machined from the aluminum alloy forgings, and linked by two cross-pins. It must be noted, however, that Daewoo receivers are NOT interchangeable with any AR-15/M16 type receivers. The trigger unit is fitted with a 2- position safety / fire selector switch, located at the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip:  Semi and Safe.  The feeding is achieved by using M16-type magazines. Both K2 and K1 rifles incorporate a bolt stop device, which holds the bolt open after the last shot from the magazine is fired. The sighting system consists of the hooded front sight, mounted on the gasblock, and the L-shaped dual aperture rear sight, with one small aperture for daylight conditions and another larger aperture for low light conditions. The range adjustments are made by the rotating knob at the right side of the rear sightblock. Maximum range setting is 600 meters. K2 also can be fitted with the see-thru scope rail just ahead of the rear sight block. The K2 rifle is fitted with the side-folding plastic buttstock and plastic furniture. K1A1 carbine has the retractable steel wire buttstock.
Located in Spartanburg SC: willing to ship to FFL for $40.00, must be willing to accept from a non-FFL.  No damage, excess wear, finish scratches or dings.  Barrel is clean and bright, clean as a whistle, no pitting, rusting or corrosion anywhere.  Fired very little, generally a safe-queen.  The K1A1 was only imported for 18 months, much less common than the folding stock version.  PM for questions or additional pics, may consider trade or best offers."

You're looking at a numbers matching Mosin M-44 carbine built in 1953 at the Budapest Arsenal in Hungary.  These Hungarian M-44s are much more of a rarity than standard Russian M-44s as they only made them for two years (1952-1953).  All numbers on this rifle match. The bore and stock are flawless. I am looking to make some room in the safe for another milsurp project.  Please feel free to email me with any questions."

Have both cylinders.

Born of the Traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the Legendary Single Action Army Revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22 LR and .22 Magnum cartridges the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art-precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. 

 The machined barrel is micro-threaded, and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes this Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are other grip materials available. For instance our Brilliant White Mother of Pearl and Elegant Black Mother of Pearl or Green Camo Laminate grips.

The AR has around 400 rounds through it of M885 and had a proper barrel brake in with frog lube and solvent per CEO's recommendation. The upper has blue paint marker on it, can be taken off real easy with a drop of paint thinner or acetone.  The rifle has been a tack driver for me, but would rather have a 308 gas gun.

KAC Lower with the following changes: $900.00 (purchased in the January hype)
-Swapped out KAC trigger with a Giessele SSA (IMO its smoother) $210.00
-Swapped LMT SOPMOD for a B5 SOPMOD because I got the lower used and original owner kept the LMT... (B5 was 90, LMT was 200, so its about -$110.00)
-Ergo rubber pistol grip with storage cover $35.00
-Rest of KAC lower is un molested KAC trigger not available.

Either option will also include black GRIP POD with metal reinforcement, 4 PMAGS (30rds) tan or black.  Will not ship to banned states, sorry. SUREFIRE LIGHT NOT INCLUDED IN SALE OR TRADE!!  Might be willing to throw it in if you trade a harris bipod and mount for it.

Sorry for the crap photos, only have the ones I took with my camera phone.  I can get better ones for those interested.

Although I am looking for a colt 901, might be interested in other 308's. Bolt or Gas, leaning more towards Gas with 18""bbl like Larue OBR, GAP 10, SR-25 (ill add for it), LWRC REPR, LMT MWS, etc... Only bolt guns I'd be interested in are GAP or APA built 308's.

Have the original parts and about 600 rounds of 7.62x25, hollow points, full metal jacket, and military surplus. Has nice wood grips on it, not the ugly issue grips.

I've shot about 70 rounds through it and has less than 300 rounds total through it. Really good shooting gun. 

If you don't know much about these guns, you should google it. The caliber round is super fast and packs alot of power. This round will go through body armor and is very flat shooting. The CZ 52 can handle high pressure reloads as well without issue.
