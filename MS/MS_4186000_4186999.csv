CZ Description
Finally available for public consumption is the much anticipated Scorpion sub-gun. Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics.
Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.

Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.

I am open to some trades, but don't need another shotgun, 22, or a bow.  I can also add to a trade if yours is worth more

Why would I sell such a wonderful weapon? simply put, I do not need to keep an additional .45.  I currently have a classic 4506 which is my favorite.

The listed 1911 e-Series is in prime condition and shown with a Hougue wrap-around grip with finger indents, which (in my humble opinion) makes for a nice hold when shooting.

The original wood grips were removed the day I purchased the weapon to preserve the classic look should I ever choose to sell or display.

This weapon has a low round count and is in perfect, clean condition.

What you get upon purchase::
1) Weapon as shown (meaning you can choose to remove the grip and add your own)
2) Original Blue S&W Case - Orginal grips are in the case
3) 4 Magazines (3 are shown, one is in the weapon)
4) 32 Rounds of JHP ammo (to fill up each mag)
5) Nice leather holster - as shown

The price at $600 for all is no joke.  Anyone whom might know of the 1911 E-Series know the price is good.  The weapon is in perfect order, just priced to move.

You MUST have a valid VT ID with your current address on your Drivers License.
I will give preference to folks with Valid CCL's from other states.

Accepted forms of Payment:

Purchased with an idea in mind and never made it around to finish the project. Never shot a single round from it, actually, never even loaded it. 

The lower was custom built by Anderson Manufacturing. Overall barrel length is 7.5 inches. Comes with a factory installed aluminum key-mod free float handguard w/ picatinny rails. The pistol is fully functional (with BCG and CH included). I have added a upgraded Full Auto Black Nitride Bolt Carrier Group. Nitiride is much slicker and harder than chrome or even Nickel Boron. It allows that Bolt Carrier Group to operate much longer without lubrication than standard chrome or parkerized finish. It is also much much easier to clean.

Also comes with a 30 round MagPul PMag magazine and single point bungee style sling for easier carrying. This is pistol, no different than a handgun. NO tax stamp is needed to own, use, or carry (yes, it can be carried as a CCW pistol if you wish).

Price is $750. FTF only, no shipping. Must be 21 with a VALID OH ID. CCW (like myself) preferred. Thanks for looking.

Our Anti Tilt Follower was designed to help stop residue particles from entering back into your rifle. Our High Visibility Orange Follower allows for safer clearing of your rifle’s chamber. Tool Free Design, no tools or bullet tips needed to disassemble and clean the inside of your AR-15 magazine. A Heat Treated 17-7 PH Stainless Steel Spring, allows for long term magazine storage while fully loaded. Stainless steel resists corrosion unlike music wire or silicon steel springs.

National Tactical Officers Association tested and approved. NTOA HexID Color Identification System – Why Guess- Ammo Identifier  We believe that marking your magazine should not be a home improvement project. Over the years we have marked our magazines using many different methods such as tape and paint. We found that colored electrical tape made our magazine marking standout when viewed from a distance. There was no need to check letters, numbers or other text, the colored tape worked just fine as an ammo identifier. Our HexID Color Identification System Is based on the principle that color is the simplest way to mark your magazines. So we incorporated color into our ammo identifier design. Not only does our HexID color identification system eliminate the messy task of adding paint or tape, it can be changed in less than a minute. Finding a particular magazine in a mag pouch, gear bag or a storage cabinet has never been easier. Our colors may be bright but you can be assured you’re not hanging Christmas lights on your rifle. Blends in perfectly with your lifestyle either at the range or in the woods. HexID is the perfect complement for three gun competitions, prepper storage, law enforcement officers and anyone who uses more than one brand of ammunition or multiple caliber rifles. High visibility, easy to see colors in critical situations. Why risk your gun your life your reputation or family by loading the wrong ammunition. HexID “Safe Color Choices”, all it takes is one minute. Hexmag “TRUE” Riser System 10 and 15 Round AR Magazine Hexmag introduces the True HX10/30-AR 10 round mag. We have developed a system that does not require the use of pins or limiters. We didn’t take our 30 round magazine and alter it we actually changed the internals to mimic a shorter 10 round mag. The Hexmag true product line uses a riser and a shorter spring in place a standard 30 round spring. Our system as shipped cannot be converted back to 30 rounds."

This weapon is intended for civilian and security use, and mimics the famous M16 rifle in its layout and placement of most controls. It is remarkably light for its caliber and size, because of extensive use of modern, high strength plastics.Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight.Available at Ventura Munitions on the SW Corner of Valley View and Russell.

This is a fairly uncommon m/27 rifle with some rather unique and rare features. 
My m/27 is a 1932 Tikka Produced rifle that has the modified 91/30 type stock and is set up as a Ski/Bicycle Troop Rifle with the side swivel.  Additionally, the right side of the stock shows old battle damage that was not deemed serious enough to replace the rifle stock.  The sharp edges have been worn down with age and likely some initial field repairs.  
It is chambered in 7.62x54R and has the modified chamber to handle all versions of this round as indicated my the D stamped barrel.  Bore is fair, dark with some pitting present from corrosive ammunition or poor field maintenance, but it remains serviceable and is a nice shooting rifle with Light Ball Ammo. 
The m/27 is a rifle that was made in limited numbers and was used hard during the Winter War against Russia.  This one is a survivor of that era and shows signs of combat use and would be a centerpiece in any advanced Mosin-Nagant or Finnish Rifle collection.

Description from the web:
The CZ 85 Combat adds a fully adjustable rear sight, extended magazine release, drop-free magazine and overtravel adjustment on the trigger. The Combat designation comes from the lack of a firing pin block safety, allowing the replacement of the firing pin without tools.

Ambidextrous features include safety levers, slide stop levers and a reversible magazine release. The lack of a firing pin safety gives the 85 Combat a slight advantage in the trigger pull department, making it a long-time favorite of competition shooters."

The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700™ action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence.

The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.
