Full disclosure,this was my CCW for the last few years, and there is some minor holster wear on the upper nose of the slide (see the pic).  Other than that, this gun has seen little to no use in the last couple of years, functions perfectly, and of course has Springfield's lifetime warranty.

I'm getting into shooting more practical pistol, and looking for a slightly larger framed gun. My preference would be a Glock 19, but would entertain a G17. And OD or FDE would be a fun plus, & I could add extra cash to make the deal right.

Shoot me an email with a phone number so I know you're a real person, and I'll call you right back.  I will take down the ad when the gun is sold or traded, so no need to email and ask me if its available. Thanks guys."

I have used it as a sidearm when in the field hunting and you will notice it has a nice patina of spot rust that I actually like for aesthetic reasons. This was not a gun that was locked up all the time, I used it the way it was intended to be used and after a decade of use its still performs like the day I bought it.
I am moving to Alaska in a few weeks, I have an unpaid traffic ticket that needs to be paid before that time. I am also looking to buy a new conceal carry Ruger and need the extra cash.
I am also selling the wife's "" LIKE NEW"" Ruger SR22 if your interested in that as well.
Absolutely no mechanical flaws for this gun or the other 22.... Again I am only selling to pay off a ticket and upgrade to a new sub compact.

We both love this gun, I Wish Ruger would make a higher caliber SR with the same handgrip and frame contours as this SR22... I have an SR45 but the feel in hand of this SR22 is hands down the best in my opinion.
We are moving to Alaska in a few weeks, I have an unpaid traffic ticket I need to clear up and we are also trying to purchase a new S&W Shield for conceal carry...
Absolutely no issue with this gun and it is in top notch condition.... Why buy new when you can have this ""LIKE NEW"" SR22 with less than 100 rounds shot total?

I also have an older Ruger P-95 DC that I have had for over a decade that is like new working condition but has some patina rust spotting on the slide action... I used it as a sidearm during hunting and fishing trips, its also a great gun.

Don't waste your time buying overpriced, eye-gouging converted or non-converted Saigas off of this site. 
- As of 6-3-2015, Classic Firearms -Online Store is Selling brand New FULLY CONVERTED SAIGA AK-47's for $899. And they also come with custom lower and upper handguards as well! They might be cheaper when you actually checkout as well. A member told me they are $750 but I haven't verified this. 
****Below is the ACTUAL Saiga AK47 that Classic is Selling online.****
- I bought my unconverted Saiga in sporter style for $219 three years ago! From a regular retailer. In January 2015, I locally Bought a RWC converted Saiga in .223 from Columbus Cabela's for $499 on sale from the $699 regularly everyday price. 
-Please People...BE SMART and don't pay these people ridiculous prices and the prices will fall to where it should be. Don't even trade them for what you have. $1400-$1800 for a Saiga 12, Really? BTW... This goes for any firearm, magazines, ammo, etc. my advice is to Buy a Brand New factory converted VEPR 12 for $899 made by Molot or a used one off of a member Tthese are made in Russia too and have self regulating gas systems! You can mix diff. loads in the same magazine.
**** No caliber of the MOLOT VEPR is on the U.S. Import BAN List (7.62x39, 54R, 5.45,.308), ***** 

Again, Be Smart and Informative and pass this info onto next person. I'm in no way working, promoting, or being paid by any company, retailer, or mfr and/or their affiliates.

Up for sale is a like new Canik TP9 SA 9MM Black handgun.  It is around the size of a Glock 17/22, and it's just as accurate.

I have fired exactly 200 rounds through it, and had not a single misfire, misfeed, or any other issues.  It was cleaned every single time.

If you're looking to buy a gun but cannot afford a Glock, do not look any further.  This comes complete with holster, 2 magazines, 2 backstraps, and cleaning kit.

It is essentially a Walther P99 clone, however with this being a single action, it has a superior trigger (around 4.2 lbs) and an accessory rail.

The slide appears to be coated with melonite, so it's as durable as the Smith and Wesson M&P Series, which is second to none.

I am only selling it to fulfill other financial needs, or else I would easily keep this as a daily carry.

If you aren't familiar with this gun, search YouTube, all the big gun channels rave over it.

NOTE:  Some people have messaged me that this gun brand new can be had online for less, however if you can point me in the direction of an FFL that doesn't charge $40-60 for an FFL Transfer, please do let me know.  You will end up paying more having it transferred to an FFL, plus this being a private sale, you avoid all of this.  Either way that's your choice."

I have had several emails asking about the difference in trigger packs (gen 1,2,3 & 4) This Gen 2 Pack with the Grey body and black hammer is the one collectors want! it is by far the most coveted. It is not uncommon to see these Gen 2 packs sell for over $1000 for the Gen 2 pack alone and that is $1000 + trade in of a Gen 3 pack. Do your research on this one, the pack with the black hammer and grey body is the one to have and by far the most valuable. This is not a brand new gun and shows signs of wear and tear. This gun was carried professionally daily but was shot fairly little. Sling and one 50 round mag are included in the sale. Would prefer to sell but always open to trades, just let me know what you have or your best offer. These rifles go for $1500+ on online auction sites due to the GEN 2 Trigger Pack.

It has its ORIGINAL nickel finish and a 4-inch tapered barrel. Everything about the gun is ORIGINAL , including the grips. As far as condition goes, I would say it's overall it's in excellent (95%). There is some very slight pitting on a few parts of the nickel finish, but otherwise, the gun is perfect. The grips are flawless, including the medallions. Further, the inside of the cylinders are also excellent, as is the inside of the barrel, the extractor rod, the forcing cone, the hammer, the firing pin, the cylinder release latch, and the trigger. There is no carbon buildup in the either the cylinders or the barrel, nor amy piiting or rust. The rifling in the barrel is perfect, with no pitting or any visible wear. The action is butter smooth, and the trigger is very crisp. The gun is TIGHT. There is absolutely no play in the cylinder during lockup, whether in double or single action. I'd say the nickel is about 90%-95%, but the rest of the gun is 98%. Truly amazing for a gun 104 years old. The serial number starts with 198. I called Smith & Wesson and they dated the gun as being a late 1911 model. This means the gun is older than the Titanic.

I've also had it checked by a gunsmith, and he marvelled at how tight it was. We even shot it a few times (one cylinder worth of ammo). It's very, very accurate.

My asking price for this gem (nickel guns in this model are quite rare) is $650. This is a very, very good price, as the most current 2015 Blue Book of Gun Values (the best source available) puts the value of this gun at anywhere from $850-$1225 in this condition, or even any grade close to this condition. In addition, I also have some new Winchester ammo (box of 50, 125 grain jacketed hollow point) that I will throw in, along with a nice leather holster that fits the gun perfectly. This gun is a STEAL for any Smith & Wesson collector.

This gun is 104 years old, and looks almost brand new. It's beautiful. Plus, it's a true collectors piece. It's outright strange that I haven't gotten any offers on this gun at this price.

I can be reached at REDACTED or at REDACTED. Kentucky residents over 21 only. Cash only. I am willing to drive to meet someone at a reasonable distance from Owensboro. I would also consider a trade for a Smith & Wesson Model 57, Model 657, Model 66, or Model 19."

It has a nickel finish and a 4-inch barrel. Everything is original, including the grips. As far as condition goes, I would say it's very good. There is some wear and slight pitting on a parts of the nickel finish, but otherwise, the gun is near perfect. The grips are flawless, including the medallions. Further, the inside of the cylinders are in excellent shape, as is the inside of the barrel, the extractor rod, the forcing cone, the hammer, and the trigger. The action is butter smooth, and the trigger is crisp. The gun is TIGHT. There is absolutely no play in the cylinder during lockup, whether in double or single action. I'd say the nickel is about 80%, but the rest of the gun is 98%. Truly amazing for a gun over 103 years old. The serial number starts with 198. I called Smith & Wesson and they dated the gun as being a 1912 model.

I've also had it checked by a gunsmith. He marvelled at how tight it was. We even shot it a few times. It's very accurate.

My asking price for this gem (nickel guns in this model are rare) is $650. This is a very fair price.

If buying a generator, an item you are going to have for years. Dont go cheap

The ""EB"" series are their industrial series/quality generators

Honda EB Series Generators are consistently rated as the leading line of generators by construction and rental industry professionals. Known for their rugged, reliable power and performance.

2x 20A plugs

Always starts first or second pull, even after sitting for a month. 

(Auto throttle) Will idle down when no power is being drawn. -
Saves gas and wear on engine.

Most stay full throttle from the time you start.

(Low oil protection) will shut down if low on oil

Was bought new from weingartz for a 5 day trip. 

Has since been in garage and used for power outages.

Im a mechanic so its been taken well care of mechanically.
I go thru it and get ready before every winter. When i need it its because power is out and i dont have time to be messing with it. I take good care of it, keep fluids changed and it has never failed me.

I change oil yearly Always using Mobil 1 Synthetic. 
Last changed 9/5/14

Change out gas as well + fuel stable added.
Drained old fuel, add new 
9/5/14 & 6/1/15

Pull it out, clean off and run it for a bit multiple times a year.

Very little use
Never used for work 
Runs great, top quality 
Very Low hours, Really 
Just got whole home generator so dont need this anymore.

My 78yr old grandma can pull start sometimes when cold but easily if warm after shutting down to add fuel. Easy to start, always starts.

Industrial quality.
