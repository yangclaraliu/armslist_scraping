Picked it up really just because of the OD frame and it was a model 21 and I have had this thing for years now and shoot it less than once a year. Out of production for years these things command a premium for the OD gen3's, especially the G21. I shoot my HK USP more often than this and don't really need this thing. I've got 4 13 round Glock brand mags (one ""ban"" period marked LE only), and one aftermarket hi-cap Korean mag I think it is. I've got all the case goodies, fired shell, speed loader, and should have the manual pack set back as well, etc. I've also got a Barska red dot on it currently, can leave or remove if buyer doesn't want it. Pretty firm on my asking price as I've seen these as high as 1200 NIB over the last year with no extra mags/goodies, and I do like the gun and don't need to sell it. Shoot, I think this was my third pistol I ever owned, so I've just been sitting on this thing for 6 or 7 years I guess if not longer. All laws apply, CCW or PPP required as well as ID to verify they match up.  Trade value is $800 or I'd take $750 cash."

It is chambered in famous well sought after 35 Whelen.  It came with a rail for scope mounting. I purchased a pair of Burris Zee Rings and a Bushnell Banner 2x-7x variable scope. I also stuck a quick attachment unit for an action cam on the side please see photos. It can be removed.
I took it out last year and harvested a buck with it. The deer dropped in its track’s and never needed more than the one shot. 
As a note:
These rifles have synthetic stocks, the trigger has no creep, over all is light in weight. They do not have the best (bluing) finishes on them but they shoot descent.  This rifle shoots great with the Hornady 200 grain superformance cartridges. It shot great with some left over 250 Grain SP ammo I had also but stuck with the former.
I don't think I have put more than 30 to 40 rounds through it and the bore is excellent.
I'm looking for $250.00 for it.
Thank you for looking if interested you can respond to this add."

The serial number on the reciever is 1166XXX which shows to have been produced in January 1943, during WWII.  The rifle contains a mixture of parts, as is the case with almost all of the Garands produced during the war. When parts wore out they were replaced with whatever manufacturers parts were on hand and the rifle was sent back into service. The only parts I have replaced are the clip latch spring and the op rod spring.  The rifle shoots and cycles fine, there is nothing like the ""ping"" of a Garand clip being ejected!  Rifle will come with hard case in picture and 5 empty Garand clips.  I would like to trade for a USGI WWII era M1 Carbine, but I will sell the Garand for $850 cash and find a carbine on my own if someone would prefer just to buy it.

This is an M1895 Nagant Revolver with a 7-shot capacity. It is in excellent working and firing condition and I last took it to the range in October. See picture attached of accuracy at 5 yards.

7.62mm Nagant ammunition, two boxes included of Prvi Partisan newly manufactured and non-corrosive non-surplus ammunition. I recently bought a few boxes at Cabela's near Polaris and I've previously purchased online.

Takedown tool and cleaning rod included.

Soviet bloc leather holster in excellent condition included, it has Cyrillic characters on the stamp inside the holster and what looks like a 1965 or 1966 date for the holster.

As near as I can tell, all matching serial numbers. See pictures.

Armory marking indicates it was manufactured in 1938 at the Tula armory in the former Soviet Union.

Some work on trigger to reduce trigger pull weight. As a result it fires smoothly in double action as well as single action, which is rare for these.

This gun is in excellent condition and ready for range time.

Also includes a barrel clamp mounted sling swivel stud, which is not currently installed.

It includes a very nice Weaver Nitrex TR One 3-9x42mm scope which mounted in a Millet mount and rings. Below is a link to more information about the scope.

This would make a great deer hunting rifle, with plenty of power and quick follow up shots due to it's pump action.  

If you would prefer it without the scope and mount, I could remove that and re-install the aperture peep sight and adjust the price accordingly.  I also have several boxes of 165gr core-lokt ammo, if you want to work out a deal including some ammo too.

Better than Saiga.  Next to be banned?
From an online review:
	""The Molot Vepr 12 isn’t like previous AK platform blasters. It hasn’t been neutered. It isn’t bastardized. In my considered opinion, the Vepr is better than the best Saiga 12 or other AK platform shotguns.""
	""The Vepr 12 is very similar the standard Kalashnikov shotgun. It uses similar parts but works off of a stronger foundation. Built around an RPK receiver, these guns are more or less an AK on steroids. Beyond the thicker steel, these guns also sport other RPK inspirations–notable the handguard and rear sight; the rest is just classic AK design.""

Some history for those not aware:

Egyptian AK47 Assault Rifle

The Egyptian AK47 is just one of the long lists of variants of the most iconic firearm in the world. It is often referred to as the MAADI, which is simply the name of the company that manufactures it. The firearm was massively imported then in the United States and it was made all possible because of Steyr-Daimler-Puch from New Jersey. It happened during the early period of the 1980s. Many of those who saw and collected the firearm recognized that it is very similar to the Russian AKM.

Egyptian AK47 as a Firearm

It is an automatic AKM rifle that was once imported from the suggested country. The rifles from the variant were manufactured by the Maadi Company for the Engineering Industries Maadi-Cairo, Egypt. The factor of the Egyptian AK47 has a long history before it was finally set in Egypt. Many stated that these firearms were originally made with the Soviet AK. At the time, it was also the most similar from the Soviet AK that can be found and bought."

Below is from Wikipedia.
 The Model 1908 Vest Pocket is a compact, hammerless, striker-fired, semi-automatic single-action pistol. Manufactured by the Colt's Manufacturing Company from 1908 to 1948, it was marketed as a small concealable firearm which could be easily tucked into a vest pocket for unobtrusive carry. Created by famed firearms designer John Moses Browning. It's rumored that Browning designed this gun to carry in his vest pocket to protect himself from Coyotes while walking his property. Chambered for the Browning-invented .25 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol) cartridge.

The 1908 Vest Pocket is 4.5 inches long, and has a 2-inch barrel. Weighing 13 ounces, it is fed by a six-round single column magazine. Colt's advertising and marketing literature of the time highly touted the advanced safety features of the Model 1908, including a standard slide-locking safety catch, as well as a grip safety. It also has a third safety feature, a magazine safety disconnector, which prevents accidental firing with the magazine removed."

 A tribute to attributes. Specialized features are the hallmark of the Compact and Pro Carry families. Some have shorter grips and light-weight aluminum frames—even night sights and the Kimber Tactical Rail. All have shorter 4-inch barrels that make them easy to carry.
Chambered in .45 ACP, 9 mm and 38 Super, Kimber mid-size pistols are an ideal compromise of size and weight. With a variety of options and features, they cover every need from duty and concealed carry to home defense. More importantly, these pistols do not compromise quality or dependability. The Tacoma, Washington, P.D. extensively tested Pro Carry models, finding them to be the most dependable firearm put through the paces in over 20 years. They checked the records, comparing Kimber not only with other pistols, but with rifles and shotguns as well. When you carry a Kimber, you carry with absolute confidence.

I believe this gun was one of the transitional guns made in the early 80's having the A2 lower with the A1 upper.  Very little use and it shoots like a dream.  I prefer the cleaner appearance of the right side of the A1 upper which has a higher value to collectors.  S/N 221XXX, a couple of scratches on the left side of the lower above the ""Colt Firearms...."" and minor scratches on the right side of the handguard.  Overall this gun is over 90%

It has been kept in the safe most of its life as I reload and primarily shoot 9mm.  You can see that for yourself with the lack of holster and use wear.  The back strap, right side, and front were professionally stippled with a light to medium pattern that provides awesome grip.  The gun stays in your hands while shooting but doesn't tear them up.  

I also have 340 rounds of defense ammo (160 Winchester PDX1, 80 Hornady Critical Duty, 40 Speer Gold Dot, 40 Hornady Critical Defense, and 20 Federal HST).  I also have 500 rounds (2/250 packs) of UMC and about 60-75rds of Winchester White Box  I'm going to list these after the pistol sells.  I can cut a deal to the buyer too.

I'm willing to ship but your FFL must accept from an individual or you can pay mine for his services (I believe it's $20 or $ + shipping) and you cover shipping costs. If you're a TN resident, I can send it directly to you but you would need to either provide your HCP or give enough info to give me a warm and fuzzy about you not being a prohibited person."
