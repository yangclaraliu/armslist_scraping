I have a Glock 19 Gen 4 with TFO night sights / 2 magazines / back straps and box that I am looking to sale. The 19 has under 200rds through it and has spent most it's life in a safe. It is in great condition with no holster wear.  I am firm on the price with what I have in it and just purchasing the TFO Truglos less than a month ago for right at $100. Only reason that I am selling is to help a family member with moving expenses."

This is the Colt police positive in the 38 colt (38 S&W/38 short) caliber. It has the uncommon barrel length of 6 inches, and the original grips. This is called a transitional gun because the barrel is stamped colt police positive, but the sideplate is stamped ""Colt's new police""  which was only done for the first couple years of production. The serial number on this revolver places it as one manufactured in early-mid 1906, the second year of production.

 I have had this fire arm looked at by a professional and they said that it is in good, shooting order.  I have never fired it, but you can if you want to. 

This revolver is in pristine condition with virtually flawless, original grips.  It has very mild holster wear, but has obviously withstood the test of time.  It comes with a box of antique 38 colt police positive ammunition and a box of 38 S&W ammunition. 

**This is not one of the cheapo 32 calibers or 4 inch barrel 38's that are a dime a dozen.**"

218,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4810218,"For Sale:  Tactical Gear , Vest , B.O.B. Ammo & more","Metro and surrounding, Portland, Oregon",$ 1,"Listed On: Friday, November 13, 2015",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Items are negotiable (within reason) and you're welcome to customize a package deal. All items are rated mil-spec or better, and unless I have specified are completely unused and in original/new condition.

Brands ranging from Blackhawk, VooDoo Tactical, 5.11 Tactical, Condor and more. Here's a more detailed breakdown of many of the items available: Note: The black vest pictured is the last one on-hand. 

Here are specs on only the vest (does not include molle pouches): 
•Manufacturer/Model:  Condor Outdoors / Modular LBV, tactical black
•Material: Mold/Mildew/UV resistant Cordura ballistic nylon 
•Steel-ring eyelet water grommets along the base of the vest and pouches for drainage if submerged
•6 built-in M4 mag pouches w/ shock-cord retention bands for secure & fast magazine access
•Mag pouches run flush along external molle webbing for seamless fit when not in use
•2 internal mesh pockets with complete hook & loop closure completely separated from vest's external by solid double-layer water sealed nylon sheath.
•Chest platform attachment capable, but none stocked as nearly every person who ordered one asked this be removed for comfort. 
•Built-in hydration carrier with padded backing -I have one new UNUSED bladder in OD green w/ insulated tubing if interested​. ...Pictured is a charcoal Camelback bladder used for the photo, but this is for sale with the separate black Camelback carrier
•Sizing is adjustable from M-XXL, official specs say XL, but read below
•Total-vest Molle coverage with QD front harness buckles for emergency ditching (i.e. fully submerged)
•Back upper vest flap is stitched hook & loop for any patches/insignia/name tape/etc...
•Drag-handle between shoulders, secured when not in use by hook & loop
•4 steel D-rings on padded shoulder harness 

My impression, it's lightweight, but strong as hell. I own this vest in OD green and am 6'00"" 200lbs, fits perfect right in the middle of adjusting. 2 years ago I was 275lbs and still was able to get mine to fit comfortably. 

I've used mine as simply a LBV with a couple 4"" molle straps and a Blackhawk rigger's belt doing tree-trimming and had tools in every position (occasionally would take the bladder out and throw in 50' of climbing rope), then gone the next weekend to teach a 3-day course at the TDI institute and worn it over a full upper body MAR CIRAS carrier with A46100 level 4 ballistic plates.

Basically, from my experience with my vest, it's handled everything I've put it through. That being said... prices!

Retail is $60, I would ask $50, but will settle on $40... If you'd like other items (pouches, ammo, mags, medic kits, etc.) we can work out a good package price to save you some cash and free up my time and space for firearms & gunsmithing. If interested in purchasing firearms, we'll start a new conversation.

MEDIC / TRAUMA Kits
If interested in a custom medic kit, I am a certified EMT and K9-SAR volunteer, so can certainly assist with putting together something customized for your needs. I never have pre-made kits, as there's no such thing as an ""all-in-one"" or ""universal"" medic kit. Any health info you wish to provide will be strictly confidential and be protected under Federal HIPAA laws and PHI regulations. You ask all the questions here...

The accessories & pouches are all new and unused -aside from obviously display purposes. The brands on these are primarily all VooDoo Tactical with a few Blackhawk and Condor. These are all from distributors at the 2014 SHOT show so do not have original packaging, but that's where I buy in bulk and you pay a fraction on a new product.

•Drop leg BLACKHAWK! Omega VI Elite Black Holster, right hand size 02. Universal form fitting with compact to full-frame pistols. Retail is $65, priced at $50.
•VooDoo tactical drop leg M4 pouches (holds up to 4 thirty round M4/AR-15 mags) $30.
•New, unused NATO issue 3M 7000 Series Full Facepiece Respirator (includes 2 series 6000 filter cases & comes with 2 new NIOSH P95 disposable filters). Retails at $440, price including filters is $100.
•Voodoo Tactical 15-9684 Mini Mojo Load Out Bag with complete MOLLE Webbing, steel D-rings, compression straps and hidden Quick-access shoulder harness for easy conversion from duffle to backpack-style carry. Note, this bag can fit everything I've pictured, so ""Mini"" is rather misleading. Retail $125, priced at $85.

------------------------------------------------------- 

Firearms, magazines and ammunition sales are priced according to current inventory and demand. Federal, State and local laws apply to all firearm, ammunition and magazine/mag-limit sales. 

Sorry, but I will NOT furnish entire inventory lists. This is mainly for my safety, but also for general liability and my right not to disclose ownership. If you're thinking about something, simply ask me and I'll let you know what I can do. 

*5.56 NATO has sold-out*
I still have 9mm NATO M822 124gr, 9mm WMA NATO 124gr FMJ and assorted personal defense JHP, BJHP, STHP, etc... All ammo is new and factory loaded, not reloads or recalled lots. Though depending on the type, some may be ""new-old stock"" as it's known (such as the Winchester Black Talons). 

Custom package pricing noted above will NOT include any firearms purchased. All firearms are also typically listed on GunBroker and for sale locally.

There is a Beretta M9A1 pictured is not for sale... sorry

I have plenty of additional pics/specs of these and other noted items. Unless we've made prior arrangements, on Tuesday 11/10/15, ALL items on hold for buyers will be relisted and sold on a first-come first-serve basis.

***Texting is best to get a quick reply on an item***

Feel free to call, though I may be in meetings and only get to any emails/voicemails morning, noon and night a day.

Thanks,

Great light weight gun for packing around on long hunts.  I was never quite happy with the accuracy of it so I had some work done to it by Oregon Timberwolf.  I had the trigger adjusted to 2.5 lbs, machined the rear of the receiver flat, and then glass bedded.  It was also cerakoted while at the shop.  It shoots much better now, I was getting MOA groups at 100 yards with 150 gr partitions and 160 Sierra Gamekings HPBT.  I didn’t mess around too much with other bullets and seating depths, etc; so those groups might be able to shrink a bit.  It does not like 140 gr.  Accubonds at all.  Very inconsistent with those bullets.  Anyway, it’s a great rifle, very light and easy to carry, I just picked up another rifle to its time for this to move on.  Its in great shape.  I hunted with it a few years so there are a few little dings and scratches on the stock, but the metal is in great shape.  I can send pics if interested.   
Total package comes with the rifle, mounted Leupold rings (cerakoted same as rifle), Redding neck and seating die set, 280 AI Brass (77 ea) and a bag of nickel plated 280 rem brass for fire forming. 

$1100

I have a Zeiss Conquest HD 3-15x42 scope with Rapid Z 800 reticle I would include for the right price.  I’m not set on selling the scope so I’m not going to list it with the rifle.

Take a break in a recliner designed especially for you! Sink into high-density cushions and reclining seats, and allow yourself to feel incredibly relaxed for hours. With elegant top-grain leather upholstery, you can rest assured your home’s style will drastically improve as well.

Experience the incredible comfort this recliner has to offer just once, and you'll never settle for anything less again. On a free weekend, you’ll love curling up to binge-watch your favorite shows or take a nap on a lazy afternoon.

    Built with a durable frame that features furniture-grade laminates and jointless one-piece arm construction, this rocker recliner features durability to spare.
    Reclining seat allows you to kick back and relax whenever you desire.
    High-resiliency polyurethane foam cushioning and deep seating make this recliner extremely comfortable.
    Nailhead trim accentuates the leather covering and adds a touch of style.

Awesome quality and durability! November 11, 2014 by 14HRT (The Woodlands, TX, United Stat) “We bought this recliner with a set. Have really enjoyed the ease of care along with the quality. I have two dogs and it is tuff enough for them.”   A Comfy Chair for a King (that likes to watch football!) January 4, 2014 by Anonymous “This is a very solid and smooth recliner that doesn't make a peep with even the hardest rocking. I often have kiddos climbing on me while I'm in my chair, and this one doesn't budge when my 6 and 2 year old decide to join me in the chair. It has a shape that kind of guides you into a good posture, and it seems to support my lower nice and comfortably.”"

 I haven't used this thing in months and its taking up space and I need a few hundred extra dollars right now. 

 I've only reloaded around 400-500 rounds of 9mm on it. 

I may have missed a couple of items, so forgive me, there is a lot of stuff on my bench. 

It is everything you need to get started reloading 9mm at least. You'd have to get different dies if you wanted to reload anything else, but It works great, its just time consuming because its a single stage press.

     *Superior 1:7” Twist Chrome Molly Vanadium Steel M4 Profile Barrel, marked 5.56 
Most commercial AR-15 barrels are 1/9 twist, which is fine for lightweight bullets.  However, the US  Military specifies that all of their M16/M4 rifles come with the 1/7"" twist  barrels, so that they will stabilize heavier bullets.  Your ammo selection is GREATER with a 1/7 barrel.  It is suitable for anything from 55gr and up.  The Mil-Spec 1:7” twist is found on the M4 carbine, the M16A4, the Mk12 Special Purpose Rifle and even the HK416.  This twist rate will stabilize heavier tracer rounds.  This barrel will also stabilize bullets up to 90 grains, and easily handles 70-77 grain bullets.  
*Upper and Lower receivers
 Forged PSA 7075-T6 A3 AR upper. milspec lower are made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish.  Includes dust cover and forward assist.

This piece shows only the most faint of high end wear and not one sign of rust nor evidence it has been fired a lot, in my opinion.  I was told that this is a very early Interarms piece due to the fact that the serial number appears both on the frame and the slide of the gun.  I believe this gun to be in the 1981-82 production year range due to the small amount of research I have conducted and Interarms S/N's are very tough to indentify it seems.  Truly a beautiful gun that is a collector.  Sorry but no box or paperwork here but it is accompanied by one factory blue Walther magazine.  No disappointments here. Not looking for trades on this guy. Just a straight sale.  I feel I have priced this PPK/S fairly due to age and condition. Local sales to KY residents only over the age of 21 with Valid KY DL and CCDW Permit preferred. No shipping unless you pay the exact asking price for the gun, plus $30 for dealer fees.

Selling my version of the matching holster and cartridge belt rig worn by the character Johnny Ringo (played by Micheal Biehn) from the 1993 movie ""Tombstone"". The holster should fit a Single Action Army with a 4-3/4"" or 5-1/2"" barrel (or similarly-sized gun). The belt is made for roughly a 34-38 inch waist, depending on how you like to wear it. For example, I wear 34-inch jeans and can wear this belt somewhat loosely on the first hole of the billet. It features 37 cartridge loops for .45 Long Colt (as many as I could fit on it.)

Hand made in the spirit of the Old West; this rig is newly-made from thick, 10-oz veg-tan leather. Perfect accessory for cowboy action shooting. Holster and belt only; the gun is not included!

The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods and more. The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy. The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like no Savage we’ve ever made. The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team. Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown.

Text any questions to REDACTED. Information from Sig Sauer Site below.Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol.

They are in great shape, with a little bit of normal wear on the club faces due to ball striking, as I only played one season with them and always take good care of my clubs. The set consists of:  4H & 5H, 6-PW, SW; all with regular flex shafts and head covers for both hybrids.

These are some of the longest irons I have ever hit. The only problems were the regular flex shafts and natural offset of the irons which, combined, greatly opened up my shot dispersion and promoted a little too much draw tendency for my swing. The salesperson mistakenly got me regular flex instead of the stiff I normally swing, and being right in the middle of the offseason, I didn't get a chance to swing the clubs and realize the mistake until it was too late to return them. That said, these would be a great set for a beginner or someone with a slower swing speed as they are very forgiving and incredibly easy to get airborne. Also, the 4 and 5 hybrids are a lot easier to hit than their traditional 4 and 5 iron counterparts."

The Designated Marksman Course extends the average rifleman’s 100yd line limit. This 100-yard limit is well short of the weapon/ammunition combination’s capability.  Precision Riflemen engage targets at 600 yards and beyond.  The Designated Marksman (D.M.) will be able to engage targets in the “no man’s land” gap that exists between that of the average rifleman and the Precision Riflemen.  Possessing the ability to estimate range, detect targets, and place effective, well-aimed fire on those intermediate range targets, the DM will play a vital role in any team planning."

This is a great ""man's gun"" in .45 acp. I have 1 flush-fit 12 rounder for it and 4, 140mm mags.
It's been Black-T coated ($200 awesome finish) and so have the 4 long mags. It's in 98% condition and very little wear anywhere. 
The extras are a Dawson fiber optic front and an SVI flat trigger (that looks way cool) and big mag funnel. I have the original trigger and short mainspring housing pin if you want to remove the mag funnel.  

It's a workhorse of a gun that just plain shoots. 

I've got well over $2500 into this. New ones sell for $2200 without mags. I'd like $1700.

The gun has had approximately 90 rounds or 3 mags run through it to check for function, and works perfectly fine. The internals show practically no wear and the gun has been kept oiled and lubed properly. 

For those unfamiliar with VZ's, these guns may somewhat resemble an AK, but they're totally different. They have milled receivers, are about a full pound lighter than AK's, and use aluminum mags. They're generally more accurate and quite a bit handier than an AK, and every bit as reliable, if not more so. It also has a last round AND manual bolt hold open feature as well. These guns are pretty rare these days, so good luck finding one this nice with all accessories included!

	Hey all, 
I have available for trade/sale a new/unfired AR rifle. This is a 16 inch stainless 1:8 barrel chambered in 223 wylde (223 or 5.56) with the standard birdcage flash hider. This is an anderson Lower with a Anderson LPK. This model has no Forward asset or Dust Cover, so it is a bit more sleek and lighter. This will also come with the red/green dot sight (with custom little reticles), collapsible stock, single point sling ambi-adapter, single point sling, 30rd Magpul Windowed Pmag, rail covers as pictured, Free float quad rail. This would be a sweet little entry level AR for someone needing a good starter gun that will perform great for them and would serve as a great starting point for many upgrades!
	I would also consider trades for various items. Possibly Marlin Lever guns in 44, 357, etc. PLR-16, CMR30, XDM with threaded barrel, AK47 under-folder, 30 carbines, etc. Some trades will need boot on your end, some on mine. No 40s, Blackpowder, or 22s unless if is heavily in my favor. Honestly, just shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on this one.

Trimmer works with standard pilots and features a micrometer fine adjustment bushing calibrated for setting exact trim length. The positive locking handle and integral power switch make this unit simple and safe to use.
