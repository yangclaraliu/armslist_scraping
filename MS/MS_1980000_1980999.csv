With a total weight of only 766 g, (27oz) the new M-A1 pistol is extraordinarily light. The unique trapezoid sight offers a new dimension in rapid target acquisition. The sight's shape guides the eye onto the target, and thus the target is captured exactly and quickly The new innovative grip offers unsurpassed ergonomics, which results in a natural pointability. It optimally supports the natural posture of the wrist during shooting. Improved adhesion is provided by the special surface design.

I have here a PA-63 Fed Hungary Makarov 9x18mm. This is a great little gun that I took in on trade and would rather trade or sell for another little pistol. It is surprisingly light because of its aluminum frame compared to some of the steel ones I've had before. I have not taken it to the range and shot her yet but she is very smooth actioned and sturdy. It also comes with the all leather Hungarian holster with built in extra clip holder. This gun comes with a total of two clips and is a really great looking gun. I got it from a guy who had gotten it from his father who used it as his carry gun before he passed. I would keep it but I simply would rather get another 9mm Luger than have to stock up another caliber off ammunition. I can shoot pictures via my cell. My number is REDACTED. Shoot any cash or trade offers there as well via text only if possible (i can almost never answer a call and my voicemail for some reason will not work on my phone). Or you could simply shoot me an email on here with a phone number you would wish me to call or text you back at. The possible trades I would consider would be for other 9mm Lugers in either compact, or full frame design. Not real particular on brand, but dont think I will do a straight trade for a davis, jimenez, or cobra. Im not saying i would do a partial trade for them, just that its definitely not gonna be a straight one. Id also consider any other trades of any kind honestly. I mean, as long as it is something of comparable value and preferably of a firearm nature (ammo, rifle, pistol, shotgun). But various other things are not out of the question. I prefer cash, but would like to do a trade as well for another 9mm. 



I also have a davis p32 acp, ATi Titan 45 ACP 1911, and possibly a Huglu 201A 12 gauge SxS available so if you are looking to do a large trade of some kind that could be a possibility as well.
Thanks for looking and have a good one!"

Ive got a Davis 32 ACP ""saturday Night Special"" up for sale. It is model p-32 and is in very used condition. I have not shot it myself because I cant seem to get my hand on any 32 ACP rounds or I would. I got it in trade from a guy who said it shot fine and was a decent little ""plinker"". It is a decent seeming little gun, but like i said, i havent gotten to shoot it myself. Either way, it is a real small and simple little gun that could be a good little plinker for you. I am looking for best offer on this of either cash or other gun. If it is another gun I prefer it be 22, 9mm, or 380 (the calibers I already have). Im not expecting someone to try and trade a Sig or an S&W for this, but in this case I would take a jimenez, cobra, taurus, or like ""quality"" of gun if it was appealing to me. I would keep it but I simply dont want to have to stock up another caliber of ammunition just for a little plinking gun. 
I can shoot pictures via my cell at REDACTED if you are interested. Please shoot any questions or offers either there or to my email address on her. Also, like i said before, it is a very well used gun that has obvious signs of usage and wear. It also is stiff to cock, but I have been told that that is ordinary for these kinds of guns, so I am not sure if that is an issue or not. It still does cock, and ""fire"" just fine and seem to be fine. 
Thank you for looking and have a good one."

The first with CASH only will own this shotgun & you pick up.

The pump-action Model 3000 was imported by Smith & Wesson in the early '80s to compete with the popular Remington 870. It's ""split lifter"" feeding mechanism addressed the Model 870s biggest drawback, the possibility of a ""jam"" if the operator ""short-stroked"" the action while racking a fresh shell into the chamber.

The Models 3000, along with the semi-auto Models 1000 and the centerfire Model 1500 line of rifles, were discontinued in 1984 when S&W's corporate parent Lear Siegler was acquired by Bangor Punta. 

These Model 3000 shotguns were well made, durable and very robust.

The lower is a Del-Ton brand receiver with a DPMS LPK.  The stock is an ACE ARFX buttstock and contains a standard A2 buffer with a CS spring.  The pistol grip is a Hogue.

The upper is an RGUNS (Cerro Forge) brand flattop receiver with a properly torqued and accurized 5.56mm barrel, so it will shoot both 5.56mm as well as .223.  Both the barrel and the receiver have M4 feed ramps.  The FSB has been replaced with a low profile gas block, which is concealed beneath the handguard.  The handguard is a Troy/VTAC Alpha 9” modular rail handguard.  All screws/rails/rail backers/installation wrenches are included.  A MaTech rear BUIS adjustable for windage and elevation out to 600 meters and a flip-up front sight are installed.

Included in the package are three black Magpul 30 round PMAGS, over 100 rounds of ammunition (76 rounds of PMC Bronze 55gr .223/49 rounds of 62gr Green Tip 5.56mm XM855, a Plano hard case, OD single point sling, and laser with remote switch.  The laser is not currently installed, but I would be happy to install it to POA at your chosen distance.  The adjustment screwdriver is included as well.

Test firing is fine with cash in hand, as long as you have somewhere to do it.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

I'm fairly firm on the price, but if I find I'm asking too much I may lower it.  I'm in no hurry to sell.  The only substantial trade I will consider is for a motorcycle, preferably a late 80s to early 90s Nighthawk at least 650cc but willing to consider others.  I may take other trades with at least $1k cash.  Will require bill of sale (a copy for each of us) and will need NCDL info.  If it matters relative to a trade, I have an NCCHP."

It has been upgraded with a Magpul CTR buttstock and MOE+ Grip in Flat Dark Earth. The standard handguards and A2 sight post have been replaced with a low profile gas block and a Troy 13.8"" free float Alpha Rail also in FDE. A Midwest Industries low profile front flip up sight has been included to go along with the Midwest rear flip up sight. Includes 1 30 round magazine. 3 sections (1 long with QD sling socket, 2 short) of picatinny rail are included to attach accessories wherever needed to handguard. The Magpul CTR (Compact/Type Restricted) – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability* and an ambidextrous QD sling mount that will accept any push-button sling swivel. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear. The MOE+ Grip combines reinforced polymer body construction with comfortable, wrap-around rubber overmolding for maximum weapon control in adverse environments. With a similar shape to a 'medium' sized MIAD, this AR15/M16 drop-in design features a hard-polymer bottom edge to reduce the possibility of equipment snags or grip damage. The MOE+ Grip accepts optional storage cores for gear stowage and includes a basic grip cap. Troy BattleRail Alpha 13? The genesis of modular free float rails has arrived. Building off the TRX Extreme design that revolutionized rail based hand guards; the Alpha Rail® utilizes a new low-profile locking mechanism, which offers unparalleled strength and stability. The Alpha Rail® disperses heat and runs cooler than other close to the barrel rail systems. With unlimited mounting options and greater heat dispersion, the Alpha Rail® once again sets a new industry standard in modular free float rail design. Comes with three detachable rails and all mounting hardware. Troy® Alpha Rail® is machined from 6061-T6 hardened aircraft aluminum and finished in MIL-SPEC Type III Hard Coat Anodizing.

Using FROGLUBE® results in a durable dry slick wax-like surface that reduces friction, eliminates fouling, and destroys rust. FROGLUBE® is safe for plastic, urethane, nylon, and wood. FROGLUBE®will give your weapon many extended years of service.

Model A1041. Competition grade rifle.
I bought this rifle specifically to shoot competition. It was recommended by several of my shooting friends as being one of the most reliable and accurate rifle on the market today. I really never got into it as my interested has changed to shooting 22 handguns. These are very rare and hard to find because people keep them, but I am wanting a nice target style 22lr pistol.
Here are some reasons why this makes a great shooting gun. High Standard has been at the top for competition guns since 1952, many people use them in the Olympics and for all around shooting. Longer barrel, 22”, light weight and very well balanced. Vented receiver, helps when shooting a lot of rounds and reduces malfunctions and keeps the receiver cleaner.
This rifle is in excellent condition and will shoot 22longs, shorts and 22long rifle, any brand. It has been kept clean inside and out.

The ONLY reason we are selling/trading this pistol is because my wife cannot comfortably rack the slide.. the spring is just too stiff for her. So, that brings me to the possible trades we will consider; please see below.

If trading I will expect to see (and be willing to provide) a state issued ID, if purchasing the pistol outright then I will be adding a bill of sale to that.

This kit includes all of the required parts to convert to the E2 grip. The ergonomically designed, reduced circumference makes the shooters grip much more comfortable and will especially help those with smaller hands.

Requires use of the new style mainspring 34280454. If you pistol has the long mainspring with a metal seat, you will need to also order the new mainspring. If you have the black plastic mainspring seat, you already have the correct mainspring.

Also requires the new style trigger bar spring with the coil in the middle. If you have the plain curved trigger bar spring, you will need to replace it. Check out our Trigger Bar Spring Page to see photos for comparison.


Manufacturer: Sig Sauer 

SKU: GRIPKIT-229-E2

This kit is for the DA/SA model, NOT THE DAK. If you own a newer model Sig, this kit contains everything you need.  I used this for my 2004-2005 era Sig P229 and it worked just fine without ordering any other parts.   I bought this online from Top Gun Supply for $46.95"

I have a few other things for sale and if anything sells before this which one of my motorcycles looks like it will sell as long as they come over with the cash within the next day or so this gun will go back up to a higher price so I take no loss on a brand new glock that I have not even taken out except to admire it. I used to dislike glocks. To be honest it took firing one and carrying one for a while and it grew on me. They are not the best lookng gun on the market but damn they are reliable. Between my glocks and my M&Ps I cannot believe anyone would waste hundreds more on anything as these guns eat any ammo and are easy to carry. I am now a Glock lover after my first afair with a 23 and now a few other mistresses.
