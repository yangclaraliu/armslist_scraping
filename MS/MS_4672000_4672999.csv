Up for consideration is the rarest finish of the Gold Cup models. Straight from Colt’s legendary Custom Shop is the Enickel finished Series 70 Mark IV Gold Cup National Match. The Gold Cup has long been revered for its features that gave it the reputation as one of the finest 1911’s ever built, this particular one has made a trip to the Custom Shop for the Enickel finish that makes it so hard to find. To top it off, she is a highly desirable Series 70. I bought it from the original owner and he said that it has had two mags shot thru it. It has a very faint take down mark just a whisper to be honest. It could be buffed out but II have left it because the finsh on the gun is so perfect I didnt want to take a chance of damaging it. The gun shows no other flaws. No scratches, dings or any other issues on this one and if not for the aforementioned flaw this would be a 100% gun. Comes complete with the factory box with the Custom Shop label intact as well as one other unique item, the receipt from the original purchase. These are very difficult to find and do not come on the market very often. Ships overnight insured to the FFL of your choosing.

This has two DVD/CD drives and has a 50 disk capacity. It burns the disk and then prints your image directly on the disk and they look fantastic. The ink is mostly out at this point so you'll need to freshen that up. I had this for a few projects but it's been sitting idle for over a year and I have no future need for it so it needs a new home.

The duplicator connects via USB and the software is available on the Primera website.

I'll also include 2 spindles of Primera printable DVDs.

Here's a youtube video that will give you an idea of how it works: https://youtu.be/qbk4MKsWWMw

There is a 25 disk version of this duplicator going for $1500 on ebay and comparable models are selling new for as much as $3000. I'm willing to put a trade value on this for much less than either of those numbers.

I know it's a long shot but you never know when serendipity might strike.

Egyptian Maadi AK47’s
One of the only semi-automatic Kalashnikov imported into the United States, in almost every regard, an exact duplicate of the Russian AKM. During the 1950’s the Soviet Union, as part of its military aid program, established the production of Soviet-pattern small arms in the Arab Republic of Egypt.

AKM rifles were manufactured at the “Factory 54,” the Maadi Company for Engineering Industries in Cairo. Key Egyptian personnel were trained in the Soviet Union, and the plant was supervised by Russians prior to their abrupt expulsion from Egypt at the hands of Anwar Sadat in 1972. Designated as the “ARM” (Automatic Rifle Misr), a semiautomatic-only version of the Egyptian AKM was introduced to the American public in 1982 by the U.S. division of Steyr-Daimler-Punch in Steyr, Austria. For all intents and purposes this is as close as most of us will ever come to a Russian AKM.

The laminated wood handguards and buttstock are correct in every detail. The lower handguard has the proper hand swells, and the buttstock has been reinforced with steel pins in all the right places. All the wood furniture was imported from Finland but finished in Egypt. The plastic pistol grip was injection-molded to correct Soviet configuration.

The metal components are exactly those of the Russian AKM. Small recesses on each side of the receiver , directly over the magazine-well, serve as magazine guides and instantly distinguish this as an AKM. The four gas escapes holes found on each side of the Ak-47’s gas cylinder have been omitted, and there are two gas relief holes on each side of the gas block where it mates with the gas tube. The bayonet lug is directly under the gas block.

Rear sights are graduated to 1000 meters (with a 300-meter battle sight marked “p”) instead of the AK-47’s 800meter maximum. An AKM muzzle breake was installed. The sheet-metal receiver cover has transverse ribs and a rolled edge over the ejection port. Chambers and bores are hard chromed. All the exterior metal surfaces have been finished with a baked on black enamel over phosphate. Only the green web sling was of Egyptian design.

No doubt about it, expect for the selective fire option and the markings on the receiver , this is a soviet AKM. Yet no more than 2000 were brought in before the importation ceased.

ACC/INTRAC Knoxville,TN imported Maadi rifles from 1993-1995
Imported models the ARM and RPM both with thumbhole stocks. The model ARM had a 16.34"" barrel length with the end theaded with a muzzle nut tack welded on. The model RPM had a 20"" barrel with the end threaded with a muzzle nut tack welded on. The 1993 imported RPM rifles came with a bipod attached and later imported ones didn't.

Includes:

ATI folding collapsible stock and railed forend

30 round magazine

Ram-Line Bi-pod

Up for consideration is Colt’s SF VI model. The ‘bridge’ model between Colt’s Detective Special series, these were built for somewhere between one and 2 years and while not rare are becoming increasing difficult to find. What we have here is the much more difficult to locate Matte finish, this was a finish that quite frankly if you looked at it wrong it showed a scratch. This gun has been meticulously maintained and cared for, there is nothing that shows as a detraction here. Grips have no detractions, with its compact size she’ll fit right into your safe for years of storage leaving room for more!! Comes complete with original factory blue box and sleeve correctly number to the gun, absolutely no aftermarket stuff as is true with all of my auctions. On a parting note, SFVI’s in this condition and completeness are becoming nearly non-existent and rarely seen any more. Thanks for stopping by to take a look, ships overnight insured to the FFL of your choosing.

This gun was purchased in 2011 and has seen a moderate amount of range use. The finish on this gun wears very easily, which you can see in the photos. Despite the less than stellar appearance, the gun functions very well, and runs reliably with a wide variety of ammo.

The magazine disconnect safety has been removed, and the original curved mainspring housing has been replaced with a straight one. The original parts will all be included if you want to reinstall this safety.

Also included is the original box, manual, three front sights (different heights for adjusting elevation), and barrel wrench (for removing the threaded barrel cap if you want to install a suppressor adapter).

Up for consideration is the prettiest, if a gun can be called that, of the Python line from a finish perspective at least in my opinion. The enickel finish on the Python is just amazing and unlike any of the other enickel finishes Colt ever put out. This finish was done in the Custom Shop and led to their numbers being amazingly small in comparison, this example is close to perfect with only the very faint time line and that’s it. She is one of the sweetest guns I’ve ever held. Fitted with the very difficult to find and completely perfect wooden shoes, the overwhelming majority of these came with the Pachmayr Presentation grips and really these really make this one stand out from the crowd. The only drawback I can see is a imperfection in the rib on the barrel. It could be a handling mark or could have happened during the nickeling process. The entire package comes with the factory original packaging, you’ll find no aftermarket crap in any of my auctions so bid with confidence. Thanks for stopping by to take a look, ships overnight insured to the FFL of your choosing.

This combination, along with the rifle's adaptability, appeals to bolt-action enthusiasts - whether young or old, novice or experienced.

 Each Ruger American Rimfire® rifle includes two, interchangeable stock modules that provide comb height options for scope or iron sight use. Standard models come with long length of pull modules, while compact models come with short length of pull modules. By simply removing the rear sling swivel stud, stock modules can be changed in seconds. All four stock modules are completely interchangeable across all models.

Hurls 250-grain bullet downrange at 2,200 fps
Chrome lining in both the bore and chamber extends barrel life
Includes five-round magazine
It’s called ""Thumper"" and it’s capable of taking any game animal in North America. Engineered to mount on your mil-spec AR-15 lower, this 20"" model hurls the 250-grain Hornady SST/FT .450 Bushmaster bullet downrange at 2,200 fps. Though not designed as a long-range caliber, there’s nothing on this continent capable of standing up to the firepower of Thumper and inside 200 yards its accuracy is outstanding. Recoil has been compared to that of a 20-gauge shotgun. A tubular-aluminum forend allows the barrel to free-float from the nut forward to enhance accuracy. Chrome lining in both the bore and chamber makes the .450 Bushmaster easy to clean and extends barrel life. A five-round magazine is included."

It's in 9mm and uses standard Beretta 92 type magazines - this is different than many other CX-4s you'll find on the market because most use the PX mags which can hold only up to 20 rounds.  The rifle in this listing can use 10 round mags, 15 round mags, 17 round mags, 20 round mags, and 30 round mags.

As you can see from the photos, I've added some factory Beretta goodies to it:
1) the Beretta barrel shroud - this adds some weight to the front and significantly reduces muzzle rise...plus, it looks really cool, doesn't it?
2) dual cocking handles: since this carbine is ambidextrous (switching the ejection port is simple and takes less than 5 minutes) I added a Beretta factory cocking handle to the other side, so that either hand can be used to charge the gun.
3) for me, the original configuration was a little short, so I've added some Beretta buttstock spacers (you can see them in the picture)...these are removable if it's too long for your liking.
4) I bolted on a 45 degree picatinny rail in case you want to mount a small optic or laser on the side.  In addition - and you can't see this in the picture because it's retracted - there is a small rail that slides out under the barrel which can be used to mount lasers or lights.

This gun is in beautiful shape, handles well, and is incredibly accurate.

My price is VERY reasonable, considering how hard these are to find in 9mm that use the standard Model 92 mags.  In addition, the furniture I've added to it sums up easily to over $200 more than a standard model would cost.  Finally, as shown in the pictures, I am including 3 Beretta brand factory mags: two 15 round mags and one 30 round mag.  That 30 rounder alone sells for $40.   Needless to say, I will ignore all offers that are less than $900.

Now the legal stuff: I will sell only to Alabama residents who have a current valid carry permit.  You must be willing to sign a bill of sale.  Also, before I meet you, I will need to know who I'm dealing with, so I will require the buyer to email me a picture of his or her carry permit and DL....I do not want to sell this thing to a thug or a psycho."

 NO GUN OR AMMO
 Below is the Short History of Lahti L-35 and Husqvarna M/40,
 In 1935 Finnish gun designer Aino Lahti created a new pistol for use by the Finnish Military, which at the time was armed with dated revolvers, or pistols imported from Germany. The design he created took aesthetics from the classic German Luger pistol but used a locked breech recoil operating design that was much simpler to the Luger's toggle system. It also feature a device called a bolt accelerator, a mechanism which slammed the bolt open, making it more reliable in harsh winter conditions. The L-35 was a pistol of incredible quality and robustness, being made with precision from the best materials available. Around 9,000 were produced, most would see action in the Winter War against the Soviet Union during the start of World War II.

 In 1940 Sweden purchased the design from Lahti and created their own simplified mass produced version called the M/40. While produced in much greater number, around 100,000 to be more exact, this version was no where near the quality of the Finnish L-35. Manufactured by Husqvarna, they used inferior quality steel which often cracked when used with +P 9mm ammo (+P means higher pressure). They also were less reliable in combat. Despite its drawbacks, the M/40 would remain in Swedish service until replaced by the Glock in the 1980's."

Includes the original box with matching serial number label, 5 chokes, choke tool and original shim kit.  If you've not shot a 24"" shotgun, you need to.  All of my scatter guns have 24"" barrels because of the exceptional handling of the shorter barrel.  This one is ready for your dove season, and later next year will handle your turkey hunting.  It would also be a great youth gun due to the lighter weight and swing.

The Franchi I-12 is made by Benelli, and is essentially a Benelli with a slightly different frame and fore-end.  The action is the Benelli inertia action.  The camo is of exceptional Benelli quality.  You are basically getting a Benelli M2 at half the cost.

Shipping will be $25 to your FFL only.  Please write me with your questions.  I have up to 20 photos of the Franchi from all different angles, and will be happy to send them to you."

MN ID only. I am not a ffl and do not buy from them. Bill of sale only if requested. If trading dont ask me for a ptp I dont apply for them anymore nor would I apply for a carry permit, the US constitution grants me the right to bear arms and both state and federal laws require nothing to sell or trade firearms to another in the same state other than to verify residency. A bill of sale is just security to protect the seller and buyer in case a seller or buyer is a felon or if the firearm is stolen. I am a longtime armslist regular and am getting sick of people not knowing the laws and will paste this message in every ad I post.

MN ID only. I am not a ffl and do not buy from them. Bill of sale only if requested. If trading dont ask me for a ptp I dont apply for them anymore nor would I apply for a carry permit, the US constitution grants me the right to bear arms and both state and federal laws require nothing to sell or trade firearms to another in the same state other than to verify residency. A bill of sale is just security to protect the seller and buyer in case a seller or buyer is a felon or if the firearm is stolen. I am a longtime armslist regular and am getting sick of people not knowing the laws and will paste this message in every ad I post. If you are not a ffl you have no business asking for permits as they are only issued for ffl purchases and for law enforcement to verify state carry status."

MN ID only. I am not a ffl and do not buy from them. Bill of sale only if requested. If trading dont ask me for a ptp I dont apply for them anymore nor would I apply for a carry permit, the US constitution grants me the right to bear arms and both state and federal laws require nothing to sell or trade firearms to another in the same state other than to verify residency. A bill of sale is just security to protect the seller and buyer in case a seller or buyer is a felon or if the firearm is stolen. I am a longtime armslist regular and am getting sick of people not knowing the laws and will paste this message in every ad I post. If you are not a ffl you have no business asking for permits as they are only issued for ffl purchases and for law enforcement to verify state carry status."

The Model 512 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.

The Model 512 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. Other features include a 65 MOA circle reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 20 brightness settings. The Model 512 is compatible with 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails.

Fired this weapon only 4-5 times, total round count approximately 500-rounds.

I replaced the handguards, grip and added forward grip, and stock with Magpul MOE equipment in Black to match rifle (easy fix to paint them yourself if you choose alternate color scheme).

This rifle will come with everything pictured, to include:  
-5.56 NATO chambered Smith & Wesson M&P Sport Heavy Barrel AR-15 with LIFETIME WARRANTY.
-Tactical carrying case 
-Troy Industries 3-point tactical sling
-4 30-round Magpul P-MAGS
-Cleaning kit
-Lock and unloaded chamber indicator
-ALL Original GI-style equipment that came factory on rifle; grip, handguards, stock, etc. 

This rifle was owned and maintained by an ex- United States Army 11B Infantryman, and was cleaned using ONLY US MILITARY CLP-1 since bought.

What makes this rifle different from others on Armslist?
This rifle has a heavy barrel NOT a pencil barrel, but does have bayonet lug.
This rifle is chambered in the 5.56x45 NATO cartridge, but will also fire .223 Remington if you so choose (I didn't - stuck with the best).
This rifle is an all-in-one purchase, everything you need to own and maintain your AR-15.
This rifle includes factory GI-style parts, but comes with Magpul MOE equipment installed for a lower price than others.
This rifle has Magpul MBUS rear sight, zero'd at 50-meters, and iron front sight - but railed and optics ready.

The stocks are solid with no cracks or repairs just minor handling marks & the wood fits proud to the receiver. The checkering is still sharp & these stocks are just gorgeous."
