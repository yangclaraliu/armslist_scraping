A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look.

I am selling my Sig P938 comes with case and manuals, etc.  Includes 1 six round mag and 1 seven round extended mag.  I had a custom OTW leather holster made for this by Adams Leather Works. http://www.adamsleatherworks.com/  I Paid $105 for this holster.
He has an awesome video on Youtube showing him make these from start to finish, he even airbrushes the edges black after staining it.  8-10 week lead time.  He is good!
This will be optional since some people don't like OTW holsters.  $500 without the leather holster or $545 with the leather holster.

I had Omega Gunsmithing in Monroe Duracoat the barrel, hammer, take-down pin, Ambi Safety, and grip screws in a silver color.  I didn't do this to hide anything, the gun just seemed plain so that made it look sharp in my opinion.
I have about $900 into this.

$848.00 Is what it cost me without tax and background check.  So I will sell it for the amount $800 FIRM (FIRM means FIRM) My loss your gain. So you save the tax and background check.  NO trades at present.

Please respond to the email below since I do not always get a timely response from this site.  Pickup must be in Lake Worth/Boynton Beach area since I cannot drive to far.  Low balls will not be responded too.

Thanks for looking

I added a Linear Compensator (PIG) that is almost a must on AR pistols.  It will deflect the blast wave forward away from the shooter.  This compensator was $40.

This is the version from the Sig Custom Shop where the frame has been melted for better concealed carry, SIGLITE three-dot tritium night sights were added and the SRT trigger has been installed.  My price includes 2 8-round magazines, but I have several (4 of 5) are brand new, hard to find, 10 Rd OEM magazines in original plastic.  One magzine was opened just to ops test.  The other open one (no plastic) was purchased used for $69 and is in perfect condition.  These range from $50-$100 as they have been discontinued.
If you also buy 3 10-round magazines @ $50 each in addition to the pistol, which is what about what I paid, I will throw in a third 8-round magazine and a Don Hume OWB paddle holster complimentary, which retails for about $30 and $50, respectively.  If not interested you can make an offer as to whatever you want to buy in addition in terms of magazines and holster.

This is a fairly rare weapon in 9mm that is brand new and at least $200 cheaper than a LGS and $100-125 cheaper than Gunbroker w/o the shipping and FFL fees.  The ONLY reason I am selling it is because I have decided to go with CZ as my full-size and compact line because of the Kadet  22 lr adapter that will fit both.

I will require an affirmation that you are eligible to purchase a firearm and are a WI resident.  This affirmation will include that you have not been convicted of a felony, crime of domestic violence, not under a restraining order or never been mentally committed.  I will also need to inspect your full DL at the time of purchase to verify residency, age and identity.  Cash only for local sales.

I frequently travel between Eau Claire and Madison and Eau Claire and Minneapolis and can meet anywhere in Wisconsin between these points if it's convenient to my travel schedule.  I may be willing to meet at other times, but would likely require a small deposit to cover expenses if the sale doesn't go through.

I am willing to ship.  However, if I am traveling and I am not by my FFL, be advised that it will cost about $90, e.g. Fed Ex fee for non FFL, plus your receiving FFL fees.  Otherwise, plan on $35-40 for my FFL and whatever your FFL on your end charges all to be paid by the buyer.  We can discuss details if you are serious.  Price is very fair and fairly firm, (I may move a little depending on the number of accessories you purchase) as I'm in no hurry to sell and don't plan to shoot it.  USPS money order only that will be verified with the USPS prior to shipping."

In great shape with no issues.  Will come with two 7 round magazines.  Has an excellent trigger as most know and this is the Pro model so it doesn't have the hated magazine disconnect or a manual safety.  
 Would consider trades.  I like revolvers in 38 or 357, a lever action rifle in 357, a complete carbine ar15 upper, Kel Tec SU16, 40 caliber handguns, or a pistol caliber carbine in 9mm or 40.  Maybe a large amount of 5.56 or 9mm ammo.  No Kel Tecs or Taurus aside from the SU16 or Kel Tec carbines.  Looking for an even trade, have a move coming up so I can't afford to add anything to it.

If you'd prefer to buy I'll sell for $370, price is pretty firm.

Be very respectful and clearly underline the salient points that no legally able NH resident should have to ask the government for permission to exercise their God given constitutional right! Please contact her now even if you have in the past; calls and faxes! Contact her again next week before it is to late and again in the days/weeks leading to this critical vote. Governor Hassan’s vote is the only obstacle remaining to pass constitutional carry. Please do not sit back and only “pray”. Please do not think if you do not take action “your neighbor will”, please take initiative now! Take action, contact her office now and keep contacting her office in the weeks and month to follow and then pray for good measure.
Please call ask politely for her to sign the bill into law and verbalize you are a voter and a vote against this bill is a vote against her and the democratic party! It is much easier to fight for something while you still have the right versus fighting insurmountable odds once those rights have been taken away. If you are from Mass, California, D.C. etc. you would know why I urge you to fight now.  Thank you and please make your views known to Governor Hassan, spread the word urging your friends, family and neighbors to contact her office to pass this bill now and truly be “Live free or die”.

Basically I have an AR-15 (I know, not your typical Marksmanship rifle but I feel you should really see what your rifle is capable of and high quality custom loads are better than factory loads for that) and want to make some high quality (Lapua Brass with Nosler Projectiles) custom loads tailored to my rifle. I just don't have the equipment, or knowledge to re-load my own. I will provide the brass and projectiles. I will also consult you on what primers and powder you think would be best (based on my rifle, casing, and projectile) as I have 0% knowledge of this.
I will incure all the cost of the components themselves. I will also pay you for your time in helping me tailor the right load, make about 200 rounds for me, and for your expertise and land usage. We can discuss price as this is not an easy assesment of cost.
I am looking for someone who is knowledgeable in the field of reloading, friendly (since I am new and trying to learn about re-loading, I do not want someone who is rude), and has immidiate access to land to test the loads.
I live in Marion and work in Indianapolis; I am willing to drive 90 minutes to 2 hours to meet with someone who meets these requirements.

Tap the rear pin from right to left far enough to free the trigger assembly but not so far as to release the bolt stop and bolt stop spring. (DIAGRAM A)STEP 3: Insert the Timney Trigger and tap the front pin from right to left but not so far that it presses against the bolt stop. You should be able to depress the bolt release and the bolt stop should move freely.Disregard for Model 7.STEP 4: Tap the rear pin from left to right until it is flush with the bolt release. (DIAGRAM C) If the bolt stop and spring come out during installation, note in DIAGRAM B how both fit together. One spring end hooks in the trigger recess, the other on the bottom of the bolt stop.STEP 5: Adjust the bolt release so it moves the bolt stop without any binding. Do this by very slighlty bending the tip with needle nose pliers so it perfectly engages the notch in the bolt stop. Bend and test. This may take several tries before you get it right. (DIAGRAM E & D). Disregard for Model 7.STEP 6: Install action in stock, install bolt in action and check trigger function.NOTE: Timney Triggers are slightly wider than Remington factory triggers. You may need to enlarge the opening on the trigger guard where the trigger protrudes from the stock.Trigger Adjustment: The screw on the rear of the trigger adjusts sear engagement. This screw is pre-set and should not be adjusted below this setting. The bottom front screw adjusts pull weight. Turning this screw in increases pull weight. Turning it out decreases pull weight. Do not reduce pull weight below 1.5 pounds or [8 oz forthe Calvin Elite Series.]"

These were a special run with the longer 1 in 66 twist barrels and deep button rifling made especially for round ball shooting, old school but very effective. I stopped using this a long time ago when my eyes started to go, then got the scope mount removed the rear sight then  my back went out so I rarely hunt anymore. Unfortunately It's been so long I can't find the rear sight. You won't find another one of these anytime soon and it will be a sweet rifle for the hunter or the collector. Finding the Thompson Center scope mount is no less challenging especially new in the package. The discoloration you see is not rust but old dirty oil or something in the packaging. If you can find another one of these with the original T/C 1 in 66 barrel for less let me know? I'll match the price but the scope mount will be a little extra."
