- NEEDS A NEW MAGAZINE.
I WILL include the original magazine (Which still has about 15 Bullets left in it) but, the last time I was at the range with this particular gun, I dropped the magazine during re-loading and since that day, the bullets don't properly retract from the mag into the chamber. Likely this can be resolved with some elbow grease and a Phillips Screwdriver (to open the magazine). Maybe something is loose like a spring or there's just dirt still left in but... To get a new mag is about $30 which has been discounted from the overall price of $300.00 down to just 270.00."

I have owned this pistol for approximately one year.  I am wanting to sell it because it is the only pistol that I own in this caliber.  Therefore I am including everything that I have for this pistol to include ammunition.  The only issue with this pistol is the right button for the laser.  This button did not function when I purchased the pistol.  I believe that the previous owner attempted to use a tool to remove the laser.  The laser still functions with the use of the left button.

Other items N. OC

So my divorce sale continues and it's getting uglier. Single guys reading this, don't get married!!!!! prices are cash and will meet in Anaheim Hills or Orange area for sales. Will NOT ship Ammo but open to shipping the shades and the blade. 

I have up for sale two thousand rounds of PMC X-Tac 5.56. Fifty five grain. They come sealed in 500 round flats that have 25 boxes of 20 rounds each. I wish I could lower the price more but I cannot so please do NOT ask. If you want all 2k rounds I'll do $750 otherwise I'm FIRM at $200 per 500 round flat. 

I figure I could also post two other items on here since I'm primarily selling Ammo. I use to work at Oakley and SureFire before going into law enforcement. In me moving out of my home that I loved, I came across a brand new pair of Polarized Oakley Juliet sunglasses. These are the rare Carbon color frame with black Iridium, polarized lenses. I have extra nose and temple pieces. I don't have the box but I bought these back in 2003 and wore them a handful of times. They have a tight fit and could call them new but I did wear them a couple of times so gentle used it is. I'm asking a very fair $300 for them. I don't have the box but guaranteed authentic. I paid over $400 even as an employee at the time. 

Lastly, I have a like new, carried a few times SureFire Delta Knife. I have the box somewhere but honestly, in moving, I don't know exactly where it is and I haven't even begun to unpack my new house. I'm also asking a very fair $300. It's a great knife but she has to go to help out with the lawyer fees. 

So guys, help me out. I don't want the cheating bitch wife to get any of this and the lawyers are already asking for valuables. 

Please do NOT ask me to lower my prices as I won't. I'd rather give these things to my family if I can't sell it so any ""negotiated"" replies will just get deleted. 

I'll do the sunglasses and Knife for $550. 

Thanks for reading guys and hope you can help a brother out.

I have only seen a couple of these in the past but none have the fit any finish this one does. The stainless looks wet anyway you turn the gun. Whoever the gunsmith was that did this one sure went the extra mile with it being one of the early ones. The timing and lock up are just like the day it left S&W. If you know  anything about revolvers you can look at it and tell its been fired very little. Comes with all front sight blades it left S&W with plus certificate and case locking key still in factory envelope all housed in a beautiful Mahogany case that's in mint condition as well. If you know anything about S&W 44s you know the Magna was the most accurate 44 S&W ever made. You want find a nicer Magna.

The oddity of this particular firearm however is that while most GP100s can fire both .38 special and .357 this little gem is specifically for .38 special ONLY. Only two runs of this firearm exist. Earlier serial numbers were part of a cancelled police order that found their way to the civilian market. The newer serial numbers such as this one were made exclusively for a company called Davidson's (galleryofguns.com) and seem to be no longer in production or for sale.

Brand new, these ran for between $500-700 depending on which FFL ordered it for you. This one as you can see was manufactured on March 19, 2013, before it was sent to Davidson's. I purchased it a little over a year ago on August 6, 2014 and have kept it locked up since, entirely unused.

This revolver is in Like-New condition (I don't consider this new as it now has a third party owner). It has never been fired or used outside of the test shot at the factory, the casing of which was included the shipment. There are a couple very minor scuffs on the rubber grip from storage. The original box the revolver came in as well as all of the documents and even advertisements (such as the Manual, Davidson's ad, NRA ad, etc) that came with it, are present. The spent casing from the factory's test shot is present as well. Also included are the original lock and key for the cylinder, and a tiny bronze pin (or punch?) which the purpose of escapes me.

The revolver functions in double action and single action. The trigger can be rather heavy in the former, but in single action it feels like a hair trigger. The balance is impeccable in my opinion. I must stress again, this unique model is for .38 special and .38 special +P ONLY. It CANNOT fire .357 Magnum. However, the frame is exactly the same as the .357 version, the cylinder is the only difference. If you could somehow acquire a .357 gp100 cylinder, they could be switched out as far as I know.

Now, let's talk about what's included in this deal. While I bought the revolver with the intention of using and carrying it, I never did. The ammunition and accessories I bought for it went unused, locked up along with it. Along with the revolver, you will also receive the following:

1x HKS 203M-P Plain Double Speedloader Case, Black, Medium 

2x HKS 586-A Revolver Speedloader for S&W 586, 686, 581, 681/Ruger GP100 

1x Outbags OB-09SC Nylon OWB Belt Gun Holster for Ruger GP100 / SP101, Taurus 65 / 66 / 82 / 689 Magn. / Tracker 4"", S&W 66 / 586 / 686, and Most 4"" Revolvers

1x 50 round box of 110 Gr. .38 Special Remington HTP (High Terminal Performance) Semi-Jacketed Hollow Point cartridges.

If you wish to request more information or pictures, you may contact me via email or via this site.

Buyer will be required to provide a non-expired ID, Drivers License, or Concealed Carry Permit and sign a bill of sale (both when we meet). I realize this may be inconvenient, but if you've lived in Hampton Roads long, you know this is a high crime area. I'd prefer to have myself covered if this firearm somehow ends up at a crime scene some day as I am the original purchaser.

$450 (Negotiable to an extent) Cash or United States Postal Money order are they only accepted means of payment. I am not interested in trades of any kind."

There is very little rifling left in this piece, the only matching serial numbers are found on the frame and barrel assembly. The bolt stop is a reproduction as is the stock. The stock is a Chinese reproduction that has been stained and had the hinges replaced. The inner rails are a bit chewd up as is where the bolt stop comes into contact with the barrel assembly.

Dressed in Tapco tan furniture.  Looks absolutely great.  This rifle came in as a trade and I was told that this rifle has very little round count through it.  I verified the rifling through the barrel and it appears crisp & sharp and very clean.  The trigger pull on this beast makes me think that it's a Tapco, however, I do not see any Tapco markings on it.   The trigger breaks clean and has a very good (light) trigger pull to it.  The bolt and all of its internals are remarkable in detail as they are clean and in awesome shape.  With what I was told, I have to believe the round count was very low due to the overall condition of this weapon.

Also in this lot are 4 ""spam cans"" of 5.45x39 ammo.  Each spam can holds 1080 rounds of non-corrosive ammo (4320 rounds total in spam cans).  There is also a bag of loose ammo (5.45x39mm non-corrosive) of at least 600+ rounds bringing up the total round count to @ 5000.  The steel ammo box in this lot will be tossed in as it holds everything quite nicely.

On top of all that there are 8 30-round magazines that are also included.  These magazines are all in great shape.  Some are the bakelite AK74 magazines while others are of a different brand.  All magazines are stippled and function flawlessly.

Asking $1700 (cash) or $1800 (trade) for this whole lot.  Rifle goes for @ $800, the spam cans go @ $220 to $250 each, and the magazines go for another $20 each.  Overall, I would say that what I am asking is way more than fair."

The rest of the rifle is in very, very good shape as well. No rust anywhere. I always cleaned and oiled the gun after every trip out shooting. 

These are really great rifles, the Finns did a fantastic job making the Mosin a better rifle. This one still shoots less than 2 MOA with handloads, and I'm sure the limiting factor is me.
