Weight - 4.9 oz.In August of 1976, Mark Hazen started his career as a custom knife maker. At that time, he could not afford to purchase a custom knife, so he decided to make his own. That's when it all began. Initially, Mark made knives for his friends and eventually, his creative talent was sought after by customers throughout the USA. After 30 years as a renowned knife maker, Mark decided to retire in 2007. On September 23, 2013, he received a call from Colonel Jack Tobin, president of The Special Forces Association at Fort Bragg, NC. While at an estate auction preview, Colonel Tobin saw a knife which he felt would be perfect for Special Forces active duty personnel, as well as the members of the association. Mark came out of retirement and began his journey by making a knife in honor of his fallen friend, MSG Robert Horrigan, a Special Forces Operator stationed at Fort Bragg, NC.Mark Hazen, who mastered the art of knife making over the past 30 years, is reintroducing classic old world craftsmanship in new and innovative designs. Each knife is hand made without the use of jigs. The blade and edge geometry has been engineered into each model to ensure optimum performance for its intended use. The ergonomically designed handles are specifically contoured to give a comfortable and confident grip. Each Hazen knife is uniquely crafted and well suited for all military and law enforcement personnel, sportsmen and the discriminating collector.All the knives produced at Hazen Knives go through a 3-phase testing process to ensure that each knife meets uncompromising quality standards. Each batch of steel is tested since all are not exactly the same. One knife is made from each new batch and is rigorously tested by chopping through a 2X4 piece of lumber and cleanly slicing through a piece of 20 lb. paper. If the hardness and edge retention meet the standards of phase one, the cutting test, then the testing continues to phase two, the comfort test and phase three, the fit and finish test.Come check this knife out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte. Give me a call @ 980-237-eight9eight1 if you have any questions. Shipping can be arranged for $10.

ENHANCED CARRY TRIGGER SYSTEM

The TRAVIS HALEY SKIMMER ENHANCED CARRY TRIGGER SYSTEM gives your Glock the performance of a stock 1911. Manufactured using 100% OEM parts, all of the metal components are individually hand polished to a mirror finish for consistent, reliable action. The mated surfaces glide freely, adding a smooth short transition into a predictable wall. The trigger break is crisp and clean, reducing muzzle movement. This is made possible by our unique pre-travel reduction modification, which is non-adjustable. Multiple inspection points are part of the production process. This system is completely drop-in with no fitting required.

For Carry Use

All metal components are hand polished to a mirror finish.

Includes:
Smooth Trigger w/ Trigger Bar / OEM / Modified to Reduce Pre-Travel & polished
Trigger Housing w/ Ejector / OEM polished
Minus Connector / Optional 5.5 lb. standard connector / OEM polished
Trigger Spring / OEM polished

Weight - 6.1 oz.In August of 1976, Mark Hazen started his career as a custom knife maker. At that time, he could not afford to purchase a custom knife, so he decided to make his own. That's when it all began. Initially, Mark made knives for his friends and eventually, his creative talent was sought after by customers throughout the USA. After 30 years as a renowned knife maker, Mark decided to retire in 2007. On September 23, 2013, he received a call from Colonel Jack Tobin, president of The Special Forces Association at Fort Bragg, NC. While at an estate auction preview, Colonel Tobin saw a knife which he felt would be perfect for Special Forces active duty personnel, as well as the members of the association. Mark came out of retirement and began his journey by making a knife in honor of his fallen friend, MSG Robert Horrigan, a Special Forces Operator stationed at Fort Bragg, NC.Mark Hazen, who mastered the art of knife making over the past 30 years, is reintroducing classic old world craftsmanship in new and innovative designs. Each knife is hand made without the use of jigs. The blade and edge geometry has been engineered into each model to ensure optimum performance for its intended use. The ergonomically designed handles are specifically contoured to give a comfortable and confident grip. Each Hazen knife is uniquely crafted and well suited for all military and law enforcement personnel, sportsmen and the discriminating collector.All the knives produced at Hazen Knives go through a 3-phase testing process to ensure that each knife meets uncompromising quality standards. Each batch of steel is tested since all are not exactly the same. One knife is made from each new batch and is rigorously tested by chopping through a 2X4 piece of lumber and cleanly slicing through a piece of 20 lb. paper. If the hardness and edge retention meet the standards of phase one, the cutting test, then the testing continues to phase two, the comfort test and phase three, the fit and finish test.Come check this knife out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte. Give me a call @ 980-237-eight9eight1 if you have any questions. Shipping can be arranged for $10.

Excellent condition rifle. Only been to the range twice and it works fine.

Buyer may have the original black MOE stock or the FDE ACS stock. Also, upon getting the rifle (received it about 4 weeks ago), I immediately obtained a 12” handguard (see pic) from PWS. It took 2 oz. off the top end. The rifle swings much easier now! I think it is a huge improvement. Of course the buyer gets the original 15” handguard. Also, its the newest model so no need to ask that.

The price is very fair and much lower than the retail price of $2300 for that NIB cool status, but why not save about $750? If you want to know why I'm only asking for $1550 for a rifle that costs $2300+ brand new, well, a local gun store said they'd only give me $1100 and expect to sell it for $1500-$1650. Again, if you wonder why it's not listed at 1800 or 1900, than please understand that selling this rifle sooner rather than later is preferable to making just a couple hundred more dollars.

Call with your questions if you're really interested. Phone number is REDACTED; Most weekends I'm available anytime for a call, during the week please call at 1130-1pm (EST) or 5pm - 10pm.

Buyer pays for shipping if it has to be mailed to an FFL. For a long gun, anyone can ship a rifle to another FFL so long as there is a copy of their FFL and my driver's license in the box. However, I know a local gun dealer who says he'd mail it for me if that makes you feel better. I will take paypal or money orders for a non-local purchase. I'd ask for 20 cents as test (if using paypal). For a local purchase, my preference is also that the buyer meets at a local gun store and covers transfer costs. That is pretty much the fairest and safest way to do this. 

Lastly, this listing is for sale. I need the money. I also have a Armalite AR10b Super SASS for sale. If a buyer wants to purchase both as a pair, there will be a discount."

I got these in a recent trade and own nothing that uses this calibur.
Many of the rounds have some green waxy stuff on them. Was told they had been (improperly) stored loose for many years and some manner of cleaning solution had unknowingly spilled and caked on them, The green stuff easily scrapes off with a fingernail. The twelve rounds lying down in the case are reloaded rounds, the bullets apparently were not fitted in as far as they should have been as they stand to tall to fit in the case normally, those should be fine if used with a bolt action rifle, but wouldn't advise trying to use them in a clip-fed rifle."

This gun is a boss. Ive shot approximately 500-600 rounds through it before I had it tricked out.

This setup includes the gun, soft case and hard case, also 150 rounds of American Eagle Ammo that hasn't been opened. There are 3 total mags, one stock mag and 2 magpul mags, all are 30 rounders and one magpul mag is stippled to add extra texture.

The receiver is engraved with ""Light Twelve"" and with the typical scroll work pattern. You cannot see it in the pics but the barrel bead is still there.

The stocks have never been refinished, all original, and they are somewhat of a reddish hue with very few minor handling marks. The butt stock has the original Browning black butt plate. It has a gold trigger, with the more desired ROUND knob.

No rust, no cracks, no pitting, no repairs, this gun has had a great deal of TLC throughout the years with repeated oiling.

This price is like paying under retail for the gun and getting the laser FREE! Lifetime factory warranty on the Kel-Tec P-3AT and a 3-year warranty on the Crimson Trace laser.The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer.

There has always been conversations about what bullets were good enough for personal protection. Which were too weak, which were hard to shoot as they were too powerful for some people, gun and bullet combinations that don't give you second shot repeatability, etc. etc...For concealed carry you want a pistol that is light, easy to carry, because if it is too cumbersome, it will stay at home and then what good will that do you. I should also say this is about carry guns, not home self defense guns where shotguns and large pistols are just fine. But for something to carry, the .380 is more than sufficient for the protection you need, if loaded with the right ammo. For some proof, I suggest you check out this excellent video on the subject, Ammo Quest .380 Final Wrapup: finding the BEST ammo for a .380ACP pistol"

*****Striker fired*****

Almost NIB Ruger LC9s Pro with less than 100 rounds fired to check function (flawless). Never carried, no wear marks or scratches.

This is the newest striker-fired, “Pro” model which comes without either the manual thumb safety or the magazine disconnect found on the earlier “Standard” model of the LC9s, but with a vastly improved trigger which is much lighter with a shorter pull than the awful trigger on the original, hammer-fired LC9 model. 

I bought this gun a couple of weeks ago but even though it has Talon Grips installed, I have decided that I’d like something a little bigger to fit my hand better (like maybe a Glock 43).  Otherwise it’s an excellent gun.  You’ll especially like the trigger...it’s a sweet shooter and makes me more accurate than I’ve ever been.

It has a very slim profile that makes it excellent for concealed carry.  The LC9s Pro has almost the same small dimensions as a Glock 42 (but it’s a 9mm, not a .380).  It comes in the original factory box with all paperwork, mag with the factory pinkie extension baseplate installed, plus a flat factory baseplate, and lock w/two keys.

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TN driver’s license or permit.

If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.  Cash only please so I can go buy something else.  I’m not really looking for a trade and definitely not low-ball offers.  Thanks!"

Glock did, however, have extensive experience in advanced synthetic polymers, knowledge of which was instrumental in the company's design of the first commercially successful line of pistols with a polymer frame. Glock introduced ferritic nitrocarburizing into the firearms industry as an anti-corrosion surface treatment for metal gun parts.The Glock 23 is a .40 S&W version of the compact Glock 19. It is dimensionally identical to the Glock 19 but is slightly heavier and uses a modified slide, frame, .40 S&W barrel and a standard magazine capacity of 13 rounds. The factory 15-round magazine from the larger Glock 22 will function in the Glock 23. Features:Loaded: 888 G / 31.06 Oz.Trigger Pull: 2.5 Kg / 5.5 Lbs.Trigger Travel: 12.5 Mm / 0.49 In.Barrel Rifling: Right Hand, HexagonalLength Of Twist: 250 Mm / 9.84 In.Standard: 13Optional: 15/22NBIX Nickel Boron Coated Slide And BarrelLength: 185 Mm / 7.28 In.Width: 30.00 Mm / 1.18 In.Length Between Sights: 153 Mm / 6.02 In.Height: 127 Mm / 4.99 In.Barrel Height: 32 Mm / 1.26 In.Barrel Length: 102 Mm / 4.01 In.Unloaded: 670 G / 23.65 Oz.Includes case & three 13 Round Mags"

What i have.
Rossi model 92 in .357 Magnum. SS, 24 inch long octagonal barrel, Brazilian walnut stock.
Gun has 250 rounds down the barrel. Not a scratch on it. I also have Marbles tang sight for it and mounting screws. 
.375 Mag is powerful enough to use for hunting and home defense. Gun has as much of the recoil as 22 Mag. You can shoot it all day long. I'm hitting milk jugs at 75 yards, younger eyes will do much better.
Price is $675.00 for the gun alone or $750.00 for the gun and sight. Rather firm.

Second gun is a Marlin 39a. Not sure how old but it is old. Pre cross bolt safety but it has folding leaf sight. Serial number 1526XXXX.
I would rate it at 85-90% condition. Phenomenal shooter. No scope base and no front sight hood, sorry. 
Price is 575.00 Rather firm.

Third gun is a Benelli Super Nova Tactical.  12 ga. What can i say, it is big, black and it is a Benelli. It goes boom every time you pull the trigger no matter what you feed it with. Tactical sights. Used but in great condition.
Price is $400.00 wit very little wiggle room.

Only way for me to drop prices a bit is to sell all three at the same time. I don't have my camera handy to take pictures of Marlin and Benelli but if you need to see them, i'll make it happen.

I live in Cary, will travel up to an hour drive to meet potential buyer. Face to face only, NC Drivel Licence and bill of sale required. Need to keep it legal. 
Only trade i'm interested in is a good quality AR in .223 caliber.

In great shape with no issues.  Will come with two 7 round magazines.  Has an excellent trigger as most know and this is the Pro model so it doesn't have the hated magazine disconnect or a manual safety.  
 Would consider trades.  I like revolvers in 38 or 357, a lever action rifle in 357, a complete carbine ar15 upper, Kel Tec SU16, 40 caliber handguns, or a pistol caliber carbine in 9mm or 40.  Maybe a large amount of 5.56 or 9mm ammo.  No Kel Tecs or Taurus aside from the SU16 or Kel Tec carbines.  Looking for an even trade, have a move coming up so I can't afford to add anything to it.

If you'd prefer to buy I'll sell for $370, price is pretty firm.

I have a very cool used safe with a combination lock. It is lined with concrete so it is VERY heavy! You will not need to bolt it to the floor, because wherever you put it, that is where it is going to stay.I don't know how heavy it is, but I am guessing in the 1,000 + lbs range. It is a Mosler, has all of the badging, serial number, and a working combination that you can re-set. The outside dimensions are: 25"" deep X 28"" wide X 31"" tall. The inside dimensions are: 17.5"" X 17.5"" X 17.5"". It has a build date of March, 1984. It was used to store money overnight in one of our stores. It would be great as a handgun and/or ammo safe in your garage. The only liability is that it is so damn HEAVY! I can load it into your truck with one of my shop lifts. It is up to you to figure out how to unload it. First $150 cash takes it. It is at my shop and I can give you the address for pick-up on the West side of Indianapolis on Lafayette Road one block south of the Mall, near 38th street."
