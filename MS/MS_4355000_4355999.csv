I have my new, never fired FN PS90 for trade or sale, looking for a few specific things. This weapon is flawless inside and out, as it was an impulse buy while out shopping for another AR, it has sat and not been fired. I have added the FGA Custom Armory low rider rail system, effectively reducing the height of the rail by a full inch, making optics far easier to mount and acquire. This part was 130.00, and I have also purchased an additional 50 round mag. This is the early gen with the sought after trigger pack. Box, papers, two mags, ammo, and all factory parts (maybe the Eotech 522 can be included, depending on the trade.) I have my eye on a few things, but am in no hurry and will not tolerate BS and lowball offers. I remind you that this system has never been shot. 

I don't really feel like selling it, and prefer trading, but I suppose that everything has its price. However, if you make a lowball offer, I will not respond."

All machine work is done on a precision lathe with a single point cuter all center to bore. Both the action and bolt are dial indicated to .0001"" before any work is performed. For this build we used a Shilen match grade chrome barrel with a 1-8 twist rate. The contour is a ""Sendero"" contour which is a light bull barrel. The barrel threads were also single point cut and hand fit to this action. The breech was cut to .0035"" and the headspace was cut to .0015"". This is much tighter than factory specs and will lead to a much more accurate shooter. The barrel was crowned with an 11 degree target crown. I have plenty of pics to share, detachable mag; ect. Rifle is being offered with an HS precision ""sendero"" stock with a BDL trigger guard and the factory trigger adjusted to a crsip 3lbs. with zero creep.

I traded for it from a person who used it as their trap and sporting clay gun, and it is still in great shape(some normal wear for that of a trap gun). Some oxidation on the blueing, but nothin some oil and fine steel wool can't fix(works wonders on rust and blemishes. Trust me). Cash value is $800 OBO (or better offer)(did I mention it's a Benelli?), trade value is $850(all are negotiable). My trade interests vary, but I am open to most firearm related items(ONLY). Multiple guns and cash, multiple guns, one gun of equal value, one gun and cash, or a mix of firearms related items, gun(s) and cash. School's out and trap and sporting clay season is coming up, so this would be the gun for it(and it's a Benelli!). No black powder or bows. Let me know what you have. Worst I can say is no. Located in Oklahoma City, OK. My number is REDACTED. I work nights and wont be able to reply to messages until later in the day/evening.  Thanks for lookin!"

I bought this gun used, through FFL, around 2yrs ago and have put around 350 rounds through it. It has been very reliable and to date I have not had any malfunctions. This gun has a houge slip on finger grove rubber grip that I'm going to say is permanently attached with super glue. It improves the feel of the gun a lot and probably could be removed without damage to gun. Gun shows signs of carry/use, small blemishes here and there. It is a used gun and is priced accordingly, as well as very fairly, imho. Price is firm. This gun is a pleasure to shoot, more comfortable than smaller caliber guns of similar size that I have shot in the past. I will sell through FFL or signed bill of sale (with drivers license) , your choice, but buyer is responsible for any transfer costs).

In the mid-1950’s during the first years of production of the Single Six line, Bill Ruger himself started a program to create a beautiful fully-engraved keepsake Single Six pistol; a pistol ...""carefully chosen to represent the very best tradional style in this gun-makers art"". This may be the first time a major American firearms company offered a special catalog line of fully engraved pistols making them instantly collectable. In the end only 261 Single Six Factory Engraved Models were ever produced, making them some of the rarest Rugers on the planet. These beautiful pistols were lavishly engraved by Charles H. Jarred (Jerred's personal initial monogram is located on top of the barrel near the front sight and is clearly visible - see picture 4.) They are considered by knowledgeable collectors to be the most desirable of the entire Single Action line of Ruger handguns. This offering features what experts refer to as the ""Standard Pattern Embellishment"" - the traditional hand-cut floral engraving pattern Bill Ruger chose to be the signature engraving imagery on the two tone pistol, which also included fancy premium select walnut wood grips. They are known as Ruger Cat. No. RSSE Factory Engraved - serial number 4494x, 22LR with 5 1/2"" barrel. Our pistol also includes the original ""Golden Eagle"" black mongrammed leatherette presentation display box it came in which features the famous green felt lining complete with all metal appointments and working double latches - this rare box alone is worth $1000 as many were lost or damaged. Seemingly unfired in perfect 97-98% minty condition with only the usual slight cylinder turn line and very minor finish fade on the loading gate mound, muzzle edge and extractor housing tip - all common wear more than likely from sitting undisturbed for decades and rubbing gently inside the felt lined box. They are almost never encountered in better overall condition than this. It's outstanding. No Ruger collection is complete without this one. Don't miss this unique opportunity to own one of the rarest and most desirable firearms in the world. It's an American original that will never be seen again. And being nearly 60 years old, of course it is C&R eligible. WHAT YOU SEE is that which you will receive. Please ask all questions you may have before bidding. All Sales are final. Buyer MUST send an FFL/C&R, it is required to complete the sale. No sales to CA, NY, MA, NJ, CT or where prohibited to own. Shipping with or without insurance will be determined by the buyer. (Standard USPS Priority mail non-insured is approx. $25. USPS Priority Mail insured up to a maximum of $5000 will be approximately $86. Fedex or UPS 2nd day insured up to $5000 will be approx. $120.) There will be an extra $50 charge on top of everything if your FFL dealer insists on having my 01 FFL dealer send it to him - rather than receiving it from me directly. Good luck."

*Crimson Trace 431 LaserGuard-- To be clear, this is the ""instinctive activation"" model on which CT built their reputation, not their new low-end ""Defender"" model or a Lasermax, both of which require you to lose your firing grip to manually turn on/ off.  This is fine at the range, but who wants to have to mess with little buttons in a self defense situation?  With the 431 you just assume normal firing grip and it turns on, loosen  your grip and it turns off.

 For sale - Colt, Anaconda, 44 magnum, 4 inch, revolver. The Colt is in very good condition. It is not a collector but a shooter. That's the reason I searched high and low for a while to find this one. It's in really nice, aged, condition with the signs of it being a carry/shooter. No dings, dents, major scrapes or issues that I could tell. When I got it I shot a box of 44 magnum through it and it shot and handled extremely well. I then cleaned it very well and put it in the safe. A really nice shooter. The Colt comes alone, with no case or papers.

 I am at work so I can take some photos and send it later if desired. These 4 inch Anaconda's are very scarce so I am not going to let it go for anything but my asking price. 

I am asking $1500.00 and would prefer an FFL transfer in the Kent area.

Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.Manufacturer: Beretta Usa Corp.Model: BU9 NanoCaliber: .9mmBarrel: 3.25""Type: Semi-Automatic"

Although official competition rules do not allow scopes, the rifle has a dovetail scope mount if you want to use this rifle for shooting other targets or just for fun."

Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.Manufacturer: Beretta Usa Corp.Model: BU9 NanoCaliber: .9mmBarrel: 3.25""Type: Semi-Automatic"

Cane guns are often referred to as ""poacher's guns"", but were far out of the price range of common poachers, and were commonly carried by gentlemen to use on wild game of opportunity.[1] Cane guns now are very rare to find and are mostly in the hands of private collectors and museums. Cane guns are usually fitted to fire large handgun type cartridges which is perfect for low pressure conditions of normal guns and excel in the high pressure conditions of a cane gun, with each cane gun holding a single cartridge, usually a high power type.

This is a full size real cane containing a gun barrel in the cane and a firing mechanism  near the handle. It fires a 38 Special.  It is a sneaky and devastating weapon.

I'll explain my reasoning for the price. 

This is basically a new gun. It is fitted with Ameriglo Spartan Tactical night sights, which are very similar to the Trijicon HD sights (and are manufactured using Trijicon tritium vials), orange large front dot with U tactical rear all with tritium green dots. The sights are 130 new. 

This is a savings of over well 75 bucks if you bought a new gun, paid tax, and installed night sights.
