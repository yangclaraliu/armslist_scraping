The SAM7K PISTOL
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol. This 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K pistol is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. Available with a tactical designed mil. spec. lower handguard with flash light.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7K - 7.62x39mm caliber Pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, and peep rear sight, scope rail. Includes one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. 

FEATURES
• 100% new-production parts and components. 
• Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier and double-hook trigger
• Cold hammer-forged barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology
• Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber

Extremely rare. Excellent 5 Mags. rifle that had a very limited run several years ago. It is essentially an SGL-21 that does not have the rear end conversion. Arsenal Had a very short run with these. I could easily finish the conversion because the rear end conversions are the easiest part but it would only cause the rifle to lose value. Ican include the standard rifle stock that it came with. Instead i put on an original Russian Skeleton stock ($150) and it gives the rifle more of that guerrilla sniper look. Also this comes with 5 original Russian 10 round mags($125). I have the box and papers that have the serial # on them and the Manuel is actually for the SGL-10. You can see it on an earlier posting of this rilfe that i had. I also am selling my Yugo M70b1.

Comes with brand new spring operated firing pin (original floating pins suck.) I have also dremmeled out the upper receiver to make it smoother, also dremmeled the burrs and tweaked the magazines (Need to test but minor tweaking is all that is left). I certainly do not need to sell this, so no low balls. This rifle will also be duracoated for buyer with a Tactical flat black or a gloss Diamond Plate Gray. Or both if that is what is desired (looks pretty bad ass). Scope optional for additional money. Make me an offer. Worst I can say is no."

These guns are awesome, they are basically S&W's version of a Glock 19/23. Has the same slide and striker fire system as their M&P's, with a frame that resembles a glock 19. They have great new textured grips, slide serrations, as well as thumb and forefinger stippling from the factory. They also use the same sights as the M&P's. And APEX makes a trigger kit for them for 21$ shipped! 

Do not confuse these with the crappy SIGMA or SW series, they are not even close to being the same. I bought a .40 and a 9mm version of these SD9's. I shot the .40 and immediately loved it. So I am trying to recoup some of my money on the 9mm!

This is a great deal considering no one around the area has the Compact in stock and can't keep them.  They are $499 + tax at the least when they are.  The price is firm so if you find one new cheaper then buy it!  .  Not really looking to trade at all.  Must be willing to meet close to Burlington or Greensboro area. Must have NC ccw or permit.

It was one of the darkest moments in American history. Disrespectfully uprooted from their ancestral lands, the Cherokee were herded like cattle into open stockades to await their forced westward exodus. So moved and saddened were those who witnessed the Cherokee's unimaginable suffering that their passage is known as the ""Trail of Tears.""  After the horrific forced march westward, the surviving Cherokee
people set to work to rebuild their lives. With perseverance and determination, they succeeded magnificently, and today the Cherokee are the second largest Indian tribe in the United States. ""Morning Tears"" by John Guthrie, a noted Cherokee Artist with many national awards to his credit. His work can be found in private collections and prestigious galleries throughout the United States. Today, America Remembers and the Museum of the Cherokee Indian, Cherokee, N.C., are honored to introduce this handsomely decorated firearm in special remembrance of all those who endured the saddest period in Cherokee history, and a tribute to the spirit and proud legacy of the Cherokee. 
The Cherokee Trail of Tears Tribute Rifle - Right
Right side of the receiver pays tribute to two of the most revered Cherokee leaders - Principal Chief John Ross, one of the Tribe's legendary leaders who carried the records and laws of the Cherokee Nation to the Oklahoma reservation and Stand Watie, who worked to establish the new homeland and later become a Civil War hero, the only Native American General in the Confederate Army. Also featured is a map illustrating the routes the Cherokee traveled across to Oklahoma, along with Sequoyah's translation of the word ""Cherokee."" Additionally, the Cherokee word ""Yunwiya,"" meaning people is featured.

The Cherokee Trail of Tears Tribute Rifle - Left
The left side of the receiver features a portrait of the statesman Sequoyah, whose creation of the Cherokee alphabet led to the remarkable literacy rate of his people. His portrait is flanked by two starkly contrasting scenes in Cherokee history - an image depicting the Cherokee working in the fields they loved and a touching image of the Cherokee moving west to Oklahoma on ""the trail where they cried.""

Cherokee Trail of Tears Tribute; The Tribute's lever, hammer, trigger, barrel bands, and hooded sight are polished and decorated in 24-karat gold. Hand-polished walnut stocks beautifully frame this handsome tribute to an exceptional people."

P2000 SK
Like the slightly larger P2000 model, the P2000 SK (subcompact) combines elements of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with recent technological innovations from HK engineers — only in a smaller, more concealable design.

The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 - 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 - 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.

The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter's hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.

A set of abbreviated ""industry standard"" mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines. Available in 9 mm, .40 S&W.

Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX™-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

Would prefer an older pre transfer bar model by a common manufacturer (H&R, Remington, Savage, Stevens, etc) but will seriously consider other models. Reasonable wear is fine; not interested in a rusted broken project gun.

Would prefer to meet in Sierra Vista. Can go to Benson to meet someone coming from Tuscon. Depending on the deal I might be willing to drive further.

Willing to pay a reasonable price which will of course vary by model and condition. Not interested in paying enough to buy a new pump shotgun.

Let me know what you have and how much you want for it. Thanks for looking."

From the Blackhawk website:

""The Blackhawk SPORTSTER SERPA holster is ideal for casual concealed carry and sporting applications. The SPORTSTER used the same SERPA technology as the Blackhawk CQC holster. The SPORTSTER is constructed of traditional polymer blend material instead of the carbon fiber material found in the CQC holsters. The SPORTSTER comes with a paddle attachment ONLY. The SERPA design is unique and allows you to forget old-fashioned thumb breaks that slow your draw and complicate re-holstering. The patented SERPA lock engages the trigger guard as you holster the pistol and will not let go until you release it. The release is made using your normal drawing motion with the trigger finger beside the holster body. As your trigger finger naturally comes to rest on the SERPA lock's release mechanism simply push the mechanism as you draw the weapon and it releases the gun for a smooth fast draw. No awkward use of a middle finger release or thumb break to interfere with a full combat grip the SERPA lock lets you draw the weapon quickly while establishing a full grip from start to finish. Developed for civilian concealed carry and range use but still has great patented SERPA design. Traditional polymer material construction found in other injection molded holsters. Comes with paddle mount only. Made in the USA."

I am selling my new Tempest Information Processing System (TIPS), also known as SCIF-in-a-box. This system is designed for government agencies and the military and provides broadband EMI/RFI protection to classified equipment and data. It also protects from EMP and HEMP events. TIPS are used extensively at military bases and an array of other government locations as an efficient alternative to conventional SCIFs. 

The TIPS, that I am selling, is a complete system and it consists of the following items:

1) Trusted Systems IPS security container (the biggest and best container offered on the market)
2) ETS-Lindgren Tempest Shielded Enclosure, which fits inside IPS container.

The IPS Container is a Class 5 GSA-approved safe. (Class 5 is the highest level of physical protection as specified under Federal Specification AA-C-2786.) The container is designed and constructed for the protection and operation of classified equipment such as encryption devices, servers, routers, workstations, etc.

The safe is constructed from heavy armored steel. All seems are reinforced and continuously welded.

The safe dimensions, without the caster base, are as follows: 
Heights 61 3/8"", Width 26 7/8"", Depth 60""

With the caster base: Height 69 1/8"", Width 28"", Depth 60 ½""

The weight is 2565 lb

For more information regarding the IPS container, please visit the following page: 

http://www.trustedsys.com/products/ips-containers.html

The safe is equipped with a Kaba-Mas X-09 lock. The X-09 meets the stringent FF-L-2740A United States Government specification. It is one of the very few locks that is approved by the government to secure top secret data and/or equipment. It does not require batteries and supplies itself with power via an internal self-activating power plant when the dial is rotated in either direction. This temper resistant lock cannot be hacked, because the digital information is hidden in the processors' non volatile memory. Also, the X-09 lock features several modes of user access with audit capabilities. 

This is an outtake form an article about safe locks and physical security written by a reputable locksmith: 

Perhaps the most amazing safe lock with which I am familiar is the X-07 and X-09 electronic dial by Kaba Mas Hamilton. This dial exhibits none of the weaknesses associated with mechanical imperfections and loose tolerances present in mechanical locks. They also operate in ways that will completely frustrate both human and robotic brute-force attacks and elegant manipulation techniques. Safes with Kaba Mas electronic locks and adequate steel wall construction are all but impregnable.

For more information about the lock, please visit following link and click on the X-09 Brochure PDF file:

http://www.kaba-mas.com/Kaba-Brand/Products/366458/x-09.html

The IPS armored container is equipped with the Ice Qube sealed high performance cooling system, which uses Air Conditioner / Heat Exchanger that extracts heat (up to 4,000 Btu/Hr), without polluting the interior space with dust, dirt, moisture, smoke, chemicals or other contaminants from outside air. It is operated via a remote control, which allows for closed door operation of the container.

Currently, the air conditioning unit is wired for 220v; however, a Step-Down Power Adapter, 230V to 120V, is available through Trusted Systems.

For more information about the cooling unit, please visit following link:

http://jimdgrayassoc.com/iq2500ts.pdf

The ETS-Lindgren Tempest Shielded Enclosure is the actual container that provides broadband EMI/RFI and EMP/HEMP shielding. It is equipped with a cooling system as well. If physical protection is not required, it can be used without Trusted Systems IPS container

The approximate dimensions are as follows: Height 47"", Width: 32"", Depth: 42"".

The approximate weight is 400 lbs. 

For more information regarding ETS-Lindgren enclosure, please visit following link:

http://www.ets-lindgren.com/pdf/TIPS.pdf

The whole system comes with several accessories which are as follows:

1) Heavy duty base with 6 casters. The caster base is removable, so, if desired, the safe can be bolted to the floor.
2) TRACK50 -- pair of removable service tracks. Qt.1 pair http://www.middleatlantic.com/enclosure/roll/axss.htm
3) TS310 - removable telescoping stand that supports and levels the service tracks Qt.1 - http://www.middleatlantic.com/enclosure/roll/axsr.htm
4) SH-5A-26 - slim racks Qt.3 - http://www.middleatlantic.com/rackac/storage/shelves2.htm
5) Remote control unit for cooling system.

Accessories are new and in the original boxes (except for the caster base - it was shipped on a crate).

Manuals for the safe, lock, and climate control system are included.

The lock also comes with a spare set of screws, screw driver, and a special key with gold plated pins for changing lock combination.


The TIPS is subject to export restrictions. You must be a United States citizen to purchase this safe. Two forms of ID must be presented e.g., a picture ID (such as driver license) and voters registration card.

Even though it is legal to have a full TIPS for personal use, they are not intended to be sold to general public. Therefore, manufacturers such as Trusted Systems and ETS-Lindgren rarely sell such products to civilians. When they make an exception, a buyer is expected to pay $57,000 (that is right-- fifty seven thousand). This price does not include accessories. Those very few people, who are able to purchase them, tend to keep them. Consequently, it is almost impossible to obtain such safes, especially new ones, on the civilian market. 

I am selling my new TIPS for $17,000. If you have knowledge about full TIPS security containers, then you understand what a tremendous deal this is. 

Free delivery to a driveway is available for a local buyer.

Non local buyers must preview the system in person prior to shipping. I will gladly provide you with a complimentary one day stay at any Hilton Family hotel located in Fairfax County.

For trade consideration is my Taurus PT24/7 OSS DS Tactical pistol, chambered in .40SW. It includes the pistol and (2) 15rd magazines. It has a few small holster marks, but in very nice shape with low round count. It sits in my gun safe most of the time. I can't seem to find the original Taurus box, but will include a hard case with it. 

This pistol features a 5.25 slide/barrel, and both a safety & de-cocker. This is a very saught after Taurus pistol, now a discontinued model agrued to be Taurus's best/highest quality pistol produced. 

The only reason I'm considering parting with it, is to try something different (quality pistol) and preferably in 9mm or 45acp. (I would certainly consider a similar Taurus PT24/7 in 9mm.)

I picked these mags up a while ago after looking at all the rave reviews on them. Unfortunately, there was an issue with them seating with some ARs. I have one of those ARs.

Apparently, they work fine with ""Colt spec"" ARs and most others. Problems were supposedly the minority. Do your own homework.  If you know these will work for you, this is a good deal on great mags.  You'll get 3 for the price of 2.

I'd be happy to trade for other mags (PMag, Troy or GI).  Feel free to make an offer!

It has the polychoke which I believe came that way from the factory.  It has seen use, but is in pretty good condition for a 77 year old gun.  I bought this from a co-worker who was moving so I don't know a lot about the history.  I will respond to any questions.  Thanks"
