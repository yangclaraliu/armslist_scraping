-last but not least I have a Taurus pt 140 in 40 cal with the inox matte stainless slide and 3 mags, this one has an issue one of the polymer trigger pin broke on me so the pistol is not currently working but on the upside Taurus has a lifetime warranty that follows the gun not the original purchaser in other words if anything ever happens to a Taurus gun all you do is ship it back to the company and they will fix or replace anything that goes wrong with any of there products so if you are willing to pay shipping and wait a few weeks this a screaming deal on a nice 40cal pistol p.s. Don't take my word for it regarding the warranty look it up online for yourself Taurus will fix anything free all the owner is responsible for is shipping back to the factory asking 135$

The pistol is a semi-auto 45ACP. I have kept it gun in excelent condition. It comes with the original manufactures case, rosewood grips and magazine. In addition, the pistol has a second Chip McCormic 8rd mag with extension for easier reloading and rubber Houge grip seen on the gun. 

Although I can't say for sure how many rounds I've fired through it, I can say it hasn't been many. Approximately 6-7 hundred.  The gun is a dream to shoot. No travel in the trigger what so ever and breaks clean as glass. Comes with the original manufacture Trijicon Night Sights. 

I purchased this gun brand new from Kimber for nearly $1,400. I certainly don't expect that kind of money to come back but considering it's condition you would be wasting you time offering less than $900. I'm only putting this up here cause I want a welder more than this gun. If I can't get what I want for it, I'm happy to keep it. 

Do yourself a favor and go to Kimber's website and take a look a what they have to say about it's features.

Features:  
-Daniel Defense MK18 Rail system (black).  You cannot mount underbarrel flare launchers with this rail system, if you are wondering.
-14.5"" Colt-made barrel.   It is a government profile M4 Heavy barrel for the M4A1 (this barrel will retain zero no matter how hot it gets).  1/7 twist.  Couple hundred rounds through barrel, but still shiny and clean inside, no pitting or scarring.  I will include the Bolt carrier group for the right price, which includes a new Daniel Defense MPI'd bolt.
-Govt-issue M4 upper reciever.
-Extended Low Profile Gas block
-YHM Phantom Flashhider.  One of the best flashhiders I've ever used.  
-Bravo Company extended charging handle.  Lettering on the top is worn, but it functions flawlessly.
-Troy Industries Flip up front and rear sights.  The front sight is HK-style.
-Magpul stubby Foregrip.
-Knights Armament Rail covers, three long, one mid.

As this barrel is 14.5"", it is considered pistol length, however, the YHM flashhider brings the total length to over 16"".  If you wanted to weld it in place, it would be a legal rifle length with a simple easy mod.

I'm asking $450 FIRM for this upper, which I believe is very fair, especially considering the $300 price tag of the rail system, the cost of troy industries flip up sights and a barrel.  I am not interested in trades for handguns, rifles, ammo or ANYTHING except a 16"" dissipator ar upper.  Again, NO TRADES except for a dissipator ar upper.

Thanks for looking, and if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them!"

No hammer to catch on anything, great snubbie size and super light weight (same as the airweight). Do your research, this is a great revolver with great reviews and reliability. 

It does come with original S&W box.

New from Buds - $441 plus you would pay $20 for transfer http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/cPath/21_39_1806/products_id/62622/S%26W+Bodyguard+5RD+38SP+%2BP+1.9%22

5 boxes with 190 rounds of different ammo. You can see the pics. Some hollow point, some round and some flat head(ammo break down below with link).
Here is the Hornady self defense ammo, 5 rounds shot - http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/9-7929
$18
PMC ammo, full box - http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/AMM-3195
$18
Mag Tech - 2 boxes of 158 grain bullets (1 lead and 1 flat jacketed) - 15 round used in each box.
Flat - sold out - figure $18 a box - http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/43096
Lead - sold out - figure $18 a box - http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/43067
box of mixed ammo: see below - figure $30 due to all the personal defense ammo
33 hollow points - some double tap (+p), some federal (+P), some winchester.
17 lead head bullets - 1 round is winchester, rest are stamped RP.

That comes out to around $100 in ammo then you would have to add shipping, or buy it at the store for about $140.

Also comes with a holster. Holster is either IWB left handed or OWB and small of back for right hand. Figured around $20 (probably worth more based on the leather) for the holster

So new with the ammo you are looking at $581 to $621.

For that reason I figured around $480 would be a good deal.

Will need to check PTP or PTC and match it with your drivers license.

Can send more pics of pistol and ammo via text or email.

Now that the basics are out of the way.  Up is my Sig556 SWAT Classic.  It was purchased BNIB by me 2 years ago from Stillwater Armory.  It has original Swiss parts which means no adjustable LOP on the stock.  It only folds.  Round count is somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 and has been cleaned every 200 rounds or so.

Elongated quadrail for additional offhand length and railspace. Non-pinned A2 flash hider.

Has the original rear HK-style drum sight and hooded front post.  Popsicle BUI is integrated into the rail beneath the drum.

The only blemish, standard to any used (loved?) 556 is the finish wear immediately behind the ejection port.  It's only cosmetic and if you shoot it, it's going to happen.

Looking for trades primarily but I'm not opposed to selling for the right offer.  I will NOT ship to FFL and will do F2F provided you can legally purchase a firearm in the greater OKC area."

Bought this when the Gen 4 was first released, and it has been a safe king ever since. No scratches, no dings, basically brand new, just test fired (one day at the range, no more than a box of ammo through the pipe) I figured since I'm not using it someone else can get some joy from firing it down range.
