Below is the Sig Sauer description:

The SIG SAUER® P220® defines accuracy – and reliability – in a .45ACP. But many SIG shooters have asked for a P220 with a longer slide, one that would compete head-to-head with other five inch barreled 45's. The result? The first P220 Match prototype went to our testing range where it shot an eight-round group measuring 0.64” at 20 yards. Our engineers after extensive review concluded that this was a good starting point.

The P220 Match Elite adds the most sought after features to the P220 Match - beavertail stainless frame, front strap checkering, adjustable target sights, SIG's innovative Short Reset Trigger (a DA/SA trigger system with a 60% reduction in trigger reset)"

When unlocked, three guide ribs on the bolt sleeve align with the three locking lugs to allow the bolt to slide smoothly. When locked, these three lugs provide massive bolt strength. The A-Bolt II feeds very smoothly because of its unique, patented cartridge depressor that stays in position, independent of the bolt rotation, as the bolt slides gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The bolt face is recessed, completely surrounding the cartridge base. A cocking indicator located at the rear of the bolt offers visual and tactile firing pin status.The 270 WSM fills the void between the .270 Winchester and the .270 Weatherby Magnum. You get the ballistics of the Weatherby without the recoil of the magnum. If you want a gun that is meant to reach out and touch something, this is your rifle. Light use, but like new condition. Private sale (no sales tax/background check) $900.00 oboWilling to trade for comparative .243 rifle."

Very early serial number -- serial number 1016.  There are no digits missing it has a four digit serial number. 

26"" non-ribbed barrel

2 3/4"" inch chamber

Patent date on receiver of 1903. Based on the very early serial number and the patent date I estimate this shotgun was manufactured in late 1903 or early 1904 (there are no record for the guns this early). The first batch of A5s ever manufactured by FN for Browning was 10,000 guns. 

This shotgun has seen a long life of use and careful maintenance and repair and is fully functional.  The receiver was re-blued at some point in the distant past.  It appears like a factory re-bluing and not a home job.   The butt stock and fore grip were also replaced; probably at the same time as the re-bluing.

The barrel is a nice 25 1/4"" (or 28"" from breech to muzzle, and I think the magazine holds 3 or 4. The action is your standard super-strong pump, and works very smoothly. I'm not sure if this was the deluxe model, but the wood is in 100% beautiful in in perfect condition. I believe it's American Walnut, full grain and beautiful, with no dents, dings or damage of any kind. The metal parts are probably in 95% or better, with only a very few blemishes. No rust or corrosion, nor has there ever been. It has your standard safety located behind the trigger, and a brass front bead sight. I believe this is probably a Remington or Mossberg rebranded for Montgomery Ward's Hardware devision (back when MW actually sold stuff that men like!) This was common practice back in the day. There is NO PLASTIC on this shotgun like the new ones... shotguns they sell for cheap at Big 5 and the like have plastic trigger guards, floor plates and furniture/stocks. This gun is all wood and metal, and was probably made in the 1960's or '70's. It must have been a ""safe queen"" most of it's life, as it is in wonderful condition. All in all this is a nice, well-made pump shotgun for a good price. Buyer pays transfer fee; only $25 in south Mt Vernon. C&R FFL license is OK as well. Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

This lightweight, all-metal pistol builds on the trusted P238 platform, delivering accuracy and reliability with duty caliber performance.With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.- Microcompact Frame- Slim and Lightweight 9mm- Single-action Only- Ambidextrous Safety- Sig Lite Night Sights- 7 + 1 round capacity- Stainless slide with black frame/grips"

This includes the complete slide, barrel, and recoil spring. The plastic sights and the recoil spring are essentially new. The internals are the highly desired forged parts that were discontinued nearly ten years ago. The finish is NIB-X, and the serial numbers were removed before the refinishing process. This is legal since your supplied frame is the serialized part designating it as a firearm. This would be perfect for a Glock 19 owner that may like the option of shooting 40s&w since they do not have the option of conversion barrels.

This is a late 90's, Gen 3 slide that came from a police department that went to Glock 22s. They destroyed the old frames and sold off the uppers to a company that refinished them before wholesaling. FTF in or around Chattanooga. I Will listen to trades. I will include one factory 13rd, Glock 23 magazine.

The Sub2000 Gen. 2 is the natural evolution of the folding pistol-caliber-carbine with a few new extras. How do you take a gun that was already solid and make it even better? 

Keeping the form, function, and mechanical action the same, this overhaul focuses on ascetics and ergonomics. Looking at the Gen. 2, the first thing you will notice is that the polymer encasement has been overhauled, trimmed, and textured. Railed surfaces have been added on the top and bottom of the handguard as well as M-lock slots on the sides. 

The front sight has been vastly improved from the first generation. Modeled after an AR-15’s front sight, the Gen. 2 front site is now constructed of metal and is adjustable for windage and elevation. 

The barrel is threaded to 1/2×28 for use with a suppressor. The front sight will need to be removed before a suppressor can be secured the gun. 

The stock of the Gen.2 is also improved, giving the user the option for length-of-pull adjustment, as well as sling mounting surfaces. 

As of now, the Gen.2 will be built in the Glock 17/19/22 pattern, but it will be available with Smith & Wesson M&P, and Springfield Armory XDM pattern magazine wells, too. 

The Sub2000 Gen.2 is a vast improvement over its predecessor and it gives the user a gun that is less of a novelty and more of a real-world option for personal defense. Watch for these innovative guns at your local gun store in the coming months."

Their quality set the bar and they were prime choices for creating a ""Type 3"" style AK by removing the thumbhole stock.

This particular rifle is one of a kind. It has had the lower tang professionally installed so that it can accept Type 3 AK47 furniture. The wood furniture has been nicely refinished and matched to the gun perfectly. If that wasn't enough, this gun is unfired and comes with the numbers matching original box, manual, sling, magazine, and other accessories. The finish is perfect, this AK needs nothing.

If you have doubts about the gun being unfired, just let me send you some pictures of the bolt or the piston head. It's incredible. You will never find another AK47 like this one - with the time and money put into the professional work and the wood, let alone to have a gun from over a decade ago remain flawlessly unfired.

It was an impulse buy for sure. It is a nice little gun but I have no real use for it. I have put exactly 150 rounds through it without any issues. This model does have a threaded barrel though I have never removed the thread protector.

 This Walther has a double action trigger pull of 17 pounds. The single action pull is light and nice but the double is crazy. According to info from walther, "" This is intentional as a safety feature.""

 Trade includes all pictured items: Firearm, 2 10rd Mags, Thread protector wrench, Sight allen wrench, 2 additional sights, Manual and Factory case. The cable lock disappeared somewhere.

 What I am looking for is a side by side 12ga coach gun with external hammers. I would prefer The Century JW2000 or SG1090N. I see them come up at Big 5 once in awhile for around $280 or so and Buds has them for about $270. 

 Finances being what they are this time of year I am hoping to find a straight across trade rather than a cash purchase. The dollar value looks pretty close to me.

 Really prefer a trade but if I have to have a cash number I would say 348.88

 I might be open to other trade possibilities but Really do have my mind set on a 12ga JW2000.

 Just for the hell of it, I also have an interest in the Taurus Judge and Public Defender as a friend with a JW2000 would make that trade if I came up with one of those two. I could perhaps add some ammo or a bit of cash to even the value on that one.

I have a list below of items I am interested in.

 Guess I am open to considering what (Firearm Related) items might be out there so offers can't hurt.

 E-Mail and I will reply as soon as I see it.

 Not interested in trading for Ex-wives, Herb, 72 Pintos or non-firearm related materials.

 I will not Ship this pistol. I will not accept a cashiers check for 5000 to cash and wire 4000 to Nigeria. Really just want to trade for firearm related items only.

 If this ad is still up, I still have this pistol.

I have all that.

Will not spend more than $500 on a USED glock. They're not unicorns in MA anymore, these $800 asking prices are outrageous. I don't care if you put in an apex trigger kit yourself, swap the trigger back and sell it for a normal price, I don't trust your work anyway.

Can trade my gen2 with NiBX slide and barrel towards it if you'd like, it's set up for a trijicon RMR. Slide milled, suppressor height sights. I stippled it myself so its not a show gun, and it has wear on the slide because I actually use it.

I don't want to sell it, but dammit it's Christmas and I need to get gifts.


For sale:

-Charles Daly Hawken w/ a TON of supplies: $600. This gun is essentially new; shot it three times. Comes with sabot rounds, minie balls, cleaning supplies..... it's well worth the $600. This is the perfect hunter's get up.

-CVA Bobcat w/ another TON of supplies: $450. Again, basically new. This one hasn't even been shot yet. Comes with round balls, patches, cleaning supplies, powder measures, and plenty more. Again, well worth the cost. And if you live somewhere rainy and you don't want to take a nice Hawken out to be ruined, this is a perfect hunting gun.

-Pietta Reb Revolver, Snub-Nose, w/ yet more supplies: $300. Brand-new, never-fired. Has sat in a humidity controlled-safe its entire life in my home. Has brass trim and a gorgeous walnut grip. Comes with everything you need to go shooting sans powder. I have shot, caps, cleaning supplies, etc.



Every gun mentioned above comes with its own set of supplies. All you'd need to do is supply powder, and you're ready for the range. I do have powder for sale if you need some, both FFg and FFFg, but only a can of each, so don't wait. I also have plenty of supplies and a few unique items, such as a hand made powder-horn, with handmade sling. Very intricate weave, very cool piece; a conversation-starter at the range every time I go.


Need gifts for Christmas? Nothing says ""I love you"" like a black powder rifle!


Family not into guns? I also have for sale:

-Crossbows(brand new, still in box. Various draw weights)
-Medieval weapons/armor(Brand new)
-Body Armor, Class IV(Direct from factory)
-Warhammer, both 40k and Fantasy(Used but in excellent condition)
-Brand new Google Nexus 7 tablet(includes leather cover, keyboard, and stylus too)
-60-70lbs of MRE's, purchased a year ago. Good until 2025.


I apologize in advance for the low quality pictures; I don't have a smartphone, just a dumb one. If you are serious about buying, I'd be happy to bring my guns into the shop where we have an HD camera, and take much clearer pictures for you. But, seeing is believing, if you're interested you should just come see for yourself. I find people like physically holding the rifles rather than just seeing a picture of them.
Email me with questions. If someone is wanting to purchase my entire black powder collection I will drop the price significantly. I will also consider trades for any Civil War reproduction muskets/rifles, or any modern firearms as well."

Except for this model, the ""Patriot"" line appears to be a knock off of the classic Keltec design. However this .45 pistol is a totally different bird. It is sort of mix of a 1911 and Glock design. Cobra inherited the model after it bought out Republic Arms. It was designed by world famous firearms designer Nehemia Sirkis. Sirkis was a member of the Israeli national shooting team for 20 years and won the Israeli title seven times. He is one of the world's foremost weapons designers. Lightweight and plenty of power make the Patriot an authority on protection. This firearm will get the job done. The .45 Patriot's true double action system offers a vital second strike capability. It's ergonomically shaped, comfortable and concealable.
