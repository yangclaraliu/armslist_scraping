The SR-556 offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

Product Description
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Although this pistol has been fired, it is still in excellent condition and I would imagine someone could easily remove the light powder markings on the cylinder from when it was fired.  This is the way I bought it many years ago, and this is how I am selling it.  I've seen several of these all cleaned up and listed as ""NIB"".  I do not work that way.  This 4"" stainless Colt King Cobra is in excellent condition as is.  If the purchaser wants to have it really cleaned, I'm sure they could have it in the box for show and nobody could tell it has been used any.

Needless to say the Colt 'Snake Guns' are getting rather rare.  By no means am I looking to get top dollar out of this pistol, but I have had it for quite a while and will have no issue keeping it for quite a while more if it does not bring current fair market value.  If you have any questions, just ask.  I apologize that I am no professional photographer, but I believe the pictures give a good representation of the pistol and accessories from Colt.  Purchaser must have proper IN identification and preferably a carry permit.  If it is to be shipped, it must go from my FFL dealer to your FFL dealer at the expense of the buyer.  If you want more pictures emailed to you, just let me know.  Thanks for looking!"

I have an original Colt Single Action Artillery Model. This is one of the later Colt rebuilds. It is stamped D.F.C. for inspector David F. Clark. It has been reblued and does not have the original grips.

Here is the description from the most current blue book:

""Colt SAA Artillery Model refers to U.S. government model SAA revolvers with 5 1/2 in. barrels, which were reworked and refinished between 1895 and 1903. In response to growing dissatisfaction with the stopping power of the newly adopted M1892 .38 LC cal. double action revolvers, the U.S. Ordnance Dept. directed Springfield Armory to collect all remaining quantities of .45 Colt Cavalry revolvers from storage, refurbish if necessary, and shorten the barrels from 7 1/2 in. to 5 1/2 in. The Colt Company refurbished approximately 1,200 of these, while about 16,300 were reconditioned at Springfield Armory. Not all of these were refinished, since many were still new, in unissued condition, and simply had their barrels shortened. During this first re-work period from 1895 to 1896, care was taken to match serial numbered parts, and in some instances, parts were even renumbered to match. After seeing hard use in the Spanish American War and the Philippine Insurrection, approximately 5,294 of these same guns were returned to Colt between 1900 and 1903 for refurbishing. Unfortunately, no attempt was made during this time period to match serial numbers. This shortcut minimized labor and saved the government $1.50 per gun.""

The article from American Rifleman pictured below is from the August 2006 issue, ""I have this old gun.""

Finally, a .22 LR tactical training rifle that looks, feels and handles like its full-size counterpart. The ARX160 is a rimfire version of the ARX100, Beretta’s celebrated .223 Rem tactical rifle. But aside from the caliber, this .22 LR rifle is virtually identical to the centerfire version as far as operations, controls, accessorization and customization options. A training rifle that will never let you down, the ARX160 is an extra-durable piece of gear that will satisfy even the most demanding tactical shooter.


Ambidextrous Controls

A serious training rifle should always mirror the “real thing” in the way its controls work. This is why the ARX160 features ambidextrous two-position safety, magazine release and cocking handle. With this rifle, you can easily train and shoot with either hand dominant and improve your skills without breaking the bank.


Limitless Accessorization, Customization Options

This training rifle is a great base for building the tactical system of your dreams. It comes out of the box with four Picatinny rails: on top, a full rail enables you to easily attach your favorite sighting or optics system, while on either side and on the bottom of the fore-end additional rails let you add other accessories such as tactical lighting. Other customization options include the telescopic folding stock: you can adjust the length of pull at the touch of a button, while the stock can be folded partially or all the way to accommodate most firing situations.



Durable, Easy to Shoot and Maintain

The ARX160 is built to be durable and super-tough, being constructed of superior steel and technopolymer. Its flip-up sights are just like those on the full-caliber rifle—super-light but rugged, and featuring a rear diopter for quick and accurate target acquisition. Maintenance is easy thanks to the simple way in which it comes apart and is reassembled without any tools. Whether you use it on its own as a rimfire tactical rifle, or as a training tool to improve your handling of the full-power counterpart, the ARX160 will always turn heads at the range and will never let you down."

Look on the Alexander Arms website for all the info you need. This is a complete upper that can be put on any AR-15 lower without modification. The upper retails for about $760, the ammo and brass alone is worth about $300. Probably about 50 rounds shot through it. I personally have used it on three different lowers with no problems at all. Furthermore, some experimenting revealed that it will shoot with standard Magpul AR-15 mags. (No promises on that end, though...)
Serious stopping power ready to be swapped out for the current upper on your AR-15, or pick up a complete lower and you're set.

Sorry, no firearm trades. Depending on if/how far I have to travel, I may be able to go as low as $700 cash and a brick of .22lr.

Should be equivalent in value to my trade, about $550-600..some wiggle room depending on what you have.  I probably won't respond to offers that are clearly not of similar value though (e.g., a $250 Mossy won't do it).  

With the .40 you get a kydex holster, 2 mags, 200 rounds of ammunition, Crimson trace laser, mag pouch and mag extension (in case you want to buy a high capacity mag and use instead of the 10 round mags).

Alternatively, I'm still looking to trade for a good quality, large caliber revolver. .44 and up but might consider some .357 types.

A truly fantastic factory build. sub MOA performance from a freefloat barreled action with great style and feel. Everyone who has seen this has begged to borrow it, and we all know how that would play out. Attatched is the screen shot from the online build in February. The actual stock is a slightly different color, it is more of a earth tone. The rifle and scope are in immaculate condition. I have shot this just 5 times in order to test the factory adjusted accuracy and 2lb adjustable trigger. And it is 100% spot on at 100 yds. No adjustments needed. I have the 15 round partial box and 2 full boxes of premium match ammo that will be included. The total for this build was $1,031. I paid extra for the Hogue overmolded aluminium pillar block chassis stock and the 6x18x50 Nikko illuminated retical scope. I will throw in a few surprise extras aswell. This is sure to be someone elses favorite. Simply too much goodness to list here! I will trade for a gas piston AR with adjustable gas block and will add cash to make everything fair or a well built direct impingement AR. Below is the build order.

The underfolding stock locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, the stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it. Stock Pictures Shown."

I have an Eberlestock J51 Warhammer Pack and G1 Little Brother with several accessories for sale.

I spent over $1000 on this setup and have never used it other then putting some things inside. It has never left the house or been outside.

If you don't know about Eberlestock, I suggest you do some research on them. They are the prefered company of choice for special ops and sniper units in the military.

There are several reviews on youtube and the internet that you can read about but these packs are arguably the best packs ever. 

Here is a pretty good review of both packs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMUv-KDK98U

The Pack I have and the combination of accessories is the most modular pack that they offer with several combinations of load outs. These guys are packing 150-200 pounds of gear on their backs with this exact pack.

Attached is a picture of all that is included in my order as well as some stock pics.

Please shoot me an email if you have any questions and include your phone number if you want me to call you back.

Located in South Sarasota.

I will consider all reasonable offers.

It's still brand new and hasn't been fired other than the factory. 

Started off as the Predator version, but I bought a Boyds tactical varmint stock (wood, much like the original mossberg stock) to make into a quick project. I never got around to installing pillars, so that will need to be done if you so desire. I was doing some custom work on the original stock, but didn't turn out the way I planned, so It will not be included with this rifle. Just the Barreled action, and the boyds stock. 

As far as marks, the only marks on the rifle is the handling marks you see in the closeups of the barrel. Nothing crazy, just slight scuffs from changing over the action. 

Will not come with the cheap factory scope base, but I recommend going over to EGW to get one of theirs. A lot better quality. 

Due to what your getting, my price is $450 cash

I'll include the factory 10rd magazine, along with x2 20rd CMI M1A Magazines 

I'm selling to finish my other project builds, I just never had any time to get around to this one. 

Ad has been cross posted, so the first ""I'll take it"" get's it.

Total belt length measures 60"", and from what I've measured, the belt can be adjusted from 50"" to 58"".

As I'm sure you know, this is the same Colt 1911 pistol that the 'United States Marine Corps' ordered from Colt, but then decided that they did not want civilians walking around w/ a pistol w/ USMC markings. They sent Colt Firearms a 'cease & desist' letter which halted production of these guns. Colt continued producing this 1911 without the USMC roll-mark, which in turn made the pistols WITH the USMC roll mark highly collectible! This is one of the original pistols that has the USMC roll mark, as well as the desirable Pelican Case. This USMC marked pistols will most certainly continue to appreciate in value, so DO NOT hesitate or she will be gone!"

This rifle is chambered in 5.56 nato. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. Payment can be made with Postal Money Order. Shipping charges are extra to Alaska or Hawaii."

Made in the good ole U.S. of A. By IntraTec Arms. Its a very good condition fires well submachine gun.. (uzi) in other words.. SSemi-Automatic very low Serial Number on this piece which tells me its the (Pre-Ban) model D.C.10 .includes many options from factory that many other TEC9s and TEC22s do not have. In such case a optional Heat Shield, 32 rd. Magazine, Iron Sights and Handles (for strap). The IntraTec 9mm is also equpit with a threaded barrel big plus because these arms are getting to be rare and hard to find.. TEC discontinued IntraTec Arms in 1994 and this piece is a firearm of History ( although not a good one) within 6-7 years this weapon was known as your pit bulls today.. Giving it a bad name and banning it altogether.. Anyways back to the Luger produced in Miami. Florida she is Mil-Tech not stamped. Has a small rail with red laser on heat shield (not drilled) whew lol. Located on the heat shield is one iron Handel for a gun strap beside the front iron sight. On the back end of the upper is the other rear iron sight beside (lower) iron handle for strap.. The whole entire upper bolt is original Black Matte Finish lower reciever is Black polymer no cracks breaks or signs of drying and corrosion.. The firearm has been used but overall in good condition.. I do believe this weaponis a closed bolt system that fires and clip recycled well.. gun does pull either left to right or vice vversa; but it is a bad bad repeat BAD piece of Americans History.. again Low Serial well maintained in good working condition."

Up for trade is an awesome arsenal sgl21. It's in good shape (I would rate 90%). There are a few marks but over all very very clean. For the enthusiast/collector my rifle has an earlier legion stamped rifle. For most this won't mean anything but from a collector stand point this is more sought after.  Has seen around 500rds. Super smooth trigger. A very nice rifle. Being these are rapidly gaining popularity because these Russian aks are longer being imported, I figured I would see if I can turn it into something else I have been looking for. I'm looking for around $1200 in value out of it. If you look for these rifles for sale gunbroker is about the only place around to find them and they are asking much much more than that for them. 

I'll also take a a quality ar15 factory build. Bcm, spikes, colt, etc. no palmetto state armory guns or frankenbuilds. 

Other quality ak in 7.62 or 5.45 plus cash. (Mak90 an $400 cash)
