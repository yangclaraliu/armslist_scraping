I purchased this gun new and used it for waterfowl, turkeys and trap league.  It patterns well and is THE SOFTEST shooting 12 gauge I've ever pulled the trigger on, owing to its gas operation.  It proved its metal in the snow geese fields of South Dakota.  4 boxes of 3-1/2's in a single day and my shoulder didn't feel any worse for the wear.  At one point there were Benelli SBE's on both sides of me simultaneously being field stripped because they had become single-shots.  The Franchi was the only gun to last the week without failure.

This is the real deal. This scope is no longer offered by Leupold. New, this optic cost me $1879.00 from Optics planet.  I do realize it is no longer new, hints the price drop. $875.00 is a very fair deal, probably too fair, but that is my bottom dollar cash price. As far as trade value goes, I'm still holding at $1100.00-$1000.00 trade value.  This is your chance to own the same exact optic the U.S. Army uses in their MK24 Sniper System. As far as trades that I'm looking for, I love S&W revolvers, Ruger Security Six's(with both cylinders preferred), quality 1911's, and other quality handguns.  As far as long guns that I'm interested in trading for, I'd love to add another M1A or M14 to the collection, or possibly another AR platform, but I don't want your Custom pieced together AR, only stock models will be considered. Other quality long guns will be considered as well.  The specs for the optic can be found below, and I have every turrett cap; 308, 30-06, .556/223 and 300win, the original box, paperwork and sunshade that came with the optic new. All low ball offers will be ignored. Thanks for looking and God Bless!

All parts were milled not stamped. The entire rifle is numbers matching including the stock. Does not come with a bayonet but does have the factory style sling. It has the bent bolt. The over all condition is next to pristine. Bore is like a mirror. Only issue is a very small sliver of wood is missing where the stock meets the butt plate. Very smooth action and shoots great. As far as accuracy goes this rifle is a 100% tack driver. Serious inquires only and must meet in Hardin County. REDACTED I will add pictures later. I can send pics for now to those interested. The price is firm. I've seen M48's in worse shape sell for close to what I'm asking.

All parts were milled not stamped. The entire rifle is numbers matching including the stock. Does not come with a bayonet but does have the factory style sling. It has the bent bolt. The over all condition is next to pristine. Bore is like a mirror. Only issue is a very small sliver of wood is missing where the stock meets the butt plate. Very smooth action and shoots great. As far as accuracy goes this rifle is a 100% tack driver. Serious inquires only and must meet in Hardin County. REDACTED I will add pictures later. I can send pics for now to those interested. The price is firm.

This is not the new, less expensive direct gas version; this is the full featured piston drive model that will stay nice and clean. Quick, scoop this up before election season rolls in and jacks up all the prices! MSRP for this rifle was $3194.43.The rifle is in nice shape and shoots sub-MOA with factory ammo. You heard right, this is a proven shooter, so less risky than buying new (if you can find one). It is chambered in the very flat shooting .243 Winchester caliber, and has about 300 rounds through it. It has typical wear for that round count, with some wear around the ejection port and some polishing on the bolt carrier. Otherwise this thing is pristine.Standard equipment on this rifle are a POF 4lb single stage match trigger with anti-walk, anti-roll pins; nickel-boron coated bolt carrier assembly; multi-postion gas piston system adjusts for standard, suppressed, or bolt action fire and back again with a simple 90 degree turn of the knob; chrome-moly 20"" barrel: flat-top upper assembly with Magpul free-float, Hunter fore-end; billet lower with winter trigger guard; Magpul grip with storage; effective and attractive muzzle brake, Magpul adjustable buttstock; hard shell case; basically everything that's cool.Optional stuff included for this includes: 4-16 x 50 Pentax Gameseeker rifle scope with precision-plex BDC reticle, mounted with Burris Zee rings; lightweight 6-7"" bipod; extra Magpul module rail on the fore-end with a sling mounting ring on it; and a Magpul angled vertical grip.Due to current laws here, I will not be including the Magpul 20 round magazine that came with the rifle, but I will include a 10 round steel mag to get you started. Also included are a set of Lee reloading dies, Hornady LnL length bushing, Lee trim gauge and shellholder, RCBS small base sizing die, a couple hundred rounds of clean brass (some primed); some once fired brass, uncleaned and unprocessed; almost 400 87gr Hornady V-Max bullets; 200 Berger 95gr classic Hunter bullets; a few 55gr Nosler Varmageddon bullets; and some 105 A-Max blems.This gun has been very reliable and operates perfectly. I really hate to lose a proven performer, but the wife says I can't hav 2 AR10's.

I am looking to trade for a compact pistol in 9mm or sell them to finance a pistol.

I have a M1 Carbine in .30 carbine.  Its a solid shooter and is a universal that appears to be made after world war two to the Korean war. It is a shooter, not a collectors piece. The stock is in good shape and the barrel is rust free. I put 50 rounds through it. I like its handiness but I need a pistol more right now. Im asking $425. It comes with a sling and two 15 round magazines. It is a great shooter and solid shooter to add to the collection. 

The mosin is russian made and has a stamp that says it made in 1943. It has the original stock and is a solid shooter. I cleaned the cosmoline out and the barrel has no rust. It comes with the bayonet, cleaning kit, and 20 rounds of 7.62x54R. I  am asking $200. This is a great budget gun that can fill many roles, deer gun, long rangr shooter or .30 cal plinker. A grwt idea to pick this up before prices go even higher. Ammo is still available for around 20 cents a round.

Up for sale/trade is my Springfield XDm 3.8c 45acp, comes with all the manufacturer goodies including the 9rd mag and 13rd mag, interchangeable back straps, case, paddle holster, speed loader, mag holster, lock etc. Also comes with N82 Professional holster (these holsters rock check them out!).

I've put about 300rds through it, carried it for a few months, and decided it's just too wide for my small hands, I can get much tighter groupings with my pocket pistol (Kimber Solo STS) just because it fits my hands better, the inverse is true for my shooting buddies so I'm pretty convinced the problem is me and not the gun. It has a few light scuffs from carry and range time but in all a very clean well maintained pistol.

In trade I'm really looking for a nice 1911 (I know I will very likely have to add cash to the deal and that's fine with me), preferrably something concealable and with a stainless finish, BUT I will hear any reasonable offer, worst I can do is say no right?

I will only deal with Arizona residents holding a valid CCW. Feel free to contact for any questions."

It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

The perfect rifle for someone that doesn't want to wear themselves out lugging around a 7-10 pound AR--it really is amazing how much of a difference a few pounds can make. Its light weight makes it awesome for extended shooting sessions, and pretty hard to beat with the magpul sights that come installed. The rifle is sporting a BCM 15"" Rail, has a nickel-boron coated mil-spec trigger, and a Magpul grip and locking-stock. Has been professionally cerakoted in a gorgeous burnt-bronze color and has had all the lettering blackened to make it stand out. This really is something you won't see anywhere else--and is priced below what it would cost to build a similar one.

Also has a quad rail with rail covers a aftermarket barrel shroud and a aftermarket gas puck and spring with 6 settings instead of 2 like the factory one...the purpose of this is to be able to shoot shells like birdshot without having cycling issues common in these saigas. I've only shot high end double .00 buck shot and slugs out of the gun have never had a chance to shoot it after I installed the gas puck so it has yet to be tested. I also still have the factory gas puck. I bought the aftermarket bolt lock spring which is the cause of another common complaint in these guns but have not had a chance to install it. I bought this gun from a friend who is in the military that bought it brand new did the full conversion and never shot it one time. I have personally ran less then 75 shells through it so the gun is brand new hasn't even been broken in yet I hate to part ways with it but im in need of the money and this is really a last resort. The gun comes with 3 10 round magazines I also have a few boxes of double .00 buck and a few boxes of slugs I'm willing to throw in

The handgun comes with 2 magazines and the original carrying box. It's been running like a beast and shoots like a dream. It's a great gun for someone who's on their market for an inexpensive home defense gun to have on the night stand or in their truck. It has a single action/ double action mechanism and a safety and decocker switch, which allows a bit more comfort if you decide to carry. I can conceal carry this around because I'm a pretty big guy, but it may be a bit noticeable for slimmer guys.

This red dot sight allows faster first-shot target acquisition and follow-up shots. The RMR helps those with aging eyes to enjoy handgun shooting again or just be more proficient in their shooting. Attention to detail starts with the one piece machined steel magwell/mainspring housing for quick and sure reloading of the Shadow Hawk. You will notice the chiseled look and feel of the black flat faced trigger preferred by competition shooters. The gun is topped front and rear with Trijicon Tall Tritium Night Sights. The rear sight is integral to the base plate used to mount the RMR. This one piece unit is built for sturdiness and durability. An advantage of these sights is that a suppressor can be used effectively without having to change out to other sights, as long as you have specified the threaded barrel option. They will co-witness with or without a suppressor attached. Your hands will quickly notice the high undercut on the trigger guard along with 25 LPI checkering on the front strap. The high beaver tail will amaze you with the almost seamless fit and finish. Spiral cut black and gray G10 grips add a subtle highlight to the black nitrite finish. The stainless bushing contrasts nicely with the slide and frame. The aggressive cocking serrations are not just for looks but provide a sure purchase to rack the slide. Finally, leaving nothing to chance, we have beveled and recessed the slide stop to allow for the addition of Crimson Trace Laser Grips if you so choose. One you get the chance to use the Shadow Hawk Government with the amazing Trijicon RMR sight, you'll have a true appreciation for the experience, thought process, and technology that went into this particular pistol.

No box or papers

This particular revolver does not have the ""M"" stamp, indicating that is was never sent back to Smith & Wesson for a recall that was issued in 1985. The recall was to address issues with the hammer nose sticking into the bushing during dry fire. Not all 686's and 686-1's were affected by this problem, but S&W will still honor the recall now almost 30 years later to include free shipping. This pistol does not stick and functions without issue. 

Non-""M"" stamped 686's are highly sought after by collectors, because they are in the original factory configuration.

Also installed on the Glock is the Gactory OEM Glock ext slide catch and a Pearce frame plug. All items were installed by a Certified Glock Armorer (myself). I use to be in the gun business and I have collected Glocks for many years. But now I have decided to make a move out of state to be with my daughters so its time to free up some cash for the move. Ill be listing several of my collector Glocks for sale. Suggested retail on this gun was almost $700. I sold them in the shop at MAP pricing of $549 plus tax and $5 call in fee. I have included right at $100 worth of extras and improvements to this Glock. My asking price is $655 obo. If you research the new OD Glock you will find that they are extremely hard to find anywhere. They were on GunBroker for awhile but Glock guys have been picking them up as fast as they get listed. Please feel free to send me a shout with any questions or some more pics. Im not looking for any trades at this time. Thanks for looking and GOD Bless.

They made a limited run last year of several models and were sold out quickly and now are hard to get because they are not making them anymore. I added an extra mag to fix gun for a total of 3 magazines included. A ghost 3.5lb trigger connector was installed along with a Ghost complete spring kit. Also installed on the Glock is the Gactory OEM Glock ext slide catch and a Pearce frame plug. All items were installed by a Certified Glock Armorer (myself). I use to be in the gun business and I have collected Glocks for many years. But now I have decided to make a move out of state to be with my daughters so its time to free up some cash for the move. Ill be listing several of my collector Glocks for sale. Suggested retail on this gun was almost $700. I sold them in the shop at MAP pricing of $549 plus tax and $5 call in fee. I have included right at $100 worth of extras and improvements to this Glock. My asking price is $655 obo. If you research the new OD Glock you will find that they are extremely hard to find anywhere. They were on GunBroker for awhile but Glock guys have been picking them up as fast as they get listed. Please feel free to send me a shout with any questions or some more pics. Im not looking for any trades at this time. Thanks for looking and GOD Bless.

 Taurus Model 809 Semi Automatic Handgun 9mm 4"" Barrel 17 Rounds Black Checkered Polymer Frame Black Tenifer Finish. The Model 809 was derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.
