Private Sales of Guns in Arizona
Arizona has no law requiring a background check on the purchaser of a firearm when the seller is not a licensed dealer, although no person may knowingly sell or transfer a deadly weapon to a prohibited possessor. All sales are also subject to Arizona’s age restrictions. Arizona has no other laws regulating the manner in which guns are sold. 

Arizona prohibits a person from knowingly possessing a firearm if the person:
•	Has been convicted of a felony or who has been adjudicated delinquent for a felony and whose civil right to possess or carry a firearm has not been restored;
•	Is at the time of possession serving a term of imprisonment in any correctional or detention facility;
•	Is at the time of possession serving a term of probation pursuant to a conviction for a domestic violence offense or a felony offense, parole, community supervision, work furlough, home arrest or release on any other basis;
•	Is an undocumented alien or a nonimmigrant alien traveling with or without documentation in this state for business or pleasure or who is studying in this state and who maintains a foreign residence abroad, subject to certain exceptions;
•	Has been found to constitute a danger to himself or herself or others or to be persistently or acutely disabled or gravely disabled pursuant to court order, and whose right to possess a firearm has not been restored;
•	Has been found incompetent, and not subsequently found competent; or
•	Has been found guilty except insane.

Arizona also prohibits any person who was previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult, from possessing, using or carrying a firearm within ten years from the date of his or her adjudication or release or escape from custody if the person was previously adjudicated for an offense that, if committed as an adult, would constitute:
•	Burglary in the first degree;
•	Burglary in the second degree;
•	Arson;
•	Any felony offense involving the use or threatening exhibition of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument; or
•	A “serious offense.”"

I thought I wanted to invest in an RMR, and ended up not going that route. This gun has seen two or three trips to the range and has a round count under 500. It might only be 300, but 500 is safe. I can add magazines or subtract depending on the offer. These are $700 daily at GT Dist, and I don't know anyone else who is selling them locally. 

I'll include 3 magazines, and one can be the 33 round extended if you prefer that to a 17 rounder. It has an Optimized Duty Sight on the rear which I can leave on or remove - comes with the factory adjustable rear sight, reloading aid, glock lock, backstraps, papers, case, etc. Comes standard with factory 4.5 trigger and Glock factory extended slide release. This is a factory picture. I'll get you a picture if you want, but it looks like a Glock... like every other Glock you've seen. 

Would be willing to consider trades for a Gen 3 Glock 17 plus cash. If you have another trade I can't live without - by all means tell me."

Roughly 1850 of these were important to the usa before the weapons ban. Theres probably four or five for sale from what ive found recently and when you do find them they are beat to hell or don't function or don't have anything with them. 
This spas 12 dates at 1988 by the proofing code. I have the original box, manual, parts list, tag, magazine plug, sling, and hook. The gun has had the safety recall (push botton) and has had the nessasary maintenance, (anything that was rubber from 27 years ago has been replaced with aftermarker or factory parts). This comes with the locking case shown in the picture. 
This gun is practically brand new. Everyone that has seen it usually can't believe the condition and for 1988 it only looks a year or two old. 
I'm the third owner. The original owner never fired it. A friend of mine bought it from him who did fire it, and ive put 20 rounds for a function test. The gun probably has less than 100-150 rounds totally. Text me at 828423829four
 And please don't ask me what my ""bottom dollar is."" I will not respond to your text or email. I'm asking 2,500. Make me an offer and will go from there. If your offer stands near 1500 or below even in a trade, you and I are way off. The quality and shape of this spas is very rare. I've seen this gun go with nothing but the gun and grip (no stock) and in rough condition for 1500-1700.
