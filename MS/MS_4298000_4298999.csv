No 80 percent kits, no stripped lower receivers, no pistol buffer tubes etc.  I am looking for a dedicated lower for putting a dedicated 22LR upper on it.  Poly, off brand, etc is all okay with me.

I have my CCW and am happy to sign a bill of sale.

Please note: I can buy a BRAND NEW PSA (ready to fire) lower all day long for 140 at Palmetto State Armory so don’t come to me with 200 dollars for your poly lower that you spray painted in pink camo then tried to sand off / half melted with paint thinner then used to hammer tent stakes on your last camping trip… be realistic about your prices to avoid wasting anyone's time.

If you do have an AR-15 22LR clone (Colt , 15-22, etc) will entertain offers for those as well.   Functions must mimic an AR not be a look-a-like such as a Mossberg 715.

I put a couple mags through it then it spent a couple years in the closet. When I got it out again I wasn't too keen on the old A2 style and had a new upper put together, along with a few other upgrades. That was a year and a half ago and I've once again shot it once and it's been in the closet ever since. I think it's time for me to sell it to someone who will actually use it rather than tripping over it twice a day while it collects dust. All in all it's had about 150 rounds through it.

As it's currently configured it's got the following:

RRA LAR-15 marked lower with stock parts unless noted
Magpul MOE fixed stock
Magpul MOE pistol grip

RRA Forged A4 upper receiver
Full auto bolt carrier group
Bergara 16"" 5.56 chrome moly nitride finish barrel (mid length gas system)

Yankee Hill 12"" (iirc) free float hand guard with full length rails + the nice end cap
Magpul Gen 2 front and rear flip-up backup iron sights
Vortex Strikefire red/green dot optic and removable 2x magnifier
The Vortex is mounted on an American Defense quick release mount. (I haven't shot it since I got the mount, will need sighting in!)
I'm including 2 steel mags and 3 of the synthetic p-mags, as well as the case that's pictured.

It's a good gun and what little I've shot with it has been fun. There's not much in the way of rifle ranges nearby for me so like I said, It's spent most of the time sitting in the closet taking up space. No sense in keeping it around when I could use the money for other stuff.

I'm located in Rockford. Would rather meet in person here or somewhere not too far away. Must have FOID card and follow all the laws. 

I'm open to reasonable offers but please no lowballing. Not really interested in trades at this time. I have guns just about coming out my ears and don't need any more."

The bead sight would be nothing to fix. It is something else to operate the bolt action lever. You just can't do that with the semiautomatics. With a little work you would have a very very rare gun.Hi Point was actually made by Kessler in Silver Creek, New York. Manufacture was 1951 to a year undetermined. The Kessler Model would be 3OC.

The Glock 23C (C for compensated) combines the time tested Glock 23 40 S&W pistol with a ported barrel, allowing for less muzzle climb and faster follow-up shots. This increasingly rare Glock has been discontinued and finding it in like new condition will be difficult. Bud's Gunshop in Ky no longer stocks them new.

I got this in a trade and it appears to have been fired very little (if at all) and appears to have never been holstered. Born on date is 24 Jul 2013 so the night sights are less than two years old (bright). I bought 3 additional mags for this so it comes with a total of 5. Looking for cash to fund another purchase (already made ). I believe that I am asking a fair price and I am in no hurry to sell so the price is firm guys. Not looking for any trades at this time but if you have a like new handgun (no rifles) of equal value I am willing to consider a trade. Thanks you!

Over $800 invested WITHOUT the ammo, that would easily be another $150. So, well over $900 between the gun, ammo and extras. Grip tape in pics peels right off.

I figured low on everything else not to mention TAX and SHIPPING.

Hey all,
I have available for trade/sale a used AMT Backup 380. This is an awesome little CC pistol that would be great as a deep conceal or for the gal (or guy). I shot this today and it shot flawlessly for me. I would keep this, but I already have a conceal for myself and the gal I bought this for doesn't like the feel of it. 
I would also consider trades for other firearms as well (no BP or 22s). Would really like another Tokarev pistol, 38 snub nose, PF9, DB9, DB9FS, LC9,  Hornady critical defense 22 mag ammo, etc. Just shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to be able to meet up in Norman on this if possible.

A favorite among Benelli shotguns, the Benelli Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability - the kind of reliability that you can count on - your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.
The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The ComforTech system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever."

Newly engineered Omega trigger mechanism improves trigger travel and with the use of fewer parts enhances the service life of this model. However, the main advantage is really easy interchange of decocking lever or manual safety. 
This pistol model can show off its original design and excellent and unerring grip with instant and intuitive target acquisition. Low-lying barrel axis together with the slide backstop on the material of the frame allows keeping perfect control over handgun even at very rapid shots fired one after another. Really extensive practical tests demonstrated not only excellent accuracy and reliability of this new pistol, but also extremely high resistance and durability of all parts of this handgun, which is further enhanced through nitriding of the barrel and slide. 
The CZ 75 P-07 Duty has unlike the overwhelming majority of pistols of the CZ 75 family the barrel locked into the ejection port. Defining the barrel height and its axis centricity is secured by the protrusion located at the rear section of the locking block. The slide handling facilitates eight clean-cut grooves. The original shape of the slide results from bevelling of its upper lateral edges thus facilitating placing and withdrawing the handgun to and from holster. The slide carries sights, the front sight in longitudinal and the rear sight in transverse groove, with the sight radius extension made by elongating the rear sight visual area up to the rear edge of the slide. The integral part of the slide is of course also automatic firing pin block safety. Spent cartridge case extraction is provided by robust extractor placed on the right side of the slide. Ejection of cartridge case or any not discharged cartridge is facilitated by pretty large ejection port. The slide’s recoil spring is made of rectangular profile wire. The Duty model basic disassembly is essentially the same as for the standard CZ 75, so there is no tool necessary. In case of need for more thorough cleaning the trigger and firing mechanism can also be easily and in effect almost completely disassembled. The pistol comes in the following versions: with manual safety, decocking lever and/or decocking lever with manual safety included in the packaging.

•	Tuned Custom Krebs Safety

3) picatinny rail mount
4) 6-24x50 AOE illuminated reticle rangefinder scope
5) scope rings

The aluminum frame is extremely light weight thanks to it being skeletonized and the fore grip is constructed entirely from a very high quality carbon fiber, which further adds to it being super light weight. The foregrip also allows the barrel to be completely free floating, which as you know, increases accuracy. There is no flex in the carbon fiber. The buttstock is full adjustable for cheek weld and length of pull. The rubber pistol grip fills your hand very well. The barrel is 26 inches and has been crowned with a 12"" twist. The barrel is a thick heavy contour barrel. Free shipping for police or former military. Email call or text anytime. My cell is REDACTED. No trades. I will ship it to an FFL near you

the perfect concealed carry 9mm, May 15, 2014


you could not ask for anything more in this handgun category. dimensions and weight are appropriate and the pistol feels well in my smaller hands even with the 13 round magazine(s). shot to the point of aim right out of the box. with the exception of my ""flyers"" keeps most shots from a rest within a 3 inch circle at 15 yards...no malfunctions whatsoever. this gun is a 'keeper'....nothing there that you will not like....i'm ""pumped"" pk

Bersa Thunder keeps up with the Big Boys, July 26, 2013


This semi-auto has everything you would expect on a much larger and much more expensive pistol. I find myself packing this Bersa Thunder instead of my Beretta. The weight factor is considerable and the Bersa is much easier to conceal. I have tried many, many hand guns in my time, and the Bersa Thunder Ultra Compact Pro wins a spot near the top in all categories. Try it and you will be pleasantly surprised.

Fine pistol, January 29, 2013


could probabably write 9mm on a pencil and this gun would shoot it. Bang for the buck? can't beat it. Needs a min 200 round break in, shoots a low untill You get used to the trigger. Then again that's just me

Perfect CCW gun, July 27, 2011


I have fired every thing from russian rounds to the expensive selfdefence rounds and never had a jam so long as it was some what lubed up. Fits perfcictly in the pockets of my BDUs so it can't be seen. Acracey is exolent for a gun with a short barel I have hand no problems hiting soda cans at 25+ feet. It has night doted sites so if you don't have light you can still line up your sites.

Fantastic gun for the price, March 15, 2011


Never had one FTE, FTF, goes bang every time you pull the trigger regardless of ammo. Feels good in the hand and is just the right weight, thickness, etc. If you can get one, do it now-you won't be disappointed.
