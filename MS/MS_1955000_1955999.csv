T/C Omega .50 caliber muzzle loader with black synthetic stock and blued barrel... Also has a Nikon Omega 3-9x40 scope with BDC reticle on it that is made specifically for this gun. 

Getting rid of it because it is taking up space and just have not really gotten into muzzle loader season... I bought it a few years ago and have maybe shot it a total of 8 to 10 times... just enough to sight it in and make sure its still 'on' about once a year.  Has been fairly well cleaned after every time shot. 

However, due to whatever residue that has gotten left behind, the bore is in questionable shape. Everything besides the bore (rest of gun and scope) is 99%.  I do not have any experience with cleaning up guns in this kind of shape, therefore I do not really know what to ask or if it will still be a good shooter.  I have cleaned it up considerably but it still needs some work.  So I encourage you to take a look at it before making any decisions and let me know what you think. 

Because of this, I am willing to let it go pretty cheap. The gun could be cleaned up and be just fine or it might not... like I said, I don't really know.  Kind of a gamble.  I am open to any offers/suggestions for this gun since I do not use it and it has possible issues.  Let me know what you think.  Just to throw a number out there... I was thinking $400 for the gun/scope.  I will sell the scope by itself if you want it for $220 and might even throw in the rings and bases if they work for you. The scope is Like New with all original packaging.

I can get you pictures via email if you are interested. Thanks!"

Lots of other extras,and lots of E.European steel mags.

500 rounds of Wolff lacquered ammo -the old school stuff that doesn't rust,unlike the polymer coated stuff.Also a ammo can full of Golden Tiger.At least 1,000 rounds.

We  (wifey and I) need auto repairs and/or need cash.

I'm putting the cash value around $1200.I know what ammo costs and an early year SAR-1 is NOT a WASR10,so I won't be low balled.This is a no haggle price.

Honestly,I'd rather get the work done then have the cash.

This isn't open for trades because I don't want to get caught up haggling when I need cash to fix the car,but if you are a PROFESSIONAL MECHANIC or,better yet, own a shop, I certainly would consider you doing the car for us -parts,labor and all,no nonsense,in full trade for the rifle.

We need an engine tune up (definitively needs new wires and plugs) on a 2003 Domestic Make (GM) 4 door sedan,a transmission maintenance flush w/filter change,and new shocks -good ones- all round.

Also need new tires -all four- ,goodyears,firestone (no generic crap),And I'll throw in a used .40 bersa minifirestorm that has a galco holster and 2 mags.With ammo.Including a box of decent JHP.(would be nice to be able to get it all done at the same shop).

I will need a contract on the work and a warranty on parts and labor.

For this rifle,I'll also have to ask to see ID,and the rifle needs to be mentioned as the ""payment"" by serial number on the other paperwork (contract and warranty),which we will both sign.

You get to see the gun after we work out a deal at my house,then after the work is done,you get to keep it.I'm not driving to your shop before we make a deal (yes,its that bad lol).

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. 

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun.

282,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1955282,For Sale/Trade:  New Hensoldt Fero Z24 scope w/ claw mount for HK / PTR,"Kenner, Louisiana, United States",$ 700,"Listed On: Sunday, August 11, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a new Hensoldt Fero Z24 scope. It was new when I boughtit many years ago and I just unwrapped it for the second time to photograph it. Still has the tissue paper with the sunshade, which are often lost and not included with surplus kits. The quality of the glass is excellent, as you would expect being made by Zeiss. The scope is marked Hensoldt Wetzlar on top and has text and numbers printed on the bottom.
Markings on sticker on bottom: Fero Z24, a serial number, and 1985, presumably the year of production or inspection. The scope tube diameter is 1.25 diameters at its widest part. The mount appears to be an original HK claw mount, which is marked Schussrichtung on the bottom, to indicate the direction of installation. It fit on a PRT 91 GI that it was test mounted to. PTR rifles are built on tooling purchased from HK, so I would expect that it would fit. I understand that the HK claw mounts were matched to a rifle when they were produced. This link may be informative. link... The claw mounts alone are roughly 300 dollars, so getting a top notch piece of glass and an authentic piece of HK hardware to boot is icing on the cake.

As indicated in the image gallery, this auction includes:

    The case that the scope is issued in, in excellent condition
    The scope itself
    The HK claw mount. Not a cheap knockoff. The knockoffs do not hold zero.
    The orginal cleaning kit with pouch, which includes includes brush. cleaning cloth, and screwdriver for adjusting turrets
    The sunshade, still wrapped in paper. These are often lost and cannot be purchased separately from the scope
    Cheek rest. The PTR/HK needs this to give you a good cheek weld.  A stock with holes in the same place will fit it no nice and tight. 


Open to trades for: Quality AR optics, preferably something that's good for both short range and several hundred meters. Suppressor host guns. Will consider other things, but I don't need shotguns, cheap handguns, or bargain basement ARs"

It comes with everything that it came with. Only thing I don't have is the cardboard box it came in. It will also come with 2 boxes of ammo that I bought when I bought the gun, their is 13 rounds missing out of one box that i shot with this gun. The price is $400 firm! I really don't want to hear I can get this gun on Buds for $289. That price is a sale price, gun comes with no laser you will have to pay shipping, ffl fees, taxes and your not getting the ammo. All of what your getting would tac on $150 to $170 from the cheapest internet price! P.S. Illinois is CCW coming!!!!

Email bharger at dragonmount.com  I'm in West Palm can do local or will ship ffl to ffl for cost   REDUCED FOR QUICK SALE $500.00 


The only trade considered would be for a new Cimarron 1911 polished blue or nickel. Unless you have one don't ask please. You'll only waste your time and mine.



FailZero parts are treated with  EXO Technology , a patented process that transforms a metal surface into a permanently dry-lubricious material that's harder than the substrate itself. It's dry-lubricious properties reduce friction so well, no wet lubrication is ever needed. And, EXO Technology dissipates heat so efficiently, operating parts run cleaner  and  cooler - a great benefit in semi-automatic and automatic weapons.



FailZero parts do require  cleaning , but at far less intervals then standard wet-lube parts. There is no lube to attract and hold grit, create crud and gunk, or thicken up.  FailZero parts will operate until too dirty to function.  Fouling can be brushed away with a steel brush with little effort. A normal cleaning schedule is suggested even with FailZero.



FailZero parts have been  thoroughly tested  by the U.S. Department of Defense, by law enforcement d epartments nationwide, by rigorous internal testing, and by tactical training centers . Much of the test data is proprietary under military secrecy provisions. FailZero parts are currently in use by SWAT teams, security agencies, and by military troops under battlefield conditions. Other EXO treated parts are used in military advanced weapons systems, mortar tubes and components, missile testing systems, and more. And, FailZero parts are guaranteed for life



Unlike films, conventional coatings and applied lubricants, it will never rub off, never flake off, never build up crud. EXO Technology eliminates wet-lubrication failures of critical components, giving you an “active weapon advantage” under all conditions. Proven by DoD tests, SWAT teams, tactical experts.



The patented EXOTM Technology used in FAILZERO upgrades has been thoroughly tested and proven effective by UCT Defense – a division of UCT Coatings and developer of EXO Technology – and by the U.S. Department of Defense. Test results include:



* 50,000 lube-free rounds on AR-15s. * 15,000 lube-free rounds on M9 pistols. * 18,000 lube-free rounds on carbine rifles. * 23,000 lube-free rounds on machine guns.

I have both flip up covers as well as a Kill flash and the riser block for AR platform. 

I can take some pics of it if needed for serious buyers, but will not waste my time if I don't think we can make a deal!

Not interested in shipping so if you cant meet locally don't respond. And if your not sure what AUTHENTIC Aimpoints go do your home work before sending bull crap offers!!!

Just got these rifles on a trade and looking to turn it into cash. There are three Ambush 300AAC made by Daniel Defense, New-in-box, never fired. If you are unfamiliar with the capabilities behind this caliber I suggest you look it up and research it. It is the ultimate tactical cartridge. Included a two stage Geissele SSA trigger. Sweet camo job on these, perfect for hunting. Threaded barrel. If you are not familiar with Daniel Defense they make some of the best AR's out there and are actually located right here in GA!

This is a high performance STANDARD PRESSURE 40 S&W loading, which means it is safe to fire in all 40 S&W firearms that are in normal operating condition.

The light weight 140gr. all copper Barnes bullet will mushroom readily, yet penetrate as deeply as a typical 180gr. JHP style bullet, while generating the low recoil and fast velocities of a light weight projectile. This aids in fast/accurate follow-up shots. Expect roughly 13 to 14 inches of penetration in flesh and bone.

This load utilizes a flash suppressed powder, which gives the shooter an important tactical advantage as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Firing to save your life in the dark is likely if you find yourself forced to fire. Blinding yourself with your own gunfire, after the first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

As always, we have used real world firearms to generate our advertised velocities. We feel the industry wide practice of generating advertised velocities from extra long test barrels is dishonest as the actual customer will not be able to achieve those velocities in real world occurrences, where it matters. With Buffalo Bore ammunition, you’ll get the velocities we advertise, with real over-the-counter firearms."

My father had one, and it was his pride and joy!  Dad died in 1976, and passed the gun down to me.  Unfortunately, in 2004, this gun, along with 15 of my other firearms were stolen, and not one has been recovered so far.  Because I will likely never recover my original collection, I am now attempting to rebuild the collection with near exact replicas of what I one owned.  This particular gun holds extremely sentimental meaning to me for obvious reasons:  It was my beloved father's, and I grew up with it always hanging on the wall; a reminder of my wonderful, now deceased father.

I am now PLEADING with anyone who owns this particular rifle, or knows someone who does, to PLEASE consider selling it to me.  Believe me; I will take extra special care of the rifle should you determine to part with it.  I have cash, and am certainly willing to travel (only within the state of Oregon) ANYWHERE within the state, to do business with you.

Oregon state, private sellers only, please.
