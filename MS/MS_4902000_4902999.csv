Custom long slide for use on any Glock 20, 20SF, 21, or 21SF. Allows you to make use of all the power of a 10mm. This was carried as a sidearm while hunting/backpacking, and has fired approximately 150rds of various types with perfect reliability and great accuracy. The pictures turned out poorly, but there are no scratches/blemished on the slide. Slide is 8.85"" long (same length as 17L) and is machined for .45ACP. 6.06"" KKM barrel allows reliable and safe use of 10mm, but if you wanted to shoot .45 all you would need is a barrel chambered in .45acp. The listed price includes everything above. You will need to provide sights (the ones in the photos are Warren-Sevigney tritium combat sights, I'll leave them on for an additional $110), recoil spring/guide rod (you can drop in your own from your regular G20 or G21 or I'll include one for additional $50), and a striker assembly (you can drop in your own from your regular G20 or G21 or I'll include one for additional $50).

Includes 3 magazines. 
Union Switch & Signal company of Swissvale Pennsylvania, primarily made railroad signaling equipment but received a contract on May 5, 1942 for the manufacture of 200,000 M1911A1 pistols.  The first pistols were accepted by Ordnance inspectors in January 1943, but the company received word that their contract would be canceled, due to a severe drop in requirements for the pistol.  Within a month U.S.&S. had signed a contract to supply carbine parts. On March 8, 1943 the company was officially notified that their contract had been cut back from 200,000 pistols to 30,000 pistols.  However on June 26th, when the contract was nearly complete, and many of the workers had been transferred to Carbine operations, the company received a letter of intent to purchase an additional 25,000 pistols.  The last of the pistols was shipped on November 27, 1943.  55,000 Union Switch and Signal pistols were delivered serial numbered from 1041405 to 1096404 with peak production reaching 650 pistols a day.   

U.S.&S. pistols are the second rarest of the M1911A1s (55,000 produced), only the Singer is rarer (500 produced).  None of the Union Switch & Signal 1911A1s have the crossed cannons ordnance stamp even thought the practice was standardized in late 1942. Also most of the early pistols up through about serial 1060100 received no “P” proof on the slide and frame.  From about 1060100 to about 1082000, the “P” proof was applied, but at the Left edge of the slide where the curved part meets the flat.  This was due to a poorly drawn ordnance drawing showing the placement of the proof.  From about 1082000 to the end of production, the “P” was placed in its normal location on the top of the slide (center in front of rear sight).  When the ""P"" proof mark is found it will be on both the slide and receiver and be of the same size. Notice the ""P"" proof stamp is smaller then Colts but still an uppercase letter.
The number of different machining operations performed by US&S on the parts for the pistol, was 600. These required the services of 658 different machines; 421 types of cutting and drilling tools; 239 different fixtures, and 447 different gages. While the Government owned the machines, gages and fixtures, US&S provided its own perishable tools. The receiver for each pistol underwent 106 individual operations, during which some four fifths of its weight was machined from the original forging.

Another interesting fact is the development of the US&S firing range, the design of which was later adopted by various pistol manufacturers including Colt. On the range each of the 55,000 pistols produced was test fired 21 times. Not a single pistol manufactured and assembled by US&S was rejected by the resident ordnance department inspector, of the 55,000 pistols fired by the US&S inspector before being passed to the Government Inspector, only two failed in one test. They were found to be completely automatic in action, firing seven shots with one trigger pull. US&S was consistently rated high in tests for Interchangeability of parts.  The test was conducted once a month, the four producers of the pistol being required to send six pistols each to the key inspectors of the small arms pistol industry integration committee. The pistols were taken apart, the parts scrambled, and the 24 pistols re-assembled.

It is reported that Union Switch & Signal produced high quality pistols and did not experience the extreme production problems that Remington Rand and Ithaca had. The ordinance department reported the Union Switch & Signal pistols had a superior finish and consistently rated high in the interchangeability tests. According to the Springfield Research database a lot of these pistols were shipped to the Navy and the OSS.

This early example has the P on both the slide and receiver which is unusual. It was not acceptable for one reason or another and sent to the Salvage Crib to correct the malfunction.  This happened to many pistols, and is only noticeable on this one because of the late date of adopting the P.  There were so many, for example Ithaca sometimes had 10% or more, they became backlogged and often took several weeks or longer to get repaired depending on the severity of the problem.  By the time this pistol was submitted or resubmitted for acceptance the P proof mark had been adopted.  This pistol is a very collectible oddity .

The pistol was purchased new in August, but is now up for sale as I'm looking to downsize to fund an AR project. ~400 flawless rounds through the gun; It has never had a failure of any kind. I have only used factory new ammunition from Federal, Speer, and Winchester through the weapon. It feeds 124g standard pressure Gold Dots perfectly. The holster has actually never been worn; I only have it for keeping the weapon holstered in the safe. The 3 mags are genuine Ruger and were purchased new when I bought the SR9E in August. 

Once you inspect it you will see it is in excellent condition for a lightly used handgun. I don't think you will be disappointed. 

For the sale: cash only please. Meet at a FFL. I prefer AS Indoor Pistol Range in Youngwood (very close to PA turnpike); if you would like to make other arrangements please let me know, however this sale will only be performed at an FFL for a legal transfer. Buyer responsible for FFL transfer fee/background check. Price is firm. Thank you for looking!"

This firearm is amazing, but I have a P229 Legion now that I carry, so the P228 just sits in the safe all day.

I've had her for about 4 years now, and have put about 500 rounds down the pipe. Not sure how many the previous owner shot out of it, but this gun is at least 25 years old so it's definitely had some use. Still shoots perfectly. Dead accurate, and smooth. It's smoother and better shooting than most new guns that come off the line, that's SIG quality for you!

Anyway, when I bought the gun it was cerakoted black, but pretty worn. I decided to get the Cerakote professionally redone by Sergio at GunnWerks, LLC and he did an amazing job, the finish is perfect.

Black and burnt bronze may not be your preferred firearm colours, but getting the slide/controls redone is both cheap and easy if you don't like it. I think it looks amazing. 

This firearm comes with 6 magazines. 2-10 rounders, and 4-13 round magazines. All magazines are SIG factory mags, no cheap aftermarket stuff. 

ALSO comes with Hogue rubber grips, standard factory grips that are on the gun, AND a Safariland ALS holster which is not only extremely comfortable, but it has the ""Advanced Locking System"" which is great.

How much for all of this you may ask? A very nice firearm, 6 mags, two sets of grips, and a holster? 

I'm asking [COLOR=""#008000""]$550[/COLOR] [COLOR=""#008000""]FIRM.[/COLOR]. These W. German SIG's are extremely hard to find, extremely well made, and usually go for a LOT more than what I'm asking, especially with all of the extra stuff.

Not looking for trades at this time, cash only please.

My apologies for the crap photos, the lighting in my house sucks. This is a must see rifle. I am currently taking offers, please text 816716462eight. FOR MORE PICTURES..... PLEASE TEXT."

It is mostly because of the super low felt recoil of it’s high polished ROTATING BARREL. This is not your grandfather’s Glock. EVERY single part is CNC machined and de-burred. NO MIM PARTS !! I am not going to write poems about it. If you do not know about this gun and the brand – it’s probably not for you. For those guys that know Grand Power and K100 MK12– well, you know what you are looking at here ;—) Tenifer slide, stainless CNC-machined body in polymer frame. This is a solid low recoil full frame pistol.

NOTE: Please note that this is not the old MK7 K100 model – it is the latest MK12 version. This video from Sooch00 will tell you how just how special this pistol is:

THIS VIDEO IS WORTH WATCHING even if you are not interested to buy ;—)

This gun (and the 4-4.5lb TRIGGER !!) is really amazing. SUPER accurate and smooth shooting pistol. Just got it last month and the ONLY reason why I am selling it because I just bought Grand Power flagship – the K100 X-Calibur.

Comes with two 15rd magazines and the original box. Excellent – LIKE NEW condition, no scratches or dings of any kind, could EASILY pass for a NEW GUN!! Purchased only last month – less than 200 through. Also comes with 4 exchangeable back straps, fully ambidextrous, 4.5"" barrel, VERY smooth 4-4.5lbs trigger.

MSRP on this gun is $629 + tax. Internet deals are about $100 less, but by the time you pay for shipping, CC charges FFL transfer fees, you are in it for close to 6 bills.

My price is ONLY $475 !! Not interested in any trades or ‘offers’ at this time. Price is FIRM at $475, ....and no –”$450 will not take it”, so please save your or my time. Thanks for your understanding. Only ‘face-to-face cash deals anywhere in greater Tampa Bay area.

This model does have a threaded barrel though I have never removed the thread protector.

This Walther has a double action trigger pull of 17 pounds. The single action pull is light and nice but the double is crazy. According to info from walther, "" This is intentional as a safety feature.""

Trade includes all pictured items: Firearm, 2 10rd Mags, Thread protector wrench, Sight allen wrench, 2 additional sights, Manual and Factory case. The cable lock disappeared somewhere.

What I am looking for is a side by side 12ga coach gun with external hammers. I would prefer The Century JW2000 or SG1090N. I see them come up at Big 5 once in awhile for around $280 or so and Buds has them for about $270. 

Finances being what they are this time of year I am hoping to find a straight across trade rather than a cash purchase. The dollar value looks pretty close to me.

Really prefer a trade but if I have to have a cash number I would say 348.88

I might be open to other trade possibilities but Really do have my mind set on a 12ga JW2000.

Just for the hell of it, I also have an interest in the Taurus Judge and Public Defender as a friend with a JW2000 would make that trade if I came up with one of those two. I could perhaps add some ammo or a bit of cash to even the value on that one.

I like .357 revolvers and derringers as well. 

Guess I am open to considering what (Firearm Related) items might be out there so offers can't hurt.

E-Mail and I will reply as soon as I see it.

Not interested in trading for Ex-wives, Herb, 72 Pintos or non-firearm related materials.

I will not Ship this pistol. I will not accept a cashiers check for 5000 to cash and wire 4000 to Nigeria. Really just want to trade for firearm related items only.

This is for a British model Bar on Band Enfield Rifle. The stock has a hairline crack on the washer's side, but it is still sturdy, and will not compromise anymore. The bore is in average condition, but the rifle is in solid condition, and will be an excellent representative piece of the rifles that were imported by the Confederates for the Civil War early on.

$750 cash $800 trade

Let me start off by saying that I just bought this brand new a few weeks ago.  It is an excellent gun, but I just got an Arsenal AK, so I figured I'd sell this one.
I paid around $800 for everything here, so that's where my trade value will sit.  

Century RAS47 chambered in 7.62x39
-I've put 200 rounds through it
-It has a nitride treated reciever, and lined barrel, which has better corrosion resistance and allows for greater accuracy than chrome lining
-it is %100 American made with brand new parts.  The fit and finish are very nice
-features the new RAK trigger, which is top notch
-has magpul MOE stock and hand guard
-comes with a 30 round pmag, a qd sling mount for the hand guard, a shark style muzzle brake, a 6"" flash hider, the original slant brake and a box.
(I can include a scope mount and a countersniperusa scope for  an additional $300)

You will not be disappointed if you buy this gun.  It has treated me very well.  I just don't need two aks in the same caliber.  It's very accurate for an AK.  Century claims its MOA capable and I believe it.

I have threaded a few of my own barrels, and a few for my friends. One of my friends suggested I offer to do it for other people, so I am going to give it a shot. Providing your barrel can be threaded, I would charge $50 for this service. If you have an unthreaded barrel, like a bull barrel, and you would like to have some threads machined into it, let me know, and I will see if it can be done. The barrel profile will need to have a straight section (non tapered) near the end so that I can chuck it up. The barrel must be removed from the receiver completely before I can do anything with it.  I have only done rifle barrels up to this point, but I don't see why I can't do pistol barrels as well. I have the program for cutting 1/2-28 threads, but if you want some other threads, it shouldn't be any problem to modify the program a little bit. Bull barrels are the easiest to thread.

Gun was purchased by my grandfather in the late 70's.  He carried it for a few years, and it shows some minor wear from those limited periods of use, but it has spent the majority of it's life safely stored in a gun sock in his, and then my, safe.  He replaced the original grips after they were damaged, and they've been lost.  I bought these laminate grips in 2011 to replace the Pachmyers he bought that were oversized and faded.  

The action is in excellent condition, and the pistol works flawlessly.  Very tight lockup. No rust, inside or out. Email for more detailed photos or additional information.
