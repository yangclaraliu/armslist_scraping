Up for trade is a beautiful ruger security six, 4"" heavy barrel stainless version. This revolver comes with the original Box, paperwork, hogue grip and the orginal factory wood grips. From what I can find it was made in 1980. It's in very good shape. I just picked this up in trade an figures I would see if I can find something else I was looking for before I decided to hang onto it. It was part of the personal collection of a local gun store owner. Trades are listed below. If it's hours before Thursday I'll take $500 for it. If not it's going back to trade only. 

Quality bolt rifle in 308, 30-06, possibly .270. No savage axis or ruger Americans please. Prefer wood stocks but will consider synthetic. Rifle must be in new or near new condition.

This revolver has never been fired other than factory as we stand by our assessment of this King Cobra being as good as if you step back in 1997 and bought it from a firearm store. It is 99.5% or better and has absolutely no marks or distractions. Please judge from the pictures and let us know if you would like a picture of any part of this revolver. Comes in original Colt blue box from 1997. This a truly a special King Cobra that will make someone very proud to own and be the center of attention in any collection or at the range. King Cobras like this one don’t come around very often because Colt quit making them a long time ago and people that obtain them are firing them rather than preserving a King cobra like this one.

Since 1959 the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on should they have to punch out over a remote area. Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game."

These rifles are built off VZ 58 parts kits using a brand new american receiver and barrel, and they come with three 30 round magazines, leather sling, and cleaning kit. The VZ 58 series of rifles started in 1958 in Czechoslovakia as a substitute for the Ak 47 rifle, as the Czech military wanted a alternate rifle that better suited their needs. The VZ 58 is a lighter rifle by almost 1 1/2 lbs (even though it is a milled receiver rifle), striker fired fire control group, short stroke gas piston, full open ejection port, lighter aluminum alloy based magazines, and the ability to completely dissassemble the rifle without special tools."

I bought it to run with because it's so small. It can carry a total of 8 shots if you have one chambered. I clip it right on to my jogging shorts and I don't even know it's there. It's not a gun someone should rely on 100% though because it is picky with the .22 ammo it will cycle. The compromise for me was that it's so small I was much more likely to pack it on a daily basis than other cc guns I've had. And even though it's so small it truly feels great in the hand. It's pretty fun as well. I've shot about 100 rounds though it. I bought a clip draw belt clip for it that works amazing. I would recommend clipdraw to anyone. I also have an uncle mikes holser as well. Comes with the original box and manual, 116 rounds of CCI mini mags, 100 rounds of CCI stingers and 20 rounds of CCI  Shotshell. Price is firm. It's a good deal for what it comes with. I would definitely own another in the future. Thanks for looking."

I have a Nodak Spud reciever with an Egyptian Maadi parts kit. Now, first thing first. The front sight is broken and needs to be replaced. With that said I want this thing gone. I can build AR's but dont have the time to learn anything about AK's and quite honestly I don't really care enough about them to want to. I am selling this for a good price and all you have to do is replace the front sight, however you want to do that.

Buy it, fix it then resell it for more than twice what you bought it for. Keep for spare parts, I dont care. I just wanna move on from AK's honestly. 

Asking 400 OR BEST OFFER! I want it gone send me an offer I dont care. Whoever sends the highest offer gets it, i only ask you meet as close to the Fremont/sanduksy area as possible.

Hello Everyone, 
 I have available for trade/sale a used but in great condition Apple Ipad Retina 32gb with Verizon 4G LTE service. This was gently used and has only light use marks. It will come with a new/unused cable and a used (but very rarely) power adapter. As well as a ballistic case and the original box/paperwork. I got this to use briefly as a hotspot provider (and fun tablet) but lately it has just sat on my desk. So I decided I would rather sell it to someone who would actually use it! haha
 I would also consider trades on this. Mostly only interested in firearm trades, (needing a complete 5.56 1:8 twist AR upper), but may consider others. Just shoot em a text at REDACTED or a message on here and we can go from there. Need to meet up in norman on this.

The muzzle brake is awesome, reduces recoil so you can watch your rounds hit through the scope. 

Speaking of scope: the scope is a Vortex Crossfire II 6-18x44 with the Dead Hold BDC reticle. Scope was just purchased in May. 

You'll notice that this action doesn't look like other Axis. The action came from a gunsmith who, as he said, ""got bored at work one day so I worked on the trigger a bit"". And yes, this was a real gunsmith, not Uncle Ted in his garage. I don't know what he did but it breaks clean and crisp! He put a spare 22-250 barrel (hence the stainless) on it and bedded the action into this stock (very comfortable stock!). I bought the rifle from him as a backup for my recent prairie dog trip to North Dakota, but I liked my .204 so much I put 100 rounds through this and left it in the truck. There is no detachable magazine with this. I won't lie, I lost it. You can purchase one and it will fit as the stock has the latch present. I've been using a piece of cardboard to make a shelf and loading it like a single shot. 

Comes with the bipod and sling, and the box the scope came in. Any questions, feel free to ask. I'm not here to screw anyone over. 

No, I WILL NOT SEPARATE THEM. Package deal only. Also, NO TRADES please. I don't mean to yell, just have to put it in big letters so people see it. Please don't read that and think, ""well, maybe he'll want my trade"". No. I won't. Don't ask.
