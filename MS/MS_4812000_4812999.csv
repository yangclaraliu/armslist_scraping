The mount currently has 34mm rings but it can be converted to 30mm by purchasing a set of 30mm rings separately for around $40-$50.  I bought this a few months back with the intentions of using it for a long range rifle project.  However, due to some unforeseen circumstances I have all but abandoned any dreams of finishing that project.  The mount lists for $160 and the upgraded tactical latches ran me another $23 for a total investment of $183.  With that being said, I am interested in trades for certain AR parts of equal value; or I would be willing to do a FTF sale for $125 or shipped for $135."

For your consideration is a blueprinted LEFT HANDED Remington 700 chambered in 280 Ackley Improved. The LH action has been squared and trued center to bore; the inner tenon was opened up .010"" and new threads were single point cut center to bore. The actions lugs have also been squared and trued. The bolt lugs, as well as the bolt nose and face have been trued and squared. All machine work is done on a precision lathe with a single point cuter all center to bore. Both the action and bolt are dial indicated to .0001"" before any work is performed.

 A brand new Shilen, match grade, chrome barrel was used for this custom build. The contour is a #4 (classic sporter contour), 9 twist and finished at 24"". The barrel threads were also single point cut and hand fit to this action. The breech was cut to .0035"" and the headspace was cut to .0015"". This is much tighter than factory specs and will lead to a much more accurate shooter. The barrel was crowned with an 11 degree target crown.  I have plenty of pics to share showing the machine work being completed.

 Once the machine work was completed and the rifle test fired the barreled action was caustic blued but can always be customized to your needs... Maybe add a muzzle brake; cerakote finish; detachable mag; Jewell trigger; custom paint the stock; ect.

 The barreled action in a quality stock will easily shoot 3/4 MOA with factory ammo and is capable of 1/2 MOA or better using hand loaded ammo. I have a few HS precision stocks and a few Bell and Carlson stocks to offer with this build.  Willing to sell just the barreled action for 1300 if you already have a stock and bottom metal.  The barreled action will include the firing pin assembly and factory left handed trigger - I know they are not in the pics but will be included in the barreled action price.  Send a note for more detailed pics.

 I have a few other blueprinted Rem 700s available as well so if you have another caliber in mind send a note... I probably have it or can build it.

 Will ship to your FFL if needed."

I am including an alien gear inside the waistband holster with plastic clips, Glock box, paperwork, and two magazines with cerakoted base plates. This gun was purchased new this past spring for over $650.

The gun has not even been fully broken in yet. It functions flawlessly for me, but when my girlfriend fires it she occasionally limp wrists it. She has noticed a lot of improvement in it as the coating has worn off of the contact points. With a few more rounds through it, it should be just as dependable as any other Glock out there. The company that cerakoted the gun coated a couple of areas that they should not have which is why the friction has caused her to limp wrist it. It will wear right off with use. 

At this time I am not interested in any trades, but feel free to send me offers anyway if you think that they might be appealing or irresistible. I will consider offers for other firearms, gun safes, etc. I will not accept offers that include your old piano, power tools, farm animals, etc.

They are essentially the same gun with a few differences. The Pro 40 had the bead blasted satin stainless slide, where the FNP 40 was all blued. The Browning had a standard mag safety, whereas the FNP did not. She is 100% pristine, as the numerous pics clearly show.

Here is full feature list from Ruger:

The Action is a Steel, 3 lug, 60 degree bolt throw. It has a unique mounting style, which you have to see to understand properly, and again, that is 1800 words alone. It feeds flawlessly and here is the kicker, from just about any mag out there.  You can use an SR25 mag, AICS, M1A, M14, they all work and feed without any modification to the mag well.  Magazines can be another big expense, being able to use the cheaper Magpul mags is great option. Having the ability to use AICS makes you more compatible with others.

One look and you know Xtreme Tactical Rings are all about point-of-aim security and durability. The super-strong yet surprisingly lightweight, six-screw aluminum rings anchor scopes in place on any Picatinny rail or Weaver-style base to deliver unfailing return-to-zero. Available in 1"" and 30mm sizes, a choice of four ring heights accommodates the installation of any sight from red-dots to large objective target scopes. The 1"" height is perfect for all scopes on AR15/M16 flattop receivers, providing proper cheek weld. Designed and built for the rigors of tactical shooting and massive recoil, Xtreme Tactical Rings are not out of place on varmint rifles or big game rifles that may be exposed to the abuses of hard hunting and magnum recoils.

. It is specifically applicable to all M1 Garand, M14 and M1A, BM59 and BM62, Valmet M76 and M78, SIG 510-4 and AMT, FAL, LAR, StG 58, L1A1, SAR 48, SAR 4800, SAR 8, HK91, and other rifles using the 7.62x51mm NATO/.308 Win., .30-06, and similar cartridges. 

Features: 
. Automatic range finding. 
. Automatic compensating reticle crosshair plex to maintain bullet-impact zero. 
. Calibrated for .308 Win., 168-grain bullets at 2600 fps and compensates for bullet-drop from 200 to 550 yards.

Two Spanish gun makers were known for high quality firearms: Astra and Star.  Both were top notch companies making quality arms for the Spanish military and some export.  Unfortunately, the gun makers in Spain who produced inferior quality firearms ruined the reputation of all Spanish gun.  Don't take my word, do your research.  Although the Astra sold in small numbers, many consider the Astra the highest quality of all.  The A70 is a small single action made of steel.  It's robust, accurate, and highly reliable.  This gun has never failed to feed the rounds I fired from it.  The feel of the gun is very comfortable, although definitely not lightweight for its compact size.  I had the combat hammer, trigger and slide refinished in a durable hard coat.   I love the feel of this gun, and is perfect in every way, but I am a lefty and I really needed an ambidextrous safety.

Ammo included is 450 rounds of full metal jacket in 50 round boxes from various manufacturers.  There is 50 rounds of hollow points in a plastic ammo box, and 42 rounds of +P hollow points in another box.

Includes a nylon/fabric holster with a pocket to hold an additional magazine.  

I have two additional new magazines (one in the original wrapper) I will sell separately for $25 each if you want them.

My price is firm and I will not take less than $350 for all of it.  We can meet at an area QT for the transaction.

To buy this gun and ammo you must be 21 years old, a US citizen with no criminal record, and there is no reason why you cannot legally buy this gun.  ID will be required to prove your age.  Thanks

One look and you know Xtreme Tactical Rings are all about point-of-aim security and durability. The super-strong yet surprisingly lightweight, six-screw aluminum rings anchor scopes in place on any Picatinny rail or Weaver-style base to deliver unfailing return-to-zero. Available in 1"" and 30mm sizes, a choice of four ring heights accommodates the installation of any sight from red-dots to large objective target scopes. The 1"" height is perfect for all scopes on AR15/M16 flattop receivers, providing proper cheek weld. Designed and built for the rigors of tactical shooting and massive recoil, Xtreme Tactical Rings are not out of place on varmint rifles or big game rifles that may be exposed to the abuses of hard hunting and magnum recoils.

I just bought this gun and realized I'm going to have more expenses than I thought. I wish I didn't have to sell--it's beautiful, an amazing shooter and perfectly reliable in the rounds I put through it.

I paid over $1100 for this gun at Bud's. So... you're welcome--I covered the costs of the break in period, AND saved you almost $200 on a brand new gun.

Probably looking to do something this weekend, or sooner. NO TRADES, please. 

FTF, in-state CCDW holders only.

Thanks. Happy to answer any questions."
