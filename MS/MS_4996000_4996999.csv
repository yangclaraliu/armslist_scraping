Very nice specimen of a rarely seen Smith & Wesson - Lew Horton 3 inch model 624 and is a .44 Special. On Armslist in South Carolina there are none. Only a a very few United States wide. And I'm only referring to the ones with the 3 inch barrel. If I'm correct, only one 3 incher on Gunbroker. This one is used and has a couple slight handling marks. Date inside grips puts it at 1985. Only a very few thousand of the 3 inch produced. In my 2012 Blue Book of Gun Values, the 3 inch is not even listed. Only the 4 and 6 1/2. Comes with the original Goncalvo Alves grips with the Smith & Wesson Medallions. $875 OBO.  Thanks."

This is an ""ac"" marked gun, also known as a ""cigarette gun"" or ""last ditch gun"" because these were being built as the Americans were nearing the Walther factory so they were being built with little regard to finish or looks, just as long as they functioned so the German soldiers were not without weapons. With that being said, the finish is a little rough, but a unique thing about this gun is that the numbers actually match, most ac variations aren't numbers matching. The bore is bright and shiny and has excellent rifling. Gun appears to be fully functional and although I've never tried firing it I see no reason why it couldn't be fired.  

This also comes with the holster that it was brought back with it. The holster is also authentic and correct for World War II and valued at $90-$120 

I value this package at around $1000 to the right collector. I know its hard to find the right collector... So I'm asking $700 for the gun and holster for a quick sale.

Description

Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic 12841. Designed with input from a distinguished group of current and former professionals, the Patrol Rifle Optic incorporates many never before seen features to maximize this sight's performance within the challenging conditions faced by modern law enforcement. A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 mount for the PRO Optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic's front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches and fingerprints."

Has been very well taken care off (maintained & cleaned regularly) and is in excellent condition! This is a great subcompact pistol that would work well for CC or home defense. Included is the Glock 26 pistol, carrying case, owners manual, lock with keys, 2 backstraps, and 3 10 round magazines, one of which has a Pearce grip extension attached for those with bigger hands.

Patterns great with birdshot, Hornady critical defense rounds, and buckshot. I've never shot .45 LC through it. It has resided in the safe since the second day I bought it. Great for home defense, camping, snakes, and fun at the range. I would like to sell this gun and put the money towards another project.

This is not the cheaper first gen model, this one is going for $930 at the only place I found online that has it in stock before any shipping/FFL fees and $1,000+ in the big box stores, but out of stock there too and there is around $130 in upgrades with mine. This will make a great CCW or OCW for someone, I have a few in 9mm already, so letting this one go and no hurry to move it. 

$850 FIRM in cash or $900+ in trade value. I have an OWB/IWB and IWB only holsters I can add for another $80 cash or $100 in trade value, they retail for $130 and are in like new condition. Please be specific when making an offer as to whether or not you want the holsters or not if it's a trade, if no mention, then I can only assume you do not want the holsters.

I don't need anything, but I may look at trades if it's a good deal, If it's not a good deal, I will politely pass. Mostly interested in semi-autos(AR's-AK's) right now, stripped lower AR-15 and AR-10 lower receivers and mags. Again, if your trade offer is not a good deal on the value, there is no reason to offer it as I will not be interested, just trying to save everyone some time.  May also be open to gold, silver and ammo in the common calibers, any ammo trade would also need to be a really good deal as I have plenty. 

Must be able to own a firearm in TX, ftf in or around Dallas area.

Won't be available long......1983 - Grade 1 - Made in Japan (http://www.browning.com/customerservice/dategun/detail.asp?id=5) Detailed Condition Overview: Light mark/imperfection Not very noticeable about 12-14 inches past the front site. Light roughness on top of receiver, bottom left area. Light wear on stock above and behind feed hole, probably the most noticeable of wear/use of all. Very small imperfection on opposite side of stock. Review of Rifle: This rifle is essentially like a brand new one with a slight memory or two from the few times it has been shot. I love shooting this rifle. Unbelievably smooth and nice sounding. It’s also extremely light and well balanced. Not going to be a burden to bring along. The Browning SA-22 is a timeless firearm from the most famous gun maker that ever lived. The genius of John M. Browning lay in his elegantly simple and straightforward design philosophy. An SA-22 allows you to experience his ingenuity firsthand.

It stands alone as one of the first autoloading rimfires, and one the most desirable rifles ever made. The SA-22 was one of the last of John M. Browning's designs, and his genius shines through in every feature. The slim, stylish forged steel receiver and slender barrel takes down into two compact units without tools. The SA-22's tasteful engraving and select walnut make it an object of lasting beauty and enjoyment. Surely these rifles are meant to be enjoyed in the field as much as they are admired as heirlooms."

* Note: I apologize if I missed any emails, and couldn't reply. Evidently Armslist had some problems (with me) with the emailing system. Or maybe it's just me the unlucky one. For some reason I didn't get the emails from my gun and accessories postings. I've lost some sales, and probably some good trades. Hopefully, this time my email from here works.  Once again, I apologize for some of you that replied to my ads/postings and didn't get any replies. I wasn't ignoring you folks. Cuz I don't want to be ignored myself when I reply to one (or two) of the postings on here. Thank you. And Happy New Year to everyone!"

*********************************************** ************************************************** ******


Late in 2011 Bob Marvel decided that he would train one of our Master Gunsmiths to build one of his most popular custom models. This involved literally months of training and preparation. The time was well spent, and has produced what we consider to be one of the finest and most unique models we have offered to date. This model incorporates several features that are new to the 1911 market, one of which is the new Nighthawk / Marvel Everlast™ Recoil System™. This new recoil system allows a shooter to go at least 10,000 rounds before a spring change is necessary. Felt recoil and muzzle flip are also dramatically reduced. The proprietary barrel system is unique to any we have ever produced. The groups at 50 yards are beyond the capabilities of the average shooter.





Other features include fully adjustable sights that have been recessed into the slide, and are fully dehorned, which allow the shooter to change zero to whatever distance they intend to shoot. As mentioned earlier, this model will only be built under license by Bob Marvel® by our Master Gunsmith that he personally trained to follow his exact specifications. Don’t miss this opportunity to add one of these to your collection. They are destined to become heirlooms in the future.

Well over 2K total invested in the package.

I recently got a XL650 press as a gift from a relative... along with a bunch of extra stuff. Its set up in 45acp and works like a dream!! I have loaded around 150 flawless rounds her and also have processed around 1500 223 brass pieces.

After spending a lot of time loading over the last 7 years, I would like to jump back into a Super 1050. In all honesty, the only reason why is because I have around $2000 in parts for a 1050 sitting on my bench (so something has to go). For me, it just makes sense to jump back to a 1050 due to the amount swaging I do for rifle processing.

I do not need to sell this by any means and I will not separate this.

What I am asking for the below package is: $1600 for a local pickup.

Hoping someone around here is about to order a 650 and I can move this along. Like I said, I know its not the typical ""used"" discount, but its damn near new.

It is a great scope at the range if you want to see what your gun will really do because of how well it tracks.  It has a fine crosshair which makes this not so desirable for hunting in dark woods but great in good light at the range or varmint hunting in open fields.  I liked using this on sub-caliber rifles because there are no ""clicks"" in the windage and elevation adjustments; can be dialed in for those tiny bullets.  It is very sleek and has the right look for some guns.

I have put exactly 180 rounds through it with zero issues. This is a perfectly functioning rifle. I took it out twice and other than that it sits in the corner by the bed.

This AR is an E3 Arms Omega-15 Multi-Cal 5.56 Milled Polymer Lower. Upper is an ESS with a Nickel Boron BCG and an M4 profile 1/7 twist 16"" barrel from SAA. It has the standard grip and birdcage flash hider.

I added the Carbine length alluminium quad rail and the detachable Carry handle with milspec sight and scope rail mount. I also added a rear end plate with sling point.

This AR trade package includes everything shown in the photos. The Rifle, 6 Mags, 340 Rounds total, Detachable Carry Handle Sight with scope rail mount, Flip up rear sight, 12 Rail Covers, Cheap Vertical Foregrip, Universal Combo AR Wrench, Extra heavy duty ejector ring, Cabelas .223/5.56 cleaning kit.

6 full mags, 3 are Pmag 3 are Metal GI  310 Rounds PMC Bronze .223 55gr FMJ BT, 30 Rounds Xtac Green Tip 5.56 62gr in the banded Pmag.

I am more interested in a trade than a sale and figure about $800 is the trade value number for the package. I have no idea on a cash price but will think about it.

Some people are AR people and some are AK people. I really tried to prefer the AR like a good American but I just cant do it.

I would like to trade this AR package for an equivilent AK package. I would prefer a folding stock model, Underfolders are good. I would also like an equivilent amount of accessories and ammo but this can be negotiated.

An AK with folder package is what I am pretty much looking for here but other options would be concidered. I could use a good semi-auto 30-06 like a Remington 740/742 Woodsmaster though they sell used for around 300-450 so we would need to work out the imbalance. I also have been looking for a Century 12ga coach gun with external hammers like the JW2000 but again they retail new from Buds for under 300 so we would have an imbalance there too. Multi Gun trades are a possibility.

Not really looking for handguns at this time. 

Open to other Possibilities so feel free to toss an idea out there but please do not be offended if I am not interested in your firearm related item.

Not interested in trading for Ex-wives, Herb, 72 Pintos or non-firearm related materials. I will not Ship this Rifle. I will not accept a cashiers check for 5000 to cash and wire 4000 to Nigeria. Really just want to trade for firearm related items only.

The rifle is in a monte carlo stock due to the old wood stock being in very terrible shape. The rifle did not have the standard 10 round magazine, so it will come with 4 20 round removable mags. I replaced the original front sight post with a bright, thinner post, but it will have the original with it along with some other colors. The rifle will also come with 85+ stripper clips as well. The finish on the metal is in very good shape and the bore is still nice and bright. I clean my rifles religiously so it is very clean and ready for the next range trip. I've only put 160 rounds through it with no hang ups using even Tula ammo. I'm starting the price under what I paid for everything since I need replacement pistol pretty fast. I can be reached best by email or text at REDACTED. Please no phone calls during the day since I will be at work. Just text me first and I'll let you know when I can speak over the phone.

This pistol is Italian made.

This pistol was custom designed by Beretta to fire the .40 S&W so the slide, springs and buffer are slightly heavier than the Model 96.  Like the 92/96, it is double/single action.  A rail mount and rail cover was added to meet the needs of the two primary markets for the pistol: law enforcement and military special operations.  The pistol was poorly marketed (beginning with the name) and eventually dropped by Beretta.  However, those who know Beretta pistols, know that this Italian made pistol is one of Beretta's finest.

For those new to the .40 S&W, it is a formidable round. Firing the Hornady 155 gr XTP or 180 gr XTP the .40 S&W delivers 479 ft-lb of energy at the muzzle; this matches the energy delivered by the venerable .45 auto and 40% more energy than the 9mm. This is accomplished while keeping felt recoil comparable to the 9mm. This massive increase in energy is why the U.S. military plans to replace the 9mm pistol with .40 S&W.

This BNIB pistol comes in the factory box with two magazines and all factory paperwork; a set of Beretta Thin-Grips is also included.  The pistol has been upgraded to include a steel guide rod.

Wilson. Mr. Wilson identifies this example as the ""Smith & Wesson Magazine Pistol, Pre-Volcanic Pocket Model Identified as the Type 1. Early Variation with Iron Frame and Spurred Trigger guard. Serial No. 136. .31 Caliber with 6 shot magazine, This type 1 was manufactured in 1854, a total of 700 were produced. These pistols were produced in Norwich Connecticut. Mr. Wilson then notarizes every aspect of this exact pistol in the letter he personally wrote and signed. This pistol has a 4"" part octagon/part round barrel. All serial numbers match throughout the whole pistol. The iron side plates are factory engraved, the grips are beautiful. The only issue with the pistol is the messed up screw head on the left side of the frame. That is the only issue with the pistol, other then that, this Volcanic pistol is a fine example of a very scarce pistol. Action works good, lever is a bit loose and does not hold against the frame, fall's down some (see picture). I'm sure it could be tightened up, when displayed, the lever stays exactly where it should, (see picture). Bore is very good for one of these. Overall this is a very fine example of a very rare Factory Engraved Smith & Wesson Volcanic Pistol. I try to describe all of my guns the best and I strive to make the customer happy. I will be listing many rare guns so keep looking. Shipping on this item will be $30 flat. you can mail me for more details..REDACTED"

I have also added Talon Grips ($20).  These can easily be peeled off if you do not want them.  I have also purchased an additional magazine that comes with an extended base plate ($40).  I will also include 2 holsters, a Desantis IWB black leather ($30) and a Remora IWB/Pocket Holster ($40).  

Only reason I'm selling is because I bought this to my first concealed carry firearm and just could not get used to the small size (I'm a bigger guy).  Decided it just wasn't for me.  The gun works perfectly and has never had a single malfunction and I've tried multiple types of ammo.  

Looking to sell or trade.  Open to trade offers, but mainly looking for a 22 pistol to use as a suppressor host.  This gun usually sells for around $400 brand new.  I'm including $230 worth of accessories.
