Ruger Mini 14 Ranch Rifle chambered in .223/5.56. Wood is not perfect, as you can see in the pics, but not abused. The marks on the wood are marks, not cracks. It will come with the sling as well as 1 5rd Ruger factory mag. Gun is in great shape other than the marks on the stock, but is priced to sell. As a freebie I will include 2 30rd aftermarket mags that will not feed properly unless down loaded by a couple of rounds.

Gun is in great shape. It was my first .45 and I just can't stand the way it shoots. Too much recoil and too small for my hands. I'm looking to trade ONLY for a 9mm. I'd like a Glock 26 (yes, I know they are smaller but the recoil is so much less). Maybe a Glock 19. I'd be open to other 9mm pistols also. Maybe a .380 (Bersa Thunder perhaps with cash). I need a good car gun. I'm not interested in any other .45s or .40 cal.

I will sell the gun and all the ammo for $525, firm. I really want to trade so this price is non negotiable, but if you want to buy it I will sell it for that price."

I recently picked this up thinking I'd be able to easily convert it for left-handed use.  Unfortunately, the conversion requires that the rifle be sent back to IWI.  Given the expense of mailing the rifle in and the price of a new bolt that they do install, it’s more economical for me to sell this and buy a left-handed version locally.  

So here’s your chance to get a lightly used Tavor.  I haven’t shot it at all.  The previous owner told me it has roughly 250 – 300 rounds through it.  There is wear towards the rear of the rail where the previous owner mounted an optic.

It comes with its factory box, manual, cleaning kit, and one factory mag.

No trades unless you are local and have a left-handed version of the Tavor in black or olive drab in similar condition.  Unlikely, I know.

I’m in Washington County and would prefer to deal locally.  For a local face to face transfer, proof of Oregon residency is a must.  A current concealed carry permit is preferred.

If shipping is required, the buyer picks up all costs.  If buyer is a person who lives out of state, that individual must have a FFL to receive."

A2 birdcage flash hider is fully removable not like some that are welded or pinned on. The exterior is in like-new condition with almost no scratches or wear. The BCG shows minimal/normal wear for 120 rounds. Bought a DPMS Oracle early last year and ended up replacing the upper on an impulsive buy later on in the year. Since then this upper has sat unused in a padded rifle bag. (Its been a few months now) It was only removed from its case at the range and in my garage for cleaning. The upper and BCG have exactly 100 rounds of 5.56 american eagle 55gr and 20 rounds of some sort of winchester .223 varmint rounds which shot really nice.

Currently looking for $300 obo for the upper complete with quadrail, BCG, charging handle, red/green/blue dot sight. I am also willing to trade for a modern 9mm pistol such as a glock 17 or a canik tp9 for example.

I am not a retailer nor am I an authority on appraising uppers so if you're interested in this or just feel like this isnt worth the asking price the PLEASE MAKE AN OFFER.

i really like the all black with stainless controls and trigger.
if you offer me something and your gun is less than 900-1000$ then expect to make up that difference, i judge price by what i find on the net, minus 150$ depending on if its used.
if you chambered a round and fired it, the rifle is used, test fireing is done in a factory.

This is an older (and better!) gun with beautiful walnut furniture, good bluing and the classic red buttpad, showing just honest wear.  It has a 30"" full choke plain barrel.  It comes with some extra barrels and choke tubes:

1) 24"" 50 cal muzzleloader barrel.  Surprisingly accurate.  Good for about 1.5 in. at 50 yds
2) 28"" C-Lect choke barrel with ventilated rib, which is pretty rare
3) 28"" ported barrel with Accu-Choke, and M, F and IC choke tubes, and turkey choke

Priced separately, the gun would sell at $189 and the barrels would sell at (1) $99, (2) $99, and (3, with all choke tubes) $159, which totals $546, but I can do $500 for all.

I am happy to mix/match, but not at a discount, so individually, these are firm prices.

Great for conceal carry.

Past the break in period, where most of jams (failure to feed and extract).

Almost no felt recoil. This actually great for ladies, teens and others who are sensitive to the recoil that many small pocket and conceal carry guns have.

Great for teaching, also due to the lack of recoil/pain.

It's a pretty good shooter too, just look at the included picture of it's target.

The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.
 
All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.
 
The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.
 
The Enhanced rifles features a spiral fluted barrel, 2 position adjustable gas piston, and a bayonet lug.

This gun come new in the box. it is the OD Green KSG Keltec Shotgun Pump. From the Kel-tec factory: This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!
 
The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.
 
All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.
 
The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.
 
The Enhanced rifles features a spiral fluted barrel, 2 position adjustable gas piston, and a bayonet lug.

In great shape i would give it a 7 out of ten do to a erroe i made when replacing the extractor spring. scratched up the finish a bit on the slide around pin hole for it. other than some scratches the firearm is fully functional and ready to fire. I will emphasize that this is my everyday carry so it sees dust and debris here and there. It is cleaned twice a month and practiced with once a month. i have the original booklet and case for it. as well as a belt clip holster that i use for it that fits its great. there is only one magazine for this firearm and several boxes of rounds as well as some custom round that i made. Background check will be done for this sell. if you would like more information send me an email with a phone number and i will get back to you as soon as i can."

This is a kick ass little handgun that I am actually quite sad to see go.  It's pretty, it shoots great (never had a malfunction even during 200 round break-in period) and you cannot get one in CA.  I put ≈300 rounds through it and was intending to use it for CCW, but decided to let it go bc I am used to the M&P trigger.  Nothing wrong with trigger pull whats so ever, in fact I shot very accurately with it immediately, but I just don't want to carry something that varies from what I am used to.  

Gun is in fantastic condition without a single visible scratch.

This gun was brought in on SSE and is an off roster gun, so you as a Californian cannot get one anywhere else.

Must meet face to face at either Sacramento Gun Club in Rancho, The Gun Range in North Highlands, or M&J downtown Sac only.  Buyer must bring CA DL with current address, HSC card, and vehicle registration.  

Local FFL transaction ONLY.  No funny business, serious buyers only.  

If you are serious, click ""contact seller"" link and respond with your first name, your phone number and a good time to call you.  If you cannot follow these instructions, I will not respond.

$380 firm and I will pay transfer fee, you pay DROS fee.


Gun comes off a bit more green than seen in these photos.  This is a fantastic 9mm for conceal and carry.

Two Id`s required -NO EXCEPTIONS
2007 Taurus PT1911 .45
I bought this last year from the original owner . It had NEVER been fired . He bought it and stowed it away in his safe . I know this to be true because when I cleaned it it had all of the factory grease still on it.  I have since put around 1000 rounds through it . People talk crap about  Taurus , but I seriously have not ever had an issue with any ammo or mags I have used . This pistol has ALOT of features that are usually reserved for higher end 1911 `s .
Polished feed ramp , front slide serrations , and great checkering on the frame .  and matched slide and barrel . Full length guide rod . Comes with two factory mags , original box , with paperwork ,and takedown tool .  I have misplaced the original black plastic grips . I installed RAASCO Dymondwood walnut grips with thumb relief for easy mag release . This has been one really reliable pistol . Meticulously maintained , with very little wear . Perfectly broken in . The ONLY reason I am even considering selling this great pistol is , I recently came across a Colt Gold Cup . : )  I am firm on the price . WIll also include a Bianchi holster with the deal .

Handles buckshot or rifled slugs efficiently through the fully chrome plated, 18"" fixed cylinder choked barrel (no constriction) for wide patterning. This open choke is also very accurate when using Foster-type slugs. It also has non-glare metal surfaces with a tough composite stock and forearm. Additional features include a five-shot magazine (plus one in the chamber), and a positive, deeply grooved forearm for control and stability.

Whether it’s multi-gun competition or protecting your home and family, the Super X Pump Defender™ is the perfect choice. Its inertia-assisted action, six-shell total ammo capacity, durable composite stock and ribbed forearm give you an edge against any odds.

Today, it measures 0.7185"" (or, 0.0105"" constriction) which puts it a little tighter than IC.  Ironically, that is why I bought it!  It is a perfect field or small game gun.  It is my best swinging gun.  If I didn't point out the cut barrel, you would only know from measuring the constriction; it is that well done.  Nickle steel, so I am guessing this one dates to the late 20s or 30s.  It has honest wear, great mechanicals and lockup, and GORGEOUS wood, and it is a deal at $399.

You cannot compare this gun to the (much lower) quality of what you can buy today with $399.

The 4 Inch XD combines safety with quality and ease of use.
With the new Ultra Safety Assurance (U.S.A.) action trigger system, this polymer framed pistol is as comfortable as it is safe.
The XD's frame is made from a proprietary polymer material that has produced a pistol that is extremely durable, reliable and lighter than popular competitive models.
The frame is checkered in front and rear for a more positive grip, even with wet or sweaty hands. The XD's also have a slide release, ambidextrous magazine release button, and a quick turn disassembly lever, allowing for amazingly fast and simple field-stripping.
