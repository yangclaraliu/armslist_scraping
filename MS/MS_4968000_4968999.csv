I originally wanted to move from USPSA to shooting more 3-gun matches but work commitments on weekends hasn't allowed me to do so. Shot one match in NC and had a lot of fun with this. No cycling issues with or without a suppressor. This rifle has been safe kept and cleaned well, gas blowback is minimal with the BCM charging handle but it gets pretty dirty using a can. 

Rifle will be sold as shown EXCEPT the Trijicon 1-4x optic and LaRue mount, which I plan to list separately. Comes with 5 magazines; I have magpul 20/30rnd (some new in the wrapper) and steel 30rnd, all in excellent condition (your choice). If interested in the optic/mount, please make an offer. It is a true 1-4x with very little distortion at 1x. The sight post is the red triangle version, only issue with this is the tritium is very weak- fiber optic mode is plenty bright for almost any application anyway. 

If you have any questions, please let me know. FTF or local dealer transfer only. Willing to travel within the greater Richmond area. 

EDIT: Many more photos available, I can email additional views of the rifle and optic if requested.

This is a true 1-4x optic, very low distortion at 1x, works like a standard red dot. Up to 4x zoom makes shots in the 100-200yd range a breeze. Fiber optic is very bright even in low/evening light, has to be turned down in full sun. The only issue I have with it is the tritium is very weak by itself (total darkness). You can rig an LED to the fiber optic coil fairly easily if you're handy with electronics and want to shoot in the dark. I prefer a weapon light if I'm going to use something for home defense, anyway. This is not really a close quarters optic but a great all-around scope for 3-gun and hunting. 

The LaRue QD mount is rock solid and will retain zero after removal and re-mount. Awesome for cleaning and storage (just mark the rail you place it on). 

The scope retails between $800-900 and the mount usually runs $210 - 
Asking $700 for both. Comes with lens caps, original box and lens cleaner."

 My dad was feeling quite down and was having some medical issues; I wanted to cheer him up and offered to buy him anything he wanted for his upcoming birthday. He wanted a crossbow. He lived in Michigan and I have been here in Evansville for work and so we looked at crossbows at different stores and separate from one another. When we talked on the phone we discovered we both had the same bow in mind: the ""Bowtech Diamond Stryker Solution LS"". Admittedly, we both had chosen this bow for very different reasons; my dad chose it because he knew his stuff when it came to hunting, and I chose it because I know nothing and care nothing for hunting, but I like the show ""The Walking Dead"" and this is the type of crossbow Darryl uses to nail zombies between the eyes, though my dad preferred the camo version of this model over Darryl's black model.
 I scraped together most of the money and borrowed the rest. It really made my dad happy. He took it out the night before his procedure and shot a really big 8 point. The next afternoon he went in to the hospital and could not speak, though he was able to communicate through blinking in response to yes and no questions. That is how he was able to tell the nurse that no, he didn't know the stranger who was holding his hand (that was me) and no he did not wish to be kept alive by machines.
 It's been a year now, and rather than being a memorable token, seeing this crossbow against my wall just makes me sad, so I guess it's time to sell it. 
 The only flaw it has is that 1 arrow is missing as it completely passed through the deer and was never found.
 I will also include the Tarantula carrying case and extinguisher deer call with dvd that I had bought him for Christmas and never got a chance to give.
 I don't expect to get my money back, so I will be accepting the best offer I receive.

New in Box  and very sought after!

The new DD5V1 is a groundbreaking, performance-driven platform engineered from muzzle to buttstock. Incorporating over a decade of expertise from industry-leading Daniel Defense engineers and designers, the DD5V1 establishes a whole new standard in the .308 platform. With innovative features like a 4-bolt connection system, an optimized upper receiver, an improved bolt carrier group, ambidextrous controls, a configurable modular charging handle, and a cold-hammer-forged barrel, the DD5V1—although built around a traditional AR platform— establishes a new tradition in 7.62 rifles. It also features a Geissele SSA two-stage trigger for precise fire control. Even with all of these features, plus a DD Superior Suppression Device and 15” Picatinny top rail, the DD5V1 weighs only 8.3 lbs. The new DD5V1 will be sure to deliver the accuracy, reliability, and durability expected from Daniel Defense.

This .44 Mag is getting harder to find and one in great shape with all the bluing and no rust is even harder to find.   I've seen them in this shape g anywhere from $600-800 and with many states going to 'shotgun only' or 'pistol caliber rifles only', these are popular.  The action is very tight and smooth, bore is clean and shiny.  Note the dings on the stock.  The pics make them look worse than they are but I highlighted them on purpose.  I don't want you thinking this is a 100% grade collector's rifle.

LOCATED IN HUDSON - Will drive a reasonable distance.

With that said, I'm only putting this up for sale this weekend only.  I'd take $650 OBO.  I would also be open to trades but ONLY -- ONLY -- the following (unless you have something very, very special)!   If necessary, I'd add cash.

I'm * NOT * one of those people who seem to think a 'trade value' should be higher than the true value.   The value of an item is the value.  Enough said ...

I didn't even know these existed until I got a hold of this gun. The gun is basically new, hasn't been shot more than 50 times. In addition, I have had a custom worn finish applied which makes the gun look absolutely incredible. It couldn't have turned out any better.

I have decided to sell my rare .223 / 5.56 Saiga AK47. It's had the trigger group converted using the high quality parts from CSS, and I started the front end conversion (swapping gas block and front sight) but just haven't had a chance to finish. I have too many projects going on and letting this one go for less than I have into it. If you add up gun, parts, stock, it's well over $1,000.

I'll give you the gun, factory Izhmash 5rd magazine, nicely refinished russian stock set which is worth quite a bit on its own, and the new gas block and front sight. The old front sight and gas block have already been removed, all that needs to be done is have the two new parts slipped on and pinned. Fully converted Saigas (front end, rear end, stock set as you have here), not just unconverted or trigger conversion only, go for $1,000-$1,250 all day. This one should go for more because of the finish, heavy barrel, and stock set. This is a great chance for someone to make a quick couple hundred or just get a really nice, rare and collectible Saiga for less.

This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose.

The new SIG SAUER® P250 Compact DAO 9mm 3.9″ 15+1 NS Poly Grip is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select
 one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change
 everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250’s innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes – there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world’s only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the “To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability” you’ve come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Excellent condition. Beautiful. Correct IHC stock with DOD/DAS cartouche, correct but a tad faint. Can easily be seen in good light.Correct LMR barrel, 6-53, in the white, meaning it has never been reparkerized, maybe never shot. Finish looks new. Has Springfield Armory operating rod, the real one, not the xd manufacturer, which may be what it came with new, as SA helped IHC early with trigger groups, perhaps oprods as well? No rebuild stamps or electro pencil markings. Serial number is low, 444xxx, postage stamp variation. Email for more pics pls. Super nice rifle. Price is firm. Should be 500 more, so we can dispense with the dickering and deal. Realistically priced. The International Harvester m1 is hardest to find, harder still in the excellent condition mine is in. May do part trade on Colt ar 15, SP1, HBAR, ETC. May do part trade on Glock 19 or beretta 92 of some type, fs, m9a1 m9a3, whatcha got? May also be interested in lightweight hunting rifle, Ruger American compact, or win model 70, rem 700. Not interested in junk. Mines not. Thanks for looking!"

Made in the New Haven Ct. plant, (2005) this is one of the last of True Winchesters
and being the Stainless Models, according to Winchester was only produced for 2 or 3 years,
making it very desirable to the collector (it will never go down in value) as well as the avid hunters.

With the traditional cut checkering pattern and handsome Schnabel fore-end of the classic Featherweight, this flagship of the Model 70 line offers both beauty and performance with a weather-resistant stainless barrel, receiver and internal parts. While the looks of the Featherweight quickly set it apart from the competition, don’t overlook its time-proven three-position safety, as well as a Jeweled Pre-64 Style Control feel bolt, it provides extraordinary accuracy.
The Winchester Model 70 is called the “Rifleman's Rifle"" by many because for more than 70 years, the bolt action rifle has been praised by law enforcement and the military for its precision, accuracy and performance. It's one of those weapons that can still make people utter “they don't make ‘em like they used to"" 
Features include:
Receiver – Stainless steel
Barrel – Stainless steel; Matte finish; Free floating; Target crown
Action – M.O.A.™ Trigger System; Pre-64 action; Three-position safety; Controlled Round Feed; Controlled ejection
Stock – Grade I walnut; Satin finish; Cut checkering; Schnabel forearm
Features – Hinged floorplate; Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad; Sling swivel studs; Jeweled bolt body; Knurled bolt handle

I like quality firearms, and kinda favor Lever guns, and revolvers, but feel free to surprise me, I will say that I have been looking at the AR style rifles, but would prefer a factory gun, not one of the thrown together rifles that seem to flood the market.
