The tubular magazine tops off at 10 rounds.Both the straight-grip stock and forearm are crafted of select American walnut accented with a brass barrel band and Henry’s recognizable brass receiver.

The T4 contains some of the most evolutionary features offered by the company. The T4 resembles the popular T3, but on a 3.8” barrel platform. Reliability was the most important consideration when plans for the new pistol began, hence the 3.8” Nighthawk match grade barrel over the more popular but less reliable 3.5” or shorter barrel. The proven Bob Marvel Everlast® Recoil System was modified to fit into the smaller T4 frame, thus reducing felt recoil and decreasing recovery time between shots. The frame is thinned just like Nighthawks popular Lady Hawk. The proprietary barrel is crowned and recessed with the slide. On the outside, the front of the slide has cuts designed to reduce weight. They taper in towards the crowned barrel, giving a unique look to the T4 like no other handgun produced by Nighthawk. Grips are like the T3 and are thinned for less bulk.Barrel length is 3.8”.

If you are looking for a mint condition collector's show piece then you should keep looking because this awesome six shooter has a little wear on her finish.
The good:
Barrel and cylinders in excellent condition.
Internals seem fine, tight lockup.
Sweet Python trigger, smooth double action and crisp single action.
Very accurate and easy shooting.
The Not So Good:
Finish has a few spots of light surface rust, does not appear to be any pitting
Some bluing wear at the muzzle and a little at the high edges.
Rocking some unattractive aftermarket Pachmayr grips; though in fairness they are quite comfortable and recoil reducing.

This Python belongs on duty, not in a museum. It is a great gun, a blast to shoot, and looks good but not great, though it still has the great Python lines. 
Oregon resident only with valid ID. Not really looking for a trade. Can send additional pictures."

Here is the info from the Daniel Defence Website https://danieldefense.com/upper-receiver-groups/daniel-defense-m4-urg-v9-lw.html

The new Daniel Defense DDM4v9 Lightweight Upper Receiver Group is designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications.  The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Lightweight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire.  The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.

The V9 Lightweight URG is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. Daniel Defense complete upper receiver groups come complete with bolt carrier group and charging handle.

The previous owner had it since at least the 1970s and I think he took good care of it.

It is about a 1.5-2 MOA hunting rifle in its original 7mm Mauser caliber. I like the stock on it. It has that '50s-early '60s feel without having a Weatherby style flat plank forearm. The barrel is free floated and my son took a muley with it and a couple of pigs a few years ago.

The scope is only mounted and this one hasn't been zeroed. It was just stuck on there so you can zero and shoot it without having to go out and get one. Truthfully it's just a really junky Centerpoint 4x and you will probably take it off and stick it on a .22. What the heck, I mounted it for this sale and have given it no value. Just thought you might like to have it.

Since ammo for these probably isn't sitting on the shelf at Walmart, I am also including 20 rounds of Graf headstamped (PPU) 150 grain softpoint ammo for it. Ammo is readily available at gun shops of course.

 Price is $250. I can even mail it to you since it's an antique. What the heck - it has a lot more character than a plastic stocked rifle from - you guessed it - Walmart!

I can meet you in or near Santa Fe at about any time. Anyone can own this since it is not considered a firearm by the Feds. It is an antique."

The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location. Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel. Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms:Manual thumb safetyGrip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firingFiring pin blockEach UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round in states that permit these magazine capacities.

For sale, .357 Mag from Smith & Wesson's Performance Center. This is their 8 shot tactical revolver. This is the model with the fixed rail. As typical with Performance Center's pieces, the design, workmanship, fit and finish and stellar. I have owned both the fixed and removable rail version, and liked this one better, but I have to sell. Scandium alloy, with stainless internals, trigger and hammer. I've owned in 8 months and purchased this new. Fired approx 70 rounds of only qualify ammo, and is in perfect working order. This has been well cared for and maintained, and used lightly at the range occasionally. There is a small scratch near the end of the muzzle that you can see in the picture, but other than that blemish, the weapon is flawless. It did not come with the metal case I have seen that come with earlier purchases, but I do have the receipt for purchase, and original case and lock. The R8 is light for its size, feels awesome in the hand, deadly accurate, fun to shoot, kind of unique, and comes with the stuff listed below.

- Surefire X300 tactical light
- Hornady Ammo - Critical Defense, 4 boxes (these things are sick!)
- Armscor Ammo - Precision FMJ, 7 boxes
- Remmington Ammo - UMC, 1 box
- Hogue grips
- Extra batteries for the light (although, I have never had to replace them yet)
- Original safety key
- Balco holster (this was made for a .44, I had to cut it to fix, and never really used it because I was affraid of wearing the finish, but you can have it if you wish
