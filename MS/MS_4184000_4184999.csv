I am a Police M-16/AR-15 armorer certified by Colt.  This custom build was put together using Larue Tactical upper and lower receivers, Daniel Defense handguard, Geissele trigger, and the very hard to find Lothar Walther 300blk barrel from Spikes Tactical.  All parts were assembled brand new and not cannibalized from other builds. 

I hate to part with this rifle because it is a lot of fun to shoot and the 300blk is such a neat round to research and play around with.  Just look at the parts list and do the math, you’ll see that no expense was spared when this rifle was being meticulously built and my price reflects the parts installed.  This rifle is extremely lightweight. And as with any billet Larue upper/lower receiver it is super tight” Tex-spec”.  There is absolutely no play or slop between the upper and lower receivers at all. 

Approximately 164 rounds have been shot through the barrel and have been documented in a data log book which is included with the sale. Also I have saved almost every spent casing as well as every empty box of ammo fired through the rifle.

I’ll be including over 350 rounds of ammo with this sale (approximately $400 value). 

Also if you’re interested, I have thousands of pieces of 223/556 brass (all once fired Federal).  I have more brass than I know what to do with.  This could be easily reloaded into 300blk.  If you want I can include some brass with the sale of the rifle plus I’ll throw in a brand new set of dies used to reload .300BLK…

I am selling this rifle, I’m not giving it away. You’ll see that I’m including a ton of extras and my price is not some “post Sandy Hook or pre-president Hillary Clinton administration” markup…  

Also available if you’re interested is my custom built 223/556.  You’ll notice I had a very similar design in mind when building this rifle as well.  I will be making separate posts for both rifles but will consider making this a package deal and not separating the two of them."

Pistol.  I bought this just because it looked cool, but after researching I found people really love these guns to shoot and enjoy so I don't want to just leave it on my wall.

Finish shows patina but is original, bore appears clean and not rusty.  Stamped Tingle Manufacturing and is not an Italian copy.

I think $300.00 is a good asking price, but there is nothing on the internet for an original Bob Tingle, the copies go around $200.00 for a ~ok one so if I am way off please feel free to tell me.  I want someone to enjoy this for what it is.  I can re-finish free of charge if desired by the buyer.

I am a Police M-16/AR-15 armorer certified by Colt.  This custom build was put together using Larue Tactical upper and Tactical Innovations lower receivers, Daniel Defense hand guard and barrel.  This rifle is super lightweight and has no play between the upper and lower receivers.  Just take a look at the parts list and do the math you’ll see that my price reflects all the parts installed and that no expense was spared when building this rifle. 

I am selling this rifle, I am not giving it away. You’ll see that I’m including a ton of extras and my price is not some “post Sandy Hook or pre-president Hillary Clinton administration” markup…

You will not find 1/2"" thick targets anywhere for this price.  I wanted a few targets to shoot at but the local steel supplier would only sell if i bought a 1/4 sheet minimum.

The cold hammer-forged barrel has a polygonal profile while the slide is made from a solid bar of nitro-carburized steel. Following recent trends in modern pistol design, the P2000 makes extensive use of impact-resistant polymers to reduce weight and production costs. As with other recent Heckler & Koch pistol designs, the P2000 is modular to suit individual needs. For instance, the grip is modular with exchangeable backstraps, allowing the user to customize the pistol's grip size and feel. There is a universal accessory rail built into the dust cover in front of the trigger guard that allows for the use of tactical lights, laser pointers and other accessories. This is in contrast with the USP series which uses a proprietary H&K mounting rail that limits the types of accessories that could be used with the pistol. The P2000 is a hammer-fired pistol with an exposed spurred hammer; a bobbed hammer is optional. It has an ambidextrous slide lock and a fully ambidextrous magazine release installed in the trigger guard."

Here is a brand new in box Kel-Tec PMR30 with Tan Cerakote Finish.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.

We all grew up hearing the phrase, ""Faster than a speeding bullet...,"" but not when it is fired from Smith & Wesson's new Model 460XVR, with the highest muzzle velocity of any production revolver on earth. The Model 460XVR is so revolutionary that it required an entirely new designation...XVR, X-treme Velocity Revolver.

Starting with their Extra Large Frame, the Smith & Wesson engineers worked to deliver maximum velocity - over 2,300 feet per second - to reach the target faster than ever before. The 460XVR™ has interchangeable compensators to accommodate every load and its ""gain-twist"" rifled barrel means superb long-range accuracy (beyond 200 yards) with every shot! Only Smith & Wesson could deliver this much power, this much velocity and this much accuracy in a precision, production revolver.

What I have:

106 pounds of movable type.
This is made of a quite hard alloy, though I can't identify the alloy or the hardness for you.
They are probably quite old, as movable type has been out of use for a LONG time.
They are corroded, but of course, this will skim out as dross when melting.
Along with the 106 pounds of type, I have 26 pounds of ingots that I already melted down from the same lot of type.
This makes 132 pounds in total.

37 pounds of large lead ingots
This is of an unknown alloy, as well, but seems harder than pure lead. It may be 50/50 (lead/tin) solder, which is very valuable for ""sweetening"" an alloy for better castability, hardness and resistance to leading.

20 pounds of processed wheel weights, in ingot form

Take all 189 pounds for $200
That's $1.06 per pound

I am unwilling to ship this lead.
You MUST be willing to pick it up here at my house in Brantingham, NY, about an hour north of Utica.

I won this bow at a banquet raffle in Kentucky. The only reason I'm selling it is because before I won this bow my wife purchased a New Hoyt as an early Christmas gift for me. I took this bow to Hoffman Archery and they outfitted it with the accys shown. I shot a total of 15 arrows through it at the shop and that is all the bow has seen. It sits in my closet now waiting to be purchased. It is in pristine condition and with absolutely nothing wrong with it. You are basically getting a bran new out of the box bow. 

The bow features a 28"" axle to axle, perfect for ground blinds and tree stands. This is the Black Crimson, one of Mathews custom colors. This bow will come loaded with the following accys:

Mathews Solocam 2 piece quiver
QAD drop away rest
Axion Archery stabilizer w/ 2 harmonic stabilizers inside
Wrist sling
Tru Glow 4 pin sight

Please feel free to text or email with any questions. Like I said before, I shot 15 arrows through it at Hoffman's archery shop just so they could tune it. You will not be disappointed in this biw. It's shoots fast and smooth, with a rock solid wall.

I bought this gun new from Sportsmans Warehouse in February, and I bought this particular one because it is a little tighter and more solid feeling than most Kimbers I've felt, and also turned out to be extremely accurate too. I've put less than 500 rounds through it so far, so it's not even broken in yet. There are virtually no signs of wear or marks. The night sights are probably the brightest I've seen on any gun so far. Only selling because I don't use it enough and need cash.

I also added an increased power Wolff mainspring (not recoil spring) to help mitigate the recoil of some hotter 10mm loads, which I never ended up using in this gun. I also added an EGW flat bottom firing pin stop, which fits better than the original Kimber one. The combination of the heavier mainspring and flat bottom firing pin stop help reduce recoil and negate the increased wear that comes from using full-power rounds. For more info on why I did this check out this thread: http://10mm-firearms.com/general-discussion/1911-owners-we-are-doing-it-wrong!/

Comes with the original box and all the goodies that come with that, as well as an extra Kimber mag for a total of two mags, and the original firing pin stop. Asking $1,000 obo, which is a bit less than I paid for this (Gun alone was $1070, mag $40, and other parts were $34).

I purchased the pistol a little over a year ago and have only had the opportunity to put 50 rounds through it.

The gun looks like new and I had no malfunctions or any other problems with it.

It comes with a Springfield pistol case, two stock 7 rd mags, holster, double mag pouch, cleaning brush, and owner's manual. The white grips currently pictured on the pistol are not included. However, it does come with a gorgeous set of cocobolo wood grips with the Springfield crossed cannons logo and a second set of black plastic grips, also with the Springfield crossed cannons logo.

The pistol also comes with two additional Tripp Research 8 rd CobraMags (about $36 apiece). 

Also, this pistol is one of the ""NM"" serialized models. From what I have gathered, there are ""N"" and ""NM"" serialized models. The ""N"" models are manufactured and assembled in Brazil. The ""NM"" models are manufactured in Brazil but assembled in the US. The ""NM"" models are more sought after because they supposedly are of a higher quality. This is what I have found through internet searches. I have never handled an ""N"" model so I can neither confirm nor deny this.

I spent about $700 on the pistol and another $75 for the CobraMags. I'm asking $550, firm, cash only. Buyer pays transfer fee ($35) at an FFL in the Vallejo area (Napa, Vacaville, Fairfield, etc.).

I don't think that Lyman offered it for long.

This is one of the highest-capacity tumblers ever made specifically for reloading.
I can't find the paperwork that came with it (yet), but I recall that it was rated for way over 1,000 .38 Special cases, and perhaps 2,000 9mm

I've used it moderately (probably less than 10,000 cases cleaned in total),
but almost not at all for perhaps the last ten years.
I was always impressed at its effectiveness and capacity.

I always used ground corncob media in it, which worked well.

It has the Auto-Flo drain system, which gets most or all of the media out of the bowl, leaving the cleaned cases behind.

It comes with a clear Plexiglas cover and a black plastic media drain tub.
I am moving out to the West, and decided not to bring it. I will be bringing it with if it doesn't sell for a reasonable price in a couple weeks, though, so act quickly.

I am COMPLETELY unwilling to ship this tumbler.
You MUST be willing to pick it up here at my house in Brantingham, NY, about an hour north of Utica.

I just got my CC permit so im shopping for one I can carry comfortably, has proven reliability, sufficient fire power (round capacity), and doesn't cost my first born child. It'd be great to have 2 or + magazines, not a high round count, and maybe a holster for CC. 
Striker or hammer fire is fine. No preference. Although, I'd very much like a Glock 19 Gen 4 9MM for around $500

My main deal breaker is a heavy trigger; i.e. the Ruger LC9-heavy, heavy, HEAVY. Bought it, tried it, didn't like it. So something nice and crisp is preferred. 
Magazine cap I'd like 10 or more rounds 9mm
I'll pay a fair price for a used pistol so please contact me if you have one you'd like to sell."

full disclosure. Barrel nut is a slightly chewed from previous improper barrel nut/ rail installation (previous owner). Top rail where it meets upper is slightly bent from i assume the same. This caused the gas tube to be offset by a mis-indexed barrel nut. I bought a new gas tube and personally oversaw the correct re-installation of the barrel nut by a competent gunsmith. Chewed portion of nut did not affect re-installation at all. Gas tube now slides flush as it should. Also, slight thread blemish on the pistol tube, does not affect the tube threading into a lower or the castle nut spinning.

In first picture, upper is the top upper. Comes with the non windowed pmag. comes with standard lock plate. Bottom lower, sling lock plate, and windowed pmag are gone.

I'm looking to sell my Springfield Armory 1911 mil-spec package with parkerized finish chambered in .45 ACP.  The only trade I'm interested in would be for a Sig P938 (prefer Equinox, SAS or Blackwood) and I can add cash on my end.  I've been to the indoor range a few times with This 1911 and put a couple hundred rounds through it total.  It comes with the factory case and every thing in it (x2 seven round mags, holster, mag pouch, extra black grips, etc.) plus a Wilson Combat 8 round mag.

The cheapest I can find this package online is $599 plus tax, plus $30 shipping insurance, plus FFL transfer plus $40 for the WC mag.  With that in mind I'd like to get $550 for everything.

Must be 21 with valid ID to purchase.  Call or text if you are interested.  I am not willing to ship.  Thanks for looking.

Horton’s daily operations and their special editions have upwards of two decades’ seniority on their friendly competitor neighbors, only 12 miles from each other. Here is the latest Colt Horton’s Special, and it is as traditional as they come. This is a Series 80 descendant of the 1911A1 with firing pin safety, but also with full coverage military style finish, brown Bakelite type GI Grips, and a lanyard ring type Mainspring Housing. Manufacturer is Colt Industries of Hartford, CT. Exclusive distributor is Lew Horton Distributing of Westboro, MA. Colt factory designation is Model O1991Z, M1991A1 Series 80. Construction is entirely steel, with the exception of the grips, and the anodized trigger and mainspring housing. The Colt M1991A1, writes the factory, is a direct 4th generation descendant of the ""often imitated but never duplicated"" Colt M1911 classic automatic pistol, and this variant is the closest approximation to the World War II version. Type is Browning Design 1911 Government type Single Action semi-automatic pistol. Chambering is .45 ACP Caliber. Barrel is 5 inch stainless, 6 groove left hand 1:16 rifling. Frame and slide finish are matte blue, approximating the WWII parkerized versions. Sight system is matte blue stake on front and dovetailed notch style rear that is drift adjustable only for windage. Safety system is classic threefold, main safety for right handed shooters; grip safety; and Series 80 type firing pin safety.
