From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

This can is AWESOME! Super quiet & very light weight.

This is straight from Liberty's website;
Borrowing baffle technology from the Mystic program, this suppressor is a natural evolution in the design and manufacture of a firearm silencer. This suppressor utilizes the same tube specifications as well as the same stainless tube retaining ring as the Mystic, but instead of using stainless steel as the material for the core, it utilizes 6Al 4V Titanium instead. This gives the suppressor the strength and lightweight characteristics of titanium, with even better suppression than that of the Mystic. The titanium core has better thermal heat transfer characteristics than stainless steel and therefore gains 2 to 4 dB in suppression over the Mystic without loosing any of it’s strength. This is truly class leading suppression!!! We have seen meter readings below 120dBs with this suppressor design!* This suppressor will also carry most of the same caliber ratings as the Mystic as well as all of the same mounting solutions. Get yours today!

Any form of payment(other than cash of course) MUST clear OUR bank before transfer starts. Credit/debit cards gladly accepted, but we must ad 3.5% for this option.

Built in collaboration with Advanced Armament Corporation, the new AAC Suppressor Ready pistol is one that you will cherish for a lifetime.

A steel thread-protector comes standard to protect your barrel when the suppressor is not in use.

Available through Nighthawk Custom, its Preferred Dealers or from Advanced Armament Corporation, this custom handgun is loaded with proprietary features. The first to catch your eye will be the lightening cuts on the top of the slide, mainspring housing and front strap that match the Advanced Armament Ti-Rant suppressor. As you can see from the pictures, it makes for a very attractive firearm. The slide sports new Heinie Ledge Straight-Eight Suppressor Sights which are only available through Nighthawk Custom. These sights are designed to give you a complete sight picture over the top of the suppressor. The distinct ""ledge"" rear sight allows you to cock the weapon off of a hard surface if needed.

Aimpoint® Micro T-1
Lightweight sight for extreme conditions

Built to offer the same battle-proven ruggedness as other Aimpoint products, the Micro T-1 performs reliably under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon. Suitable for use on

    Rifles
    Carbines
    Shotguns
    Submachine guns
    Handguns

The Aimpoint Micro T-1 is ideal as a standalone sight, and can also be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics.


Excellent night vision compatibility

The Micro T-1 can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility. The performance of the Micro T-1 is optimized for use with all generations of Night Vision Devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology.


The clearest, brightest image possible

Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).
With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.

One of our first products ever and still the best selling rimfire silencer ever, the Sparrow™ 22 was designed with simplicity, durability, and user serviceability as its core objectives. It is the shortest rimfire silencer on the market, has the quietest 10-round average of any silencer in its class, and can go 2,000 rounds between cleanings. Patented Multi-Part Containment (MPC™) technology facilitates ease of disassembly and reassembly – an essential function of .22LR suppressors. The internal MPC™ construction uses two half tubes that pull away from a monolithic core, which ensures that the Sparrow 22 will remain easy to clean after extended periods of use with notoriously dirty rimfire ammunition. The Sparrow 22 is compatible with multiple calibers up to 5.7mm and is rated for full auto fire.

And I wouldn't have to tell you about the quality of this work. You will also know that my asking price is about what the engraving alone costs. This particular engravers work has been doing this full time for over 40 years. And the value of his work goes up every year. And I know there is an extremely long waiting list and for new work. The pistol comes with a signed letter of authenticity from the artist. I am also including an extra pinky extension mag, Desantis ankle holster, a genuine shark skin wet molded pocket holster and 3 boxes of Corbon .25 NAA ammo. All those extras were well over $200. This would not only make an amazing investment but also a great CCW/Back-Up pistol. This is honestly the last thing I ever wanted to sell but I need the cash. I am asking $650obo. I have way more than that invested and I am sure if I put it on an auction site it would get close to twice that. But I only feel comfortable meeting someone in person.  Serious LOCAL buyers only!! I have many more pictures and info on engraver for serious buyers. I will only consider face to face transactions for CASH ONLY.  Please email with any questions."

This is a shooter not a perfect safe queen, but they ain't getting any cheaper and they ain't making any more...at least not yet DROPPED TO LOWEST BOTTOM DOLLAR because I noticed a smidge of freckling along the cylinder that I hadn't noticed before. You can't find a Python cheaper than this one. Prefer NWA buyer."

Hogue rubber grips are molded from a durable synthetic rubber that is not spongy or tacky, but gives that soft recoil absorbing feel, without effecting accuracy. This modern rubber requires a completely different molding process than ordinary neoprene and results in a much superior grip. The material used does not come apart or deteriorate and is resistant to all solvents and oils used around firearms. Hogue Grips give you a lasting precision fit and durability that will provide years of dependable service. The flexibility of the materials and molding process has allowed Hogue to produce superior rubber grips with features that out perform all other makes.

The clearest, brightest image possible

Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).
With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.

This is a great starter pack if your just getting into firearms or not, still a great kit.

For those of you who call me to purchase and don't understand the new (not that new, but A TON of people still call me and get intimated with the process.) regulations in WA state:

Please don't call if you are not willing to complete each of the steps. The process is straightforward and as long as you don't have a criminal record, you will be fine.

1. If you want the gun, you will need to meet me at an FFL. I use one on Wetmore Ave in Everett, because they charge only $25. I would like to use this FFL as I will be covering the fee.
2. Once at the FFL, if you like the gun, you pay me. Once you hand me the money. I pay for the background check. At this point the sale is final, as I am paying for the background check.
3. The FFL will make the background check phone call. If you have no criminal history you have nothing to worry about.You will get your gun, you may just need to wait a few days. This is when a CPL comes in handy because you've already had a background check done, and it speeds the process.
4. If FFL tells you that you need to wait, the FFL will simply hold the firearm until they get the ok from the cleared background check. At that point you pickup the gun and owe nothing.

Please don't lowball me. The price is firm. There is already $150 worth of ammo, 3 magazines: 2 ten round and 1 15 round AND the Blackhawk Serpa holster included. You can keep the green ammo can currently holding all the ammo.

(Background & TN Tax)
DESCRIPTION:
The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

 ***THIS IS A KAHR CW9 with a KAHR P9 Black slide on it. I am not presenting this as a P Series Pistol. ALL parts on this pistol are from the CW series except the slide.*** 

 This is the factory DLC coating on the slide, not an aftermarket finish.

 75 rounds have been run through this with the P series slide -- No issues. Under 150 rounds total. 

 The only cosmetic flaw I can locate on this is on the top of the slide. I have included a photo. An instructor was teaching my wife basic pistol functions during her CWP class and his gold wedding slid across the DLC coating. This is not a scratch, but rather an ""inlay"" of gold. (Yes, that's a joke) You really have to catch it at the right light for it to be noticeable. 

 It comes with two magazines as shown in the photos. 

 Please feel free to contact me with any questions!

According to proof marks on the barrel of the 10 gauge shotgun, the firearm dates back to the early 1800's from Birmingham, England. There is also a 20 gauge shotgun that does not have any proof marks but according to the markings looks as if it is from the same era. The long gun used to be a flint lock but was converted to percussion cap at some point. The 10 gauge and long gun are in good condition. The 20 gauge has been repaired however the repair is consistent with the era of the gun. All guns have not been refurbished and have lots of unique engravings. These pieces would be great for a collection or for decoration over the mantel. Each gun is for sale for $500 each. Prices may be negotiable and trades for modern rifles will be considered.

I put enough rounds through it to break it in and warm it up for someone. 

I originally bought it because I watched too many Nutnfancy videos and he sold me on it. Full Nutnfancy video review http://youtu.be/93-DJbuBUEA. It's a great gun and all of what he said is true, just turns out it's not for me and I'm OK with that. So I figured rather than let it collect dust I would trade it out or sell it for something that will work for me and in the process provide someone with a great firearm for their own collection. 

I am really looking to trade for a M&P Shield 9 (without safety version) and it doesn't have to be new. I am aware that money can also be used to buy an M&P Shield, but I am lazy and if I can provide a fair trade for someone who would like to get rid of their Shield, then I'll pursue that route. That being said I am not intransigent and am open to reasonable offers, both trade and monetary, people are willing to submit. 

Must be 21+, have valid Drivers License, CCL or PTP and be willing to fill out bill of sale to complete the transaction. 

PS. Please write to the ATF and your representatives regarding the M855 and M109 ban being proposed and make them hear our voice as a gun community and supporters of the 2nd Amendment.

PLEASE READ THIS. I'm getting a lot of questions from people that are answered in this description.  
Custom built Remington 700 chambered in .300 RUM.  Heavy, fluted, free floating barrel.  Harris bipod.  Zeiss 3-10x50 scope. Polymer stock. Custom bowflag camo.

This is a great rifle for long range shooting.  The .300 Remington Ultra Mag round is very powerful with a super flat trajectory.  .300 RUM ammo is available in multiple power levels and a variety of bullet weights which makes it equal to shooting a .308, a .300 win mag or a full powered .300 RUM, so it's like having three rifles in one. This rifle has had less than 50 rounds fired through it. The scope is included along with a rolling hard case and about 50 rounds of ammo.  My roommate built the rifle in 2006. I bought it from him for much more than what I'm asking now. I do not have the original stock. I do not know specifics of modifications yet I do not believe the barrel or trigger have been modified. I do not know the specific model of Remington 700 that the rifle was before it was modified.  The stock is ""The Ultimate Sniper II"" from Choate.  I do not have spacers. I am not looking to sell to an out of state buyer because I don't know the legalities of each state. 

It's a fantastic rifle and performs very well, but I have a wedding to pay for. The rifle is worth double what I'm asking for it and I'm not looking for a firearm to trade, but i will take 9mm ball 115 gr. and/or .223 55 gr. ball brass case ammo of a quality brand."

They are both fully functional and I have had each out several times for the heck of it and did not have any problems with either. They are pretty old so I guess they are nice and broken in. I would call them shooters and not collectors as the metal finish is either not very good or has been redone. The remaining ammo that I have for each will also go with them.

1890 Winchester – 22 short 
This is a Second Model takedown. If the thumbscrew at the rear of the stock is removed, the rifle splits into 2 pieces as shown. Neither the stock nor fore end have any cracks but do have some dings. The metal on the outside of the octagon barrel as well as receiver has a significant amount of pitting and has been re-blued. The small boxes of ammo are all full and the large box is a partial so somewhere around 300 rounds included. Asking $500.

1897 Winchester -16 Gauge
This is also a takedown model, 26 inch barrel and fixed Full choke. After pushing a pin at the end of the magazine tube, the magazine can be rotated and pulled and then the barrel can rotate and detach from the receiver as shown. It is pretty neat. The fore end has a crack in one side but it is intact. The stock has a recoil pad installed. The finish on the receiver is nonexistent but there is bluing on the barrel. One full box of ammo and the other is a partial with only a few shells. Asking $350.

825,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4066825,For Sale:   Glock 29 TFO and 3.5 Trigger! Ultimate Home Protection Piece!!,"Far West, Evansville, Indiana",$ 525,"Listed On: Monday, March 9, 2015",Handguns,Glock                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"For sale is one of my 3 identical home protection pieces. This is a Glock 29 with TFO tritium fiber optic sights that fires the very potent 10mm round. What is really surprising is that this Glock hand cannon fires a round that puts a .45 acp round to shame yet is NOT punishing to shoot. I fire 100 rounds of the ammo I plan to use for home defense through each of my home defense pistols, clean them, and then load them and stash them in strategic places in my home. 

For various reasons, I no longer need 3 of these man droppers stashed in my home. No Glock 29 I've ever owned has ever failed to chamber any defense ammo nor failed to fire. Since they certainly are not pretty, they have to be the ultimate in reliable and dependable along with being world class accurate for a compact pistol. I have added Meprolight TFO sights to all of my self protection firearms. The sights are NOT cheap, but they are the brightest sights you can buy for daytime as well as night time shooting. 

This pistol comes in Glock box, owners manual and two 10 round magazines that both have the Pierce pinky grip extension. As you can see in the picture, he original Glock copper lube stuff is still on this pistol. If you want a man dropper, and not a pistol that may just possibly dissuade any intruder, this is for you. The night sights are less than 2 years old, so you should get at least 10 more years out of them before they dim.  If you want the pistol without the TFO sights on it, I own the $600 sight pressing machine and can put the original sights back on for $50 less.

The package deal for this home protection system is $525 with all pictured and with the TFO sights. I will need to see proper Indiana ID and preferably a carry permit. This is a fantastic firearm that will last for decades and tens of thousands of rounds. Just ask if you have any questions. Thanks for looking at my ad. If you want to see more pics, just ask. I'm no computer wizard and I kept exceeding the size limit allotted for this ad. Thanks again!"

I bought this knife in the late fifties and believe it is a genuine Third Pattern, or P-3, because of the following features.  The blade is the “thick” type, showing triangular flats where it was reduced in thickness to enter the guard.  The guard itself is thick with sharp edges.  It appears to carry three stamps, unfortunately all in the same place.  One is clearly “ENGLAND” and the second (over the first) is a broad arrowhead.  Above the arrowhead point, there appears to be a third stamp, which might be a “2.”   The pommel carries a barely visible “2” stamp near the hilt.  The sheath is stamped with the word “ENGLAND” near the hilt.
The blade has been sharpened and is discolored but there is no rust.  The copper tip on the sheath has a slight dent at the end, but does not interfere with knife insertion.  The elastic band that retains the hilt has partially disintegrated due to storage and time.  Otherwise, the sheath is supple and in good condition.   Asking $250 obo."

I have a 5 Star Firearms speed loader that is included in the asking price (30 dollar value) as well as a Galco shoulder holster for it, without the harness, that I'm willing to let go for 50 additional dollars (new they run almost 90 and this one has been carried less than a month).
