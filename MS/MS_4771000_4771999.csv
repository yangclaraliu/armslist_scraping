The differences between the LM8 and the MRP CQB rifle is that the LM8 does not have the Picatinny rails machined into the upper. On the LM8 you can place Picatinny rails as needed on the upper for bi-pods, lights or lasers. This allows a very low and smooth profile on the hand guard for the operator, allowing improved ergonomics for users that prefer a smooth profile. 

The LM8 still offers the same flexibility for quick barrel changes as the MRP CQB. This process utilizes two bolts and takes less than 2 minutes to complete.  The LM8 can utilize different calibers and barrel lengths from the 10.5"" (NFA Rules Apply) to the 20"" barrels in both the direct impingement and piston systems. These rifles also come with the authentic and excellent LMT SOPMOD stock. Lewis Machine and Tool (LMT) flat out makes some of the most durable and accurate firearms on the planet. This is a top three manufacturer in our opinion. No fancy marketing, packaging and No BS. Just innovative and well executed products.


Can also include 750 rounds of steel core penetrator ammunition and 30 round Mags

Truthfully, I have fired both magazines ONCE at a very short range session and they look brand new out of the package. I believe I do have the box packaging if you want that.

 FROM THE TAURUS WEBSITE:
 This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going. Also comes with (3) back straps and magazine loader..

It has a keymod 15"" handguard and will also throw in a Knight's Armament handguards( the same that the USMC uses in their M16s). Price is 300 firm, the barrel alone it's worth more than that. Just to answer any questions that people might have, never had any issues with it, really accurate, put about 140 thru it(never steel cased or aluminum), the only reason I'm selling it its because I recently purchased one of the Sharps Bros lower and the upper doesn't match the look, so need the money to build a shorter upper.

 The negative reviews online regarding tuning problems are for the Chinese version. This one is made in Korea and holds a tune just fine. Also, someone reported difficulty stringing this instrument. Evidently, he was unaware that the chrome cover is removable and exposes the string anchor points. Stringing it is a breeze with a tuner crank.

The short mag action has been squared and trued center to bore; the inner tenon was opened up .010"" and new threads were single point cut center to bore. The actions lugs have also been squared and trued. The bolt lugs, as well as the bolt nose and face have been trued and squared. All machine work is done on a precision lathe with a single point cuter all center to bore. Both the action and bolt are dial indicated to .0001"" before any work is performed.

A brand new Shilen, match grade, chrome barrel was used for this build. The contour is a #5 contour (heavy sporter but not quite a varmint), 10 twist and finished at 24"". The barrel threads were also single point cut and hand fit to this action. The breech was cut to .0035"" and the headspace was cut to .0015"". This is much tighter than factory specs and will lead to a much more accurate shooter. The barrel was crowned with an 11 degree target crown. The barrel has only 3 rounds through her... I have plenty of pics to share showing the machine work being completed.

Once the machine work was completed and the rifle test fired the barreled action was caustic blued but can always be customized to your needs...  Maybe add a muzzle brake; cerakote finish; detachable mag; Jewell trigger, ect.

The barreled action in a quality stock will easily shoot 3/4 MOA with factory ammo and is capable of 1/2 MOA or better using hand loaded ammo. I have a few HS precision stocks and a few Bell and Carlson stocks to offer with this build...

The .300 WSM is stocked in a Bell and Carlson sporter stock and can be swapped into an HS precision if preferred.  I have plenty of more pics if needed.  If you prefer just the barreled action - I can offer just the barreled action for 1100.  

I have a few other blueprinted Rem 700s available as well so if you have another caliber in mind send a note... I probably have it or can build it.

Make a fair offer - the worst I can say is no thanks...  Will ship to your FFL if needed."

It is New in Box, never opened, never installed. This is the model with the 6-position adjustable length, side-folding stock with adjustable cheek rest. Gun can be fired from the folding position - note, AK's with side mounted rails may not allow this side-folding stock to fold completely, just FYI. This will attach to most standard AK-47's, though Yugo's like the NPAP will require an adapter, such as the one by Krebs. The pistol grip is one of the most comfortable I've ever used.

I've got the same stock installed on my SKS and on a 10/22, and I really love them. They are very comfortable to shoot, light weight. The adjustable stock makes it nice and easy to adjust LOP. The side-folding stock makes it nice and compact for storage.

Also comes with: 

* (1) 4"" Picatinny top rail
* (2) 2"" Picatinny side rails
* (1) 2"" Picatinny bottom rail with swivel stud
* (3) Sling Swivel Studs
* Scorpion T2 Recoil Pistol Grip

I paid $139 for this last year, but I don't need it any longer since I don't have a gun to mount it to. So, I'd like it gone. 

Price is $75 cash, face to face. I'm not looking for any trades.

I prefer local FTF sale, but I will ship for an additional $10 (I can accept payment via PayPal), anywhere in the continental U.S. that doesn't have a stated restriction on folding or adjustable stocks. If you know they're not allowed in your state, please don't waste my time, because I will check."
