This model has the loaded chamber indicator and the manual safety.  I have kids in the house and my wife has friends over all the time so even though I keep in a locked safe, I wanted the safety.  I have cleaned it once and then put it away.  Was purchased a few weeks ago, but wife decided she is hooked on Shield so off it goes.  The accessories are about a year old as I had a PM9 previously.  
Included in the sale is the PM9, the Crimson Trace laser, a Recluse Pocket holster, a kydex pocket holster, a CROSS BREED mini tuck in their collector edition leather, 6 mags, 4 extended and 2 flush, Hogue grip, box and manual, lock.

This is the smallest (i believe) 9mm pistol on the market designed for concealed carry.  It is tiny but VERY shootable.  Recoil is minimal (I know from my previous one).  You can look up hickock45's review on youtube.

I am in Tampa and if local, require a FLDL and prefer CWP.  A bill of sale must be signed.

If not local I will ship to FFL via my local FFL for a cost of $30."

Here's the info from their website: 1,000 signature subsonic optimized 300 Blackout projectiles. These are polymer coated lead bullets with a Brinell hardness of 18. Our 300 Blackout projectiles are specifically designed for subsonic application on both AR platforms and bolt action rifles. They work well in both metal and polymer AR magazines and feed well with AR15 and m4 feed ramps. Please be aware that these projectiles require that the cartridge case be belled to properly load. This means taking an extra step to flare the case mouth so the coated lead will not be shaved off during the loading process. These projectiles are not jacketed and need to be loaded in the same manner as cast bullets."

Something didn't seem right, so I looked up what information I had on them such as email address, first and last name, year of birth, and location. Often times people will inadvertently volunteer information about themselves that will help. If they don't, ask simple questions like ""whats your first and last name"", ""what side of town do you live on"" or ""what year were you born."" By using Google and social media site searches (Sometimes you can even access court records in your area online to find information on people), I found out the potential buyer had priors for felony drug possession and passing bad checks. Who knows what else they have on their record that I couldn't find. The police can't be everywhere at once. It is our responsibility to keep our own communities safe and help keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. Our families lives and our neighbors lives depend on it. Use your gut feelings and your head. If something doesn't seem right, look the person up first. Be safe out there, Armslisters!"

If you are reading this post you more than likely know what this gun is all about and how rare this Italian gun is. I purchased this gun approximately 7 months ago brand new and has maybe 150 rds through the gun. The gun runs flawlessly and is a true work of art. The only flaw to this gun is a blemish just in front of the dust cover. I was not told about this when purchasing the gun and I was rather upset after receiving the gun. After firing the pistol I really didn’t care or worry about the blemish and see it more as a beauty mark. In no way does the blemish effect the way the gun fires or works, it is truly a fantastic pistol. The gun comes with all original parts and nothing has been changed or added to the gun. I have the case, manual, tools (for trigger adjustment), extra spring, and 2 magazines. This Gun retails for $2399 at Pardini USA. Please feel free to call or text should you have any questions or would like to see more pictures. This will be a face to face transfer at a designated agreed upon local FFL dealer. You cover transfer cost.

Description
The DBAL-I² (Dual Beam Aiming Laser – Intelligent) Class 1 IR Laser is the first Mil Spec infrared aiming laser available to the commercial market. Class 1 IR lasers feature a 0.7mW rating which is eye safe and not restricted by the FDA. While this is a lower output than the standard 5mW+ IR lasers used by Warfighters and LE Professionals, it is perfectly adequate for targeting at ranges out to 250 yards. This encompasses most ranges at which users will engage targets during night shooting and training.
Functionally, the DBAL-I² Class1 Laser features two output modes: Visible and IR. The IR Laser is 0.7mW while the visible is a full power Class IIIa laser. The DBAL-I² Class1 is available with either a visible red or visible green laser. The IR pointer is low powered to make it eye-safe, but will perform well out to 450 yards. The pointer is easy to spot and has a good divergence/shape. The IR pointer works well with a separate LED IR Illuminator at distances, but will become a bit harder to see at close range due to the splash back from the illuminator on walls. This is especially true with light-colored walls. However, it is still easily visible for targeting. The IR pointer is more easily seen in darker conditions. Just like visible pointers, the Class1 laser will tend to wash out the closer it gets to another light source.
The Visible Pointer is available in two versions: Red or Green. These are both standard full-power Class IIIa lasers.
Based on LDI’s proven DBAL-I², the Class1 version has very few outward differences. The Class1 DBAL-I² utilizes the same exact body housing and optics package as its full-power brother. Physically, the housing is completely Mil Spec anodized precision machined Aircraft-Grade Aluminum with LDI’s excellent HT Throw Lever Mount. These housings are extremely rugged, currently fighting on the front lines of the Global War on Terror. The Mount is a self-adjusting throw lever that is exceptionally strong and requires no tools to adjust for out of spec rails. The only outward difference between the Class1 and standard models are the power setting markings. The DBAL-I² Class1 has markings for High/Low Visible and IR Pointer that allow for .7mW high and .2mW low.
In the past, some small-time companies have attempted to build home-made modified IR lasers and sell them on the tactical market. These units did not hold zero and were generally poorly constructed- more suited to toys. Now, for the first time ever, a major government contractor is producing civilian-legal IR lasers in quality Mil Spec housings. Finally, the commercial market has something readily available at affordable prices.

I saddle stitch everything by hand to ensure long life. I may need to see your gun to be sure of a proper fit, as I do not have patterns for every firearm. It will be worth it though, to have a strong holster that will carry the way you want. Many options are available, including exotic materials. We can get together to make you a one of a kind, or just a good solid holster that will last you for the rest of your life. There is a $25.00 minimum for repair work. But belt holsters start at $50.00 Most shoulder holsters will start at $150.00-$200.00. I will be happy to give you a quote. Stacy REDACTED"

The only marks are on the stock with some minor scratches & dings. I have not tried to doctor them up (see pics).  Otherwise, it's in perfect operation and all other areas are virtually flawless with no other markings, or rust, as it has been taken well care of.  I can't say 100% certain, but knowing him I'm confident he did not put more than 100 shells down range.  I've had it since 1987, and I may have put 20 shells down range, if that.  As often the case, the attached pictures do not do it justice.  I have others I can send to interested parties.

 The Monitor 4000 Exit Alarm is the most effective solution to combat pilferage and protect employees from unauthorized entries through security-sensitive doors. It usually pays for itself with increased profits within 90 days. The Monitor 4000 Exit Alarm can be temporarily bypassed for deliveries and trash removal, but reminds managers to close and secure the door. The 100dB alarm will sound when someone attempts an unauthorized exit or when the door remains open past the authorized time. The unit can be plugged into an existing standard outlet, and has a rechargeable backup battery. Easy to install, easy to use, easy to maintain. 

 Patented Prop Deterrent -If the door is not shut in the allotted time, after authorized use, the adjustable timer in the alarm box will sound the alarm; eliminating propped open doors.
• Automatic Reset - Alarm resets immediately when the door is closed and is not dependent on an employee remembering to rearm the system.
• Backup Battery - Built-in automatic resetting surge protector and continuously charging backup battery system ensures the door remains armed in case of power outage, circuit failure or attempts to cut off power illegally.
• High Security Keys - Protects against unauthorized duplication of keys.
• Modular Internal Components - Components are designed so the end user can easily replace a part without the use of an expensive tradesman.

I currently have, or shall I say “HAD”  a couple of post on Armslist for two reasons, what better opportunity to try and sell gun stuff (“Merry Christmas!”) and also to be completely honest with you, I need the money, especially this time of the year. But for some reason the Armslist community decided to FLAG my post for whatever reason. I absolutely and truly respect and support ALL efforts to stop the ID thieves, scammers, unwanted marketers, and especially all the bad guys living in our great Country, trying to find a way to circumvent methods to illegally obtain firearms solely for the destruction, mayhem, fear and an effort to bring udder chaos to our GREAT COUNTRY.  That being said, I ask of you all, PLEASE do not flag any of my posting, it was my mistake NOT listing my phone number, which in hindsight might have brought a little more credibility to my postings if in question of their validity, and I did so only to try and do what you folks just did, stop the crap that sometimes comes along with using classified media like this, and Craigslist etc. I am a Proud Veteran of the United States Army, Honorably Discharged, 118th Military Police Unit (Airborne), Honor Graduate of the Department of Defense Military Working Dog Team School, and also served with the Army Security Agency (ASA). I served our Country during the Vietnam conflict, was attached to the 18Th Airborne Corp. I am now retired and living on a very meek disability, but I am still truly blessed.
