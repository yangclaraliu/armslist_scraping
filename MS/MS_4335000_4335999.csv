This model has Stainless Steel finish and was made in Israel. Magnum research is the importer for this pistol. Features include a 7 round magazine capacity, 6 inch barrel, Adjustable sights, Rear slide serrations, black polymer grip panel, Single action hammer fired semi auto, Ambidextrous manual safety, and has a 7/8 inch rib with cross slots for Weaver style rings. This model was produced between 1991 and 1995 by IMI in Israel. The serial number is 34200457. Condition is excellent, with only a few marks or flaws. The bore and chamber are very clean. The magazine has some wear from use, and on the base plate but a good cleaning should fix that. There is also a minor mark on the Stainless finish, on the left side of the pistol right below the front weaver cross slot. This was most likely from a scope ring that was removed at some point. The overall condition of this gun I would rate at 98%, however this auction is for the gun only plus 1 magazine, owners manual, and two hand tools. I do not have any additional accessories or a factory box. Message or call our store with any questions. Thank you for shopping with The Sportsman's Shop!"

I have a Marlin Model 336 in 30-30 caliber that I want to sale.
It is in good condition for being made in 1962 with the usual minor wear. This is a pre-64 model so is a little better made than the ones made after that.
This DOES have the JM stamp on the barrel.
There is some bluing missing on the top of the receiver where the scope can be mounted...worn off, not scratched off. Most of the bluing is in decent condition.
I want $400 and will meet within a reasonable distance.
I will answer all inquiries.
Thanks.

This gun has an interesting history. This version would be considered a ""Second Contract"" pistol. ""The Germans liked the Astra 600 well enough to place an initial order for 10,000 pistols.  These were in the serial number range of 501-10,500, delivered to the Germans and stamped with German waffenamts.   A second pre-paid order for over 40,000 pistols followed and Astra manufactured them, but the Allies invaded Europe and the Spanish were unable to actually deliver the guns to the Germans.  These so-called ""Second Contract"" pistols were never stamped with any Nazi markings or waffenamts.  After the war the Spanish government sold the unused 600's to the newly formed West German Police (so the Germans paid for them twice).  All the WW2 guns were manufactured in 1943, hence the 600/43 designation."" This gun is in great physical condition but most of the bluing has faded. Own a piece of WW2 history for a great price. Serial number is in the 56,000 range so this would have been one of the last ones to roll off the line in 1943."

249,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4335249,For Sale:  Webley Mark VI .455 1917 Naval Revolver With original web holster,"Cleveland, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 475,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 1, 2016",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,Revolver,"You are looking at the .455 Webley Mark VI. According to the original paperwork with the gun from Fort Bragg it was issued as a .45 acp but the markings bear the .455 designation. It is only recommended this gun fire the .455 ammo as it has been speculated that the .45 acp ammo is too high pressure. The gun is shaved to allow the firing of a .45acp round with a moon clip (not included). Do so at your own risk. This gun is in great shape for its age, has some metal gouging on the rear sight as pictured. A Brief History:  ""The .455 Webley Mark VI was the last of the large frame, big bore Webley revolvers. The series had originated in 1887 with the introduction of the Mark I revolver, itself evolved from the highly successful ""Bulldog"" pocket revolvers chambered for the earlier .450 Adams cartridge. The Mark VI, adopted in 1915 for the Great War (aka the First World War), was the largest of the .455 Webleys, having the previous Mark V's heavier frame and cylinder to handle the Mark II .455 Cordite cartridge and a longer six inch barrel. It also had a redesigned square butted grip, a departure from the classic bird's head grip found on all the previous models. Although a large frame revolver, it is surprisingly light. Following the First World War and the decision to replace the .455 with a lighter pistol in .38 caliber, it became the inspiration for the Webley Mk IV revolver chambered in .38 Smith & Wesson (aka the .38/200 S&W for its 200 grain bullet load), which was first rejected by the Royal Small Arms Factory and then shamelessly copied as the Enfield No. 2, Mark I (the Mark IV was later produced by Webley in 1942 to meet wartime demand). Although officially superceded by the .38 caliber Enfield No. 2 revolver in 1932, the big .455 Webley Mk VI remained in military service through World War II and briefly afterward."""

A thread protector was added to the gun. The HK45 comes with it's hard carry case, two 10rd magazines, lock, and all factory literature. Meprolight Tru Dot night sights are standard equipment on the gun. Tan Frame (V1) DA/SA, safety/decocking lever on left, with two 10rd mags
Originally developed for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition the new HK45 “Tactical” comes standard with a threaded barrel and Meprolight three-dot tritium night sights.
With a choice of three frame colors (green, tan, or black), the full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components.
The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.
The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy.
Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger.Come check this pistol out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte.

The heart of the 1918A3 is the receiver made from 8620 steel casting that has been carburized and induction heat treated. The castings are machined on state-of-the-art, CNC machining centers. Every rifle is fully assembled, inspected, test-fired and re-inspected under the direct supervision of our master armorer.

It weighs in at only 10.6 ounces, about the same as its Scandium Center Fire Magnum siblings from the Smith & Wesson line. This revolver features the standard groove rear sight, and a readily visible white dot front sight. The double action trigger pull is always stiff on Airlites, and that is necessary to produce sufficient firing pin pressure so that hard-primer ammo will ignite dependably. Manufacturer is Smith & Wesson of Springfield, MA. Type is double action only pocket revolver, internally hammer fired, with transfer bar internal safety. Construction is majority aluminum alloy, with steel inner barrel, cylinder chamber liners, blast shield, and internal parts including hammer and trigger. Barrel is 1.875 inch two piece, with 1:18.75 six groove right hand rifling, enclosed in a full lug alloy shroud. Sight is ramp type front XS white dot, with frame integral fixed notch rear. Trigger is MIM, Metal Injection Molded Steel .275 smooth faced combat, with a 15 pound vicinity double action pull. This revolver is not for the weak of hand, and the nature of the cartridge is such that not a lot can be done to lighten the trigger. Cylinder is swingout steel lined alloy, capacity 7 rounds of .22 Winchester Magnum caliber ammunition. In our experience with the models 650 and 651, an owner needs to keep the under side of the ejector star clean. Weight empty is only 10.6 ounces, and that is this powerful little revolver’s forte. Overall length is only 6 3/16 inches from the muzzle to the back bow of the grip frame. Grips are factory stippled texture combat boot type. A word about finish. In the lightweight Smith & Wessons, especially those with scandium, titanium, and high tensile aluminum alloy frames like these, carbon residue is a constant problem on the white finished revolvers. Black is better; black finish revolvers do not show carbon as bad as the white ones, and the carbon is extremely difficult to remove on scandium or titanium. The completely enclosed hammer makes this revolver desirable for two reasons; one, a frightened user cannot back the hammer, and the only way it will fire is a deliberate double action pull, and two, this Centennial configuration is ideal for pocket and purse concealment with ready, no-snag access.

A New Era of Perfection ""The beginning of a new era of perfection"", is how Blaser CEO Bernhard Knoebel has named the launch of the new Blaser bolt action rifle R8 in his preface of the fired-new catalog. For the past five years, there has been one lingering question for the hunters and engineers at Blaser, regarding the Blaser bolt action rifle R93: How can this technically superior concept be taken to the next level? In order to answer this question the Blaser engineers, most of them passionate hunters themselves, kept a close connection to hunters around the world in order to respond to their requests. Detachable Magazine When the development of the R8 actually started the detachable magazine was right at the top of the optimization list. Blaser found an ergonomically superior solution that essentially supports fast and intuitive handling. Magazine and trigger unit merged into one compact module. The magazine buttons are positioned right above the trigger guard. Thus, the magazine can be released blindly and within a split second. When removing the magazine, the R8 automatically de-cocks and once the magazine is removed, the cocking slide cannot engage anymore. Today, this is a very important safety feature securing the rifle against misuse by unauthorized persons. Blaser Precision Trigger The detachable magazine is just one of a multitude of innovations that turn the R8 into the new worldwide benchmark when it comes to bolt action rifles. Enhancing the reliable and precise performance of the trigger posed a very special engineering challenge that has been brilliantly mastered. The new Blaser Precision Trigger breaks crisp as glass at a trigger pull of 750 gram / 1 5/8 lbs. Thanks to its extremely short release time it turns the shooter’s thought impulse immediately into an accurate shot. The innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing, which marks the next leap in rifle technology. The desmodromic trigger mechanism offers unsurpassed reliability in extreme conditions such as freezing rain and blowing dust. Perfect Stock In order to make shooting with the R8 as comfortable and safe as possible, Blaser attached immense importance to optimizing the stock, reaching a new level of perfection here, too. Different from traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. This results in increased muzzle stability and a substantial reduction of felt recoil. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Design Besides achieving maximum performance, Blaser gave particular attention to superior style and design. Concave and convex lines discreetly shape the rifles appearance. Contours of stock, action, mount and bolt handle blend perfectly, giving the R8 a dynamic and unequaled elegance. ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE CALL OR TEST 1-9098336300. LUGARD.( jlugard30@yahoo.com)"

Chambering the popular and powerful .44 Magnum and 454 Casull rounds, the mighty 444 and 454 revolvers are built for a lifetime of tough use. Offering award-winning designs in four distinct barrel lengths, these monsters feature a crisp trigger break and smooth pull for accuracy, cushioned grips and factory porting to reduce felt recoil.Dual lockup cylinder-Provides stability under extreme chamber pressures.Porting-Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.Taurus Security System (TSS)rs-Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gunTransfer Bar-The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

These would be perfect on a traditional blued or other dark finish. 
They're cut for standard safety, and are standard thickness.
They have alternating layers of black and reddish wood, with the typical 1911 grip pattern of checkering and the double-diamond. 
For those not familiar, Dymondwood is a wood laminate that is created by mixing thin layers of wood and phenolic resin, under high pressure and heat, making a very hard wood-product that's very popular in knife scales and pistol grips, because it is very resistent to damage, and is totally unaffected my water, sweat, gun oils and cleaners, etc. 
It also doesn't dry out, shrink, or crack like regular wood grips will can eventually do.
The grips are in virtually brand new condition, asking $25,firm (and that's less than I paid).
This is a much better pic than the one I had before, but it still caught too much glare, but you get the idea. Click once on the photo for a larger view.

I have a Savage Arms 64, semiauto .22 long rifle, in fair condition. It was my first rifle.
It has a 10rd magazine and fires absolutely fine, putting rounds within a 50 cent peice circle at 175ft. Stock is synthetic. Can fit a scope on the built in rails (shown scope not included) and has a hollow stock (in which I store rounds and a cleaning kit).

It's not in the best shape, as I bought it in worst condition than it is now at a flea market from its previous owner. Slight pitting and rust on the barrel (but it's surface level and hard to see). I'd rather have a tube fed built action, so need to make room. Will throw in 50rds of .22LR to get you started."
