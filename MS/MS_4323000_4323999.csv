The only piece you need is the scope. I have a Leupold Mark 4 LR/T 3.5-10x40mm (#60020) with TMR recticle. I'd be willing to include it for additional $$. I'll even include the mounts.

This has been an excellent rifle for me. Shoots sub MOA (about .6-.8 MOA I'd say) and I've hit silhouettes out to 1,100 yards with it (that's about as far as my skill can take it but the rifle might go farther). I'm only selling it to help pay for a custom $4k rifle I'm having built.

This would make an excellent starter rifle for someone just getting into long-range shooting. Savage 10s are known for incredible out of the box accuracy. The Savage AccuTrigger is also known as the best factory trigger with about 1/5-2lb trigger pull currently set. Not as nice as a aftermarket Timney or Jewell but those cost $250 a pop.

A word about the stock. The stock is packed full of features. It has a detachable monopod (I'm not a fan of monopods for field work but its excellent for benchrest shooting or zeroing the rifle), reenforced fore-end to keep the barrel truly free-floating, pistol-grip and rear hand-hold. The length of pull and comb height can be swapped out for different sizes to get the perfect fit.

Like I said its been a great rifle. Its been great for both plinking and hunting.

I will ship for free to an FFL. Email with any questions."

Important note, be very careful with the scopes you see for sale on Armslist and other forums. There are a couple postings for scopes at too good to be true prices. Be warned these are too good to be true! These are knock-off scopes being sold from China that are not genuine. An easy way to tell is that these will typically come from unregistered users and when you email them they will reply with grammatically incorrect English and will be very eager to get your shipping information.

The coolness factor of these old .410's has to be seen to appreciate. This would make an outstanding squirrel/rabbit gun. It's high quality, old time craftsmanship that isn't to purdy to take in the woods. The receiver does have case-colors, making it one of the older production Stevens 311 .410's from the 50's - 60's.

I spent over a year putting this rifle together and have only have approximately 50 rounds through the barrel.  I built this rifle to shoot in F Class mid range but a couple things in my life haven't worked out as anticipated so I've decided to sell. I did not do much load development with it yet because I was just trying to put some rounds through it to break the barrel in.  It showed a lot of promise and was shooting very well with ammo that I loaded for a different barrel.  The rifle is ready to go except the paint has bubbled where it sat in padding in my case.  I was going to sand it down and have a local body shop paint it right but never got it done.  I would am looking for $1100obo.  I'll entertain any decent offers.  NO TRADES!!

This is an Ak platformed rifle that is built as ""sporting"" rifle to allow easier import into the USA. Although the receiver is stamped .223 alone it does allow 5.56. This was done to bypass the restriction on the importing of military chambered firearms. The rifle comes with 1 10rd magazine and 1 30rd magazine and sling. FYI the magaiznes for this rifle are specifically made for a Saiga so you cannot just use any AK type mag and are a little more expensive. I will only sell to PA residents (so please don't try if from another state) and if you are from PA I am willing to go to or meet within a 15 mile radius, any further and you will have to do the rest of the driving. I am willing to consider trades, I've had my eye on some H&K's lately(cash on my end depending on model) and also a lever action .357/.38 would be awesome ....NO A/R's!!.

You will notice the polymer furniture set on the rifle, this is NOT the cheapo sort you get if you buy the polymer model, it is a US made Hogue furniture set.  It is very comfortable and can take rail attachments.  This and the original wood set come with the rifle ($59.95 on Hogue's website).  The polymer TAPCO mag which the rifle was sold with and two high quality GRC metal mags will be included. [I will throw in additional metal mags for $15 each.]

I found this rifle to be an excellent mid-grade AK and it functions Serbian tough.  I'm not price-gouging, as the cheaper underfolder model goes for $649.95 of websites like J&G (before shipping, tax, or transfer fees) and there are some nice extras I've thrown in below cost to sweeten the pot.

Things are moving quickly!**

I have for sale a Saiga 7.62x39 AK.  These rifles are a stupendous variant of the AK species, with butter-smooth actions and excellent accuracy, without the sticker-shock you might get from an Arsenal.  Made in the Izhmash (now Kalashnikov Concern) company in Izhevsk, Russia, these are derived from the minds and machines who made the first AKs.  Their Russian pedigree also has branded them no longer importable, due to sanctions from newly brewing tensions with the US.  The rifles we have here are all that's left.

Despite the embargo and panic, I'm keeping the price low on this one (don't mind the crazies charging $850 for these unconverted, damn opportunists, they are), as I bought it from a friend who needed cash fast for way less than the going value.  I checked it over, and he wasn't lying-- it's barely used, he went to the range with it once.  I've kept it cased in a dehumidified area after giving it a cleaning and look-over.

This is in the unconverted style and takes proprietary Saiga magazines, the factory 10 rounder is included with this rifle.  If it was converted I'd price it closer to $900 (but you can do just that if you want after buying!).

I live in the Cheltenham area and am willing to travel a bit to meet for the sale.  Please have a PA DL to check and be willing to sign a bill of sale.

My number is 267-566-1O86.

Feel free to contact me by any method if you want more pictures or have questions.  I will keep the ad active if the gun is still available, don't send me a message just to ask if it is still up for sale!

For sale is a (Pre-64') J.C. Higgins Model 20-12, 12 gauge Pump Shotgun (Sears 583.2002). *Note - Per Serial # Lookup - Sears 583.2002 is a Model Year 1958*

Features a 28"" barrel with Full Choke.  Chambered in 2 3/4"". 

Overall Good condition for age, shows normal wear and tear with worn bluing on magazine tube and few minor dings and dents on wood furniture.  Anybody familiar with these shotguns (or High Standards, as I understand these were modeled after the Flight King 200), knows these guns were built like tanks and are notorious for having ""super slick"" actions (this particular gun is no exception). Overall this would make a very nice shotgun for someone looking for dependability without breaking the bank.

Gun was manufactured early in 1986, confirming that it's a PRE-BAN AR-15.  

I purchased this gun from SC State Police.  It appears to have been mostly arsenal kept, and had very little use.  Trigger breaks cleanly, and I swapped out the stock spring for a brass set to lighten trigger pull.  Barrel has 1/7 twist, so handles heavy projectiles and shoots 500 yards easily.  

I had started to make this my long range rifle, but started shooting shotgun.  Selling this to replenish the savings account after a recent purchase.  

$1200 buys the rifle, scope mount, Harris #5 swivel stud adapter, original springs and grip in addition to the brass springs and Hogue grip currently installed, 3 magazines (Colt 30-round, C products 30-round, Magpul 10-round), Caldwell brass catcher, and Plano case with foam cut to fit.  For an extra $150, I'll leave the Redfield Revenge 6-18x AO scope I currently have mounted.

I am happy to entertain a partial trade toward the purchase.  A couple ideas I would accept - SKS in excellent condition - nothing sporterized, just good wood with the 10 round box and bayonet still affixed.  S&W M&P Shield 40, Ruger GP101 or similar revolver in 357 Mag with a longer (6"" preferred) barrel and adjustable sights, or another good carry piece.  I'm open to some options, but not multiple trade items, as my primary reason for selling the gun is to replenish the savings account.

If in the Roanoke region (within about an hour's drive), sale will be face to face and I will see your concealed carry permit or voter registration and drivers license.  A Bill of Sale is required.  I will ship to your FFL if I can't drive to meet you.  $40 to ship.  Send a reply to this post, and it will find its way to my cell.
