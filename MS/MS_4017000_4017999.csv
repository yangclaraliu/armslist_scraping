Emergency Mylar Blanket, also called a solar blanket - the Mylar blanket can prevent you from losing body heat. Perfect for emergency protection in all weather conditions Waterproof windproof and reusable. Will not crack mildew or shrink Reflects 90 percent of your body heat back to you. Generous size 84""X52. Can be used as ground cover or signaling device for air support and makes an excellent signaling device like a signal mirror with thousands of angles. Complete thermal protection from rain and snow. Provides compact emergency protection in all weather conditions. Can be used to prevent and counter hypothermia by reducing heat loss from a person's body. Can be used to cover injured victims in order to help reduce shock. Can be used in a hot environment to provide shade as a shelter barrier. Works well as a water collector and makes a good sun shade. Excellent for scaring away bears and other predators when unfolded and shaken vigorously. Can be cut into a bandana to protect the head from sun, prevent heat loss, and protect the eyes against snow blindness (see-through, works just like sunglasses and can be layered for desired darkening) When sitting between an emergency blanket and a fire it makes a great reflector to keep you warm on all sides."

It is so RARE you have to buy one, only 700 Million of these were ever made so get yours while you still can haha.  Ok all joking aside now here it is. 

The rifle comes as shown with one Tapco 30rd magazine. It has a USA pistol grip, Tapco collapsible stock along with a Tapco trigger and a bolt in trigger guard.  The bullet guide is from Dinzag Arms and is drilled, tapped and a button head screw was used.  Price is $700 shipped or $675 FTF.  Your FFL must be able to recieve the rifle from a non FFL holder. If it has to be shipped from my FFL then you pay the extra shipping.  I can take extra pics if needed but I assure you the internals are all clean and the bore is bright and shiny. The rifle has around 750 rounds through it.

I planned on using this for squirrels and rabbit hunting, since this is 1200FPS it is more than enough for that, but have been looking in to .22's.

I was wondering if someone had a .22LR handgun they wouldn't mind doing a trade + cash. I am looking to trade, and spend about $100, so whatever you have in that price range I am open to hearing about. It can be revolver or a semi-auto, I am not going to be picky, but it has to be safe to operate.

You can swap out your 16"" barrel and go with a 12.5"" barrel in a matter of seconds if you choose to SBR it. It comes with the 300$ factory ares sights and the 750$ contract only full auto bolt carrier that ARES will not sell to ANYONE except for law enforcement or military. Seriously go try and buy one, I GUARANTEE you can't or I might as well give you mine. lol. The reason why the full auto bolt carrier is awesome is because it's heavier and better quality. The ARES Shrike also has the rack city feature like you would rack an AK47. It's a sidecocker. which makes it even more badass. Let's be honest, nobody likes standard AR15 charging handles. I bought this brand new for 2595 from ARES down at knob creek not including taxes. 

I wan't to keep it, but unfortunately my girlfriend wants to travel for spring break and I need some money. I don't want to get rid of this. I DON""T have to sell this as I'm selling a ton of other things. This would be last but if someone offers me my asking price, i'm unfortunately going to have to give it up. Hopefully someone buys something else from me, but if you're local and you have 2500$ to splurge like i did, best of wishes to you. Again, no trades, no low ball offers, and I will only meet face to face in a public location that is agreeable to me and the buyer. I will take ccw holders as priority over someone else, and you have to be a state of ohio resident, not a felon and above the age of 21 for legality sake. Last thing i want to do is sell to an idiot who is not allowed to possess a firearm. Abide by the terms and we're good. Thanks for looking.

The only flaw is one side of a sticker on it is starting to peel (who needs a sticker?) The Orion 80/I made by Zeiss/Eltro is a high-quality starlight night vision scope currently in use by the German Bundeswehr. This scope features high-tech XX1211 and XX 1340 image intensifier tubes, flash protection capabilities, reticle adjusters, focus knob, on/off button and shade control knob, reticle brightness knob and a rubber protection cover. Each scope comes with the original storage case and the following mounts: HK-made G3 claw mount with adapter plate MG3 Lafette tripod mount with adapter plate PzF 3/PzF 44 grenade launcher mount Quick-change adapter attached to the scope. This adapter can be mounted on a Picatinny rail (not included) and if it is removed it can be attached directly to a Stanag mount or to the G3 claw mount minus the adapter plate for a low-profile sighting picture. With a Stanag Scopes To Picatinny adapter like the A.R.M.S.#7 III Adaptor, this scope can be mounted on any rifle/shotgun, optionally you can spend $10 on Amazon to buy a UTG 2nd Gen STANAG To Picatinny Adaptor Mount to mount this on any firearm. This would make a DEADLY hog or yote night vision scope. I took it out to my property and had no problem identifying a human size target at 400 yards. I do not know what the maximum range would be but it is FAR better than gen 2 NVDs plus it is German made, so I am sure that it could take some serious abuse before it failed, unlike some of the new digital NV scopes. It is built for the recoil of a 7.62x51 Nato. It amplifies available light (starlight) it does not need any IR light but an IR light could be mounted on it, it is tapped for an accessory platform on top of the unit. It can also not be detected by night vision devices due to the lack of it using IR so if you are stealth hunting you can not be spotted by someone using a NVD. I hate to let it go but i need the money. When I can afford it again this is the exact model that I will be buying. Includes the original screwdriver and mounting screw pack, microfiber lens cleaning cloth.Listing as New old stock because I was told when i bought it that it was never issued, and I have never mounted it on a rifle, just tested it for function and have ran it for maybe 20-30 min checking it out. Has never been exposed to bright lights or daylight, works perfectly."

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hex wrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.

Purchased this rifle 1 year ago and the seller did not inform me that the rifle bolt head slides off the rail after 3-5 shots. I've put about 200 rounds through and safe to fire. Excellent long range precision, but had to endure the occasional frustration of snapping the bolt head back down on the rail. Trying to be an honest broker here as I sell the rifle, so selling for less than my original purchase price...Great condition all around save for the mentioned issue and a local gunsmith gave me the diagnosis that the rifle after 2-300 more rounds will have enough wear for a shim. Truly enjoyed this beauty (they are getting harder to find unmodified) but looking to purchase another vintage battle rifle with the Enfield sale as purchase $$$. $275 is a firm price.

When life throws you a curve… Wouldn’t you know it, I acquire a nice long range 308 for the range only to have my neighbor walk down to tell me that they are getting prepared to move to a retirement community.  He proceeds to tell me that he is going to sell 16 of his firearms as he will not have a need for them and the kids don’t shoot.  Long story short I will be getting all of them thus I no longer need the Remington 700 SPS as he has 2 threaded R5’s (308 and 300 win mag) that will be mine by the end of the month.  As such I will be selling the Customon Remington 700 sps I acquired from Derrick.

It has the heavy 26” with a 1-12 twist chambered in 308.  This model came with the x-mark pro adjustable trigger. The rifle currently has an Archangel stock with built-in bipods. The scope is a Millett 4x16 50 mm mil dot scope. The original rifle box, scope box and rifle stock come with the rifle.  

Per the original owner - rifle is put together to reach out there and touch something. He said he put 10 rounds thru the rifle to sight it in.  I put another 5 thru it last night prior to cleaning, oiling and storage in the safe."

Description below:

FABULOUS Winchester Model 1894 Carbine Limited Edition I, manufactured in 1977 - 78 as a limited edition of 1,500. Winchester combined richly colored and highly figured American walnut with deeply blued and gold plated metals to produce an heirloom collectible centered on the legendary Model 1894 lever action carbine chambered in the .30-30 caliber. The receiver features deep relief John Ulrich pattern engraving with game scenes on both sides of the receiver. The accompanying Winchester booklet states that the engraving is “a classic reproduction of one of the finest styles developed under John Ulrich at the start of the 20th century. American-style scroll-work and animal scenes became a recognition point of supreme quality.” The receiver, barrel band and lever are gold plated with a soft luster matte finish. The wonderful stocks are XXX fancy walnut with a fine, multi-point checkered walnut forearm and straight grip stock. The butt stock is graced with a smoothly curved crescent, steel buttplate. The 20 inch blued, round barrel is mounted with a ramped, adjustable buckhorn rear sight and a blade front sight. Two blued barrel bands hold the barrel to the forearm and to the cartridge tube magazine. The barrel is inscribed on the right rear side with “LIMITED EDITION BY WINCHESTER” in cursive script. This beautiful rifle comes with a fitted presentation case that appears to be walnut topped, with mahogany sides and bottom. The case interior is lined in wine colored fabric. Includes a covered compartment for a box of cartridges (not included) or accessories. Leather ""Winchester"" label on the inside of the top. The case has three brass latches with the center one incorporating a key lock. The bottom of the case is covered in green felt. Case dimensions are: length at 42 ½ inches; width at 10 3/8 inches; height at 3 1/8 inches. Papers include: Winchester Limited Edition booklet, serialized in hand to the rifle; a letter from Phil H. TBD, President of Olin Winchester Group indicating that this Winchester was manufactured on February 22, 1978; 13 cent address envelope to be used to order a custom brass name plate for the case; Winchester “Sporting Arms Purchase Card”. Complete with original box numbered to the rifle and sleeve, and case shipping box. Rifle Weight is approximately 6 pounds 5 ounces. LOP is approximately 13 ¼ inches. New in case, with only the slightest handling/storage marks overall. The case is excellent with a few scattered handling marks. This is one of the finest examples of this Limited Edition that we have offered."

Up for sale today is a used Colt Sistema 1911 from Argentina, which was introduced in about 1927. It comes with one standard 1911 magazine with matching serial numbers. The reason I am selling this is because I just recently got a hold of another 1911 and would not like this to sit in my safe and rot. 

The serial number for this 1911 matches to the late year of 1960. 

The Colt Sistema has an interesting history that some might enjoy, and the overall condition of this 1911 is average. I have shot this handgun about 200 times. It comes with a small handgun case and some older printed information from the previous owner if you would like that as well.

I am asking for 650 for this one, but can entertain offer.

I would like to request that you are a resident of the state of Virginia, have a valid Driver's License, and a CCW.

Pictures will be uploaded soon."

That part was made by Midwest Industies. Every part of this rifle is in beautiful shape and shoots like a dream.

This was imported by century in the early 2000's, but I believe its all Indep/FMP (Portuguese) made, and converted to semi auto for import. The quality is directly comparable to H-K guns, not like most of the ones built in this country from parts. The welds, finish and overall quality are excellent. Price includes 15 magazines, mainly HK mags with perhaps one or two Reinmetal mags. I believe all were new or like new when I aquired them. Also have an HK made collapsing stock I'll sell with the gun for an extra $125.

 When I first had this gun I shot an 1 1/4"" 5 shot group with iron sights and Hirtenberger ammo. It has functioned perfectly in the approximately 600 rounds fired through it. Its been all Hirtenberger, South African, or Portuguese brass case ammo I've shot.

 The 922R compliance stock that came on the gun looked cheap, it now has a high quality US made stock that is exactly like the German made HK stock, and also bought high quality US made hammer and trigger, and I believe cocking handle. The muzzle brake is as it came for 922R purposes. I modified the front sight ring from full ring to open protective ears.

 I will sell to the buyer one or two cases of South African or Portuguese ball ammo for 55 cents/rd ($550/1000). Ammo is brass case berdan primed non corrosive and in battle packs. I'm ONLY interested in selling the ammo with the gun or after the gun is sold.

 Price includes shipping by US mail to your FFL. Prefer they accept from individual. Other shipping methods will be extra. Ammo will ship UPS and actual shipping costs are extra."

It was purchased from Builders Hardware here in Charlotte. It was ordered with the following upgrades.
1 Grade 3 wood instead of grade 2 that came standard on all Super Grades.
2 Winchester Custom Shop Island Express Safari sights no longer made due to cost.
3 Kickeez recoil pad.
The stock has fantastic figure and color thru out the blank and only very minor handling marks. The bluing is mint except for one small rub on the floor plate. The bore is perfect and the rifling looks like it was cut yesterday. I know for a fact the gun has been fired less than 50 times since new. The rifle has been very well cared for by the owner.
Rifle comes with the dealer hanging tag and owners manual. Also comes with a hand fitted Browning model 1915 safari case. The case is in mint condition and was purchased from the same dealer in the early 70s. This case is like new and comes with the Browning instruction manual and care card and both locking keys. I have seen some of these sell before but not one that looks like its brand new with all paper work and both keys. Will also come with a hand tooled Torel Cape Buffalo sling that was purchased along with the case. Will include one box of vintage Winchester Western 458 solids and one box of empty's.

I had assumed it was a stainless model, however, after speaking to the Custom Shop Director and Senior Gunsmith at SIG SAUER learned it is in fact a low-glare nickel variant of which very few were ever produced.

Hogue grip cover, green nylon Romanian sling and front sight tool also included. Cleaning kit in butt stock. Metal finish is typical of the SAR series rifle. A few very minor dings in the stock and hand guard. Excellent bore. Front sight is straight, but right ear is bent slightly out. Will need to be heated and pushed left. One spot on bottom of barrel from resting on nylon bag after firing. Will wipe off when reheated. Overall, a pretty nice example of a no longer imported Romanian factory rifle.

Since 1959 the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on should they have to punch out over a remote area. Through the years the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5"" long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It's chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.

When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that's coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. It's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

The receiver is also coated with Teflon for superior weatherproofing and waterproof protection, even in harsh saltwater environments. The updated receiver is grooved, making it easy to top off with your favorite optics.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in two finishes; Black and Mossy Oak Break-Up Camo Pattern. All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight.

This pistol has all the features you expect to find.

If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

I made a few changes. It includes an Ed Brown grip safety with memory groove, an Ed Brown trigger, an Ed Brown extended thumb safety, a Wilson Combat Deluxe commander style hammer, Wilson Combat Factory Plus firing pin, Wilson Combat Factory Plus pluger spring assembly, and new 3 dot sights. Also included is the factory storage box and manual. And special feature, a Milt Sparks Summer Special II holster. 

This was my daily carry for a few years and it shows the wear. But it hasn't been shot too much, < 1500 rounds, probably closer to 1000. The pistol functions perfectly with a new recoil spring. Like most .45 compacts, it eats recoil springs fairly quickly. I swap them out about every 300-400 rounds to ensure good function. 

$550, located in Las Vegas. I know there can be resistance to modified handguns. But this has been tested and passes. 100% money back guarantee if it fails to function properly."

He was a blacksmith and machinist by trade.  I have shot the gun several times and it functions perfectly but shaves a little lead due to minor timing issue.  In this condition the gun would sell for $1500.00 up.  I realize the conversion has devalued the historic value of the gun somewhat so I am asking $600.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters."

A self defense rifle has to perform the first time, every time. The ultra-reliable A.R.G.O. system incorporated into the new Benelli MR1 does it for the U.S. military, and makes the MR1 the best home defense rifle available. MR1 self defense guns are chambered in 5.56 mm NATO (.223 Remington) and use the battle-proven Auto Regulating Gas Operated (ARGO) system—the same system developed by Benelli for the M1014 (M4) and used for over a decade in multiple conflicts by the United States Marine Corps."

For sale is a one-owner Ruger New Model Super Blackhawk .44 Magnum revolver with a 7.5” barrel.  I am the original owner.  It is in very nice condition and functions perfectly.  There is no rust and the bluing is almost 100%.  The serial no. is 83-44XXX, which means it was made in 1983.  I have only shot approximately 500 rounds through it.  It has not been modified in any way, other than adding the Pachmyer grips.  Unfortunately I cannot locate the original wood grips, but they are available on Ebay.  The attached photos show the actual pistol for sale and were taken on February 10, 2015.

The pistol is available for face-to-face cash purchase and pickup in Kennewick, WA.  I do not want to go through the time and hassle of mailing the pistol.  And I am not interested in any trades.  Sorry!

The background check that is now required in Washington by Initiative 594 and subsequent transfer of the gun to the buyer can be performed at the Hole in the Wall gun shop in Kennewick, WA.  The fee is $25.00, payable by the buyer.  The process is no big deal.  It can be done as quickly as a normal check on a new purchase, only you SAVE BIG by buying used!!!

Anyway, give me a call at the number listed below if you have any questions or would like to arrange to purchase the pistol.  To avoid having to bargain on the price at the gun store doing the transfer, my price is firm at $425, which is a good deal.  I checked and there is no sales tax on the private sale, even though the transfer occurs at a gun store.

Thanks for looking!

It's a blue sedan with an automatic. It has a clean title and runs well. If I hadn't just bought a new car a couple months ago, I would've taken it on my holiday drive up north without hesitation. 

It's an automatic sedan, has power windows / locks, stereo with a 6-cd changer and a Sirius radio that works well but isn't currently activated. It has new plugs / wires, a relatively new battery, had the muffler replaced a couple years ago. This car has been in my family since new and was never beat on.

There are some issues though: The driver's door is stuck closed, the latch in the door needs to be replaced. It needs tires, they were holding air with slow leaks (lost about 10PSI overnight) but I honestly haven't tried refilling them since they went flat over my vacation - they're old / dry, not worn down bare or anything. It will probably need brakes soon, last time I had new pads in the front / the drums looked at was about 30k / 4 years ago. There are some dents and scratches, the paint is a bit sun faded, the interior could use a cleaning, but it's not a 'junk' car by any means.

If someone took the time to slap some tires on it and fix the door, this thing will run another 16 years without a problem. Hell, strip it out and turn it into a track car, I just don't want to be bothered with it anymore.

I'd like to trade for a decent 1911 but I'm open to any interesting trade offers, just shoot me an email and let me know what you're thinking."

This is a muzzle loading double barrel 10 gauge, proofed at the Birmingham Arms House from 1868 to 1875. I included a picture of the proof with the 12 that is needed to date this gun. On the side is engraved Kettridge Company, but they were only an importer. One hammer needs some work, but this gun is stout. If you know about the Birmingham Arms House, you know they triple loaded a gun and fired it to make sure the Damascus steel was strong enough. I would bet a lot that this is still a shooter...... or restore it and resell it for thousands. I just don't have the time."
