I am selling for $600 which is below the MSRP price but what makes this a steal is that I'm not just giving the buyer the gun, case and the 7 round magazine that it came with but it also comes with custom grips made by VZ Grips (the best 1911 grips on the market), 1 10 round Chip McCormick magazine, 1 10 round Wilson Combat magazine, and a custom kydex holster in the ""Typhoon"" Kryptek pattern. In total the buyer will be paying $600 for items that total around $850."

We start with certified USA 7075 T6 billet aluminum and hold it to an extremely tight tolerance of .0005 using our precision Computer Numeric Controlled (CNC) mill. Our Precision Matched Rings are kept in pairs throughout the manufacturing process — ensuring perfection from one set to another. These Vortex rings are then serialized, vibratory tumbled, hand-bead blasted and finished off with a Type III hard coat anodize.
These Vortex Precision Matched Rings position the center of the riflescope tube at a height of 0.97 inches (24.64 mm) from the base. Will only work with Picatinny spec mounts—will not work with Weaver mounts. Sold two rings per package. Hex wrench included.

We can furnish photos of any exact specimen upon request. Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number of virtually identical shotguns we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges. This is not a comfortable shooting weapon, even if someone is doing varmint control with Super Light 2 3/4 inch shells, but a powerful one. For a good balance between firepower and felt recoil, a 3 inch Magnum load with 1 1/4 oz. BB Steel Shot delivers 90 Pellets at 1400 feet per second from the muzzle and that figures the rough equivalent of 2 boxes of .17 Mach II bullets all in one shot. Consumers must be at least 21 years of age to own one of these, any shotgun with a pistol grip has Federal Status as a hand gun for age requirement purposes. This is Mossberg's Cruiser Grip shotgun, the Persuader 12 gauge pistol grip variant of the tried-and-true Model 500 slide action with tang safety, easily employed by Left Handed Shooters. The Persuaders are virtual duplicates of the proven Mossberg military 500 and 590 models. Factory specs are: double slide bar pump shotgun; 12 gauge 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells; 18 1/2 inch Cylinder Bore Barrel; blue finish metal with black polymer trigger group housing, and with matching high impact black corncob type polymer forend and pistol grip; weight 5 3/4 pounds empty; capacity 5 + 1 with 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 + 1 with 3 inch magnums; overall length 28 3/4 inches. This specimen is what we call a factory demo, a showpiece for Mossberg’s sales team that has been in Mossberg Corporate custody until we got it. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. This 500 Cruiser has a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. We have even outfitted it with a matching trench type heat shield. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times. We’re offering the shotgun in the photos or one of its substantially identical mates for only $ 259.00. Buyers must be at least 21 Years of Age; the Cruiser grip gives this shotgun Other Weapon status on the 4473 form. Local pickup by a civilian non dealer has to be a Tennessee Resident.

Photo specimen is representative from a handful of virtually identical shotguns, all of them are within 5 percentage points on their finish grade, excellent condition. We can furnish photos of any exact specimen upon request. Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number of virtually identical shotguns we might have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges. The Mossberg model 500 has never been as prestigious as the arch-competitor Remington 870, but it’s just as tried, and just as true. Here is an excellent specimen of their traditional, attractive model 500 All Purpose 12 gauge pump. Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Model is 500 All Purpose, factory sku is 50120. Type is pump or slide action shotgun. Construction is steel barrel and working parts all built into an alloy receiver that undercuts the 870 on weight, with cut checkered semi gloss finish hardwood stock and forend. Finish is blue steel barrel, black anodized receiver, and chrome plated bolt and shell carrier. Trigger group housing is high impact black polymer, with .292 smooth faced gold plated trigger. Safety is top tang type. Chambering is 12 gauge; Barrel is 3 inch chambered blued steel, 28 inch Ventilated Rib, with 16 Ports for recoil reduction. Choke tube is marked as modified, but it measures .715 vicinity, something we call Improved Cylinder, steel, slug, and buckshot permissible. Accu-choke threads on the 500s are the same as old style Winchester Win-Choke and old style Browning Invector. Sight system is 12 post serrated top Ventilated Rib with brass center bead and ivory colored front bead sight. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 rounds of 3 inch shells, and the distinctive Mossberg adapter plug is included to bring a hunter in compliance with 2+1 shot regulations. Weight empty is 7 1/2 pounds, with center of gravity about 1 inch forward of the receiver. Buttstock measures 13 7/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch brown rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. This model 500 comes to us from Mossberg’s distribution system. It is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or a showgirl at a Firearms Industry trade show. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. This model 500 comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times. Replacement pricing on mossberg com is over $400 on this shotgun. We’re offering the Mossberg 500 in the photos, however, or one of its substantially identical mates, for only $ 229.00. This shotgun comes with only one Accu-Choke tube, and no wrench. A quarter works well enough.

For those wanting/needing a lead-free, HEAVY 357 Magnum load, generating full power plus, here it is.

Below are real world velocities taken from my personal stock guns. The industry established use of long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings is essentially misleading to the public who won’t be firing the ammo from a laboratory test barrel in the real world, where it matters.

1947 fps—Marlin mod 1894, 18 inch barrel
1518 fps—S&W mod 27, 5 inch barrel
1519 fps—S&W MT Gun, 4 inch barrel
1436 fps—S&W mod 66, 3 inch barrel
1385 fps—S&W mod 66, 2.5 inch barrel
You’ll notice the newer S&W 4 inch Mt. Gun, gave higher velocities than the older 5 inch mod 27 S&W. This is because of different internal barrel dynamics and chamber dimensions of the newer gun. In general, the newer S&W revolvers are made to tighter tolerances than those of 30+ years ago.

Due to the long-for-weight all copper bullet, the 357 does not have the case capacity to use a bulky flash retarded powder and thus there is a noticeable muzzle flash with this load in all the test revolvers, however the rifle shows no flash at all due to its longer barrel.

This load is the typical barn-burning, turbo charged, Buffalo Bore type HEAVY 357 Mag. load and as such, should only be used in revolvers made of all steel. It should not be fired in light weight, alloy framed or cylindered revolvers. Feel free to use it in ANY/ALL 357 mag. chambered rifles and all steel revolvers/handguns."

The 10.5"" barrel is Black Nitride / melonite treated which is more accurate and lasts longer than chrome lined. The extremely lightweight 10"" MCSR V2 Keymod rail has a 1.8"" inside diameter to accommodate suppressors. The Seekins adjustable gas block is over $60 alone and offers you complete tuning capabilities (see below).

This is an awesome package and it is brand new, never fired, $500 cash. Or I might trade for a decent 1911, S&W stainless .357 or larger caliber revolver, other quality pistol or revolvers, Mossberg SPX, AK, Mini 14, or ?

From the manufacturer:
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block lets you to fine tune your rifle's gas system for smoother cycling and operation. Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability.
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block.
Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes.

The MCSR V2 rail is comfortable, extremely light weight modular rail system that will work in any situation as well as comfortably fit a suppressor inside the rail. The MCSR V2 was designed to make using a quick mounted suppressor easy to install or remove while inside the rail.
The MCSR V2 rail is designed so that the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions will accept all keymod accessories and have two anti-rotation QD positions per side (6total). The internal dimension has increased to 1.8"" to accommodate most suppressors on the market."

Like the new Citori Micro Midas, the new Silver Hunter Micro Midas gas-operated autoloader is trim, lightweight, easy to shoulder and swing and ideal for the smaller shooter. Here is the opportunity to purchase a deluxe autoloader with all the features you need to have a reliable, successful day in the field.

Its semi-humpback design, which refers to the pistol grip and rear of the receiver area, allows a sure grip for smaller hands. Additionally, the lightweight profile barrel helps pick up the ivory front sight bead very quickly. Shouldering, the grip, sight plane and weight are all critical factors when selecting any shotgun, either for youth and ladies or for adults. The Silver Hunter Micro Midas becomes the only real choice because of its compact and lightweight handling. The finely cut checkering on the grip and forearm also help to better control the gun."

There was going to be 1500 knifes made. The information got mixed up, or Paragon didn't care, and they started making the first run of them as automatic knives. Ruger recalled as many of the knives as they could from distributors, stores, and anyone they could track down so they could buy them back. They didn't want an automatic knife out there with their name on it as they only intended to have a rugged manual folder. Less than 100 of the first production autos made it out, but nobody knows for sure how many are left after Ruger recalled a good bit of them. 

Well here is one of the ones that never was recalled. It is in like new condition and comes with the original box. The only mark on the knife is on the back of the blade from rubbing on the inside of the handle. It isn't much of a mark, but most of the ones I have seen have the same mark. 

This is a first production run that was very limited and you can see the custom laser engraving on the left side of the blade. 

The action is very FAST on this knife and the lockup is rock solid. Just like every Paragon knife that was produced and collected. Paragon went out of business and is now owned by Asheville Steel. 

Price is $350

I have about $2,000 invested in it when you add up the trigger job.  I love the rifle and I saved my pennies for  it but I just can't get use to it,  I guess I'm just not a military rifle kinda guy, I've only shot 2 boxes of 55gr thru it and it's been a safe queen since.  I DO NOT EXPECT TO GET 2000 OUT OF IT,  let's face it AR prices have dropped but if I could get a couple 17's or 22mags or some other small varmint caliber that would work for me & my wife to hunt coon, Fox,  bobkats, coyotes & such I'd be happy.  I'm pretty sure this AR would be too much gun for coon, Fox or bobkats.  I'll listen to any offers you got and we can always haggle."

Started out as a base model Stag Mod 2 that has been added to.  All factory furniture has been replaced with magpul, grip, forend, and ACS stock.  Has a Vickers Tactical two point sling that I added Magpul MS3 hardware to so now it functions as a two point/one point convertible sling.  Has a BCM Gunfighter charging handle and a Surefire Procomp muzzle brake/compensator that does an excellent job at reducing recoil and muzzle rise.  Originally was running it with an optic but I have switched it back to iron sights and it is fairly light weight if that's important to you.  Will also come with a Condor Tactical chest rig that will hold ten magazines, multiple pistol mags, and a vertical universal pistol holster that will hold just about anything, even handguns with lights.  Will come with ten magazines, six magpul and four GI's, and about 300 rounds of Tula 223.

This has been an excellent, 100% reliable rifle for me with zero malfunctions of any kind, has had around a thousand rounds through it of mixed brass and steel, so it is not picky.  If you aren't familiar with STAG they make very high quality rifles and are a contract parts manufacturer for many of the big name AR producers on the market now.  Totally mil spec, chrome lined barrel, M4 feed ramps, MPI inspected BCG, and just about everything else you could want in an AR. Only thing I can say against it is that it has some scuffs on the left side of the receiver from rubbing against gear.

I'm looking to switch things up, so I would be interested in a partial trade for a quality AK47, primarily one of Yugo manufacture (absolutely no WASR's).  Would also be interested in partial trade for a quality 9mm, particularly a SIG P226 229 or M11, HK VP9, or Beretta 92.  might consider a commander length 1911.

If you'd prefer to buy It sell for $1100, fairly firm on price, I have over $1400 in it.  

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

We are selling:  German Youth Rifle, .22 LR caliber, manufactured by Deutsche Werke, Werk Erfurt, Germany between 1919 and 1939. Because it has a low serial number, I think it's closer to 1919--But I am no expert.  Single-shot, tip-up breech for loading and ejecting shell; with bolt pull for cocking and safety. Deutsche Werke logo - a stylized ""D"" being formed by what is referred to as a ""dormant lion"" with the tail forming the ""belly"" of the D - inside a circle on breech-block and left side of stock. The left barrel reads ""CAL .22 LONG RIFLE"". The right hing plate is stamped ""D.R.P./Germany"" for Deutsche Reichspatent (Patented in Germany). The breech block is stamped ""Mod. / I under the logo mentioned above.  Our rifle has strap holders on the stock and barrel  I have not seen those on other (same) rifles.  

I have not and will not test the rifle.  I can tell you it clicks when the trigger is pulled so I have every reason to think the firing pin is working.  (Maybe it shows that I don't know a lot about guns?)

Deutsche Werke AG was originally a factory that made torpedoes and later submarines for the German Kriegsmarine; they also produced motorcycles and diesel engines. The former Royal Prussian rifle factory at Spandau was once a part of Deutsche Werke (German Works)."

I am really interested in any ww2 era rifles or firearms. Even collectables such as ammo or bayonets, helmets,  etc. Primarily looking for a mosin nagant 91/30 though. If anyone wants a practical carbine instead of the long wall hanger, let me know. Thank you! Will sell with 80 rounds of surplus for 200. Yes they are 99 dollars on some websites, and they are very hit and miss. I've seen them with almost completely broken in half stocks. With shipping and transfer you're getting close and it's a hit miss deal.  This one shoots great with good wood and has some ammo.

Its technical layout is mostly the same as the earlier SSG's, and it sports a single-stage, direct trigger and a short top MIL-STD-1913 ""Picatinny"" rail allowing the installation of commercial or military-grade optical sighting systems.
The stock is quite a different deal though: the Steyr Mannlicher SSG Carbonis built out of a chassis that's thermally-molded out of a carbon-based sheet molding compound (SMC) whose raw form reminds glass-reinforced plastic rolls.
When this material is thermally treated to manufacture the stock of the SSG Carbon rifle, the carbon particles distribute in an uniform manner all throughout its surface. This allows extreme tension and pressure strength in all three axes, while maintaining a low weight: the average weight for the Steyr Mannlicher SSG Carbon rifle is around 5 kilograms/11 pounds, with variations in the order of a few hundred grams depending from caliber and barrel lenght.

 






Steyr Mannlicher's SSG Carbon bolt-action rifle sports a cold hammer-forged, high-accuracy rifle available in three different lenghts: 508mm/20"", 600mm/23.6"", and 690mm/27.2""; overall lenght ranges between 118,6cm./16.7"" and 128,7cm./50.7"", accordingly.
The Steyr Mannlicher SSG Carbon rifle feeds through a detachable magazine, whose capacity varies depending from which one of the four available calibers is in use: both .243 Winchester and 7.62x51mm/.308 Winchester caliber magazines will hold ten rounds; .300 Winchester Magnum caliber magazines will hold eight rounds; and .338 Lapua Magnum caliber magazines will hold six rounds.
Other factory features of the Steyr Mannlicher SSG Carbon rifle include a front spike mount for an upfolding bipod, an ergonomically-shaped pistol grip, and a totally adjustable stock with integrated adjustable cheekriser. Additional MIL-STD-1913 ""Picatinny"" rails can be installed to the handguard through drilled and tapped attachment points to allow the installation of third-party tactical accessories."

860,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4130860,"For Sale:   Steyr Scout, Mud","Fayetteville, Fayetteville, Arkansas","$ 1,625","Listed On: Sunday, April 17, 2016",Rifles,Steyr                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"BESSEMER, Alabama - Steyr Arms announced today that it has expanded its Scout Rifle line with the introduction of OD Green and “MUD” stock variants, both of which are now on American soil.

Steyr’s OD Green was first used more than 40 years ago on the legendary SSG 69 tactical rifle. OD Green was rebooted last month with the introduction of the AUG A3 M1 rifle, and it is now available as a standard stock-color option for the Scout. The new MUD color offering is similar to the familiar field dark earth color, and it also now available on the Scout Rifle.

The Steyr Scout was the result of a unique and nearly decade-long collaboration between scout-rifle-concept creator Lt. Col. Jeff Cooper and Steyr Mannlicher, GmbH. The lightweight, .308-caliber bolt-action, all-purpose Steyr Scout rifle can accept a low-powered, forward-mounted scope for accurate fire and both-eyes-open operation to detect flanking dangers. Backup “ghost-ring” iron sights integrated to the top rail can be deployed within seconds should the optics fail.
In keeping with Cooper’s requirement for a magazine cutoff, Steyr incorporated a two-position magazine system that allowed the rifle to be fed individually with the five-round magazine in a lowered position. The magazine could be seated one step further with minimal pressure, allowing the bolt to feed cartridges directly from the magazine. A second five-round backup magazine is contained in the buttstock.
The Scout Rifle also features a bipod that is seamlessly integrated to the stock when closed. Five sling-swivel attachment points allow the addition of Cooper’s favored Ching Sling on either side of the rifle.
Measuring just 39.4 inches and weighing in at 6.6 pounds, the Steyr Scout also features a fluted 20-inch cold-hammer-forged barrel."

HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. Pistol is Variant 1 double action/ single action with ""SAFE position. A control lever (manual safety/decocking lever) is positioned on left side of frame.

The Colt 1862 Police Percussion Revolver is considered by many collectors as the epitome in development of the cap and ball revolvers. Manufactured from 1861 until approximately 1873, it was designed in response to the demand for pocket pistols by both civilians and the police force. One enduring legend states that 1862 Police Percussion Revolvers were particularly popular with Civil War Officers who, rather than using them in combat, relied on them as a defense against over-zealous surgeons determined on amputating a limb on the battlefield.
