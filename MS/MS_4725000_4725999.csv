143,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4725143,"For Sale:  Magpul UBR Stock, Magpul MIAD Pistol Grip and sling for your AR","Helena Valley, Helena, Montana",$ 240,"Listed On: Saturday, October 24, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This ad is for one stock and one grip in either black or FDE. Buy this set and I will toss in a Black Rain Ordnance Single point sling(real nice). I have a couple of these sets left over so they are available. Total value is well over $320.00. Please include your phone number if you would like a response, to many scammers. I check my email twice a day, morning and evening. Can do shipping in a medium flat rate box for around $14.00, I believe. I will check on other shipping options. Price for the stock, grip and sling is $240.00 not including shipping if desired. 

From Magpul: The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand. https://www.magpul.com/products/ubr-collapsible-stock

The MIAD (MIssion ADaptable) Grip is a drop-in replacement for the standard AR15 grip. It is designed to improve ergonomics with interchangeable front and rear straps for personalized hand fit, an aggressive texture for positive weapon control, and is compatible with all Magpul grip cores to adapt to various storage needs. Made in U.S.A.


From me: You either need a stock to be solid and dependable, or you want a little more; there is very little in between, because the people that need a stock to stand up to breaching, shouldn't be buying a budget stock. This stock is one of Magpul's finest offerings and its retail price reflects that, but you get a dependable, tough, butt stock that can get you out of a pinch and you're not going to have to worry if it will or won't perform. Fit and finish are typical high quality Magpul and the UBR is solid as a rock. If you're looking for more than a shoulder prop, this is the stock you should buy.

I do not have the factory box for the stocks, as I had a number of these shipped to me in one box to save on shipping. These are the real deal, not knock off or reproductions. You have my guarantee. Let me know if you have any questions, I can send additional photo's as well."

178,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4725178,For Sale/Trade:  16x7 heavy duty tandem axle trailer,"Narrows, VA 24124, Roanoke, Virginia",$ 750,"Listed On: Friday, September 25, 2015",Farming,Mossberg                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"I have a trailer that I have been building for quite some time and have decided to part ways. The main frame was salvaged from a old mobile home and then braced with 6 very heavy walled square crossbeams. The deck is made of true 2"" thick rough sawed pine and treated with many coats of Thompsons to ward off rot. Overall deck length is 16 foot, with 12 foot being full width, and the overall width is 7 foot, with 6 1/2 foot between the inside rail lips. This trailer has dual 6600 lb axles, front axle has 12"" electric brakes, all new brake parts, new 2800 lb rated 6 lug hubs and brake drums (cost me over $400 from Northern Tool), good 2800 lb rated 225/75-15 trailer tires (not car tires) and each of the 4 springs are rated at 3000 pounds. Also included is one pair of heavy duty homemade ramps that hook to the rear lip on the deck, ramps are made from the same mobile home steel with deck boards carriage bolted to them. The trailer comes with a 2 5/16"" coupler and a pair of magnet towing lights that require a 4 wire flat plug. The hitch height sits at 22"" for a level deck when unloaded, so your tow ball should be around that same height.

This trailer is not just some slap together hack job. I actually took the time to make sure the frame was completely square, the center point of the axles is exactly where it should be and perfectly matched from side to side. The hitch is perfectly centered and level with the frame. When on level ground the trailer will sit level without the jack, that way when properly loaded your tongue weight is acceptable and your vehicle just has to pull the trailer and leave all the hauling to the trailer's suspension.

What the trailer needs:
Permanent lighting
Lights and brakes wired
Fenders if you desire them (standard 66"" long tandem fenders will do it)
Titled (I have always used it with a ""FARM USE"" tag)

I will take $750 cash or trade"

Im sort of a big guy   so I increased the grip length to fit in better with my sword collection. Honestly I dont even like guns im more of a sword guy so id really just like to get this off my hands so I can by a nice wastahsi made cold steel. My other cold steel like my chinese great war sword is pretty great, i mean i could easily draw it faster than this ruger.

This was a SHOT show special in 2014. 
Ported 32"" barrels, High rise rib, adjustable comb. Has all the case candy plus !!
I'm including 2 extra skeet chokes, A Browning sock, and three boxes of shells.
I love the gun, my scores jumped as soon as I got it. But I just don't have time to get out to the Sporting clays course. I barely have time for a couple rounds of skeet and my 28 is OK for that.

It comes with 2 more triggers, hex wrenches, multiple site replacement cores, barrel locks  and the choke wrench. Everything you see in the photo except the red backdrop!

I have three boxes of shells left over and I sure won't need them so the new owner gets them too.

The only ""flaws"" are the tiny knick/grooves in the comb. I tried to get the light on them in the inset photo in upper right so you can see them. They are hard to see, but I thought I should point it out.

Oversized roller
Short reset kit 
light firing pin block spring

I've also installed the CGW P series sight set with black rear and fiber front.  All the internal parts have polished.  This gun will cost you $775 if you bought it from Cajun.  I'm including a total of 5 19 round magazines, a Dara kydex holster, and all of the original parts along with the CZ factory case and paperwork.  Not in a rush to get rid of it so I won't even respond to low ball offers.  I have a couple of hammer fired handguns so I'll entertain letting this one go for a decent striker fired 9mm gun.

Remember that the price of the gun new was $550 and TN taxes is 9.75% which puts the tax on this gun @ $53.63. In addition to that, you have FFL fees which are usually $50-$75 depending on where you buy it. Oh, and remember that you cannot buy this gun new anymore. So that's $653.63 - $678.53. retail.

I am asking $900 for everything or $700 for the rifle with the bipod.  I Also have a Pelican 1750 case (brand new) that has not had the foam cut yet that I can include for an extra $200 if you like but would rather keep that for my new rifle.  Not looking for any trades thanks.

History Lesson (Truth About Guns):
The Mod30 was an improvement over the Mod28. That gun was famous for the first of the early 1980’s JSAAP competition stages for guns aspiring to become the new U.S. armed service standard-issue pistol. Although Star outperformed both the Ruger and Smith & Wesson entries, the military brass eventually awarded the Beretta 92 the contract.) 

This pistol was adopted for service by a number of Spanish police organizations, and the Spanish armed forces. Spanish Air Force pilots and some Guardia personell used the MI also. The M30 was also adopted in some numbers by Peruvian police and security forces as well as French Special Forces.

Comes with one original mag, and one mec-gar mag, utterly reliable and accurate. Better trigger than a custom 1911, must be tried to believe.  I believe it is wearing the original grips. More of a shooter than a collector's piece. If it were a collector's piece, it would command a $2500+ price. Asking $1400.

Seriously, that one guy who wants over a grand for an Egyptian Maadi parts kit build? Just...wow. 

Anyway, I've got one too many AKs and I want to build another one from scratch because I'm an idiot, so I need to sell one first. 

I've got a Century Yugoslavian style OPAP for sale. Look those up, they're a really quality AK variant, and I'm only asking the going rate. I bought it new and have had it for a little over a year, it only has maybe 300-400 rounds on it. Still in ""like new"" condition. Super fun and surprisingly accurate, I've never even messed with the irons and it'll hit a standard size sheet of printer paper at 100 yards all day...standing, unsupported. 

NOW TO THE PRICE: As configured in the picture, I'm asking $800. That's an ACE folding stock mechanism on there, along with a Hogue grip. That's about $250 worth of extras that I'll throw in for $200. 

If you DON'T want any of that stuff, that's fine...I'll take it all off and put the original factory stock and grip back on there and sell you the rifle for $600. I have done a really simple and clean looking refinish job on the foregrip wood with linseed oil, but the rear stock is still raw since I took it off the rifle the day I got it. 

The FFL I prefer to use is in Littleton, I have a membership and P2P transfers only cost $7...but buyer pays the transfer fee, so I'll go to any other FFL you want in the Denver/Boulder areas. I'll also deliver anywhere in the state, but outside of Denver/Boulder I'm gonna charge a $50 delivery fee...anywhere further west than Vail will be an extra $100. 

Thanks for looking!

oh and NO TRADES...I'm selling this thing to free up some room in the safe and fund a new project, so I'm not looking to trade this one. 

I have a couple other pistols for sale/trade though, feel free to enquire about those as well."

Below is a list I found on the internet of vehicles with a matching bolt pattern.  I cannot guarantee they will fit your vehicle.  These are AS IS and I will not take them back if they don’t work out for you.  They can probably be made to fit most vehicles with adapters you can buy off ebay.  I am looking to sell these this weekend so please feel free to make an offer.  The only thing I may trade for would be a nice flat screen TV or guns / ammo.

Truth is, I have not lost interest, I lost my job, just looking to pay some bills this month. I have another bone stock AR I can use parts for, so that's why I am offering ways to reduce costs on your end. This makes a nice stable longer range shooter, the adjustable cheek riser adds a nice balance on the rear. Shot's very nice.

Not looking for trades, face to face, cash. 

I can reduce the price by removing or changing out the following parts.

1.) 500 BUCKS off the price if you don't want the scope, covers and mount.

2.) 50 BUCKS if you don't want the sling. 

3.) 125 BUCKS if you don't want the iron sights. 70 BUCKS If you don't want the iron sights but DO want brand new magpul polymer sights.

4.) 200 BUCKS if you don't want the trigger, I can put in a new stock one. 

5.) 30 BUCKS if you don't want the angled fore grip. 

6.) 100 BUCKS if you would prefer a quad rail (And not the one on the rifle) of the same length that I have, a Yankee hill machine YHM-9634 in excellent shape http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/2-YHM-9634

7.) 25 BUCKS for the Magpul B.A.D. Lever if you don't want it.

8.) 150 BUCKS if you don't want the bolt carrier group and want to use your own.

9.) 25 BUCKS if you don't want the Magpul QD plate on the buffer tube, please note I do not have a stock replacement.

10.) 25 BUCKS if you don't want the front rail Magpul QD sling mount.

Pick and choose. If you want the whole thing? You see the price (2000.00) If you don't want some OR all of the parts I listed in this paragraph, that's fine too."

Do you have soon to be teenaged daughters? Do you have 300 bucks you wanna blow? If you answered yes to one or all of those questions, this is the shotgun for you!

One owner, and maybe 25 shells have been through this firearm as I wanted to function check it and got a little carried away. It has otherwise sat behind the front door covered in froglube and spider webs. With an 18.5 inch barrel, this firearm is as comfortable defending against home invaders as it is defending against clay pigeons and paper silhouettes. These uncertain times call for an uncertain stock length and with six aftermarket positions, you can know with certainty that it'll fit you, and those you wish to defend. Lastly, does anyone need more the standard 5+1 12 gauge shell capacity? You'll never need to answer that question because of the aftermarket 6 shell holder lovingly bolted on the receiver.

I'm letting it go for the low price of 300. I'll even throw in the aftermarket picatinny forend that I never got around to installing, any documentation that I can scrounge up between now and the day you purchase it, and a firm handshake. What else could anyone ask for?"

With the new HS403G, we have used the design of the successful HS403A, but we moved the battery housing to the right side of the optic. This provides easy access to change the battery.  The compact battery housing has a lower profile than the windage turret. The mount is now fully T1 compatible. You can use any aftermarket T1/H1 mount for this sight.  The turret adjustment mechanism has been updated with it being 3mm higher than the HS403A, to make it easier to adjust with a gloved hand.  All other features are identical to the HS403A.
