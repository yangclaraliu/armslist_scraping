This weapon was bought with creating the sexiest looking 870 12ga shotgun out there.  Has only had around 60-80 shells fired through it and I am the original owner/creator.  The only reason why I am selling this is due to needing to purchase a couple of handguns that I will use more than I have or will use this.  Trust me (ask my wife) this was a tough decision due to having so much time and money invested into this weapon.  

So no low balls or trades please!

Here is all the features:

-  Remington 870 Tactical 12ga Shotgun w/breacher choke

-  Has been professionally Duracoated so you never have to worry about surface rust again.

-  Has a 3lb trigger spring which was installed by a Remington Armorer.

-  Magazine Tube extension

-  Mesa Tactical Pistol grip/Collapsable stock kit.

-  Hogue Pistol Grip (rubber)

-  VLTOR Buttstock (with strong and weak side battery compartments)

-  Side Saddle for extra shells

-  FAB Defense Line Handguard with rails

-  Surefire KM3 LED weapon mounted light w/quick attach system and pressure switch (this light sells new for around $600 and has IR capabilities)

-  iTAC Defense Red Dot Sight

-  TAG Single Point OD Green Bungee Sling

-  Pelican 1720 Travel Case w/rolling wheels (already has the foam cut out for this weapon and my old 1911)

-  I'll throw in some Federal Tactical Rifled Slug and Tactical 00 Buck


As you see this weapon is complete and this listing offers everything you need if you have nothing for a weapon like this.  The buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sell and present a valid CCW or a Pistol Purchase Permit WHICH has an address matching their drivers license to be photographed so I can retain a copy with the bill of sale (yes I realize its not required in NC but I'm not in the business of selling a weapon to a convicted felon).

I am asking $1200.  This is a fair price considering everything your getting and the cost associated with those when bought new.

I check my email all the time so if I fail to respond by the end of the day on a day you email me please reply again.  I have had emails from ARMSLIST go to my spam folder and then deleted in the past.

Cheers and stay safe!"

For sale/trade I have a Walther P-1. This is a post-war production model of the P-38 with the reinforced frame. I've ran about 100 rounds of 9mm NATO through it. Fires great, very accurate, with no failures of any kind. Just a blast to shoot. Gun is in 95% condition, with no holster wear, no blue loss, and no major scratches. 

For those interested, the slide is marked: 

""Walther P1 Kal 9mm
2/80 (star)""

Frame says:

""420--- (circle) Bw""

So, from my understanding, this is a Bundeswehr issue made sometime in Feb 1980. Kind of neat.

Looking to sell/trade. More interested in trading, really. My 2015 blue book has this listed @ $450 for 95% condition. So I will ask $400 cash/trade value.

Located in Norman, OK. Face to face transactions only, please. Willing to drive a little within the metro to meet up for the right deal. Please call or text me at REDACTED if interested.

Thanks, and have a good day!"

This weapon was bought with creating the sexiest looking 870 12ga shotgun out there.  Has only had around 60-80 shells fired through it and I am the original owner/creator.  The only reason why I am selling this is due to needing to purchase a couple of handguns that I will use more than I have or will use this.  Trust me (ask my wife) this was a tough decision due to having so much time and money invested into this weapon.  

So no low balls or trades please!

Here is all the features:

-  Remington 870 Tactical 12ga Shotgun w/breacher choke

-  Has been professionally Duracoated so you never have to worry about surface rust again.

-  Has a 3lb trigger spring which was installed by a Remington Armorer.

-  Magazine Tube extension

-  Mesa Tactical Pistol grip/Collapsable stock kit.

-  Hogue Pistol Grip (rubber)

-  VLTOR Buttstock (with strong and weak side battery compartments)

-  Side Saddle for extra shells

-  FAB Defense Line Handguard with Rail System

-  iTAC Defense Red Dot Sight

-  TAG Single Point OD Green Bungee Sling

As you see this weapon is complete and this listing offers everything you need if you have nothing for a weapon like this.  The buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sell and present a valid CCW or a Pistol Purchase Permit WHICH has an address matching their drivers license to be photographed so I can retain a copy with the bill of sale (yes I realize its not required in NC but I'm not in the business of selling a weapon to a convicted felon).

 $580.  This is a fair price considering everything your getting and the cost associated with those when bought new.

I check my email all the time so if I fail to respond by the end of the day on a day you email me please reply again.  I have had emails from ARMSLIST go to my spam folder and then deleted in the past.

Cheers and stay safe!"

PRICE: $500

INCLUDED: Firearm, one 15-round P99 magazine with Walther P99 factory grip extension/sleeve, three 10-round S&W compact magazines (one with pinky extension), zippered handgun sleeve.
AVAILABLE EXTRA (right of first refusal given to buyer):  Gould and Goodrich Level 3 basketweave leather duty holster.
---------

The SW99 was a collaboration between Smith & Wesson and Walther, effectively ""cloning"" the Walther P99. Walther produced the frame, and Smith & Wesson produced the barrel and slide. It's identical to the P99 in structure and function, the only differences being aesthetics (primarily the lines on the slide and the rounded instead of squared trigger guard).

This particular model comes with the AS (Anti-Stress) trigger, which is unique in and of itself. When the striker is pre-cocked, the trigger has a pre-travel is taken up completely (and locked in place) when you pull the trigger to that point (without passing the break). From that point, the trigger pull is a crisp 4.5 pounds, with a very short reset. However, it can be carried in DA/SA mode with a pull weight of 7.8 pounds on the first pull by using the manual decocker.

Another distinct advantage is mag availability. It's fully compatible with magazines for the P99 as well as the PPQ M1 (just not M2, which are more expensive anyway), and Walther even makes a factory 20-round magazine for it. But unlike the Walther and it's 1-year warranty, S&W honors the warranty for the life of the firearm, not just the owner. It's perhaps for this reason the 9mm version is becoming harder and harder to find.

If you have any questions about it, I'd be happy to answer them. As you can certainly tell, I'm a dork about these things."

I am the only owner of this Smith and Wesson M&P and it has been very well taken care of. It has some very mild wear on the magazines and some wear on the barrel hood but other than those it is cosmetically perfect. It has fired approximately 800 rounds with various ammo and no malfunctions even while fired suppressed. All rounds were fired with the Storm Lake barrel and the factory barrel has not been used except as tested from the factory. Currently it has the Apex Aluminum trigger and sear installed with the duty weight spring ( includes lighter spring as well ) and the Apex Reset Assist Mechanism. It also has the steel magazine release installed. It comes with all factory original parts and accessories and has the baseplates for installing a red dot of your choice. It has the small back strap on currently but includes a medium and large. This is a fully loaded M&P that has all the best parts you would want especially for shooting suppressed. The Bravo Concealment Holster is great for using at the range or even to conceal if you like to carry a full size gun. It is very comfortable to wear and the belt loops can be switched and customized for your uses. This pistol is an absolute blast to shoot and has worked great for me! I hate to sell it but I really need to down size my collection a little. Right now I would like to sell as a package with all the parts and accessories and not split up. Thanks for looking and Post below if you would like to Buy!

It was never fired and he wanted to turn it into a precision rifle. I took it apart and we decided to go with high end parts so the only things we used from the rifle were the complete lower and buffer tube. I had a spare PSA lower and purchased a lower parts kit to make this a complete rifle as a spare. It has full FDE Magpul furniture and I had a Rainier arms XTC brake laying around and threw it on there. I took it out last weekend and put 30rnds through it to make sure it functioned 100%. The brake was more effective than I remembered. All it needs is some type of rear sight or optic to be range ready. Only reason for sale is to fund another gun purchase. Looking for $650

I have a beautiful 1942 Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifle that I spared no expense in building. It has the more expensive olive drab Archangel stock and a Russian military POSP sniper scope. The scope is removable 
and replaceable if you prefer to use the iron sights. The bolt handle was professionally extended and bent to make cycling rounds 
easily. I had it TIG welded and then the whole bolt assembly was polished. (Not epoxied and screwed) The removable magazine is a generous 10 round mag. More are available through eBay and this site in 10 and 5 round.

This rifle uses the powerful Russian 7.62x54R round which many compare to the 30-06 round in characteristics. Coupled with the 26"" barrel, it allows for some precise long range target delivery. Included in the deal is the rifle, the original stock, sling, the bayonet, oil can, ammo can, cleaning rod, and 160 modern non corrosive rounds. Some of the rounds are heavy steel core. 

The barrel and crown are good condition for years of service. You can add up the parts in this build and will see I am charging less than the cost of all the parts, so a fair price is offered. 
I will need to see that you are over 18 and a legal Florida resident.( show FL DL) If you have any interesting trades of equal value, I would respectfully listen. Have fun out there!"

This listing is for fifty (50) empty brass. I have plenty more if you need more at the same price. These were stored away long ago and we just found them while cleaning out the basement.

Long Story:
Back in the late 50's and early 60's the Army Advanced Marksmanship Unit ( now known as the Army Marksmanship or AMU) was concerned with the major problem of proper functioning of the rimmed .38 Special cartridge through converted 1911 pistols. The major problem was feeding-there was a noticeable difference in the position of rounds in the magazine between the first and last rounds. To overcome this problem magazines were modified, feed ramps were polished, and the chambers enlarged to allow the cartridge to ride up the ramp and into the oversized chamber. This oversized chamber caused problems with accuracy.

To alleviate the feed problems Herman Gano, an AMU gunsmith came up with the ideal of the .38 AMU cartridge. The .38 AMU is basically a .38 Special with a semi-rimmed base, like the .38 Super. When used in appropriate guns, nearly all the feeding problems were eliminated. The first cases were hand made by turning down a .38 Special case in a lathe to remove the rim and form an extraction groove. Later the Army contracted Federal, Winchester-Western and Remington to produce the .38 AMU cartridge.

Colt Industries followed through by producing a conversion kit to be fitted on both the 1911 and Colt .38 Super pistols. The conversion kit consisted of a .38 AMU slide with all the innards, recoil spring, magazine, barrel bushing and a .38 AMU barrel. One interesting note, other than ID markings, there's no difference between the .38 AMU and .38 Super slide. The barrel is unique in that it had only one forward locking lug so the gun wouldn't lock up too tightly and hinder proper cycling with midrange ammo. The work required to ""convert"" a pistol to .38 AMU is approximately the same as a full accuracy job. The slide must be fitted to the frame, the barrel must be fitted to the slide, and the barrel lug fitted so it cams with the slide stop pin. 

.38 AMU never really took to the shooting crowd for several reasons. There were no empties available for reloading, (most shooters were geared for .38 Special), the conversion kits were somewhat difficult to install by the shooter, the advent of the .38 Special Gold Cup magazine which solved the feeding problem with regular .38 Special wadcutters, and the introduction of the Smith and Wesson 52, an out of the box match gun."

This is a later model, with a roller bearing in the striker channel for a smoother and more consistent trigger pull. It is in excellent condition, and included are two 17 rd. magazines, the original case & papers, and keys for the built-in trigger lock. 

The Steyr has a similar grip angle, but a smaller diameter and much more ergomonic grip shape than the Glock 19. The Steyr has a 4mm lower bore axis, for less muzzle flip and less perceived recoil. The Steyr has a steel frame incorporating longer frame rails and the trigger / sear mechanism (very solid and precise). This steel frame fits into the polymer grip as a module. The glock uses its polymer grip as a frame to locate & hold the trigger mechanism, and the shorter frame rails are molded into the polymer grip. The Steyr uses unique fast acquisition trapezoidal / triangle combat sights which are made of steel (easily replaced if you prefer standard rectangular or night sights). The glock has plastic sights. The Steyr has a shorter trigger pull, with a quicker reset. The Steyr has a two round greater standard magazine capacity (17 rds versus 15). The Steyr has a built-in keyed trigger lock as an additional safety feature. The Steyr was initially designed for the .40 S&W, and then adapted for the less powerful 9mm. The Steyr's barrel has a fully supported chamber, and standard rifling to allow use of non-jacketed bullets, while the glock's chamber is not fully supported, and their rifling requires jacketed bullets.
