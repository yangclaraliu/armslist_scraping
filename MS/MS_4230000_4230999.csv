The wood grip and slide show slight wear, but there are no severe scratches or chips anywhere on the gun. The gun and its ammunition have all been stored well in my gun safe.

This pistol includes a fitting reversible CC holster and two full boxes of .380 auto hollow-point ammunition. One is a 25-count box of Hornady Critical Defense and the other a 20-count box of Gold Dot cartridges, each worth about $20 in stores. Since this is the only .380 I own, I will throw in my 34 remaining Atlanta Arms & Ammo range cartridges.

Buyer must be a resident of the state of Georgia with a valid driver's license. I would also strongly prefer to sell to someone with a Georgia CC permit or who is at least over 21.

When I got it, it didn't fire and found the firing pin to be broke. I just replaced it with stock pin and it shoots like it should. Loads from magazine fine. But the decocker does not work as it causes the gun to shoot...maybe just an adjustment or result of a new pin. Either way, its not a gun I'm interested in.

It was used by various cavalry units during the American Civil War.

The Smith Carbine was unique in that it broke apart in the middle for loading and it used rubber cartridges which sealed the gases in the breech. The downside was that these cartridges were difficult to remove.[1]

The carbines were built by Massachusetts Arms Company of Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts; the American Machine Works in Springfield, Massachusetts; or the American Arms Company in Chicopee Falls. The name of the distributor for the manufacturer, Poultney & Trimble of Baltimore, Maryland, is often stamped on the carbine's receivers.  only 30,062 made.

ABOUT THE GUN-  The one you are viewing does show its age with a lot of patina and light  pitting on the barrel and receiver. There is a little pitting in the bore but nothing that should effect accuracy. All serial numbers match though out the gun, The action locks up tight no side movement at the breach, action works smoothly. stock is solid, does indicate that the gun was used as a club do to 2 light cracks on either side of the stock. There are what appears to be counting marks on the side of the fore stock, maybe a account of confederates taken with the gun? This gun shows obvious signs of being in the war and lots of use. Very cool gun to have in your collection.

The M&P is in good shape, and will come with all of the factory stuff, box, backstraps, two factory 17 round magazines that came with it and an extra for 3 magazines total.  Also has factory night sights on it with plenty of life left and it has had some trigger work done on it, so it is a bit smoother and lighter and breaks much better than a stock M&P trigger.

Absolutely no problems with it, I'm just wanting something a bit more compact for carry purposes.  I would like to trade for a similarly equipped Gen 4 Glock 19 with night sights and a like number of mags.  Would still consider a Gen 3 if it has the features mentioned above.  May look at one without night sights if you have extra mags or ammo to offset the cost.  Might also consider an XDm 3.8 Compact in 9mm or a Beretta M9a1 or 92a1 (really want one with a rail), maybe a 92fs. Maybe a Glock 26

Would prefer to trade, but if you'd rather buy I'll sell it for $525.  With the night sights, trigger work, and extra mag I'm pretty firm on price.

Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use. Ultra-Durable, Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home DefenseDesigned to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.Snag-Free, Modular Design, Loaded with FeaturesThe lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.Reliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to MaintainThis pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.Whether it is for official military and law-enforcement use, for home defense and concealed carry or as an accurate and high-quality pistol for recreational shooting, the PX4 Storm is one piece of gear that will never let you down."

From what I can tell, this model was made from 1888-1897 due to its hexagonal barrel indicating that this is a first model, second variation. I inherited a few other firearms from him and this one has no particular meaning to me so I am listing this one and a couple others for now. The S&W's, Colts and other will be staying with me! 

This is a nickel plated revolver, it retains about 65-70% +/- of its finish but it still shoots great, locks up tight and is great nostalgia piece or something to stash away as a backup to a backup. The bore is still in great shape, the grips are in fantastic shape with no cracks or chunks missing out of it. 

I've personally run a box of ammunition out of it and I have one box left that will go with it. Keep in mind that this fires the .38 S&W, not the .38 S&W special and ammunition is still available for this old revolver albeit it's not that common (I think Cabelas has it in stock from time to time) and it is available online. 

$200 I believe is a fair price, but I am a fair person and will negotiate within reason. CCW holders preferred but not a necessity. MO residents only and a Bill Of Sale are my only requirements for purchase.

The gun is super nice, very well made and powerful, I purchased it brand new.  For those unfamiliar with these revolvers, the frames are cast by the same place that does Ruger single actions, but they're fit and finish is nicer than Rugers.  The rear sight even has the Ruger logo on it, so this is essentially a more robust Super Blackhawk with better fit and finish, and better features too.

It's got an unfluted cylinder that has a free spinning pawl so it spins in either direction (Ruger for example only spins clockwise), and the chambers are recessed as well.  It's a flat top and is drilled and tapped for scope use and comes with the factory scope mount.  It also comes standard with an over sized locking base pin.  The trigger is excellent as well.

The barrel is 7.5"" long and is hand lapped from the factory, it's a 5 shot and very, very strong.  To those somewhat familiar with single actions, the BFR is somewhere in between a Ruger and a Freedom Arms in terms of quality.  This gun has been shot about 20 times, that's it and it has been very well taken care of, no nicks or scrapes on it and cleaned after each use.

Buds sells these for about $935, after taxes you're at $1000.  I'm asking $750 for it and a soft hoslter.  The gun is as close to brand new as it gets.  I'm not really looking to trade right now, so if I don't respond to your trade request don't take it personal.  I live around Danville and will meet up with you as long as it's reasonable.  Thanks for looking!"

The FM is a high quality Argentinian Browning Hi Power clone, and all of the Browning parts are interchangeable with the FM.  The Classic is fairly rare, and masterfully done, and features many of the same features as the model III Browning Hi Powers.  
  Comes with factory magazine, though any magazine for the browning hi power will work and operate with this weapon.  There is very little wear on this firearm, and the slide and magazine release is very positive.  The magazine that comes with it is not drop-free, but it will drop free with other browning high-power magazines.  
  This is a soft shooter, and points intuitively, and has very mild and manageable recoil.  There aren't very many of these in the states, due to the dropping price of the dollar during the importation.  If you would like to try before you buy, I would be more than happy to meet at Talon or another reputable range.  
(I put Browning as the manufacturer because this is closer to a Browning in terms of quality than an FEG, but this firearm is an FM.)

It worked flawlessly last time I shot it, although I only put a few hundred rounds through it. Seems to be in pretty good condition overall considering it's age.  They're solid steel and have a medium size frame so they soak up recoil well and aren't painful to fire at all.

Grips are a little rough which seems common on these old surplus guns and there's some holster wear on the front of the grip. Otherwise the finish is pretty good.

Chambered in .32acp and comes with the same mag that was in it when I bought it. Must be 21 and prepared to show ID if you look young.  May be interested in trades or offers on other handguns but I'd rather sell straight out.  These guns are going for $250-270 on Gunbroker before the shipping and transfer fees.

It is in great shape as you can see, I'm happy to send more detailed pictures to anyone who is interested.  And if you like these pistols like I do, take a good look at McFadden's ""Ultimate Clip Loader,"" they work for the Ruger Mark pistols, the Browning Buckmark, and a few others.

524,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4230524,For Sale:  Gen 3 Mossberg 930 SPX Custom *READ*,"Columbus, Canal Winchester, Lancaster, etc., Columbus, Ohio",$ 750,"Listed On: Friday, April 10, 2015",Shotguns,Mossberg                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Shotgun,"This is a Gen 3 (about 7 months old) 930 SPX.  I've gone through about five of these shotguns (one Gen 1, two Gen 2's, and two Gen 3's) looking for ""the one"" that would actually be what Mossberg claimed the 930 SPX should be...and a little more (like cycle weak loads under 1200fps).  

I found all that in this 930.  It was broken in as per Mossberg's instructions with heavy loads and reliably cycles Wal-Mart light bird shot all the way up to 3"" big boys.  After break-in it was sent for some custom work.  

It has a polished trigger job, enlarged feed port, the bolt and bolt carrier have been de-burred everywhere, a Mesa 930 Urbino shortened LOP stock was installed, the recoil spring was micro polished and lightly greased with NyoGel, the recoil plunger was radiused for smooth action, and it has been re-coated in Magpul Tan KG-2400 (a far superior coating than Cerakote).  This gal is ready for anything, it's low maintenance (all coated parts do not require oil), and runs like a top.  It has NONE of the issues that the few 930 SPX's that crept past Mossberg's QC have had in the past.  It's probably one of the fastest cycling 930's you'll find anywhere. 

...All that and my fickle mind has gone a different direction (haha, I can't never decide on just one).  I've found a smoking deal on a Beretta 1301 Comp that I gotta have but can't justify so this bad girl's gotta go.  

The original stock, recoil action tube, recoil/action spring, butt pad, sling, and original box/paperwork/lock, etc. will also be included as if purchased new.  I will also include the Trijicon ACOG Reflex that's pictured with it.  Before you get all excited the ACOG ain't perfect.  It's been to the desert quite a few times (it's probably 10years old) and suffered from all the same problems as every other ACOG Reflex I've ever had (washes out in a lot of light.....not good for the desert).  My unit Armorer played with our all of our teams ACOG's and made them a little better but we still swapped out to TA31F's and COMP M4's.  I will never use it so it's yours to play with.  A $550 Reflex for free ain't a bad deal either way you look at it.  It is NOT included in the price so don't ask for a different price on the 930 without it included.  If you don't want the ACOG I'll put it back on the shelf.  

The smith work and stock cost total about what this gun sells for retail.  Anyone that knows anything can tell you that.  This ain't your off-the-shelf SPX so don't low ball me, the price is more than fair.  Honestly, this is how the 930's should come out of the box (they'd just cost twice as much).  Everything is still serviceable so if anything every gets worn out all parts can still be ordered from Mossberg.

If I had to classify this 930 as it sits right now I'd put it in line with the FN SLP MK1 Tactical.  It's every bit as fast and smooth as my FN but without the cost (well, cost to you anyway).

The Troodon (TROH-o-don) was named after a dinosaur. The name is Greek for ""wounding tooth"". This fantastic OTF knife has a slender contoured handle that is a delight to hold and use. It has a dual edged satin finish blade with plain edges on both sides. It has the feel of all the Microtech classic knives and the entire knife project was spear headed by Anthony Marfione. It has extremely sophisticated internal mechanisms which improve the overall operational functionality and reliability. Like each Microtech knife, this out the front knife is fantastic.

I use it for duck hunting. It gets to the shallow water spots great. Right now it sports a Coleman 5 HP motor, but I also have a 6 HP Yamaha motor that needs a little work. It ran great all last season, but ran terrible this season so i took it off and thats why I got the Coleman motor. It runs fine now. Also have a trolling motor that mounts to the front. You have to supply the battery. Bear in mind this is a small john boat ideal for small rivers and the shallow creeks to get to those honey holes. I ran it across NickaJack once. It did fine but it is not well suited for big expanses of water. Its normal stomping grounds are the small creeks and channels in Arkansas chasing ducks. The trailer is in decent shape. 

I value the Coleman motor at $800, the Yamaha motor at $200. the boat at $800, and the trolling motor at $30. Trailer value at $200.  I can separate the Yamaha outboard and trolling motor but would like to keep it all together as a package. 

I am looking to trade the boat for older Smith and Wesson revolvers preferably in original boxes. Revolvers with no boxes I would consider, but it would have to be something really cool. Kimbers I would also consider as well as Sig Sauer suppressor ready guns like the P226 Scorpion TB. OR you can make a cash offer (bear in mind I value the package at $2000) and I can go buy those guns I seek.

These guns were built on US-made milled receivers and FCGs with imported Zastava parts - this *is* a 922 compliant gun. Has had a Hogue AK grip installed, 4-16x scope installed on original mount, limbsaver slip-on recoil pad, and short 1913 rail with bipod on front lower handguard. The modified handguard is a spare; the original lower handguard, original pistol grip, and a spare upper handguard and flash-hider are included. Also comes with 4 10-round magazines with Magpuls, Yugo 4-mag carrying case, and hardcase. Shoots very well with Privi 196g match ammo. Uses standard AK fire control group save the selector (think it has a Tapco trigger & hammer). 

Beautifully finished gun. If you like AKs, this is the Cadillac version of a PSL or other full-caliber marksman rifle. At AWO, priced at $1550 with a 6 month wait, without the scope, bipod, or extra pieces.

I will entertain trades for $ + C&R guns like an Arisaka or Carcano. FTF in Charleston SC area or I can ship to your dealer at cost (guessing $50-75 based on weight and size)."
