SIG PROPAGANDA: Introducing the P320, a polymer-framed service pistol designed from the ground up with the input of law enforcement officers. The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. SIGLITE® night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous. Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol.
Unlike any other pistol in its class, the P320 features a unique 5-point safety system, standard on all models:

- Striker Safety
- Disconnect Safety
- 3-point Take Down Safety System
- Takedown is prohibited without removal of magazine
- System prohibits takedown without slide locked to the rear
- Rotation of takedown lever allows disassembly without tools or trigger manipulation.

The unique modular design of the P320 offers the user the ultimate in flexibility to change calibers, sizes, and fit. Small, medium, and large complete polymer grip modules ensure comfortable and optimal fit for the widest range of hand sizes.

I bought this about a year ago. i haven't shit it very much at all, maybe less than but close to 100 rounds went through this pistol. I've alternated between this and my Glock 19 for my concealed carry options throughout the last year.

About this Gun:
This is one of the most popular concealed handguns last year. This gun shoots 40. cal S&W as stated above. The gun holds 6+1 with the standard magazine and 7+1 with the extended magazine. The gun is fairly easy to take apart now, I've broken it in a bit but the darn thing was a bit annoying to take apart when i first got it, but everything is all smooth now. This gun comes with a thumb safety, me personally, i always keep a round in the chamber with the safety on while i carry. But if you don't like it at least its an option. 

Whats Included:
The gun comes with original paperwork, which really honestly just consists of the spent casing and the manual. It never came with a case when i bought it, but 6 months ago i got an XD with their magazine promotion and the extra mas came in this nifty little case, and since then I've just thrown it in there, ah and obviously the gun plus both original magazines and the bore lock it came with.

The Price:
I originally overpaid for this pistol, sad because it made me have a little resentment towards it for a while, but now I'm just cutting my losses and selling it, I've upgraded with the M&P40C. I personally like it better. The price is $365. That's walking away with the pistol, no tax, no shipping, no transfer fees/background checks. If you are active duty military and can prove it, ill make it $350 only because I'm active duty and I do enjoy the occasional military discount too.

For sale is a lightly used Pre-64 Winchester Model 94 lever action rifle in 30-30 Winchester caliber with a 20” barrel. If you look at the successful bids on Gunbroker.com, a rifle in this nice of condition would typically sell for $700, plus. But I prefer to sell it to someone in the area.

The Serial No. is 223XXXX, which means it was manufactured in 1956. It is one of the nicest original Pre-64 Model 94’s that you will ever find and it functions perfectly. It has nearly 100% of the original bluing. It does not have any touch-up bluing. The stock, which has never been sanded or refinished, has only some faint scratches and dents. All I have ever done to the stock is wipe on a little oil finish, as they can dry out over time. The attached photos show the actual rifle for sale and were taken on February 19, 2015.

The rifle has a Redfield peep sight and sling swivels. In addition, I installed a new magazine tube follower for the Hornady LeveRevolution bullets. The original follower is included.

The rifle is available for face-to-face cash purchase and pickup in Kennewick, WA for $499.00.

In addition, I have three 20-round boxes of hard-to-find Hornady LeveRevolution 30-30 ammo that I will sell for an additional $60.00, if you want them.

The background check that is now required in Washington by Initiative 594 and subsequent transfer of the gun to the buyer can be performed at the Hole in the Wall gun shop, 7509 W. Deschutes Ave. in Kennewick, WA.  The fee is $25.00, payable by the buyer.  There is no sales tax on the private sale, even though the transfer occurs at a gun store.

Give me a call at the number listed below if you have any questions or if you would like to arrange to purchase the rifle.

I will not respond to ""lowball"" offers and I am not interested in any trades. Sorry!

Thanks for looking!

I am looking to upgrade to a Ruger Alaskan in .44mag so I can use the same ammo in all my .44mags. Right now I use Buffalo Bore’s 340+p+ .44 mag round (1250fps out of an Alaskan) and the S&W is not rated for safe use. I really like this S&W for it’s perfect size and weight, effortless all day carry. My S&W comes with the factory case w/ accessories (fired casing, I think I have the manuals also- will look), a black De Santis leather holster and Crimson Trace Laser Grips. I would be looking for cash to equal out the deal also. If there is no interest I will just keep this and save up for the Ruger, so don't bother with the lowballs. Trade within WI only unless the deal is good enough for me to have to pay shipping and a transfer.  Email is the best way to get a hold of me.

I'm planning on keeping whichever one I don't sell, but I may let them both go for the right offer. 

The first is a 1946 35 Remington caliber in great shape. I'd give this one a grade of 90% overall. The wood is in great shape with only a couple very minor imperfections. The barrel and receiver both have very nice factory bluing, lacking only the ""new gun"" luster. The main reason I'd say it's 90% is the stainless steel slide and inside of the chamber have some discoloring, and it was tapped for a scope. 

The second is a beautiful 1948 model in 300 Savage. The very cool and rare thing about this gun is the checkered stock. Almost all of the 81's that had the checkered stock were the Model B, which came standard with it. This one, however, is the Model A that somebody ordered a custom factory checkering on. Very cool! This can be confirmed and view at the following site:

http://thegreatmodel8.remingtonsociety.com/?page_id=1051 

The 1948 has a receiver nearly like new, and the stock is flawless and shines like it's from the factory! The only imperfection on this gun is the barrel, which has some light surface rust that is hard to see. I'd give this gun 95-97%. 

The other cool thing about these guns is that the design was actually patented by John Browning, and is the same as his A5 shotgun! 

Price on the ad is what I'm asking for the 1946. The other is considerably more valuable. Also have a couple boxes of ammo for the 35 (valued at $40/box) and a couple rounds for the 300 Savage. If the ad is up I still have them. I will modify it if one sells and I decide to sell the other. Feel free to contact with questions, thanks."

The NRA/Shooting Illustrated called the Mossberg® 930™ SPX™ their 2009 Shotgun of the Year. We call it the best auto-loading home-defense shotgun money can buy. The 930 SPX was named 2009 Shotgun of the Year by Shooting Illustrated magazine and recognized with the prestigious NRA Golden Bullseye Award for 2009. Among their comments, editors pointed out the shotguns exceptional value, and described it succinctly as Simple, rugged and reliable. When it comes to home-security firearms, a simple-to-operate, dependable firearm in a crisis can make a world of difference. For that reason, Mossberg 930 Special Purpose™ autoloaders are finding their way into more homes as a primary defense firearm. All Mossberg 930 Special Purpose shotguns feature a self-regulating gas system that vents excess gas to aid in recoil reduction and eliminate stress on critical components."

This is a German-marked and produced VZ-24.  From the research I've done and information I've been able to find, this rifle was produced shortly after Germany obtained control of Czechoslovakia.  As they took control of the country, they also took control of the arsenals and weapons plants.  This rifle is a product of that.

You can see the German proof marks pictured.  From what I've found, this is a predecessor to the German G24(t) that was produced in the Czech plants.  The Germans used up the parts in stock, then switched over to the German design.   This appears to be in the first year of production, first run of 10K of the German produced rifles in Czechoslovakia being built in 1941. The subsequent runs of 10K had a suffix to the SN.

The bolt and stock do not have matching serial numbers. I obtained it in a trade with the sporter stock (included and pictured) and put it back into it's original form with a replacement stock (not SN matched, either) and metal.  Both stocks go with this rifle.

Open to trades and offers.  Willing to ship to C&R or FFL for actual cost of shipping.  I have a C&R, so I will request a bill of sale."

This is a German-marked and produced VZ-24. From the research I've done and information I've been able to find, this rifle was produced shortly after Germany obtained control of Czechoslovakia. As they took control of the country, they also took control of the arsenals and weapons plants. This rifle is a product of that.

You can see the German proof marks pictured. From what I've found, this is a predecessor to the German G24(t) that was produced in the Czech plants. The Germans used up the parts in stock, then switched over to the German design. This appears to be in the first year of production, first run of 10K of the German produced rifles in Czechoslovakia being built in 1941. The subsequent runs of 10K had a suffix to the SN.

The bolt and stock do not have matching serial numbers. I obtained it in a trade with the sporter stock (included and pictured) and put it back into it's original form with a replacement stock (not SN matched, either) and metal. Both stocks go with this rifle.

Open to trades and offers. Willing to ship to C&R or FFL for actual cost of shipping. I have a C&R, so I will request a bill of sale."

Professional Grade Weaponry, by BCM®
Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired.
As a note: BCM barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistent with these quality control procedures.
Cold Hammer Forged Barrels
This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFH series of barrels are made right here in the USA! (Just like all the BCM products.)
M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.
T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.
USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.
Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.
Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a worldwide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.
Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.
5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.
Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.
Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.
HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be quickly removed from upper receiver. To charge the rifle, the charging handle on the receiver must be pulled.

Manual safety also duplicates M16-style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip.[1] Standard sights include a front post installed on the M16-style removable base and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. On the upper receiver, an integral Picatinny rail exists which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments.

He was also an Instructor at the Academy for 10 years. Here is what he told me about the pistol. What got his attention with this 1076 was it was one of only two out of all the other 1076s that came in with a gold bead front sight and plain black rear sight. The serial # on the gun is TFP 32xx Also comes with 17 9 round S&W mags. I unwrapped all of them and only two look like they have been used. He also stated that he had only fired  4mags thru the pistol after the buy back from S&W. He said the gun comes with the palm swell grip the curved grip the straight grip which is on the gun now and a prototype grip which S&W made very few of. The only way I can tell a difference is when you hold it in your hand it feels a little different at the bottom. It also comes with 17 new S&W mag springs. One box of federal XM100A that is the experimental load that federal was developing for the gun. The real rare box is Winchester Western marked sample ""C"" subsonic restricted sale only to law enforcement  I called Winchester and the historian told me there were very few of those rounds ever produced before federal got involved. Also comes with 6 full boxes of federal 10c the load the FBI went with. I have looked on GB but never seen a more complete and rare package. The FBI guns I have seen before sold for 1600 to 2200 but never had what this one does. The box comes with unopened cleaning kit owners manual warranty and safety manual.

The CX4 is a semiauto pistol-caliber carbine designed to give you the familiar controls of your favorite Beretta combat handgun. It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies across the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.
Accepts Beretta Full-Size Pistol Magazines
The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4. 90-series and 8000 series magazines can also be used (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.
Extremely Versatile, Easy to Use
This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights.

This Super Charged 30-06 load is designed to kill any big game from antelope through AK/Yukon moose or bison. The 168gr. Barnes TTSX bullet expands and then penetrates as deeply as most 200gr. premium partition style bullets, while giving the high velocity, flat trajectory and low recoil of the much lighter 168gr. bullet. For folks who are hunting any big game in North America, this is the “do all” 30-06 load. We make a 30-06  load that is better suited for small big game like deer and antelope, (See Item 40A) but there is no 30-06 load in the world that is better suited for all NA game and especially very large game like AK/Yukon moose or bison, than this (Item 40B) load.

Note our real world velocities, shot from real world rifles. We do not use extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings.

181-series Mini-14 [not a Ranch version].  Extremely low 1977 serial #.

UNDER-folding aftermarket stock from Federal Ordnance, from early 1980's, refinished with walnut-tint Danish oil and three coats of semi-gloss Tung Oil.

Look up Federal Ordnance underfolders - rare and pricey.  I have seen them sell at auction for a hair over $300, NIB.  This certainly is NOT a NIB stock - it had been rattle-canned flat black by the previous owner... a lousy attempt at 'tacticool', hence my refinishing of it.  I wanted to reveal the nice walnut and give it a 'Ruger' look.

Ram-Line black plastic heatshield/barrel shroud, but otherwise stock.

I will include two Tapco Gen2 polymer 30-round mag's in FDE, a RamLine clear plastic 30-rd, and a Pro-Mag blued steel 20-rd.  I prefer the Tapco's to anything on the market, save for Ruger factory blued steel mag's.

Approx 1200 rounds down the pipe.  Recently [30 rounds ago] replaced gas-pipe with Ruger factory part.  Ready for 2-3k more reliable shots before a new gas pipe will be needed.
