Great little gun that hooked both of my sons on deer hunting forever.  Both took their first Kentucky bucks with this.  It's in immaculate condition.  Has only had a total of 36 Remington Core-Lokt rounds fired from the rifled barrel.  Of those 36, 6 were shots in the woods and they put 6 in the freezer (I even used one of my doe tags just to give it a spin once).  I still have 4 rounds left in second box of Core-Lokts that I will include.  

20 gauge smooth bore barrel shoots 3"" shells - may also shoot 2 3/4"" but the buyer would need to verify.  I have only fired one 20 gauge shell out of it just to test pattern.

Both of my kids have now outgrown this so I either hang onto it for 25 years until I have grandkids or I find another dad who can use it to share the outdoors with his own sons or daughters.

Also included is a nice 4x Simmons scope, the hammer thumb extension, and a BSA 30mm red dot scope that I took off of my turkey gun that I had planned to install on the smooth bore for small game and turkey for the kids.  I just never got around to it.

I will send photos of everything if you are you are interested.

I have over $440 invested in it."

H&K USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. The USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the American shooter in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high energy +P loads. Service life is engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

This handgun features corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame • grooved target triggers • polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life • can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes • specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing • corrosion resistant ""Hostile Environment"" blued finish steel slide • no snag, bobbed hammer • flared recurve trigger guard • choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines • one piece machined steel slide • universal mounting grooves for installing accessories • ambidextrous safety • Night sights"

The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. How Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-Have The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case. Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology 1. It allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round. 2. Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols. 3. Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot. Size & Features With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster. The CCP comes in stylish stainless or Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation. This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface. Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide."

Great little gun that hooked both of my sons on deer hunting forever.  Both took their first Kentucky bucks with this.  It's in immaculate condition.  Has only had a total of 36 Remington Core-Lokt rounds fired from the rifled barrel.  Of those 36, 6 were shots in the woods and they put 6 in the freezer (I even used one of my doe tags just to give it a spin once).  I still have 4 rounds left in second box of Core-Lokts that I will include.  

20 gauge smooth bore barrel shoots 3"" shells - may also shoot 2 3/4"" but the buyer would need to verify.  I have only fired one 20 gauge shell out of it just to test pattern.

Both of my kids have now outgrown this so I either hang onto it for 25 years until I have grandkids or I find another dad who can use it to share the outdoors with his own sons or daughters.

Also included is a nice 4x Simmons scope, the hammer thumb extension, and a BSA 30mm red dot scope that I took off of my turkey gun that I had planned to install on the smooth bore for small game and turkey for the kids.  I just never got around to it.

I will send photos of everything if you are you are interested.

I have a farm in NKY but I am an Ohio resident.  To comply with laws I will personally deliver this to an FFL dealer in NKY (I can meet you at your dealer).  I have this listed in Ohio for $270 but I will pick up $15 of the required FFL transfer fee for a KY resident.

I have over $440 invested in it.

Listing w/o BCG&CH. The base was a PSA, CHF, 12.5"" factory upper. I've put a Troy low pro gas block on there, covered it with an ALG Defense Ergonomic Modular Rail V0 (12"") in silver, and capped it with a Smith Enterprises Vortex flash hider. The whole setup is rock solid and built to squeak maximum velocity out of a pistol type setup (all of the barrel length chrono evals I found suggest 11.5"" is the best compromise for length vs muzzle velocity). Since I put the rail on, it hasn't even been outside.

As you probably know, the Hammer Forged barrels from PSA are FN made. ALG Defense is Geissele's sister company and makes outstanding products. This upper has a free-floated shorter barrel that has been shot about 60-100 times (if that). Looks awesome on a pistol and would be VERY slick on an SBR setup. Comes with the Co-witness front rail section and two (or three if you really need them) 2.5"" rail sections for the EMR. Has QD swivel holes, so I'll toss a swivel for your two point sling as well.

I have a Ruger SR9c in good condition along with all the factory stuff (two mags, box, etc) that I would be interested in trading for an LC9s.  Just looking for something a bit smaller and have been wanting to try out an LC9s for awhile.  Will trade straight across for an LC9s with two magazines.  Might consider similar single stack 9mm's, but primarily interested in the LC9s.  Would also be interested in 38 special S&W j frames, no Taurus or Charter please.

 I have my ccl, feel free to call text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 fLC93 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

Happy to show and sell if you are local, or to ship if you are across the state or out of state.  Shipping for this should be $25 to most places, and tax applies to buyers in PA.  I do not charge a tranfer fee when you purchase from me.

 The KSG is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil."

This 375 H&H load is designed for use on all North American game including Alaskan game. The only North American application I would use the 300gr. TSX (item 54A) on would be on 2000lb bison, taken with bad angle shots. In other words, item 54A (300gr. TSX) is best suited for African game and this 270gr. TSX load is best suited for North American game, although you can feel free to use either in Africa or North America, as they will both work for both applications.

As always, we use real world firearms to generate our published real world velocities. We prefer not to follow the industry wide, duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory test barrels to generate exaggerated velocities that the ammo user will seldom, if ever see. With Buffalo Bore you will know what velocity your ammunition is generating in the real world, where it matters.

* 10.5 223 Wylde Barrel: The barrel is the most important function to accuracy of course, so a preium barrel is essential for a quality gun. This is a 1/8 
twist .223 Wylde from Faxion. It is a button rifled barrel that will perform very well with all common 223 or 5.56 ammo. In other builds I have always gotten 
sub MOA from these barrels and expect the same here.

* Aero Precision lower and upper in factory FDE finish: These are full mil spec upper and lower receivers. Aero makes some of the most consistent lower with 
great quality control. They are the same as used by multiple premium brands, just without the price of a fancy roll mark.

* CMMG Parts kit with polished trigger and hammer for a great, smooth feel while still keeping mil spec reliability.

* M16 Mil Spec Full Auto bolt and carrier, so that you can run it as hard as you want or need without a worry

* Lightweight Aluminium quad rail in factory FDE for all your accessories. 

* KAK Muzzle Device: This creates additional back pressure for reliability functioning with commercial as well as mil spec ammo.

* ARMS brand BUIS flip up sights in FDE.

* Phase 5 Pistol Buffer Kit: This is an oversized and padded tube to give you a good shooting brace as well as a positive cheek weld.

* 42 rounds MSAR Polymer Magazine.

This is a 1942 Izhevsk 91//30 that has had a reproduction PU scope mount put on it.  I see no indication the rifle was a sniper at any time, but someone started the process to turn it into a sniper.  The drilling/tapping looks to be well done and the scope mount appears straight.  The guide pins are in properly and everything lines up without issues.

The bore has strong rifling and is not counterbored.  It passes a headspace check (Go and No Go gauges).  All numbers match, with the butt plate and mag floorplate being force-matched.

This would be a good project to finish out as a reproduction sniper, as it just needs a bent bolt and optics.  Half the work is already done.  It would even be a good base for a mod job having the scope mount already on it.

I'm firm on the price, as I think it's VERY fair.  By the time you buy a Mosin, buy a mount, and have it mounted you'd have more into than what I'm asking.

I am willing to ship to a C&R or FFL dealer.

The price is $640 and for that you get the Leupold scope base, and two sets of rings, 30mm and 1""...saving you $100 here! I'm not a big seller on Armslist but as Erielarned on Ebay I have way over 400 evals at 100% satisfaction.  Shipping will be $40 insured to your FFL holder.  I trust you know the FFL drill with a copy to me and then me getting the rifle to your FFL address. Without sounding like I'm trying to sell you a used car, I believe for about $700 (with the FFL fee on your side), you will have a rifle that can consistently put 3 rounds into an inch at 100 yards, i.e. minute of angle. Lots of folks spend a lot of money trying to get a rifle to produce this accuracy.  So do your part and you'll have one...  One last...forgot to mention that a muzzle brake was added...so there is another $100 freebie!!

Stainless steel semi-auto handguns are now common, even passe'. But this fact of life in the '90's would never have come to be had it not been for a small, now defunct company which dared to show the rest of the firearms industry the pathway to the future. Randall Firearms Company of Sun Valley, California, U.S.A., made it all happen with a line of high-quality Model 1911 derivatives.
Although Randall pistols were manufactured from only June 7, 1983 to May 15, 1985, they ushered-in an entirely new era for handguns, thus carving for themselves a place in the history of firearms around the world. This historic niche, coupled with the fact that Randall pistols are exemplary specimens of their genre, has made every single one of the 9,968 Randall pistols eminently collectible.
Among Randall's many trend-setting innovations were two of the most significant breakthroughs in the 1911 field since John Moses Browning designed that form of semi-auto in the first place. One of these breakthroughs came when Randall made the very first production pistol of its kind in stainless steel.
It actually all began with a small company called KEN-AIR, Inc., which had been in the aircraft instrument repair business in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles County [in the State of California, USA] since the mid-1950's. Then, in 1981 the company entered into a diversification program which ultimately led to the Randall pistol.
Except for some minor changes necessitated in manufacturing, the Randall pistols were much unchanged from the traditional Browning design. However, because every part except for the grips was made of aircraft quality stainless steel, this really was a new gun, and quickly became known as ""The Only Stainless Steel Auto Fit For Duty
