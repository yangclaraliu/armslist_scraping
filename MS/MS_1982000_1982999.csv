Id like to trade it for a different handgun not in .45 (unless you have a rock island 1911 you want to trade) as I don't shoot .45 much.  Not real particular about make model or size, so let me know what you have.  I would prefer a semi auto but would consider a .38 or 357 revolver.  Id also be open for a trade of a bow setup for deer hunting, compound or recurve but it needs to have a draw weight of at least 45lbs.

Only has one 8 round magazine but witness mags are inexpensive and readily available online.  I can also throw in a box of .45 for the right trade.
Mostly interested in trading, but will also sell for $350.

It is built off of a Spikes 5.56 upper, with a DPMS lower, has an 18"" custom contoured stainless barrel with the Benny Hill Rolling Thunder Compensator, JP trigger, JP Silent Captured-Recoil buffer spring, lightened BCG, Clark Custom carbon-fiber fore arm, Magpul PRS stock, Magpul MOE grip and I'm sure there are some things I've forgotten about. 

This rifle is exceptionally accurate, with sub MOA groups with most factory ammo and sub .75 MOA groups with Black Hills ammo.  With ZERO felt recoil I can keyhole double taps no problem. 

This is an incredible rifle and I hate to see it go but a new baby and a new job have put a hold on my 3-gun schedule.

The approximate value on the parts alone come to over $2,200, not including labor, shipping, etc. I'm dropping the asking price to $1,800 OBO. I will consider trades for other AR's plus cash, Tavor, and maybe others... Just offer. 

If you have any questions or want more pictures shoot me an email.

Interested in a Smith and Wesson Gunsite 1911.  Looking for a realistic price, shipped to my FFL.   If you're in Oregon, we can figure out a FTF sale.  I'll supply Bill of Sale, ODL and have CCW. 

If you need to ship, COD insures I get what I'm buying (it cost $5 extra) .  Yup, my FFL will verify contents before paying shipper.  That means he opens the box to verify serial numbers and details before paying the shipper.  If you're not honest enough to deal with that don't waste yours and my time.       

I've watched a handful of these on the auctions sites and here go absolutely nowhere for $900 to $1,200 asking price for months.  New they could be had for around $750-$800.   While this firearm is not currently booked, S&W will still make them if you order enough, thousands were sold, so it's not a limited edition.  There are +/- a dozen advertised for sale right now with no bites.  Good gun IMO, the right configuration, but not rare or limited by any stretch.  If you want to sell yours send some pics, details and we'll figure something out."

I have for sale 2 new/never used stainless steel parkerizing tanks with lids and ½” drain valves. I bought these thinking I was going to learn how to parkerize guns but never got around to it so these have just been sitting collecting dust. Also included with this is 1 gallon of Zinc Phosphate Parkerizing Solution and 1 gallon of Post Treatment Solution, both new and unopened. Each gallon of chemical is concentrated and gets mixed with 4 gallons of water for 5 total gallons of each, which is the capacity of each tank. 

I paid right around $450 shipped to the door for the pair of tanks/lids plus around $125 shipped to the door for the chemicals. I have around $575 wrapped up in this but I will sell everything as a set for $400 cash or $450 trade value. Located in Dublin and you must be willing to meet in the Dublin area for the sale.

Not interested in bows, crossbows, or black powder.

Here is the description of the tanks from the manufacturer:

6""x6""x40"", pure 304 Stainless Steel. Tank, cover, and Stainless Steel ball valve are included. 

We are proud to offer the very best Parkerizing Tanks in the industry. They are cut and formed out of pure 304 stainless steel. Handles are formed right into the ends. All edges of these tanks are hemmed, so there are no exposed sharp edges. Feel free to handle these tank with your bare hands! 

The tanks are TIG welded using supreme skill and elaborate tooling. The outside of the welds are treated and polished to reveal the beauty of the stainless steel and show the excellence of the weld. We maintain complete passivation inside the weld during manufacturing. Please look at the last picture taken of the inside of the weld, you will see that it remains brilliant and shiny. If you see a weld in stainless steel that is black or rust colored inside this means that proper provisions were not taken and rust and breakdown will start immediately when your liquid is applied."

It was a impulse buy, and I'm still not sure if I want to sell it, but the wife says I have to, (those of you who are married, know what I'm dealing with). So the description of this beautiful rifle is: This rifle came from the factory with Diamondhead flip up front, and rear sights. These are worth the weapon alone. Must see. The piston system is a Stag arms proprietary design modeled after the Daniel defense. I have sent exactly 30 rounds through her. Like all standard stag AR rifles it is chambered in true 5.56. I put on a sling attachment, and a BCM Gunfighter Ambidextrous charging handle,( if you haven't used one of these, you are missing out), and added and vertical grip/bi-pod. I have my slide fire in the pics. This is an option if you want it. If you don't want it, I can take it off and put the standard Stag six position mil spec stock. If you do want it, I will still give you the factory stock. The piston rifle is great for people who shoot full auto, suppressed, or send a lot of rounds downrange, or in competition. It is an amazing difference in how cool this runs. She is a great rifle, I am a huge Stag Arms fan. I am only willing to sell this to people in the Great State of Oklahoma. I drive all over the State, so meeting won't be the biggest issue. I have total 1680 in this gun. It's a steal for $1200 with the slidefire. Or 1000 without."

A high-efficiency LED generates 170 lumens of brilliant white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with good reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The LED has no filament to burn out or break and generates tactical-level light—enough to overwhelm an aggressor's night-adapted vision—for 2.4 hours per set of batteries. The 5-milliwatt, 635 nanometer laser sight, located below the primary light, is nearly twice as bright and much more visible than the nearest competitor. The laser's adjustment mechanism uses Nylok® screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. The white light/laser combination makes the X400 effective in close- to medium-range engagements, ideal for law enforcement, military, and self-defense use. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof. The X400 comes with two adapter wedges permitting rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. An ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation, and a mode switch allows you to select white light only, white light + laser, laser only, or system disable. Optional pistol grip switches permit operation with the top grip finger, leaving the index finger free to operate the handgun trigger. Other switches are available for operating the X400 when attached to a long gun."

Model A1041. Competition grade rifle.
I bought this rifle specifically to shoot competition and it is awesome, I have just decided to shoot 22lr handguns. It is very accurate, dependable and these are very rare and hard to find because people keep them. Never had a ftf, fte, jams or any issues.
Here are some reasons why this makes a great shooting gun. High Standard has been at the top for competition guns since 1952, used in the Olympics and for all around shooting. Longer barrel, 22”, light weight and very well balanced. Vented receiver, helps when shooting a lot of rounds and reduces malfunctions and keeps the receiver cleaner. Another unique feature is, you will never have a ftf, because the receiver doesn't feed another round until you release the trigger.

This one has been to FailZero and the slide EXO Coated. See below for details. This is a proven technology that is seeing wide spread use in auto and semi-auto firearms. I'm asking $500.00 for this only because I want a new 1911 and have to sell this to make it happen. Email bharger at dragonmount.com I'm in West Palm can do local or will ship ffl to ffl for cost REDUCED FOR QUICK SALE $500.00 


The only trade considered would be for a new Cimarron 1911 polished blue or nickel. Unless you have one don't ask please. You'll only waste your time and mine.



FailZero parts are treated with EXO Technology , a patented process that transforms a metal surface into a permanently dry-lubricious material that's harder than the substrate itself. It's dry-lubricious properties reduce friction so well, no wet lubrication is ever needed. And, EXO Technology dissipates heat so efficiently, operating parts run cleaner and cooler - a great benefit in semi-automatic and automatic weapons.



FailZero parts do require cleaning , but at far less intervals then standard wet-lube parts. There is no lube to attract and hold grit, create crud and gunk, or thicken up. FailZero parts will operate until too dirty to function. Fouling can be brushed away with a steel brush with little effort. A normal cleaning schedule is suggested even with FailZero.



FailZero parts have been thoroughly tested by the U.S. Department of Defense, by law enforcement d epartments nationwide, by rigorous internal testing, and by tactical training centers . Much of the test data is proprietary under military secrecy provisions. FailZero parts are currently in use by SWAT teams, security agencies, and by military troops under battlefield conditions. Other EXO treated parts are used in military advanced weapons systems, mortar tubes and components, missile testing systems, and more. And, FailZero parts are guaranteed for life



Unlike films, conventional coatings and applied lubricants, it will never rub off, never flake off, never build up crud. EXO Technology eliminates wet-lubrication failures of critical components, giving you an “active weapon advantage” under all conditions. Proven by DoD tests, SWAT teams, tactical experts.



The patented EXOTM Technology used in FAILZERO upgrades has been thoroughly tested and proven effective by UCT Defense – a division of UCT Coatings and developer of EXO Technology – and by the U.S. Department of Defense. Test results include:



* 50,000 lube-free rounds on AR-15s. * 15,000 lube-free rounds on M9 pistols. * 18,000 lube-free rounds on carbine rifles. * 23,000 lube-free rounds on machine guns.

I purchased it new and had a local gunsmith take care of the mods. I then sent it to Tony Rumore (Tromix) and he stripped it to bare metal and Moly Resin coated for me.

For those who dont understand the modifications......
Saigas are imported into the United States in ""sporting configuration""....meaning no pistol grip and the trigger is not located in the original intended position.
This new US made Tapco G2 trigger has been installed in the proper AK trigger location and profiled by a professional gunsmith. The pistol grip\stock\door breacher also added.

The SN 311383 which according to Frasca & Hill's ""The 45-70 Trapdoor Book"" puts it in the right year of manufacture by the Springfield arsenal. There is also the No 76 stamped behind the Trigger Guard and as other examples of 1884 Cadets show there is no year cartouch on the left side of the stock. Also it has the 1873 Breech block and Buffington rear sight which is correct. This rifle is over all excellent condition with some loss of bluing at the muzzle presumably due to the atachment of the bayonet. The Case hardening, Bore and Stock are in excellent condition as all the pictures indicate. This rifle has been in my collection for 33 years, and was purchased at The Lock Stock And Barrel in Pasadena, CA. With USPS MO I usually ship within 24 hours all others means must clear my bank first. Please ask any questions that you may have. No FFl is required. Shipping is non refundable.

SN 473. According to the ""The Springfield 1903 Rifle"" by Brophy (pg 128-129) the Ordnance Department purchased 10 of these rifles after the 1927 International Competitions fitting them with 31 inch heavy barrels (1 inch across the muzzle),Swiss Globe front sights,target scope blocks, Lyman 48 Receiver sights, palm rests, dbl set triggers, Scheuzen style check pieces, elaborate Trigger Guards and Butt Stocks. Others were offered for sale through the DCM and NRA at a cost of $231.46 from 1929 to 1932 for a total of about 40 rifles. ""Few of these scarce rifles have survived in original condition"" This rifle will letter through the SRS, as it has in the past. The condition of this is very fine plus with 96% to 98% strong blue on the barrel, 95% original blue with some freckles of light rust on the Receiver. The wood is sound with minor nicks and scratches and a hairline crack in the butt stock behind the butt plate attaching pin escutcheon, it retains most of its original fine hand rubbed oil finish. The mechanics are excellent with a bright and shiny bore. If one has any question please feel free to ask. This CR OK, IF paid with MO or Certified funds I usually ship within 24 hours with a MO, personal checks and Certified have to clear. Buyer to pay shipping, Weight of this rifle is 14 lbs and WILL HAVE to be shipped USPS REGISTERED MAIL to insure it adequately. Reasonable offers will be entertained. This is a rare and hard rifle to find,it could take years to find one let alone one as nice.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5/9/12 It has recently been brought to my attention that several of these Springfield Hammerillis (SN 434 and SN 456) have been sold at auction for substantially less than my offering price. After closely examining the auction catalogs multiple photos it is very clear that one has a large crack in the stock at the back of the Receiver, has a non configuration Springfield barrel and in general the condition of the stock, receiver & barrel and small parts in particular the Trigger assembly DO NOT tell the same story. It therefore appears that one of the two is REFINSIHED. The second ones pictures are a bit too vague to determine exactly what is going on with that rifle however again the barrel appears to be a replacement and the stock and metal parts condition seems to be at odds with each other. Also both rifle appear to have been shot either not at all or very little after they were blued. One MUST REMEMBER that Springfield Hammerillis rifles WERE SHOT both before and after they were sold through the DCM in the 1930's and to be in original condition need to show some commensurate wear. Again to quote Brophy, ""Very few of these scarce rifles have survived in ORIGINAL condition."""

If you have some CCI mini mags with a batch number of K31T19 use extreme caution or wait and see if federal issues a recall on them.  There could be other batches out there but these are the ones that malfunctioned on me.  
I think it was luck that I was using a semi auto at the time.  Had it been a revolver or some other guns with large gaps, there could have been brass slivers going everywhere.   The failed bullets had filled my mkIi with brass slivers and required a tear down, cleaning, inspection and reassembly before continued shooting.  
I'm a long time avid hunter / shooter but never had this happen before and hate to see it happen to someone else.  Especially a youngster or beginner.  Be safe and I will post again with the response from federal."

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

The 522SD has an overall length of 33.5”, weighs in at 6.6 pounds and has a barrel length of 16.25 inches including the faux suppressor ... The GSG-522SD comes standard with a conventional MP5 style stock and forend but American Tactical Imports also offers a multitude of upgrades and tactical accessories to make this rifle unique to your personal style. Why buy and expensive copy when you can own the real thing? Whether you are looking for a low cost tactical trainer or a fun plinker the GSG-522 rifle is the obvious choice.""

The cylinders are pretty tight and the blueing is around 98% and  it shoots where you aim it and it has a 9"" barrel which is great for target shooting. It has plastic grips. The 22 Mag cylinder has had very little use. If this revolver had wooden grips you would think that it was a higher end gun and definetly worth more than I am asking..
