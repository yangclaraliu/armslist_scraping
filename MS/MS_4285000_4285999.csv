My great uncle acquired it during the end of the war. The Americans were surrounded by the Germans and this was a souvenir he had picked up and brought it home in 45.
Very neat piece! Unmolested and in original shape!



All German parts and markings. It is a DUV make and dated 1942. If this gun could talk it has probably been to both fronts during the war (the Russian front and American front in the end). 
Very unique piece! All original German blueing.


Note that the gun has a wartime replacement bolt and collar. These were very common when they were sent from the russian front to fight the european front. If you look at the capture papers it shows the three serial numbers that are on the gun to this day as it was when brought home.

The patina all matches so it is a wartime replacement by the german soldier. It was used on this rifle in the ardennes forest in 44-45.

Is it possible for a pistol small enough to carry every day to have all the features and capacity that you’d expect in a larger pistol? If that pistol is the XD-S® from Springfield Armory®, the answer is yes. The XD-S® 3.3″ 9mm offers so much that you’ll be astonished that it all fits in the small, concealable profile. - See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/xd-s-3-3-9-mm/#sthash.Ct3S6pAS.dpuf"

BTW, the Raptor Grip is awesome; much more natural feeling than a standard shotgun pistol grip and more versatile. I highly recommend checking out videos of it in action on youtube if you've never fired a shotgun with one before.

Slightly under 300 rds through the barrel.  This one comes with barrel sleeve/weight, locking nut, set screw, spanner hex combo tool, locking block and extended 9mm barrel (150mm?) as well as case.  Unfortunately this kit did not arrive from Beretta with the fancy wood grips typically seen with these kits.  Barrel has like new bore (like I said low round count).  

Unfortunately the case does have a crack in it, the victim of one to many military moves apparently.  I will attempt to glue it with an industrial crazy glue and post results.  Barrel and sleeve/weight does have some handling marks as this was a kind of a show/bragging piece.

These kits have not been imported, nor manufactured, by Beretta for several years now.  Kind of a rarity to see these kits for sale.  I sold my 92 a few years ago and just never bought another one, so I no longer need this kit.

SLIDE:  Caspian stainless govt slide.  Has Bomar rear and Novak front sight cuts.  Top of slide does have flat top with serrations running the length of the slide top.  Sides are polished with ""Caspian"" on left side and Caspian C with Wreath logo at the rear, polished side flats.  As with all Caspian slides it is cut for the 9/38 firing pin to prevent primer flow.  Does have some minor marks for being in a parts box, nothing that can't be easily dealt with when finishing build.

'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' utilize 2015 technologies and materials.  All are  AMERICAN MADE, from raw material to the finished product and developed and produced right here in the USA. 
(As a Disabled Veteran, I am glad to see a company that is American Owned, Veteran Owned/Veteran Run.)

Our product line was designed to be vastly improved (2015 technology vs. 1995 technology) over our competitors products or anything previously available.

Our primary product is a hand sewn, Kevlar 'sleeve'. This sleeve encases a sturdy, non-absorbent and nonporous foam element. The foam inner element of our product is slightly over sized thereby allowing it to exert uniform, 360 degree, pressure within the barrel of the weapon.

In a rifled barrel the foam inner element acts to push the Kevlar and cleaner solution into the rifling. Pressing the Kevlar into the rifling, allows it to 'cut into' and remove burnt powder, spent nitrates and the fouling associated with our sport.

'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' contains NO METAL BRUSHES, BRISTLES OR EXPOSED METAL.  Because our 'Bore Scrubbers' were designed to be ‘reversed’, while still inside the barrel, the cleaning motion effectively ""scrubs"" the barrel bore.

This simple action greatly aids, and speeds, the cleaning process, without damaging the weapon or the product itself. We do not recommend you try this with any competitor product, you may damage the weapon, you WILL destroy their product.

In smooth bore (shotgun) barrels the 'carrier' liquid also acts upon the tiny bits and pieces of melted plastic, softening the remnants of the wadding and plastic shell cases associated with shotgun shooting. At the same time, the Kevlar and cleaner solution work in unison to remove carbon, burnt nitrates and powder residues.

Users are able to very quickly clean, and protect, valuable firearms from corrosion, rust and internal damage by utilizing our 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' and combining our proprietary blend of cleaner, lubricant and protectant, the ‘Dragon Tail Bore Cleaner’.

Metal parts, brushes and bristles of our competitors, or the pieces of a traditional cleaning rod, are very prone to damaging the internals of a barrel by adding needless scratches and ‘micro-abrasions’. These damaging ‘micro-abrasions’ may greatly effect accuracy and consistency during shooting. Also, accidentally dragging or dropping our competitor or a traditional rod onto a weapon may result in damage to the finish or bluing. That scenario is completely impossible with our product.

As well as the foam core, the Kevlar is also nonabsorbent and serves to 'wick' the cleaning solution along the working length of the 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubber'. In doing so it greatly reduces the amount of cleaning product needed and helps prevent waste. This allows our product to be more cost effective for users.

'Dragon Tail Bore Cleaner' is our proprietary cleaner using a liquid base serving as the 'carrier' for the actual cleaning product (detergents) and lubricant/protectant. The 'carrier' evaporates very quickly and leaves behind a protective, moisture repellant allowing for long term storage without the need for additional oil patches in the barrel or a second protective product to be applied.

Because 'Dragon Tail' products utilize 2015 Technologies taken from the Aerospace, Aircraft, Automotive Engineering as well as Weapons/Arms/Armor industries, when used properly, a weapon cleaned with 'Dragon Tail' products may be immediately stored for several years, then reloaded and fired, without fear of damage.

By using modern technology we absolutely destroy the 'generations old' methods of our competitors’ products.  Additionally, our products do not have a 'build up' (either sticky or gooey, or hardened and flakey) that may be observed after use of our competitors products.  Remember, our products utilize modern, scientific, Aerospace and Weapons Manufacturing industry materials, elements and technologies.  An added accidental bonus comes in the form of the anti-fingerprint property of our protective finish.

'Dragon Tail Bore Cleaner' may be used over the entire weapon. It will not harm the finish, stocks, grips or synthetics of modern firearms. The same long lasting, moisture repelling properties are then transferred to the exterior of a weapon and allow a single product to thoroughly clean and protect virtually all or your firearm collection possessions.

* Care should be exercised in the cleaning of wooden, varnished portions of “high value” weapons (for instance a $35,000 Merkel Shotgun) as the varnished finish may be susceptible to damage without proper care. The metal interior and exterior surfaces, however, will only benefit from maintenance and cleaning using our products.

Our Bore Scrubbers, unlike our competitors, may often be used for many, many different calibers or weapons rather than just a single caliber.

For example, I have cleaned my .45 ACP pistol then used the same Bore Scrubber to clean my 9mm without damage to the weapon or the Bore Scrubber...  I then decided to demonstrate to a client that I was able to do the same thing with my 12 Ga Bore Scrubber and used it to clean a 16 Ga shotgun.  Although this is NOT recommended and did take a bit of pulling to clear the 9mm and 16 Ga barrels both the 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' performed flawlessly, without damage to themselves or the weapons in question.
(Don't try that with our competitors products... metal bristled Bore Snakes, Hoppes Brushes, or Otis cleaners.  You will destroy their product, and very possibly, damage your weapon.)

And if there's something else that catches my eye I'd be happy to make a deal, either another gun or cash normally would do the trick.But anyways some details on the rifle. It has a 10.5 noveske upper with the double chrome lined barrel from the factory. And a gen 3 noveske lower, but internals are colt that includes the lower parts kit and fire control group. Buffer, buffer tube, spring all came from spikes and it has the T2 buffer in it which surprisingly does make quite the difference in recoil. And of course it has a Sig brace on it. And lastly it is topped with a Burris 536 optic that is really nice and great glass. So that said all this fun stuff has me around 2700-2800$ after all said and done. But no I'm not looking to get that out of it as far as cash goes but I'm not looking to take a large loss either. Just make an offer if your looking to buy and we can talk. I am open to shipping but it will be on your dime and I do have PayPal so I can accept payment that way as well. As far as trades go I'm open to partial trades and cash as long as it's firearm related. So no I don't want your 1980's surround sound or broke down lawn mower. Just firearms. But if you have any questions feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer them thanks."

FROM THE MANUFACTURE...



The OM2P-HS 802.11n (802.11g compatible) wireless mesh access point is ideally suited for providing robust internet coverage just about anywhere you need to share a connection. Examples include hotels, apartments, neighborhoods, coffee shops, shopping malls, campgrounds, and marinas.

For 2014, we've improved the OM2P-HS with the following features:
1. Dual PoE Support: Use either passive 12-24v PoE or standard 802.3af PoE as used in PoE switches.
2. High power: Doubled power to 23 dBm (200 mW) from 20 dBm (100 mW).

With 23 dBm power (200 mW) at even the highest speeds (5-8 dBi higher than most business class access points) and dual receive amplifiers, the OM2P-HS boosts incoming signals to provide exceptional range at twice the speed of the original OM2P. Since its dual antennas are internal (same 2 dBi gain as the OM2P), it fits into housings the OM2P can't, like the Ceiling and Ethernet Wall Jack enclosures. Even the outdoor enclosure is a cleaner, more sealed installation as the antenna doesn't protrude outside the housing.

The OM2P-HS is compatible with both passive 12-24v PoE and standard 802.3af PoE, so these access points can be powered with Open-Mesh's line of passive PoE injectors or standard PoE switches."

And if there's something else that catches my eye I'd be happy to make a deal, either another gun or cash normally would do the trick, cash is king though.But anyways some details on the rifle. It has a 10.5 noveske upper with the double chrome lined barrel from the factory. And a gen 3 noveske lower, but internals are colt that includes the lower parts kit and fire control group. Buffer, buffer tube, spring all came from spikes and it has the T2 buffer in it which surprisingly does make quite the difference in recoil. And of course it has a Sig brace on it. And lastly it is topped with a Burris 332 optic that is really nice and great glass. So that said all this fun stuff has me around 2700-2800$ after all said and done. But no I'm not looking to get that out of it as far as cash goes but I'm not looking to take a large loss either. Just make an offer if your looking to buy and we can talk. I am open to shipping but it will be on your dime and I do have PayPal so I can accept payment that way as well. As far as trades go I'm open to partial trades and cash as long as it's firearm related. So no I don't want your 1980's surround sound or broke down lawn mower. Just firearms. But if you have any questions feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer them thanks. And for a little extra I can thrown in some ammo as well.

 Value breakdown
Noveske complete upper before shipping - 1578$
Noveske gen 3 stripped lower -310$
Lpk minus trigger(colt) - 70$
Colt FCG - 75$ or geissele ssa trigger 220$
Spikes buffer tube kit w/T2 buffer - 70$ 
Moe grip - 35$
Sig brace - 110$
Burris 332 - 300$ 

All that equals 2548 but after tax it's 2738ish$, so there's the breakdown guys for those asking. Also yes I'll sell or trade the gun without the optic. I do ask if you have a trade your value/investment is around what I have. Can add geisselle ssa trigger for 2200$, 2100$ with the colt trigger.

Marked Châtellerault. This rifle is dated 1916 and is marked with the ""N"" on the receiver. Stock, barrel, and trigger guard match. Lock-up is tight and I have personally fired this weapon at 100 yard range and determined it is just as the little carbine is known to be -- very sturdy and accurate! A real pleasure to shoot. The bore is good and I have found no rust or pitting. Rifling is strong. 

Here is a link to comments on my rifle. One estimate of value was 300 Euros ($315).

These guns are not too often found in America. 

Small cut located at bottom of stock is not someone's attempt at making a sporter, but is the site of a French-done wood repair that must have fallen out over the years. This is very common. Also, slot in bottom of stock is not missing sling swivel by accident, but was removed by the French for the Artillery carbine and just never sealed up. Overall, rifle has that nice battle-damaged appearance while still offering a completely strong and serviceable rifle. A piece of history straight from WWI! 

Comes with 4 original 5-shot Mannlicher clips and 48 rounds of black primer (best in my experience) 8mm Lebel ammo. 

Thanks for your time and shoot me an email!

This is a former LE firearm that has some rare markings. First of all, it is a Canadian Colt. It is marked “Colt Defense, Hartford Conn, Made in Canada”. This is fairly rare in the USA. Researching this I found that Colt typically does not sell whole AR’s made in Canada, back into the US. There was apparently a contract overrun and some of these rifles were allowed into the US for sale to law enforcement entities. That brings me to the next unusual marking on this rifle. There is a decal on the buttstock stating “Property of Calif Dept of Corr & Rehab”. Other interesting markings are the receiver is marked “Cal. 223”, but the full heavy barrel is marked “C MP 5.56 NATO 1/9 HBAR”. This rifle came to me with an ambidextrous safety (Factory???). The M16 bolt and bolt carrier are correctly marked for the Canadian rifle. The right side of the mag well is LE/Military restricted marked. Please note the blackened edited areas on the receiver are only on the photos to keep the serial numbers private and do not appear on the actual firearm. The action is very smooth, as is the trigger. There are some honest handling marks, but overall the condition is very good. Payment will be by check or money order and I will wait for payment to clear before shipping. Buyer will pay actual shipping cost. Not interested in doing any trades.."

This is a former LE firearm that has some rare markings. First of all, it is a Canadian Colt. It is marked “Colt Defense, Hartford Conn, Made in Canada”. This is fairly rare in the USA. Researching this I found that Colt typically does not sell whole AR’s made in Canada, back into the US. There was apparently a contract overrun and some of these rifles were allowed into the US for sale to law enforcement entities. That brings me to the next unusual marking on this rifle. There is a decal on the buttstock stating “Property of Calif Dept of Corr & Rehab”. Other interesting markings are the receiver is marked “Cal. 223”, but the full heavy barrel is marked “C MP 5.56 NATO 1/9 HBAR”. This rifle came to me with an ambidextrous safety (Factory???). The M16 bolt and bolt carrier are correctly marked for the Canadian rifle. The right side of the mag well is LE/Military restricted marked. Please note the blackened edited areas on the receiver are only on the photos to keep the serial numbers private and do not appear on the actual firearm. The action is very smooth, as is the trigger. There are some honest handling marks, but overall the condition is very good. Payment will be by check or money order and I will wait for payment to clear before shipping. Buyer will pay actual shipping cost. Not interested in doing any trades.."

Information about our products.

 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' utilize 2015 technologies and materials. All are AMERICAN MADE, from raw material to the finished product and developed and produced right here in the USA. 
 (As a Disabled Veteran, I am glad to see a company that is American Owned, Veteran Owned/Veteran Run.)

 Our product line was designed to be vastly improved (2015 technology vs. 1995 technology) over our competitors products or anything previously available.

 Our primary product is a hand sewn, Kevlar 'sleeve'. This sleeve encases a sturdy, non-absorbent and nonporous foam element. The foam inner element of our product is slightly over sized thereby allowing it to exert uniform, 360 degree, pressure within the barrel of the weapon.

 In a rifled barrel the foam inner element acts to push the Kevlar and cleaner solution into the rifling. Pressing the Kevlar into the rifling, allows it to 'cut into' and remove burnt powder, spent nitrates and the fouling associated with our sport.

 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' contains NO METAL BRUSHES, BRISTLES OR EXPOSED METAL. Because our 'Bore Scrubbers' were designed to be ‘reversed’, while still inside the barrel, the cleaning motion effectively ""scrubs"" the barrel bore.

 This simple action greatly aids, and speeds, the cleaning process, without damaging the weapon or the product itself. We do not recommend you try this with any competitor product, you may damage the weapon, you WILL destroy their product.

 In smooth bore (shotgun) barrels the 'carrier' liquid also acts upon the tiny bits and pieces of melted plastic, softening the remnants of the wadding and plastic shell cases associated with shotgun shooting. At the same time, the Kevlar and cleaner solution work in unison to remove carbon, burnt nitrates and powder residues.

 Users are able to very quickly clean, and protect, valuable firearms from corrosion, rust and internal damage by utilizing our 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' and combining our proprietary blend of cleaner, lubricant and protectant, the ‘Dragon Tail Bore Cleaner’.

Metal parts, brushes and bristles of our competitors, or the pieces of a traditional cleaning rod, are very prone to damaging the internals of a barrel by adding needless scratches and ‘micro-abrasions’. These damaging ‘micro-abrasions’ may greatly effect accuracy and consistency during shooting. Also, accidentally dragging or dropping our competitor or a traditional rod onto a weapon may result in damage to the finish or bluing. That scenario is completely impossible with our product.

 As well as the foam core, the Kevlar is also nonabsorbent and serves to 'wick' the cleaning solution along the working length of the 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubber'. In doing so it greatly reduces the amount of cleaning product needed and helps prevent waste. This allows our product to be more cost effective for users.

 'Dragon Tail Bore Cleaner' is our proprietary cleaner using a liquid base serving as the 'carrier' for the actual cleaning product (detergents) and lubricant/protectant. The 'carrier' evaporates very quickly and leaves behind a protective, moisture repellant allowing for long term storage without the need for additional oil patches in the barrel or a second protective product to be applied.

 Because 'Dragon Tail' products utilize 2015 Technologies taken from the Aerospace, Aircraft, Automotive Engineering as well as Weapons/Arms/Armor industries, when used properly, a weapon cleaned with 'Dragon Tail' products may be immediately stored for several years, then reloaded and fired, without fear of damage.

 By using modern technology we absolutely destroy the 'generations old' methods of our competitors’ products. Additionally, our products do not have a 'build up' (either sticky or gooey, or hardened and flakey) that may be observed after use of our competitors products. Remember, our products utilize modern, scientific, Aerospace and Weapons Manufacturing industry materials, elements and technologies. An added accidental bonus comes in the form of the anti-fingerprint property of our protective finish.

 'Dragon Tail Bore Cleaner' may be used over the entire weapon. It will not harm the finish, stocks, grips or synthetics of modern firearms. The same long lasting, moisture repelling properties are then transferred to the exterior of a weapon and allow a single product to thoroughly clean and protect virtually all or your firearm collection possessions.

 * Care should be exercised in the cleaning of wooden, varnished portions of “high value” weapons (for instance a $35,000 Merkel Shotgun) as the varnished finish may be susceptible to damage without proper care. The metal interior and exterior surfaces, however, will only benefit from maintenance and cleaning using our products.

 Our Bore Scrubbers, unlike our competitors, may often be used for many, many different calibers or weapons rather than just a single caliber.

 For example, I have cleaned my .45 ACP pistol then used the same Bore Scrubber to clean my 9mm without damage to the weapon or the Bore Scrubber... I then decided to demonstrate to a client that I was able to do the same thing with my 12 Ga Bore Scrubber and used it to clean a 16 Ga shotgun. Although this is NOT recommended and did take a bit of pulling to clear the 9mm and 16 Ga barrels both the 'Dragon Tail Bore Scrubbers' performed flawlessly, without damage to themselves or the weapons in question.
 (Don't try that with our competitors products... metal bristled Bore Snakes, Hoppes Brushes, or Otis cleaners. You will destroy their product, and very possibly, damage your weapon.)

This match grade pistol is capable of 2-inch groups at 25 meters.  The MK 23 can be fired in double action (12 lbs.) or lighter, shorter single trigger action (4.8 lbs.).

     It features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release on both sides of the frame. The trigger guard is wide enough to allow use of gloves. The decoking lever will silently lower the hammer with the sear and hammer in a rebounded position not touching the firing pin. The factory threaded barrel and Universal Mounting Groves on the front of the frame allow for a variety of accessories.

     A permanent protective coating makes the MK 23 waterproof and corrosion-resistant and with recommended lubricants is reliable in extreme cold, hot wet and hot dry climates, heavy rain and water operations including salt water.  It is easily and quickly field striped to 5 major assembly parts plus a magazine.

     This HK 23 has the same 12-round magazine as the government version.  Heckler & Koch offers the MK 23 to law enforcement and on the civilian market with a few differences including the slide engraving ""Mark 23” instead of ""MK23 USSOCOM"", matte vs satin finish, and barrel conforming to SAAMI headspace specifications to improve ball ammunition reliability.

     I am the original owner and have fired less than 500 rounds of 45 ACP FMJ ammunition through it.  I am supplying added accessories including the HK 16 x 1 mm right hand thread protector ($25), HK Mark 23 picatinny rail adaptor by Rhyno Technologies ($108), (3) 12 round magazines ($80 each), the original case, operators manual, factory test casing, (2) extra barrel O-rings, HK lock and keys, and proof of purchase as the original owner ($2,200).
