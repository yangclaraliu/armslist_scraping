The plug is already in the gun. Perfect shotgun for a youngster who is learning to hunt / shoot. The wood is a little banged up but it's just normal wear and year that has occurred in the field.

Private Ohio sale, no Tax, no government paperwork.  I love this shotgun.  It is short, has high 12 gauge round capacity with a pistol grip.  Only reason I am selling is due to a shoulder injury that almost makes it too difficult now to pump and chamber shells.  I took it to the range once and put 12 rounds through it.  When I describe it as like new in box, it is a very accurate description.

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".  You do the math, shorter rounds mean added capacity.

I have also included in the total price a highly suggested accessory for Vertical Grip users, which cost me $44.95.
Hi-Tech's KSG Billet Lower Picatinny Rail for Vertical Grips.  Slides right over existing plastic lower rail with flush mounting set screws. No sticking out screws & slim custom design specifically for the KSG.  This item prevents plastic rail breakages for vertical pistol grip users.

I also have other highly desired accessories that were never installed at additional cost if interested.

Benelli Nova black pump action shotgun, she is totally clean.Barrel Length:28"" Round Capacity:4 + 1 Hand: Right Gun Weight:8 lbs.

Aggressive ribbing on the pistol grip and forearm provide a secure hold on the gun under any circumstances. A magazine disconnect button on the bottom of the forearm allows user to quickly unload the chamber without releasing another round from the magazine to quickly load another round via the ejection port in the event that a different shooting situation suddenly presents itself. The matte finished steel barrel features ventilated stepped rib with a mid bead and red-bar front sight. The Nova utilizes a magazine cap that doubles as a tool for pushing out the single pin that holds the trigger assembly in place, making fieldstripping fast and easy. The 12 gauge Nova has a 3-1/2"" chamber. The Benelli Nova Pump-Action Shotgun comes with 3 standard screw-in choke tubes (F, M, IC), and choke tool. 

This gun is clean, really clean. My price is firm at $300.00 she is clean so any less Ill keep it and continue to enjoy her..

Well, I just want you to know that the G42 in .380 is one hell of a nice little carry power house. I took it to the range today and what an extreme surprise. The gun is as accurate right out of the box as they claim.
I was popping head shots at 15 yards with such precision that I couldn't believe it. This little dude is all Glock. Yes all Glock. It is so impressive that the ones I have read about online, I thought it would be Glocks dud. WRONG. I went and bought another one. 
I am selling the first one that I bought with 50 rounds through it with all factory and 3 mags. One mag is stock, one mag has a Pierce pinky extension and I bought a Glock extension to make it and 8 round mag. I have everything from factory and am asking for $495 with a Klydex carbon fiber ITW hard holster. I have done the same with my new one and am keeping it. I assure you that this gun is very impressive and you need to check it out for your self. Perfect conceal/carry and critical defense ammo hollow points will make it all that much better.

That's my only complaint about this gun. But it's enough to make me hesitate to grab it as my go-to when going into the woods or the range. 5 other people have shot it, none of them hit the button. Guess it's just my massive mitts :( 

Excellent shape, owned it less than a month. Exactly 171 rounds (CCI and Hornady. No junk.) through it. 

My kids love it. All the bang and flash of a large caliber with the recoil of a .22. I can fire 10 rounds in under 2 seconds and keep it within a foot of the first shot. And with a 30 round magazine, you can really tear some stuff up!"

Designed for speed, precision, and clarity of sight picture, our one-sight-fits-all Glock pistol sight kit includes:
•5 differently colored front sights
•5 differently colored rear sight inserts
•.044"" of elevation shim
(pink = .015"", clear = .008"", tan = .004"", red = .002"")
•Front sight tool and rear sight set screw hex key

Start with one .015"" (pink) shim for 9mm and .40 cal; and one .004"" (tan) shim for .357 sig and 45 acp. Amount of needed shim will vary, depending on load and particular barrel. Approximately, each increment of .002"" to .0025"" of elevation shim will affect bullet impact by 1"" at 25 yards. With the tools provided with each sight kit, most will be able to install our Glock sights without professional help."

The Winchester Model 1894 lever-action rifle is most commonly known, as the USA's first small-bore, sporting rifle cartridge designed for smokeless powder.

I have taken a doe as far out as 275 yards with this gun, a number of hogs, in short she is dead on! 

She has been well loved and would make an ideal deer rifle for the up coming season. I mounted the scope so its done right..

She is very effective on deer-sized game, most commercial loadings are limited in effective range to about 200 yd. but like I said I killed a doe with a neck shoot at 275 yards last year with this gun.

If you are interested she's for sale, the weapon is a really clean gun so I am not going to move too much from my asking price, I would be happy keeping her handy. I have two 94s so I was thinking about selling one of them, but I am in no rush to part with this classic firearm that I know can take game and help fill the freezer!

my price is firm, there aren't too many like her for sell in San Antonio or Texas right now.

I've had this mounted on my 870 for a couple of years now, bought it online brand new. It hasn't had all that much use as my 870 has been pulling home defense duty up until I sold it recently. It's in excellent shape save for a scratch or two on the rail from mounting optics. The shell carriers retain shells using a rubber strip on the inside, which I've tried to capture in the pics. I didn't keep shells in it for storage, so it still has most of it's retention ""grab"" left, not to mention that it can be rotated under the shell carrier to use the other side or moved down. Very versatile system. Just need to move this as I'm out of the 870 platform. Includes mounting screws and pins(pins not in pic)asking $60 FTF or +shipping to US only. Email me with any questions.

Vortex level attached, LWRC folding iron sights, and configured for California compliance (don't need to tell me how messed up that is, so if you're out of state you're fortunate). The stock, grip and fore end covers are in Flat Dark Earth, while the rest is black. The charging handle is on the side (piston driven, not a direct impingement like the AR-10). Thus the reputation as a clean running gun as well. The gas block is adjustable in four settings, for various loads (if you reload) or mount a suppressor (if legally used and obtained). Will provide the operation manual for the scope. Sorry, but I'm retaining the sling, case and bipod seen in the photos. This gun has proven extremely reliable and accurate for me, but son's college has become the driving factor. Less than 950-rounds count. There is a little sign of use at the charging handle (of course), and on the 4-magazines. Otherwise it is essentially unblemished. Excellent condition for a used gun. (And for those of you with a good eye, yes the LaRue QD rings were mounted on the opposite side, to avoid catching your hand when operating the charging handle - but you're welcome to change it when you buy)."

Product info-
This sight is smaller than the former N-cell battery sight and runs on a single 123 battery. It also has a longer battery life than the N-cell style sights. Smaller, lighter and always fast with three reticle options. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights or NV mount.- Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length - Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space compared to the 4 inch N battery sights - Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved - Battery compartment is now separated from the base to allow it to hover over the delta ring of the rifle - Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 500-600 hours, 3X battery life of N cell sights - Reticle: 65 MOA circle with 1 MOA aiming dot.

According to Remington's dating system the serial number on this gun dates to either 1965 or 1975.  This gun has seen lots of use and shows some wear.  It functions perfectly and very smooth.  Having owned both I can definitely say the quality of these Wingmaster 870 is far better than the more common 870 express shotguns!
I am selling this one is because I currently have no need for 4 12ga shotguns, so a couple of them have got to go!

This is the TacOps equivalent.  However, you will NOT find this gun anywhere else.  Here's why: when I purchased this gun, I had the dealer send it directly to Gray Guns for their Action Cleanup Perfection Package.  I also had them install their new P-SPIT trigger.  Therefore, this is basically identical to what Sig is selling right now with their Legion guns.  Same guts, but in a TacOps version.  Test fired only by Sig and Gray Guns.  

Here is the blurb from Gray Guns:  “Our flagship Action Cleanup Perfection package includes detailed refitting, polishing and refinishing of the internal parts mated with installation of our proprietary springs to yield the smoothest double-action (DA) and cleanest single-action (SA) pulls possible on this platform. The DA pull weight is optimized for carry and LEO duty applications while retaining 100% reliability with defensive-grade ammunition, and the SA pull is set at approximately 4 to 4.5 pounds.""

""Like all of our action packages, the ACP also includes full feed and reliability work and a comprehensive armorer’s inspection, test firing and sight regulation for your complete confidence.”

P-SPIT:  ""NEW Grayguns P-Series Precision Intermediate Trigger (P-SPIT) add-on option for all SIG Sauer action packages."" 

TacOps already has the fiber optic front night sight and rear night sight, Short Reset Trigger and four 15-round mags.  Selling because in the four months I waited for the gun, other financial priorities cropped up.  NOT INTERESTED IN TRADES OR LOWER OFFERS, gun is priced fairly.  The Gray Guns work alone cost over $350."

The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward.  The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel.  Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 14 rounds of 12 gage 2-3/4"" rounds (7 per tube).  The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube.  The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine.  A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser.  The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights.  Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included.  The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The Kestrel 9 was designed for 9mm and .30 caliber applications up to .308.SuppressionThe Kestrel 9 provides a hearing safe centerfire rifle suppressor for the 9mm and .30 caliber carbine platforms (up to .308) that can be easily maintained and repaired. It does not disappoint.MaintenanceCleaning the Kestrel 9 is a breeze. Centerfire rifle suppressors need to be cleaned and inspected, just like rimfire suppressors.With the Kestrel 9 full user servicability is truely a reality.The Kestrel core is constructed of stainless steel for superior cleanability. You can use chemical solutions safe to stainless steel but that remove nasty lead deposits (the ""Dip""). The core breaks down so that you can put it into a reloading tumbler, or use a bead blaster for fast and efficient cleaning. And unlike other monocore technologies, you can dip your Kestrel core without worrying about damaging the exposed finish on your core.Kestrel baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Kestrel core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it.And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to disassemble your silencer is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.LongevityThere are several features designed into the Kestrel to ensure your safe and enjoyable use of the Kestrel beyond a lifetime.Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. The Kestrel design separates the end cap from the registered part so that if there is an end cap strike it will be more likely your suppressor can be repaired or replaced without having to replace the registered part.We are huge proponents of stacked bafle technology for another reason. With a monocore, there is only one blast baffle. When that blast baffle erodes, the core has to be replaced. This may or may not be a warranty repair, but in any event you have lost the use of your suppressor while it is at the manufacturer for repair.Kestrel core baffles should be rotated (like tires) whenever the core is cleaned. With four baffles available to act as blast baffles, the Kestrel 9 will allow up to four times the number of rounds fired before re-coring.SafetyThe Kestrel core is fully encased in an inner stainless steel wall. In the event of an internal baffle strike, the inner core is strong enough to capture the damaged projectile and baffle material, protecting the tube as much as possible against catastrophic failure.

Low price point. Great suppression.The suppressor that launched a company. The Guardian 22 was the first suppressor in the Huntertown Arms lineup. From its earliest inception the goal was simple - create a great quality suppressor with best-in-class suppression that could be purchased for the price of a tax stamp. You could spend hundreds more for another .22 suppressor, but ask your self one question - why? Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, multi-caliber usage, upgradability, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Guardian 22 has it all.SuppressionThe Guardian 22 compares favorably to suppressors costing twice as much on the market today, demonstrating our commitment to provide the best sound suppression possible. The Guardian utilizes K baffle technology, a tried and true baffle technology used in the quietest suppressors available.MaintenanceJust because you can take a suppressor apart when it's clean doesn't make it user serviceable. How many manufacturers claim to have user serviceable suppressors, but when you use it you find out their claims are just that - claims. Their special tools break, don't work, or you didn't buy them because they wanted an extra $50.Even if the tool worked, you can't get the suppressor apart to clean it yourself, after as few as a couple hundred rounds fired.And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.LongevityThere are several features designed into the Guardian 22 to ensure safe and enjoyable use beyond a lifetime.Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. Our end caps are made of softer aluminum so that if there is an end cap strike, the end cap will give way causing minimal if any damage to the rest of your Guardian 22 suppressor. The affected end cap, and any damaged baffles can be easily replaced without having to replace the entire core.UpgradabilityThe Guardian 22 shares the same dimensions as our Kestrel 22, a premium level, heavy duty suppressor providing best in class suppression along with unparrelled maintainence and longevity options. Your Guardian 22 can be upgraded at any time to use the Kestrel core, giving you a path to to most capable rimfire suppressor we offer.Multi-caliberWhat's your caliber of choice? 22LR? 22 WMR? 17HMR? Whatever it is, rest easy knowing your Guardian 22 was designed to handle the pressures generated.Other OptionsThe Guardian 22 can be configured with a stainless steel endcap (on the muzzle attach side) and/or stainless steel blast chamber."

They are hard to find guns and represent one of Colt's best offerings for a carry capable gun in the standard government profile.  The gun is a Colt 1991 that was upgraded from the factory with a beavertail grip safety, fiber optic sights and an extended thumb safety.  

This gun went through the Colt Custom shop at one point to have a new thumb safety fitted as the factory one had some slop in it.  The custom shop test fired the gun, and the target is included with the sale.  Gun shoots like a laser beam, as you can see.  Gun has about 1000 rounds through it and is just beginning to shoe some muzzle wear and has a few nicks here and there but is overall very nice condition.  Not a safe queen, but a real quality shooter for CCW, a range toy, or shooting CDP in idpa 

I received the gun from its first owner, and have subsequently upgraded it even further to make it one heck of a carry gun.  Here's the list

Warren tactical tritium front sight and blacked out rear
10-8 performance bar stock slide stop pin
Wilson Combat bullet proof thumb safety.  Snicks on and off positively with no slop
Ed Brown Wood double diamond grips with orings from Harrison Customs
Nighthawk Custom onepiece magwell (this alone was $160)

Gun comes with the box, and two original mags that it shipped with.

You can read about it at Surefire dot com. The 30 round PMAG mags are ganged together but you can easily separate them with a screwdriver.  It will accept any AR15 30 round mag.  I put about 100 rounds through it and it runs like a Rolex.  The Sig red dot holds zero very well.  It has a flip-up rear sight that co-witnesses through the red dot to the front sight.  I have the other picatinny rail for the left side of the front hand grip.  You can use them or not. This Sig looks like a new one.  It is one mean little piece of 60 round badness! It is only 20 1/4"" in total length and easily fits in a ukelele case available from Guitar Center or eBay for $7-30 bucks. Add an arm brace and have the next best thing to a SBR.  Reason for sale, I like to try different firearms. REDACTED.

Here is a recent reply to an interested party,

You probably already read about the P556 but I can testify that it is everything they say it is.  I like this model better than the quad rail version.  I had one of those for awhile and the front grip was like holding a porcupine.  This one has provisions to mount lights and lasers on the left and right sides of the foregrip. I have had no jams or misfires and it is very accurate through the red dot.  I have created a way to shoot it accurately by steadying the butt against my armpit and shoot it like a mini-rifle.  I can show you that.  I opted not to get the arm brace because I loved keeping it short (20 1/4"").  It is so mean for such a small package.

I will use the money to try other interesting guns.  I am sure I will miss this one.  If I had unlimited funds I would keep it as a ""Hey guys, check this one out"" when someone is showing off their new Glock or whatever."

Was bought and tried on and size adjusted only, never worn, outfitted, or used. Was going to use for my truck rig and then sold my AK so i could buy a narwhal. If you operationally operate an Ak while doing operational ops, then its amazing you have operated this long and lived without this rig. You are not going to find this cheaper then here. Would like to sell local to a hometown operator, i don't feel like shipping. 

This up-grade to the standard AK Attack Rack features the same US PALM designed and purpose built AK47 Magazine Pouches as the original AKAR on the front, but with MOLLE attachment points on the side areas
(3 x 3) which accommodate accessory pouches or other MOLLE gear.

Above the static rifle mag pouches, are (2) adjustable-flap magazine/utility pouches.  The large zippered main pocket can accommodate extra magazines or other larger pieces of gear (some end users use this as an ad-hoc dump pouch).  The side-top seams split open to accommodate our Rack-Holster or Rack Radio Insert.  The bottom of the carrier provides access to the armor pocket, which accommodates our custom level IIIa soft armor panel (sold separately) to provide full frontal and partial side coverage.  MOLLE attachments for a groin protector, glove hanger or dump pouch are located on the rear of carrier.  The 3rd Generation H-Harness provides for a flat mounting yet fully adjustable solution.  A 1” adjustable waist belt completes the rig.

The AKAR v2 is constructed of 500d Cordura nylon, and utilizes made in the USA hardware and materials.
Made in the USA."
