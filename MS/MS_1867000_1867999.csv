This is a mechanically fine, cosmetically poor revolver. It's accurate with a surprisingly smooth trigger, and crisp single action. There is obvious finish wear with signs of pitting (as shown) by the trigger guard. It isn't currently rusting, so I'm assuming the pitting was an old wound, if you will.

It was originally a Chilean Security Services pistol, and it's one of the older models. It's a good, solid revolver that could use an aesthetic touch up that I'm not capable of doing."

Back before the ""Automatic pistols"" came in, the S&W model 10 was one of the main guns carried by the police. It is calibered in 38-special and has no rust to be found on it, the inside of the barrel is polished to perfection and it still fires amazingly. I do notice that the accuracy seems a little off but that may just be due to my trigger finger. These guns will go for over $700 new. However, this one is used to some extent so I'm gonna ask a little lower. Looking to get about $350 out of it.

You read it right, this rifle has only the one round the factory shot through it, and not another. The 6 mags are loaded with CCI ammunition and two molle pouches that hold three mags each. These two pouches are currently connected to the molle webbing that covers the front of bag, freeing up the usage of the bags two deep pockets that ruger has provided. There's plenty more room for added molle attachment possibilities, an emergency med kit, canteen, binoculars, etc....... whatever you decide???

This rifle has a stainless barrel and receiver that is great for those occasions where you're unable to wipe it down right away. It has a synthic stock and it comes with the detached rail from the factory. It also comes a mount and lock. The picture will show you what it comes with.

I have it listed for 575 but will work with you a LITTLE as this is already cheaper than you'd be able to purchase this from the store."

I've had this exact same ammunition listed for the past few weeks at an average of $1.25 per slug and they've been selling quite steadily.  But, it's time to get rid of them so I'm now asking an average of $1 per slug.  It's very close to what they sell for in the stores when you can find them but with me you're avoiding tax, any possible shipping, and of course... being on somebody's ""LIST"" that you bought ammunition!  
--(insert sinister music and sounds of black helicopters)--

If you are reading this, no reason to ask if the ammo is still available. Simply email me and I will reply ASAP and set up a time to meet with you. Again, no reason to ask if they are available. This posting will be removed immediately upon sale being completed.

I *WILL* reply to all emails. Please be patient. If you don't get an immediate reply, it's likely because where I'm at puts me with limited contact and access to a computer or my phone to respond to emails.

Thanks for looking.  I value my reputation and stand behind what I sell.  I don't sell anything I don't personally shoot."

This is honestly the most accurate 5.56 I have ever shot, and the bullpup design allows for this as it provides for a 16 in barrel while ensuring the total length is still below a 10in sbr at full compression.  This model is one of the models that allows for regular AR mags as well so you will not have to buy special mags.  With this rifle I am including 5 mags, the rifle, and a hard case.

It was bought as a stock A2, but I have changed a little bit of stuff on it.  It now has a Quad-Rail w/Magpul covers on it, a Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) precision-adjustable butt stock, Ergo Tactical Deluxe Grip w/Shelf, a forward grip & bi-pod all in one, a Blackhawk Tactical single point sling & the original sling with it/ on it, a free extra plastic grip, Colorado legal mags to go with it.  I will also throw in an adjustable stock w/ tube, nut, & adapter plates.  The Armalite AR10's use the same spring in the carbine that it uses in the rifle version, however you would need to buy a heavy carbine buffer for it (H3 buffer).  As far as mags go I have (2)15RD, (2)10RD, & (2)5RD Mags as a part of this deal.  Now yes there are fancier AR's out there that have lights, scopes, lasers, & who knows what else, but if you look at what your getting and what it would cost you in retail to just get what I have done to this one, and you compare it to what I am asking you will see that it is a pretty good deal.  You can use this gun to play or even hunt since it is a 308 w/20in barrel on it.  So please no low-ball offers, I don't want to nor do I really need to sale it, I made a deal with my wife to sale it because I have two of them, and there is some stuff that we would like to do around the house.  You can look up the retail prices if you want but I looked them up as I was writing this ad, so these prices are right now prices.  I can tell you now that I over paid retail on the gun new because it was just a little after Obama was elected so I am taking a big loss by putting it up for sale, so my loss will be your gain.

Comes with two 30-round magazines and a 5-round mag, and over 500 rounds of ammo in a new weatherproof ammo box (mix of brass and steel).  Has a Weaver Marksman 4x scope on it with black rings (the scope has seen extensive use on several of my rifles so the body has some dings and scratches, but the sights are clear and crisp).  I'll throw in a second set of silver rings if you'd rather have that look, or want to keep a second scope ready for a quick change-over.  (I can mount a Simmons Blazer 3-9x40 instead of the Weaver, or include it with the package for an extra fee).  I'm including a leather rifle bag that's quilted on the inside and fits the rifle perfectly without the scope mounted.  

I'm also including a Tapco Intrafuse tactical stock with angled and straight 6-position extendable butt, and rails top and bottom to mount your favorite accessories.  Pistol grip has a compartment for batteries, small tools, whatever.  It also includes the mounting hardware so you don't have to swap it over from your stock.  (The Sig Sauer Mako foregrip pictured is NOT included, but I may include it for an extra price if you want it.)

The rifle's been to the range a few times for breaking in, but it's clean and in great condition and ready to visit the range with you, protect your home/farm, or take down a deer for you.

The classic look of an M-14 with the firepower of an AK-47 and the reliability and accuracy of a new Ruger Ranch rifle.  Plus the ability to accessorize with AR goodies."

The Ruger BX-25 Magazine was designed from the ground up, in-house at the Ruger factory, for flawless function and reliability in any Ruger 10/22 rifle or carbine. A rugged polymer body and follower make the magazine capable of handling prolonged use and almost any environmental condition. The steel magazine feed lips are engineered to withstand thousands of rounds without significant wear, drastically reducing ammunition feeding-related malfunctions and solving a problem that has plagued increased-capacity 10/22 magazines since their inception. The BX-25 magazine's 25-round capacity and excellent functional reliability are certain to make any trip to the range more enjoyable, with greater time spent shooting and less dedicated to clearing malfunctions and reloading."

The Sturmgewehr 44 was originally developed in Nazi Germany during World War II, and is well-known for being one of the first modern “assault rifles” to see major deployment. In honor of the Sturmgewehr, German Sport Guns has released the GSG Schmeisser STG-44—a replica model that’s dialed back to semi-auto and chambered in .22 LR. It’s being imported to the United States by ATI. The GSG Schmeisser STG-44 is designed to retain as many of the original specs as possible. Called the “Schmeisser” STG-44 in honor of the Sturmgewehr 44's original designer."

Used 90% condition British military version of the FN FAL (British military flash suppressor, bayonet lug, inch pattern, etc.). The Right Arm Of The Free World. The FAL has been adopted by and still the main battle rifle of over 70 NATO countries. Bore is bright and shiny, no rust on bore or anywhere on the rifle. Canadian receiver. OD green furniture. Accepts inch and metric FAL mags. Rifle comes with (4) 20rd mags and removable bipod. This is a very nice battle rifle, built before Century made junk. Very accurate, big downrange punch, it has never failed to function, and 20 rounds of .308 is FUN no matter who you are!  The only reason I’m selling is to finance another (expensive) multi-firearm purchase and I'm asking less than it's worth so please respect that. This rifle is already banned in CA, so it's sure to be at the top of ""the list"" if a ban happens, IMO, because this is one true military type rifle that can 'take care of business'  (BTW I spent most of my life in CA and have personally experienced the violation of an ""assault weapons"" ban  so I tell ya folks...a ban CAN happen in the near future. Keep fighting for your 2nd amendment rights or we will lose them!). 

This is a great longer range, harder hitting, reliable, battle proven and reasonably priced companion to your AR. 

The pictured near mint condition 4X TRILUX “suit” scope possibly available for additional $500 to complete a British Military L1A1/SUIT package.

This rifle was built for the price conscious user who is looking for a good quality and inexpensive AR15 style rifle for range practice and/or home defense. They were able to do so by changing some features that should NOT upset the majority of target shooting users out there. The barrel used is made in house – 16″ without m203 cuts, melanite coated inside and out, 1:8 twist rate, and 5R rifled. The 5R rifled barrel designs have been in use by Thompson Center, a S&W owned company, for a long time in order to produce an inexpensive and very accurate product. Those looking for a milspec rifle, this isn’t the one for you, but melanite has proven itself a durable, corrosion resistant, uniform coating that can be considered more accurate than chrome lining. Other differences on the Sport models include: an upper receiver lacking a dusk cover and forward assist, a lower receiver with integral enhanced trigger guard, LMT style removable rear sight and A2 style front sight, chromed gas key and bolt carrier and other standard A2 styled parts. For those budget conscious shooters out there looking for a rifle that offers good quality with a low sticker price, the M&P15 Sport rifle may be just what you’re looking for.

ultimate refinement with the introduction of the SIG516 rifle. With its
chrome-lined, phosphated, military grade barrel and adjustable,
four-position gas regulator, the SIG516 incorporates all of the most
desirable mechanical improvements. Add to these a free-floating quad rail
forend and barrel, and you have the most advanced, versatile AR-based rifle
available. The SIG516 Patrol comes with a Magpul MOE stock and MOE pistol
grip. As with all SIG516 Patrol rifles, it uses the SIG SAUER innovative
short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and
allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. This system, along with the SIG
SAUER proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of
the only rifles to pass NATO s  Over the Beach  test. A 16  chrome-lined
barrel is chambered in 5.56mm NATO and is surrounded by a free-floating
M1913 quad rail. The top rail is optic-ready and includes SIG SAUER flip-up
iron sights.

In fantastic condition, comes with 1x10 round Magazine, and has night sights.  Shoots amazingly well.  Ideal for conceal carry, and of course carries Glocks lifetime warranty. This, unlike a Gen3 or Gen4 Glock is much more pleasant to shoot, due to the lack of finger grooves for those with larger hands. If you want a CHEAP Glock, look elsewhere.  There are very few 2nd Generation Glocks for sale.  So, if you want a cheap one, look for a Gen3, and leave this for someone who finds 3rd and 4th gens uncomfortable to shoot.

The engraving on this gun is crisp and unfilled which would leave me to believe it to be factory.
