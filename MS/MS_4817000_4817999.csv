I would appreciate any questions or offers to be directed as a PM or text REDACTED.  I like 1911's only in .45 and really only like full size, and would be really interested in a Caspian, a Sig (ESPECIALLY one of the Scorpions or the Spartan Model), or maybe a Ruger with some cash on your end, I might even consider a Kimber but let's not get crazy.  I like 9mm in everything else, Sig's, HK's (would do a .45 in an HK as well), and of course 9mm and 10mm Glocks.  I am not interested in .40 cal.  As always will trade for gold or silver.  

Thanks for looking,
Jason in Spokane

I just received a great question about what does ""pre lock"" and ""no dash"" mean.  The pre lock means that the gun was made before Smith and Wesson added internal locks to the gun, current models have an internal action lock just above the cylinder release.  These have a couple of disadvantages, first, if you lock your gun, and lose the key you have to buy a new one before you can shoot your gun.  Second if a bad guy comes in you have to take the time to find this tiny little key and unlock your gun before you can use it.  Third, and I have experienced this, the locks can just lock up by themselves and render your gun unworkable until you either figure out why the lock isn't working, or clean and unjam it.  

The no dash indicates that this was a first series run of the gun, running somewhere between 1980-1985 as long as the internet isn't lying to me tonight.  This is indicated in the third picture where it says mod 686, later models would have a 686-2, or 686-5 and keep going as the series get older.  

The long and short of it is to S&W collectors these are pretty valuable.  If you look for them on Gunbroker they frequently run $1300+.  

Also if you look for original Smith and Wesson Target grips they start at $100, and are tough to find.

Thanks for the great question."

Thirty years later it is still the standard for semi-automatic centerfire hunting rifles.This BAR Safari features select walnut stock and forearm and deep, high-luster blueing. It is has the BOSS system and no sights. It's extremely accurate with unmatched reliability. (Scope not included)-Caliber: 338 Winchester Magnum-Barrel Length: 24""-Total Capacity: 4 (includes one round in chamber)-Avg. Weight: 8 lbs. 6 oz.-Overall Length: 45""-Drop at Comb: ¾"" (Measured from centerline of bore)-Drop at Heel: 1 1/8""-Length of Pull: 13 ¾""-Rate of Twist: 1 in 10""Standard Features:Action Type-Gas operated, autoloader with an extra strong multiple lug rotating bolt that locks directly into the barrel. Every cartridge that is loaded into the chamber of the BAR is surrounded by a recessed bolt face, which, in turn, is encircled by the barrel, which, in turn, is surrounded by the receiver. Three rings of steel surround the cartridge.A seven-lug bolt and precise breech-to-chamber relationship give the BAR an exceptional degree of accuracy and the strength to handle magnum loads.The strong and very rigid action bar/inertia block link-up improves accuracy by reducing barrel vibration. The buffering system reduces wear and stress on the rifle's mechanism.Barrel-Individually machined from hammer-forged, heat-treated billets of steel. Boss-equipped BARs are not available with open sights.BOSS- (Ballistic Optimizing Shooting System) The BOSS allows you to fine tune the BAR's accuracy to surpass that of any other autoloader. In fact, the accuracy of a BOSS-equipped BAR even rivals that of many bolt actions. The BOSS allows you to obtain precision accuracy with commercially available ammunition. In addition to unrivaled accuracy, the BOSS reduces recoil up to 30%.Boss-CR-This accessory is included with all BOSS-equipped rifles and offers all the accuracy advantages of the original BOSS without the muzzle brake feature.Bolt Release Lever-Incorporated into the receiver.Magazine-A detachable box magazine with a unique hinged floorplate.Receiver-Safari model has one-piece ordnance steel, richly blued with scroll engraving and frilled and tapped for scope mounts. Safety-Cross bolt with enlarged head.Safety Lock-All Browning firearms are shipped with a free trigger lock, padlock or a chamber lock, depending on the model, to assist you in the safe storage of your firearm.Stock and Forearm-The fluted stock design incorporates a full pistol grip with an undercut and is contoured for use with open sights, receiver (peep) sights or scope sights. The forearm is full and hand filling. Sling swivel studs are installed in the stock and forearm.Trigger-Features a short, smooth single stage on the trigger.

Each design element was driven by the requirement to create the best shooting platform possible. Exceptional accuracy was one of the key principles during development, with effective engagement ranges of 1500 meters or more, depending on caliber and ammunition. Advanced engineering and uncompromising quality are evident in every facet of design. The Tactical 2 is a bolt action rifle featuring Blaser’s revolutionary straight-pull action. When the bolt is closed, the 360 degree radial collet expands into the locking groove in the barrel – the bolt head is auto-centering and self-headspacing. The straight pull action features no rotating parts and assures rapid reloading with minimum movement. Interchange calibers by replacing the barrel and bolt head, in under a minute, without special tools and no change in accuracy. Barrels are cold hammer forged, fluted and plasma-nitrided to provide maximum resistance against corrosion and abrasion. An M1913 Picatinny rail is fixed to the barrel, ensuring full compatibility with a wide range of optical sighting systems. The muzzle end is threaded for an optional muzzle brake. The receiver is machined from aircraft grade billet aluminum alloy and is the interface for the barrel, bolt assembly, trigger assembly and magazine. A recoil lug of hardened steel is integrated into the receiver. The entire unit is fixed to the stock, eliminating temperature induced distortion. The outer surface is hard anodized. The ergonomically correct stock is injection molded out of fiber reinforced polymers and is absolutely stable, even under extreme temperatures.

W. Cooey Machine & Arms Company in Cobourg, Ontario, Canada (later acquired by the Winchester Arms Company). The shotgun was sold as model number 84 until 1967, and (following acquisition by Winchester) as model number 840. The gun ceased to be produced in 1979. Today, the 84/840 is considered a collector's item to certain people who collect the Canadian-made firearms. The item needs a new barrel but otherwise it shot great. It is a collectors item at a great price. Shipping is $35

 History The Cooey model 84 which was renamed the model 840 in 1967 after Winchester Arms purchased the factory was the first shotgun designed and manufactured by the H. W. Cooey Machine & Arms Company in Cobourg, Ontario, Canada. The Cooey model 84/840 [shotguns] that were manufactured before 1961 are stamped ""H. W. Cooey Machine & Arms Company"" on the right side of the action and the guns made after the purchase from Winchester of Cooey are stamped ""Winchester-Western (Canada) Limited."" on the right side of the receiver. Written records of serial numbers are not generally available. Some have suggested that Cooey did not use serial numbers, but many pre-1961 model 84s are stamped with serial numbers on the receiver, barrel (under the fore stock) and under the butt plate/shoulder stock. Dating the serial numbers remains a challenge for Cooey gun collectors. The model 84/840 were chambered in most common shotgun shells including 12 gauge, 16 gauge, 20 gauge, 28 gauge, and .410 bore. A new shooter/owner of a Cooey model 84/840 should get the chamber measured for the proper size of shot shell by a professional gunsmith since most of the older 84 series guns were chambered for 2 3/4"" shot shells (except .410 bores), while the 840 series was chambered for the larger and more powerful 3"" shot shells. These shotguns commonly had 26"", 28"" and 30"" barrels on them but many other lengths are available, including the rare 32"", 34"", and 36"" barrels. With the 28"" barrel the overall length is 44.5"" long. the most common choke in an original barrel was full choke, which is great for any purpose when a tight pattern is needed."

The MR Eagle is a striker fire design 9mm. Additional features include a fully adjustable rear sight for windage, three replaceable palm swells for various hand sizes and shooting styles, interchangeable front sight blades of different heights, hammer forged barrel, full Weaver style accessory rail and internal safety devices.

For over 100 years this part of the world has been the center of indigenous arms manufacture. The local tribal gunsmiths of this region manufactured copies of many firearms such as British Martini Henry and Lee-Enfield rifles, which are the most commonly encountered. These weapons were hand-made using a variety of raw materials and scrap metals and were often stamped with original markings and cartouches. They were issued to irregular forces so they would not steal the higher quality British or Indian rifles and desert their regiment. Typically, these rifles were of inferior quality and potentially dangerous to shoot. For this reason we have de-milled them according to ATF specifications including a section of the receiver removed, a welded, non-functioning bolt and a torched hole through the barrel chamber. No FFL required. The history of this region gives these rifles a bit of mystique and collector value."

Comes with one 50 round box of ammunition.  I have put approximately 50 rounds through it to verify function.  It fires and feeds with zero issues.  Also has a decocker built into the safety.  The DA is heavy but the SA is very good and would make a good pistol for someone who is recoil sensitive or just learning to shoot.

These guns are getting hard to find with rough examples going for $200 plus shipping and transfer fees.  This one is muuuuch nicer than the majority of the ones that are still available online.

It had at one time a blade bayonet. It has a Russian Rear Sight(which is correct), bore is nice and bright, there isn't any rust in the gas system, someone has ground the bayonet lug off and the cleaning rod holder off as well. Just needs a new front sight block installed and a blade bayonet and it'll look correct! Only parts not numbers matching are the magazine and the stock.

It functions flawlessly! Would be perfect for someone wanting to add to their collection of SKS Carbines as these are rare. The SKS being sold is the one on the top in the pictures with the sling, the bottom one is NOT for sale!

Ruger ® patented chrome-plated, two-stage piston with multi-stage regulator provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. The two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier.
The four-position chrome-plated gas regulator can be adjusted for optimum reliability and superior operating endurance. The gas system may be closed completely for manual operation during training or when using a suppressor.*
Folding backup iron sights include a windage adjustable rear sight and an elevation adjustable front sight. These sights provide a solid, reliable aiming system that can be folded out of the way to make room
for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.
Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock* is mounted on a Mil-Spec diameter tube.
Precision-rifled, chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel ensures accuracy and longevity.
Fluted barrel (for reduced weight and improved barrel cooling) features a Ruger ® flash suppressor * mounted with a 5/8’’-24 thread.
Round, smooth-sided Ruger ® Lightweight Adaptable handguard with flattop receiver features a Mil-Spec 1913 Picatinny rail at 12:00 position that extends the full length of the handguard. Drilled and tapped for additional rails at the 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions (two additional rail sections included), providing ample space for mounting sights, lights, lasers or other accessories.
