The upper is a 10.5"" Radical Firearms HBAR (Heavy Barrel, no flexing and ACCURATE!) Melonite barrel with Seekins Free Float MCSR KEYMOD 10"" rail. Chambered in 7.62x39 and built to run any ammo you can through at it - steel or brass cased! 

It runs. Believe me, it runs! After 2 range sessions to sight it in, I'm a bit bummed to consider selling it. But, the wife is a bit intimidated by it.. it's light, powerful, has a loud bark and looks 'mean' :) But, those are ALL the things I love about it. Bottom line, I built what I wanted and it's really not what best suits the family right now. So, on to new things.

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. Visit our website www.freerepublicfirearms.com or our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/pages/Free-Republic-Firearms/REDACTED13451 for more information.

Our firearms are competitively priced, please do not contact us with low ball offers.  Prices are firm. 

Ohio purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person at our location. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes.  If you’re not a local resident, and can’t make the drive to our location, we can ship the firearm to a local FFL dealer in your area.  The receiving FFL dealer will complete the background check, and transfer the firearm to you.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty.  We do not accept returns on firearms, because once the firearm is sold, it is considered a used item, and we can no longer sell it as new.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms by email at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. You can also send us a message on our Facebook page.

Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade, because we cannot examine the firearm before buying it.

The winning design incorporated the Stainless finish and longer barrel tipped by a flash hider inspired by the Mini-14 Tactical Series. Also from the new Mini Rifles, the fixed aperture sights are included and are a vast improvement over the original leaf style sights. There is a M1913 standard rail over the receiver that makes mounting optics a breeze and placed them at a comfortable height. Finally it is mounted into a Polumer stock insprieed by the Ruger American series of rifles with interchangeable combs for comfortable cheek weld when using optics. Overall, this limited edition rifle offers a nice balance of modern enhancements while still retaining the features of the 10/22 that makes it such a timeless American classic.

The BSO features an evolutionary, battery free, Rechargeable Illumination Technology (RIT), which is environmentally friendly and non toxic.   Simply charge the RIT illumination with ANY light source and get hours of low light reticle illumination.

Trijicon produces battle-proven aiming systems that deliver rapid target acquisition and increased hit potential under any lighting conditions. Their self-luminous aiming systems empower you to execute any shot with complete confidence in bright light low light or no light at all.

Every feature of the ACOG’s (Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight) mechanical and optical design was designed for use with flat-top receivers. This sighting system was engineered for a single purpose; to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions - without relying upon failure-prone batteries.

The ACOG is engineered upon a roof prism design for maximum optical precision and enhanced reliability. These sights combine traditional precise long-range accuracy with rapid close-quarters target acquisition.

Although the ACOGs have many features which are very advantageous for military use they’re equally well adapted for sporting and tactical applications. These compact telescopic sights are internally adjustable with tritium illuminated reticles for use in low-light scenarios.

The 4x32 ACOG Riflescope is a comfortable and engaging optic to sight through in day or nighttime. The generous field of view provides the ability to see your target and what’s going on around the target. This is a rugged optic for the discerning professional who understands that success is the only acceptable outcome.

Rugged Construction

Forged 7075-T6 aircraft aluminum alloy housing
Flat-Top Compatible

Designed for use with flat-top receivers
Bindon Aiming Concept

The Bindon Aiming Concept was devised by Trijicon’s founder Glyn Bindon. The BAC method of aiming with both eyes open ensures a far superior sense of balance and a wider field-of-view. Combining these benefits with a magnified Trijicon sight gives you a considerable advantage over your target.
Self Illuminating Red Chevron Reticle Calibrated for 5.56 NATO

This red chevron reticle features dual illumination from Trijicon’s proprietary tritium/fiber-optic technology.

As I cleaned the MINT Bore I thought to myself; The last time I had a Remington 30 Express, Deluxe 30-06 caliber that was All Original and in this Minty of condition was 30 or 40 years ago. I recalled seeing them ""This Good"", on occasion back when there was no Gunlist Magazine. And Only the Shotgun News magazine was available. That was in the early 1970's. Later on in the Early 1980's I only saw a few more ( = They were Ususally on a Gun-Dealers Display-Table, along with a lot of other Great Remingtons in Hopes of winning the Best Display at the GunShow. ). 
I'm not sure when I actually owned one of these Remington 30 Express Deluxe Checkered Rifles in this condition that was all original and had this amount of Blue still on the Bolt and didn't have a Peep-sight or something else; Or even that wasn't Tapped on the Receiver for that matter; But I will have to say that it was somewhere back in perhaps the late 1980's Era. I suppose My Point is that it would take a Long Long time to find another that was this GREAT ! And in All Original condition."
