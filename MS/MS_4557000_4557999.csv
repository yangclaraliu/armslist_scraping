Although this revolver has never been fired, I did purchase 100 balls and caps, but never got around to shooting it.  I will include the balls and caps in the deal.

The S&W 649
This might be among the most politically incorrect of all firearms. At least it would be, if more people were aware of it’s design, and mission. To the uninitiated, this is simply an oddly shaped, sort of freakish revolver. The hump backed model 649 fires the .38 Special cartridge or the powerful 357 magnum, from a 2” barrel, and has a capacity of only 5 rounds. It is really too expensive, and well made to qualify as a Saturday Night Special (whatever meaning that phrase may happen to have at the moment). Like most specialized devices, the strange appearance of the Model 649 is a reflection of being narrowly designed for a particular function. In the case of the model 649, the gun has been designed to be carried, and even fired, from inside of a pocket. 

The strange hump backed shape is a result of a shrouded hammer. A small, serrated, and somewhat flattened nub, barely protrudes through a slot along the curve of the shroud. This permits the gun to be cocked and fired in the single action mode. Either during a draw, or while firing inside of a pocket, the shroud keeps the hammer from hanging up or snagging on the clothing. This is one of the best designs for deep concealment, and the only modern design, which allows firing from within the pocket. The slide of an automatic, or the hammer of a revolver would quickly foul, and tangle during this kind of shooting.  The hammer barely protrudes above the shroud, so that it can scarcely be noticed when the piece is viewed from the side. The basic gun, is the well regarded J frame, as is used in the Chief’s, and some other small, hideout guns. This is Smith’s .32 frame, proportioned to the .32 Special round. The frame can be used for guns chambered in .38, by reducing the capacity from 6 to 5. 
   Like most small guns, the M649 can be carried in a selection of hide out holsters.  Most people might ask why it would be necessary to have a holster inside of a pocket, but there are a couple of advantages. The most obvious advantage, is that the lines of the gun are broken, so that it does not “print” through the pocket to reveal that the owner is armed. The pocket holster also insures that the pistol is always properly positioned in the same place for a sure presentation (presentation is the politically correct term for what used to be called the draw).

You conveniently fail to mention that online sellers with cheap Korean Glock mags also charge around $10 bucks UPS shipping, making the actual cost of one mag $20-25 bucks putting that seller right in the same ballpark. You also don't get to hold it in your hand & inspect it prior to forking over your ""hard earned cash"". Leave that businessman alone."

The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Government profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The V9 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

Both are Winthrop open top black leather holsters. One is made for a government model (full size) 1911 but will also fit commander and officer model 1911's without rails. The other is exactly the same but is made for 1911's with rails, not sure if it will fit a 1911 with a full rail as mine had a partial. Paid almost $70 per, will sell for $45 each or both for $80. The holster for railed 1911's is the only one that has ever been worn, the other only had the officers model in it to preserve the shape. Also for sale/trade are 300 rounds of 45 ACP 230gr. RNFMJ. All are factory reloads from LAX Ammo located in California and I have never, in over 1000 rounds had a single issue with them. This was my third case of 500 ordered, all have been equal in performance to Federal and WWB ammo. LAX has outstanding reviews and are a reliable company with great customer service. The only reason I'm selling the ammo is because I traded off my 1911 to get another 9mm. The ammo is cross posted for sale for $80 for all 300 roiunds, which is less per round than what I got them for and much lower than what 250 rounds of Remington UMC in a bulk box would cost. I'd prefer to sell everything together but I will gladly piece it out. If you take both holsters and the ammo I'll let it go for $140. The fastest way to get a response from me would be to call or text me at REDACTED, my name is Josh."

The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own.

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy, and greater reliability. 

Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty.

Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

The Glock 19 Gen4 is ideal for home defense, concealed carry or as a duty weapon. It is a mid size, 9mm, polymer frame handgun that uses a locked breach system referred to as “Safe Action”. This is the combination of a trigger safety, firing pin safety and drop safety that render the loaded pistol incapable of firing, even when banged or bumped, unless someone actually squeezes the trigger.Because it does not have a hammer, the spring loaded striker (firing pin) is technically blocked off, partially retracted and not in geometric alignment with a chambered cartridge. It is only by squeezing the trigger, which fully retracts and then releases the striker, that makes the pistol then capable of firing. The absence of a hammer also provides a sleeker profile that reduces both size and weight, while optimizing a smoother draw from concealment.The Glock 19 has the advantage of not having a manual safety, thus eliminating the need to consciously think about deactivating such a device during a deadly encounter. This is the ultimate point and shoot pistol. With 50% fewer components than conventional handguns of the same caliber, it means there are fewer parts to break, and you can literally disassemble and then reassemble the gun within seconds.The frame is made out of a synthetic polymer that is actually stronger than steel, yet 86% lighter and virtually indestructible. It can withstand temperatures ranging from -40 F to 158 F and still continue firing. An integral accessory rail provides the added benefit of quickly attaching lasers and / or lights for low visibility applications. The ergonomic grip angle is designed to allow the shooter to rapidly deploy the pistol under stress fire conditions.This series is referred to as “Gen4″ and has several noticeable upgrades over its Gen3 predecessors. A slightly smaller frame circumference, combined with interchangeable backstraps have been engineered to accommodate a variety of hand sizes. The rough texture grip allows for a more aggressive hold on the gun, especially in situations where maximum traction and weapons retention could make the difference between life or death.An enlarged reversible Gen4 magazine release makes it easier to perform reloads. A heavy duty recoil spring slightly reduces kick and also extends pistol life. Glock supplies a third magazine with Gen4 pistols that offers added firepower.The Glock 19 Gen4 features an outstanding ergonomic design, where a highly efficient bore axis-to-weight distribution ratio ensures controlled shots, even under rapid fire conditions. In addition, the dark earth polymer frame also provides much softer felt recoil than most conventional metal frame handguns.The pistol weighs in at a little over 21- ounces and has a DAO trigger pull of roughly 5.5 pounds. The metal components have been finished with a unique surface treatment called Tenifer that is extremely corrosion and wear resistant. In case you are unfamiliar with Tenifer, it’s Glock’s trade name for the ferric nitrocarburized case hardening process that diffuses nitrogen and carbon directly into the surface metal, thereby elevating the Rockwell hardness to somewhere between a file and a diamond.The slide includes a Cerakote flat dark earth finish and three full capacity 15- round magazines are provided with Glock 19 Gen4 pistols. A set of white outline sights sit on top of the slide, are highly visible, easy to use and track reasonably well. The 4.02″ hexagonal hammer forged barrel of the Glock 19 Gen4 increase muzzle velocity and provide greater accuracy than conventional rifled barrels.

The ""new"" FR-8s were primarily issued to the Spanish Guardia Civil, which is the equivalent of a federal police force, and some made their way to reserve military units as well. Obviously, the FR-8 was far from a new rifle. There was alot of Mauser left in the old girl: the five round internal magazine, the bolt, and the trigger system were essentially straight out of 1898. Still, the FR-8 had some interesting characteristics due to its CETME heritage. The sights were one of them. The rear sight had three apertures, for 200, 300, and 400 meters. It also had a more traditional Mauser style notch sight for 100 meters. These four options allowed a rifleman to adjust for elevation by simply rotating the rear sight to the correct pre-set aperture for the desired range. The front sight, also a CETME part, was also simultaneously adjustable for both elevation and windage, but this required a special tool. The tube under the barrel actually served as a mount for the CETME bayonet. This tube could also be used to store small cleaning supplies for maintaining the rifle. Lastly, the flash hider had notches to accept 22mm NATO rifle grenades, further extending the versatility of the weapon."

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. The modular design of the USP’s internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type oaf trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes. The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.Features:Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer framePolygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel lifeCan be converted to any of nine trigger firing modesCorrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finishOversized trigger guard for use with glovesOne piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steelUniversal mounting grooves for installing accessoriesAmbidextrous magazine release leverExtended slide releasePatented Lock-Out Safety deviceUSP Variants:Variant 1: Double action/single action with “SAFE” position.

I am obviously not original owner(serial puts manufacture date at 1920).
Someone before has sporterized it with a nice stock and sling, which I have refinished with tung oil.  The stock is glass bedded to support the barrel.

The bluing is in very good condition for a 95 year old rifle.  The action is smooth.  This is a ""Safe Serial Number"".  This is NOT a 1903A3, which means it does have a milled plate floorplate and trigger guard.  This is also the Mark 1 version which was designed to accept a Pederson device(google it).

I was planning on restoring this to original, but have not had time for this project.  I did purchase a 1903 stock and handguard I will include too if you would like to return to original.  No metal hardware is included with the stock.

Corrected version of these go for at least $1000 on gunbroker, some over $2k.(search 1903 mark 1)

This would be a great deer rifle as is.
Also included is 3x9 barska scope with rings and bases.

I will also throw in 20 rds of surplus 30-06 ammo."

I put a pair of Hogue Monogrip Cocobolo aftermarket combat magnums to do it justice. They are brand new never on the gun when fired. The serial #BFK9XX puts the year of production at 1990..This revolver appears to have a very low round count and is in great condition. It does not include the original box or any paperwork.
I always recommend all firearms be inspected by a licensed gunsmith regardless how the gun looks externally. I am selling off some of my duplicate ""K"" frames so please see my other listings. This offer is also listed on GB auction #498911379. For local buyers I will include a 50 round box of Remington .38 special 158 gr, OR a 50 round box of 148 grain wadcutters so you can get the feel of this combat masterpiece. A third option is a 20 round box of Hornady Critical Defense .38 +P ammo

From the Aero Precision website: Our state of the art M4E1 platform starts here, with the M4E1 Upper Receiver. The M4E1 upper receiver is a one-piece design combining the handguard mounting platform with the upper itself. Through superior engineering, we have condensed the parts needed to mount a free-floated handguard to a mere 8 screws. Since the handguard mounting surface and upper are of the same forging, not only is it a stronger system, but we are able to make additional lightening cuts to save weight and allow for more efficient cooling. Ease of installation - Simply insert your barrel assembly into the M4E1 upper, tighten it using the provided barrel nut and wrench, slide your rail on and tighten the rail screws. Within minutes you have a modular, free-floated rail. Our Enhanced KeyMod (EK) Handguards provides a lightweight free float design for your custom AR15 build. The KeyMod system allows advanced modularity past the current 1913 picatinny rail system. Machined to mil-spec dimensions and engineered to perfection, this handguard eliminates bulk while retaining strength and stability. Features: *1pc free float design *Built in anti-rotation tabs *Scalloped rails *Continuous top rail *1.8"" inside diameter fits most muzzle devices and 1.5"" suppressors *Compatible with low profile gas blocks"

Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.The Ruger SR-556E comes equipped with a new, lightweight, adaptable handguard which provides multiple options for mounting optics and other accessories. This new, round handguard features a full-length Picatinny rail at the 12:00 position, which aligns with the rail on the flattop receiver. The handguard also accepts sections of rail or handguard covers, which allow the user to configure the handguard to their exact requirements while minimizing size and weight.The SR-556E still offers the basic features that make the Ruger SR-556 family a success. The two-stage piston operating system runs cooler and cleaner than gas driven rifles, and the multi-stage regulator allows the operator to tune the rifle to the specific ammunition. The cold hammer forged 41V45 barrel provides outstanding accuracy and longevity. The barrel is threaded 1/2-28 and is capped with the Ruger flash suppressor.
