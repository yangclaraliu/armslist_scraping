This gun is very customize-able. It has a 20 in barrel to help with accuracy and helps the barrel not get hot as fast so you can use it for a longer period of time. With this gun some of the cool features you could get upgraded are: you can replace the stock to get an adjustable one, you could take of the iron sights and get a nice red dot or a scope,change out the trigger and trigger guard for a better feel, get a new grip. Personally i would change the grip and stock on it so i could get a btter more comfortable feel.

The barrel is 23"" inches long. It does not have a claiber stamp on the barrel at least the exposed barrel so I had it checked and certified by a gunsmith who stated that it is a standard 30-06. I would not let him stamp the barrel so instead he gave me a written certification that I will pass to the buyer. I am addig this. I recently noticed a hairline crack on the bottom of the stock at the muzzle end. Looks like the end cap of the stock bight have been overtightened ?? it is hardly noticeable and probably has no effect on the gun.If you go on Gunbroker.com or GunsAmerica.com and search Mannlicher German Mauser you will see that the price I am offering is more than reasonable."

The Solingen marking on a Randall knife is somewhat rare. 

 I would rate the condition as in the very good range. There are a few minor scratches on the blade that I've attempted to capture in the following pictures.

 We're asking $1,350 or best acceptable offer. Cash or USPS MO. No trades.

 We reserve the right to refuse any and all conditional offers.
  We prefer face-to-face in the Columbia/Rock Hill/Greater Charlotte area so that the potential buyer can completely satisfy himself with the condition of this knife.
 We will consider shipping for the right deal. Insured shipping with tracking would occur after payment has cleared.

Jerry Hossom started making knives more than 25 years ago, doing so professionally since 1997. He avoids knifemaking boundaries, preferring to make models that don't fit any predisposed category but are task or role specific as to function. His specialty is large fixed blades that go hand-in-hand with being outdoors and take on any cutting challenges Mother Nature can throw at you, large or little. Spyderco offers a collaborative version of one of Jerry's best known designs, available in four sizes. The ""Hossoms"" vary in size with the largest almost 16 inches long to the smallest just 10 inches in total length. All four sizes include: Full-bellied cutting edges with upswept tips and comfortably rounded spines. The blades are flat ground European N690Co steel which carries a reputation for cutting performance and edge retention. They also have a handguard behind the cutting edge, a finger choil, and jimping on the thumb ramp purposely designed to keep your hand and handle engaged when light cutting or all out chopping. All are constructed from a solid piece of steel with pinned and contoured Micarta handle scales that are green-gray. For carrying, they come in a Boltaron sheath that has a five-position TekLock® fastener.

This knife is no longer being made, and the design is hard to find.  Check out the website here:

I am selling a Howa 1500 in 30-06 with a Nikko Stirling Gameking 3.5-10x44 scope.  The rifle has a green rubberized Hogue stock. 

I bought the rifle about 3 years ago and have done nothing but a little bit of target shooting with it.  It probably has about 50-100 rounds through it.  The scope was purchased at the same time.  I am only selling them because I want to finance a slug gun for deer hunting this year.  (A Savage 220 is what I am interested in if someone happens to be interested in a trade)  

I am asking $425 obo.  (gun retails for $461 on Buds Gun Shop which is a well priced site, and the scope retails for about $150)  If you have any questions please feel free to ask.

Thanks for looking.

The Super X 2 is furthermore capable of firing five shells in a half second. That puts it ahead of the fabled Benelli Black Eagle, both in speed and in felt recoil. In our traditionalist minds, Belgium wins over Italy by a long, long shot. This shotgun is manufactured, of course, in Belgium for Winchester. The 30 inch barrel is a proven performer for sight radius advantage and tight shooting; the Back-bored barrel with Invector Plus Choke tubes makes it an instant champion. Weighing in at 8 ½ pounds, this Super X 2 has a superior balance and feel. Stock and forend on this Clays edition is genuine European Walnut with cut checkering. Length of pull is standard 14 3/8 inches with pad; drop at comb is a sure handling 1.5 inches that descends to 2 3/8 at the heel; shims are included to adjust the drop and cant. This Super X 2 Clays comes with a total of 5 Invector Plus Choke Tubes: Skeet, IC, Mod, Improved Mod, and Full. In many respects, This Super X 2 is preferable to its Super X 3 replacement. The SX-2 variant is a few ounces heavier than its Super X 3 descendant. The Super X 3 sacrifices its steel magazine tube, and shooters prefer steel tubes any day. The Super X 3 is not even offered in 30 inch barrel with Walnut Stock in any configuration. Replacement price on this fine shotgun in our area is $900 or more if a person can even find one. We're offering this gun, however, for only $ 675.00 USD

I'm selling an ARMALITE AR-10 A4 (7.62) with some added accessories to it. This Rifle comes with: *Forged Flat Top Receiver with Picatinny Rail *20"" “Heavy” Barrel. From my understanding Armalite does not even manufacture this type of heavy barrel any longer. This barrel is not the standard thin barrel. It is extremely accurate and very reliable (This barrel has also had the MolyFusion Treatment done to it as well). * Phantom Flash Suppressor * JP Floating Hand guard *JP 4"" Tactical Rail - Currently mounted on right side of hand guard. * Limbsaver Rifle Barrel De-Resonator * Aftermarket Grip * Collapsible Stock (added in with the rifle but not attached) * AR-10 Carbine Buffer (added in with the rifle but not attached) * AR-10 Carbine Buffer Spring (added in with the rifle but not attached) * AR-10 Carbine Receiver Extension Tube (added in with the rifle but not attached) * Harris Bi-pod with Extended/Telescoping Legs *(4) 7.62” 20 Rd. Magazines * Hard Gun Case Included I have also had this rifle sent in to have the “Standard Update” that Armalite offers ($150 charge) to update/upgrade the upper receiver on the gun. This is from Armalite’s website showing what they do when they perform the standard update on AR-10 Rifles. Armalite’s Standard Update includes the following: -One updated bolt stop catch -Inspect gas assembly and adjust if necessary -Check and inspect chamber -Replace extractor assembly to new style -Replace ejector springs -Upgrade receiver/barrel to M4 feed ramps -Complete inspection of rifle for reliability and function including testfire acceptance The ONLY reason I’m selling this bad boy is because I’m purchasing another Armalite AR-10 Rifle. I don’t have the money to own TWO so…I have to sell this one. Otherwise, I would never sell this rifle. It’s been very reliable and extremely accurate. I have gotten some amazing groups the way this rifle is set up and could not be more pleased with it. This rifle has been well kept, oiled, lubricated, and kept clean the moment I purchased it. The hard gun case shown in the picture was about $150 brand new. It’s in good shape and I will ship the gun with the accessories shown in the case. SHIPPING WILL ALSO BE FREE to anyone in the United States. Shipping won’t be cheap with this case either, it’s heavy duty."

Here's info from the factory for this gun.

The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge.The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters."

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

It is the USPc model and It is chambered in 40 cal. Great gun but I would like to fund another purchase so I am considering letting this one go.   Possibly trading for the right gun is also an option.  Like I said, HK made ONLY 500 of these in OD Green so they are near impossible to find. I have it priced at lower than the norm if you can find one (the last one to go on Gunbroker went for 1,300). I have carried it some so it does have a little holster wear but it is in good condition. Wonderful gun but like I said I need to fund another project. The box, gun and two mags with finger plate will be included. Mine is the V1 configuration (DA/SA with decocker & safety) In 40c. It has standard sights as well. In addition I will include a kydex OWB holster (Fobus). Buyer will need a CCH or permit.

Prefer a cash sale. However, I will consider trades (partial, multiple or maybe even). Thanks for looking $1,100 cash or $1,150 trade. Light not included. Thanks!"

Comes with $30 Lyman factory extra tang in the white and original sights if you want to convert back from Peep/Globe setup to leaf/blade sights.

I do want to disclose as I have had it in my possession I believe I have damaged the hammer trigger mechanism. I pulled it back a little harder than normal and pushed down with my thumb and it made a different noise and the hammer and trigger do not operate as it did. I have never fired the gun nor do I know if it will fire.
