I have a Tula Post-1939 Soviet 91/30 Mosin Nagant with Scope and bent bolt.

It does have the bent bolt but has the original straight bolt as well. 
Pretty nice condition for how old it is. 
Trigger has a little creep (known with older Mosins) and disconnector screw seems to have been replaced with a non-factory screw (but it doesn’t hinder performance whatsoever).

(P.s. Nutnfancys favorite shotgun) 
Here's a product review I found
Speed, reliability, balanced handling, and strength, are are all available in the value-packed Model 1300 shotgun. The 1300 is an updated version of the Winchester Model 1200, the first shotgun to utilize a rotary bolt with four locking lugs secured within the barrel extension. The 1200 was also Winchester's first shotgun to incorporate the company's patented Winchoke system, a quick change tube to allow the easy replacement of chokes. The 1300 is a take down shotgun that has an internal tubular magazine that can hold four shells.

And it comes with not one but four (count em) Winchokes. These Winchesters pattern beautifully. There's not a spec of rust anywhere on it or in it...

This Fine Vintage Winchester 1400 MkII is equipped with Vent Rib with FULL, IMP-MOD, MOD & IMP-CYL Winchoke(s), and the factory wrench to install/remove them. The chokes sell for $20 each, and the wrench $10 + shipping on eBay.com. This adds considerable value to the shotgun as all of these are included... a $70 value. That is equivalent to having the price of the shotgun with one choke at $320. You know you'll eventually want to have the others. Save a lot of time and shipping by just going for the complete package.

Ignore the Urban myth that the 1400's won't cycle with ""low brass"" or target shells. I fired nothing but Winchester AA target shells through this, and never had a bit of cycling problem. It's not been fired a lot as right after getting it my career demanded and got a lot more of my time.

Some of the paint has started to wear off where the pump rubs against the magazine tube. Also, there is a ding at the front end of the ejection port where some ejecting shells have hit the port on their way out.

All parts are original, although the bolt SN doesn't match the others. The non-matching is typical of these rifles. 

Unlike most other examples for sale, this rifle is NOT caked with cosmoline. This Chinese rifle is a wonderful shooter, and features a chrome-lined bore that is easier to clean than the Russian versions. That's particularly helpful if you're shooting corrosive ammunition.

This a second pattern dagger, introduced in 1937.  I believe it is unusual to find this dagger with both portapee and hangers intact. The blade is marked Siegfried/Solingen and has no nicks or scratches.  The pommel is white, and the overlaid silver thread is intact.   The portapee knot is in good condition, but there is deterioration in one of the two cords attaching it to the sheath.  The hanger is also in good condition.  Overall, the condition is quite remarkable considering the age and lack of any special care.
This dagger was given to me by my uncle, Major Thomas P. Elliott, AUS, who entered France in the second wave on Utah Beach, and brought this home at the end of the war.   Asking $1000."

Gun is not mint condition. A previous owner unfortunately didn't take great care of the finish. Grips have several dings, finish has worn in some spots and is marred. Rear sight is slightly deformed on one side. I have tried to capture this in the pictures. It does retain the original Colt Royal Blue finish, which is quite beautiful and why I haven't had it refinished. Overall, finish is 85-90%. HOWEVER, gun is in EXCELLENT mechanical condition.

This is not one of the PAPs that you see everywhere.  This was built from a military kit on an American Nodak Spud receiver which has a side rail so that you could mount optics of your choice.  The barrel is 12.25"" long and has a muzzle brake spot welded on that takes it to legal rifle length.  The front gas block is Krinkov with the integrated front sight.  The gas tube and upper handguard are Chinese perforated steel for better heat dissipation.  The trigger kit is a G2.  This was not built with the standard bastard sized Yugo rear trunnion, but was built with a standard Romanian type trunnion so that you can mount any standard buttstock.  With the standard Yugos, you can not mount regular buttstocks.  This comes with a Romanian push button style side folder.  I took it in trade and do not know how many rounds are through it.  It comes with 1 metal 30 round comblock magazine.

This rifle also has Champion brand tritium insert night sights on it, not the cheap glow kind that you have to charge, but true tritium night sights which run about $150 alone.

This is really handy and would be great as a truck gun or registered and made into a short barreled rifle.  It does a great job on pigs too!  

I am asking 750 for this rifle and magazine.  The messaging system doesn't always work here, so you can text me at 210-seven 22-zero six 33.  If the ad is still up, then I still have the rifle for sale."

I've got two .22 rifles for trade. These were a storage unit find. I've cleaned on them a little, but could use some more elbow grease. They appear to be in working order, if missing a part each.

First is a Marlin model 60. Synthetic ""Dragunov""  style stock. Appears to have a stainless steel barrel. According to the serial # it was made in the early 80s. Missing interior magazine tube, although it does have the spring and follower. Someone threaded the barrel, although I have no idea to what dimensions. Trigger/bolt ect look to be in good working order. Just seems to missing the mag tube.

Second is a Westernfield model 87A. This is a store brand of the Savage model 87. They are known as gill guns due to their slotted receiver. Rifle is complete minus original charging handle. I have jury-rigged a new charging handle made of a small dowel. Neat design, the bolt will remain to the rear as long as the trigger is depressed, and close forward when the trigger is released. Search it on youtube to see what I mean. :] Bluing is worn, but rifle appears to be in good overall condition.

So there you have it. Two beater .22 rifles that need some time and love.

Interested in trading mostly. Trade value $200 for both rifles. Not really interested in cash as much as a cheap revolver or Mosin or something. I'm interested in just about anything, as long as its a Firearm.

Please call or text me at REDACTED if you're interested, and have a good day!"

The ARX100 was engineered with one purpose in mind: to be today’s best tactical semiauto rifle. It takes the concept of a modular rifle to futuristic levels, while maintaining an absolutely simple operation that make it ultra-reliable. With ambidextrous controls, easily-replaceable barrel and virtually endless possibilities for customization and accessorization, the ARX100 is adaptable to any firing scenario and is perfect for today’s most demanding tactical shooter.
Ultimate Reliability and Ease of Maintenance
The ARX100 features a constant contact/short-stroke gas piston system that makes it feed and fire under the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight technopolymer receiver allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricants. To make maintenance easy and trouble-free, this rifle has no pins and can be completely disassembled in a matter of seconds with no tools at all.
Ultimate Versatility
This rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction.
Ultimate Accessorization
The possibilities for accessorization on the ARX100 are limited only by the user’s imagination. It comes out of the box with a full-length Picatinny rail on top, which is perfect for attaching a variety of optics and other sighting systems. It also has Picatinny rails on both sides of and under the fore-end, which offer countless possibilities for easily adding lighting systems and other tactical devices.

Stevens Arms and Tool Company in the period 1900 to 1915.

Shotguns of this era may have Damascus, Twist or Laminated Steel barrels which are not considered safe with modern ammunition. Even if the gun has fluid steel barrels, the chambers may be shorter than today's 2 3/4"" length shells. If using is contemplated, an evaluation by a competent gunsmith to determine barrel steel composition and chamber length is recommended. Modern 2 ¾” shells fired in a short chamber produces dangerously high pressures and can damage the gun and injure the shooter or bystanders. If deemed safe to use, only light field or target loads can be recommended.

Retail value would range from $50 to $125 depending on mechanical and bore condition and remaining original wood and metal finish."

I am really easy to deal with if you honor your commitment. But over the last month, far too many of you guys have said ""I want it - please hold it for me until Saturday""...and I've done that, only to be told Saturday that a) your wife is unhappy, b) your daughter is in the Emergency room, c) your car engine blew up, d) well ""something came up"".

So here's the deal: If you commit, then call me (or not) Saturday morning with some weasley excuse because you don't want to drive from Katy, then I'm going to add your phone number, email and name to the top of this listing.

Do we understand? See above."

I will verify your Ohio ID. RIA manufactured 1903 Rifle. The receiver was made in 1910 and is paired with an Avis replacement barrel stamped in 1919. The bore is bright with some muzzle erosion so I assume this rifle was fired quite a bit before being placed into the war reserve. This low serial number 1903 rifle is considered unsafe to fire by the CMP and has the firing pin ground down to prevent operation.  This was a CYA action by the CMP before the rifles were shipped to customers. The scant type stock is stamped to match the last 4 of the weapon serial number. The stock has a very nice arsenal repair on the butt stock but is otherwise in good shape. $600 or best offer received to own this piece of military history."
