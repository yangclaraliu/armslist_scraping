The 5.56 PDW Tactical Evo 7.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system. Because the piston chamber is the same size as the chamber on the rest of the Adams Arms gas lengths this 7.5"" upper now has the proper dwell time to get cyclic rate and bullet velocity needed to make this a viable short barreled option for any CQB scenarios. We've also added a 7"" Samson free floating Evolution forearm giving the shooter the ultimate tactical option in a personal defense weapon. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate complete upper.

The rifle has a 1 in 10"" twist rate, which means larger bullets are stabilized better because of the faster twist rate.  The stock has a Hogue overmold so you get a really good grip every time.

When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Choose from a mil-spec stainless steel spring or our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” Updated material and design features like those in our 30-round magazine have been adapted to our straight-bodied, 20-round model. All models are available in tandard military Gray. Since we manufacture these mags ourselves, we can maintain a large inventory. So, if you need magazines in a hurry, even in quantity, we can get them to you ASAP."

The barrels have a .750"" gas block seat with a properly sized gas port and the muzzle is threaded perfectly concentric with 1/2x28 threads.

These CHF barrels are made to the Mil-Spec for AR15/M4 rifles. The Cold Hammer Forging process work hardens the steel around a rifled mandrel, which creates the lands and grooves.

The barrel blanks are the correct Certified CMV material and they are also Hard Chrome Lined to the M249-SAW Mil-Spec, which is almost twice as thick as the Hard Chrome on a Mil-Spec M4.

They have Mil-Spec M4 barrel extensions and a Mil-Spec Phosphate finish on the outside (under the front sight base as well).

The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Choose from a mil-spec stainless steel spring or our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” Updated material and design features like those in our 30-round magazine have been adapted to our straight-bodied, 20-round model. All models are available in tandard military Gray. Since we manufacture these mags ourselves, we can maintain a large inventory.

Passenger side window button needs to be replaced. Exhaust is in great shape. It is a NO RUST car! Emergency brake sensor I have replaced twice and the dang thing never stays fixed so I quit replacing it. Has nothing to do with the performance of the car just a light on the dash. Other then that nothing mechanical and is one heck of a driver. Im looking to sell or partial trades with cash. If its a fair enough trade the cash can be minimum but not looking to be robbed on it. Thanks for looking and send me an email I can send some pictures of it. Will be putting some new ones up this week."

The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters."

•Long eye relief 
•Adjustable parallax 


This scope is the choice among most serious handgunners. Burris pioneered handgun scopes. The company built the first variable, and the first scopes with target knobs and adjustable parallax. These scopes are designed to take a pounding. Since handguns don't have your shoulder to absorb shock, a lot of recoil plows straight into the handgun and the scope. PL models feature Posi-Lock construction for heavy-recoiling handguns. Some models are available in the proven Ballistic Plex reticle, which is calibrated perfectly for short magnum cartridges."

Designed to be a the choice of North Country guides, it delivers the massive punch of a 45–70 Gov´t. with unmatched speed – with the lethal assurance of a 6–round capacity thanks to a full–length magazine tube. Rapid target acquisition comes natural with its 18½"" barrel and XS Ghost Ring Sights and scout scope mount. And its big loop lever adds a distinctive traditional style while promoting sure follow-up shots, even with gloves. True to the inhospitable territory it was born to thrive in, the Model 1895SBL features the weather resistance of a grey/black laminated stock and stainless steel finish on all major metal components.

This is what I am looking for: 

An AR-15 that Should meet the following criteria:
-5.56/.223 (shouldn't be an issue) 
-Detachable Carry Handle
-Bayonet Lug (stupid I know but I really want it) 
-NO BULL BARREL 
-1/7 Twist

Other notes:
I am moving all my ups that will fit on my carbine to this one. I need a pretty much stock rifle or an upper. Unless you are throwing in Pmags and ammo for a decent price. Also I am not going to pay a stupid high price for this weapon/upper. 

The deal breakers will be as follows:
-Stupid high price
-Barrel under 20""
-Barrel over 20""
-Bull Barrel 
-Non-Detacheable Carry Handle 
-Super-high round count 
-Polymer reviever

Now if your rifle does not meet all of these qualifications, go ahead and offer me anyway (unless it has whats on the deal breaker list). But I must say that I will be less inclined to pay what you want as I will have to buy more parts to make it what I want. 

I can add lots of stuff for trade like ACOGs, Aimpoints, EoTechs or Leupolds and the like if your looking to trade for an optic of something. 

P.S. I am a law-abiding SC resident w/ a CWP. If i dont like the way you, talk, look or smell I reserve the right to back out of whatever deal we come up with before money and items change hands."

THIS GUN IS BRAND NEW. ZERO ROUNDS THROUGH IT. NEVER SHOT AND WAS GIVEN A FULL MILITARY GRADE DIAMOND LUBE TREATMENT AT TIME OF PURCHASE.
It Prevents Metal on Metal Contact and galling, even on mated Stainless Steel friction surfaces.
Nanotechnology breakthrough prevents wear and slashes friction at the same time.
Chemical lubricants break down over time, cake up and stop lubricating. NanoDiamond lube will never wear out, and once the small amount of synthetic carrier oil evaporates - the Mechanical Lubrication will protect and lubricate for greatly extended periods. This product was subjected to extensive testing and reported about and rated ""Grade A"" in Gun Test Magazine Nov 2011 issue. This product provides superior protection against rust, corrosion and wear as it diamond coats friction surfaces. Currently under Mil Spec testing for MIL-PRF-63460E, the only test remaining prior to live fire testing is the Salt Fog test, which the base oil was specifically designed to pass. We have signed an OEM agreement with BAE systems and are using the world famous ""BreakFree CLP"" There is NO Teflon in THAT product, only synthetic Diamond.

(The reason I posted that is because this gun should shoot different from an identical Kimber STAINLESS PRO TLE/RL II with only the lubrication being the difference!)
I've shot many guns with this technology and had my entire car done with it. AMAZING TO SAY THE LEAST!

This little gun is a fantastic shooter and a great CCW pistol. I've personally carried occasionally for about a year or so usually as a secondary carry or as a pocket pistol on hot summer days. There is a little shinny wear on the front of the slide from holster wear, but only about 150-175 rounds have been through it. This gun has spent most of its time either in my safe or in the front pocket of my backpack while traveling. Comes as it did from the factory with the one 6 round magazine, original box, lock, paperwork, and including the DeSantis Super Fly pocket holster. Also the feed ramp has been polished by a local gunsmith to help with reliability and aid in feeding hollow points.

Can email/ text desired photos if needed. Prefer to trade locally, will sell and ship at buyers expense through my local FFL to your local FFL only. Usually cost $30-$40 depending on location.

Uberti revolvers include the 1875 Army Outlaw, 1875 Frontier, and 1890 Remington Police.

Remington entered the cartridge revolver market in 1875 when it introduced a big-frame, Army-style revolver—a six-shooter—to compete with the Colt Peacemaker. The 1875 Remington single actions kept the solid frame and overall styling of Remington's 1858 percussion models. Ordinary citizens and Old West lawmen alike recognized the sturdy quality of the new Remington revolvers. The infamous Frank James even carried one for most of his outlaw career. Faithful reproductions, the Uberti 1875 Army Outlaw and 1875 Frontier are available in Frank's favorite caliber, .45 Colt.

I've used it only once to sight in the scope and then was given another rifle so its time to sell this one. Its a nearly new Browing A-bolt Stalker. It has only seen 10 shots through the barrel, just enough to truly sight the scope in perfectly. It has a Simmons Whitetail Classic 2-10x44 mounted with Leupold scope rings. It has an internal 4 rd detachable box mag. Its a great feature to make loading and unloading a breeze. It comes with a very nice recoil pad that greatly helps take the beating this cartridge puts out making this a nice and easy gun to shoot. Many people will say the family of WSM is bad or failing but I don't believe so. This is a terrific round that has great accuracy and downrange power. The rifle will come with the other half of the box of Nosler Custom bullets and one box of Winchester softpoints. As well as a lockable hard case for transport. The only thing that could make this a better weapon is the BOSS, but that would also double the price, tho worth it. We all know what the rifle and ammo is worth so please no lowballers. Serious inquiries only. FTF and CASH only. Possible interest in trades, but I really just want to money to re-invest it in other weapons I have."

The Remington Model 870 Special Purpose Marine Magnum is a pump-action hunting shotgun chambered in 12 gauge. The M870 is a family of pump-action shotguns with a variety of hunting and tactical models. However, the Marine Magnum is one of the most unique. It is resistant to corrosion and water because the 18″ barrel’s finish is electroless nickel plated inside and out.

In a nutshell, electroless nickel plating deposits a nickel finish on the metal’s surface without using an electric current. This procedure deposits the finish evenly as opposed to an electroplating nickel finish. However, it doesn’t have as long of a lifespan.

Otherwise the Marine Magnum features a black synthetic stock with checkered grips. A single bead front sight and it comes with a padded Cordura shell bag. It is also available with a black TriNyte finish even though Remington has discontinued production of that model. Remington recommends the Marine Magnum for hunting small or any winged game."

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A."

Product Information

Shop more Aimpoint products  The Aimpoint PRO (Patrol Rifle Optic) was designed with the input of current and former professionals to create the most dynamic Red Dot sight available. Featuring band-pass lens coating, the PRO is compatible with every generation of night vision devices and provides a crystal clear 1x image for quick target acquisition in close quarter situations. The modular QRP2 mount securely attaches to standard picatinny rails and includes a removable spacer that provides optimal height for co-witness with iron sights on carbine style weapons.

The G26 has a short grip and barrel making it easier to conceal.

It has standard Glock features such as a polymer grip that’s lightweight making it 1.25 pounds loaded. On the front of the grip are finger grooves and the sides have a rough texture that feels a bit like sandpaper. Its double-action trigger is also “safe-action” meaning the safety is on the trigger rather than the side. The only way a round can fire is if the shooter pulls the trigger because its internal design won’t allow the firing pin to punch forward any other way. This prevents accidental discharges if the pistol is dropped.

Glocks have a simple, dependable and easy-to-use design, which is why they’re the preferred handgun for many law enforcement agencies. Glock recommends the Glock 26 for concealed carry."

All of the above comes as a package, I will not part any of the set out, so please don't ask. This rifle was built at Sig Sauer's Custom Shop in Exeter, Connecticut and delivered straight to me.  Sig Sauer was only offering this ""Precision"" package on their 716 (.308), but will be offering the above via special order to the general public soon.  This rifle is brand new, has never been fired, and has everything imaginable and is an awesome looking rifle, ready for the range or anything else you can throw at it (see Sig's 516 torture test on YouTube, URL below).
