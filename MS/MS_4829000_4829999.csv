It is of German manufacture and is a former police trade in.  It is the SA/DA/decocker model and comes with 6 factory stainless steel magazines.

I bought two of these years ago and this is my last one.  I find I just don't shoot much these days.

I have not modified it in any way and it comes as it did from the Dept. (3-dot sights, factory grip, etc.)  When new the Dept. had the slide DuraCoated for protection.  With use the coating has worn, and is flaking off in some places.  I bought these that way as I did not care so much about the  coating as about inexpensively having a true German Sig.  It shoots as one would expect it to - smooth and reliable.  

It is not a safe queen by any means, and I have priced it reasonably to reflect that.  If you are looking for a reliable, solid, German  .45 with 6 factory stainless magazines, please give my handgun your consideration.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of various accessories. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

The recoil is like a 9mm. If you compare with glock the USP has less recoil than the glock 22 and of course the glock 23 also. Great gun to shoot. Great service gun.

Capabilities Of Armor: All of our rifle plates are based on the AR500 platform with a Brinell rating of 500+

The Brinell hardness test is commonly used to determine the hardness of materials like metals and alloys. The test is achieved by applying a known load to the surface of the tested material through a hardened steel ball of known diameter. The diameter of the resulting permanent impression in the tested metal is measured and the Brinell Hardness Number is calculated.

Remember that there are many factors that influence any type of body armor, position, angles, bullet type, bullet load, weapon type, cover, ect. The term ""bulletproof"" is a myth. The object of body armor is to reduce the trauma caused by the ""hit"" or ""multiple hits"". The body armor is to keep you in the fight until the threat(s) are eliminated.

If you are looking at this then you probably know that McMillan no longer makes this and thus is why they are rare and hard to find. This is not one of the rifles where someone purchased a McMillan action and boogered together a rifle. This is a factory TAC-50. This was purchased new as a package directly from McMillan and has been sitting in storage since. It has not been taken out and fired. It is as it came from the factory. This is the TAC-50A1 right handed package. The rifle features a 29"" barrel with brake, two factory magazines (one still in the plastic), standard trigger set at 3.5 pounds, A1 stock that takes down for transport and storage, super heavy duty bipod made by LRA (American made), Pelican 1750 heavy duty transport case, pic scope base, Badger Ordnance rings, Turner sling, cleaning kit (to include one piece coated Dewey rod, bore guide, solvent, oil and patches), Eberlestock drag bag (very expensive drag bag)and finally the Nightforce NF NXS 5.5-22x56mm scope with MLR reticle. The rifle is finished in the McMillan desert tan.  I have checked the internet and have yet to find one of these packages selling anywhere so this may be the last new original McMillan package out there. Also, I'm not interested in splitting up the package. Credit card payments subject to 3.5% fee on total amount charged.  I do have this listed on another site and to see more pictures then you can find it at gun broker item number is 519154091 I will consider partial trades for an Accuracy International .338 Lapua.  I may consider some nicer high end rifles or pistols.  I see that someone has stolen my pictures off of Gunbroker to scam someone.

I am including a Crimson Trace CRM-201 laser sight, as well as the homemade kydex holster that I made to carry the firearm with the laser sight attached.

Excerpt from the book ""Two Inch Smith & Wesson Revolvers in U.S. Military Service"" by K Williams, C Flick, & E Archer, 2009: The Model 56 'In 1962 the Air Force ordered a .38 Special S&W K frame revolver with adjustable target sights and a two inch heavy barrel. S&W had not produced either its Model 14 or 15 with a two inch barrel at that time. The Air Force revolver had features from both and was designated by the factory as the Model 56. It was blued, had a heavy barrel with wide rib and plain clothes (PC) stocks. Neither the back strap nor the rear sight leaf was serrated, as is found on the Model 15. The Model 56 was marked U.S. on the back strap. A matching five-digit assembly number was applied to the left side of the frame near the butt, on the yoke opposite the frame, and inside the sideplate. Serials were not marked on the cylinder, extractor star, barrel flat or on the rear face of the yoke. MOD above 56 was marked on the left side of the frame opposite the yoke. No P proof mark was applied. There were 15,205 (plus a few overruns) of these guns shipped with consecutive serial numbers (K500001 through K515205), but they are rarely found in private hands. As of January, 2009 the Model 56 revolver, National Stock Number 1005-00-973-2058, remains listed in the Federal Logistics Information System as a terminal item, available for requisitioning by the Navy, subject to ordering until stocks are exhausted.'"

Fired a thousand or so rounds through it. Sawed down the barrel to 18.5 inches (3 inch chamber, cylinder bore), added a homemade sling. Gun is very light, compact, and powerful. Can be broken down to fit inside a backpack. When used without the fore-end, it can be broken down instantly and just as quickly assembled, with a shell in the chamber all ready to fire.

Wooden stock has been shortened from factory length and a homemade recoil pad added. Recoil is very stout but not bruising with 3'' loads. The stock is chipped from the shortening process. 

Receiver is in good condition, with a couple scratches. It has been oiled occasionally, and kept out of rain and other harsh conditions. The design is foolproof. Trigger break is a clean 9 oz. 

Barrel is 18.5 inches long, and missing a front bead sight (untapped hole for sight is present). The finish is complete, including the cut end, and there is only the lightest of surface rust. 

Fore-end has a lug for the sling, as well as an small hole from a failed flashlight mounting project. Minimal cosmetic damage otherwise. 

Ammunition includes 100 rounds of Federal birdshot, 15 Remington slugs, 25 Remington  00 buckshot, and 25 Tulammo 00 buckshot. 

Also available, a 3 inch smoothbore adapter to fire 9mm Luger ammo. Good for putting down wounded animals or causing frustration due to its inaccuracy (3 inch group at 15 yards). $10 extra. 100 rounds of Tulammo 9mm are an extra $20.

A perfectly functional gun for clay shooting or a budget bedroom defense gun or bear defense gun that won't fail you. Definitely not a show-off though.

•Sub-MOA accuracy right out of the box
•Weather-resistant construction for hunts in extreme conditions
•Match-quality, two-stage, adjustable trigger

If you’re on a quest for a production rifle that delivers hard-to-beat accuracy right out of the box, your search is over. Each Weatherby Vanguard Series 2 rifle is guaranteed to shoot a three-shot group of .99"" or less at 100 yards when used with specified Weatherby factory or premium ammunition. That’s sub-MOA accuracy from a rifle that costs far less than what you’d pay for a custom-made gun to deliver the same kind of performance. The 24"" barrel and other metal components are constructed of corrosion-resistant 400 series stainless steel. The barrel is bead-blasted to minimize glare. A three-position safety enhances safe operation. The match-quality, two-stage trigger is creep-free and adjusts down to a 2.5-lb. pull. An all-weather, lightweight, composite Griptonite™ stock features a pistol grip, forend inserts and a right-side palm swell to optimize shooter control and comfort. Phone or Text REDACTED"

This rifle prints SUB MOA groups. It has the HS Precision green webbing stock, not the cheaper Bell and Carlson. It is a safe queen and has had maybe 200 rounds put through it. The pictures do not do it justice. This caliber is no longer offered by Remington in this model. Notice the larger palm swell on the HS Precision stock in the picture. Stocks alone sell for $400. Make sure you look for 2 things on the others that say HS Precision as the palm swell is much larger on the HS and it has 2 front studs Not 1.

*Please note-
[Antiques@byus/papa@old] is a dealer that frequents armslist.
Having traded multiple guns with him I am convinced he is not looking out for your well being or your families well being as more often then not, he has traded and sold me crappy guns that fail to work reliably or correctly. Should you still decide to deal with him atleast be aware that he has and probably ..will continue to be this way.
He will often try to convince you that your gun is not worth the price your looking for and will try to deceive you into lowering the value or trading for a lesser quality gun. 
Thankfully Kel Tec has helped me for free, and has upgraded the above mentioned gun.
*This is a peer review meant to protect future buyers on the site, always use caution when dealing with others.
Should you not like what I have to say, maybe you shouldn't take advantage of people looking for a quality gun to give to their families. (Karma will get to you one day sir, I pray that you change your ways.)"

#1 is literally brand new, has been graphite black Cerakoted and actually looks better now than when I purchased it (after which, it sat in the parts bin--I decided to stay traditional style on my StG).  Got a couple handling scuffs in the original finish, which is why I coated it--looks perfect now  This one is of more recent manufacture, and has the machined-out portion inside the aft end for the para guide adapter (not included--I don't have one).  Asking $80.

#2 is a bit more used, has the older (and better, IMHO) anodized finish, and is of earlier manufacture.  You can see marks from where scope rings were installed, and a few brass kisses, though seen more easily from 'underneath' the piece--marks all appear to be finish only, no metal deformation I can tell.  This one does NOT have the cutout and cannot be converted to a para top cover.  Good candidate for a blast and refinish if you prefer the prinstine look, or can obviously leave as-is.  Asking $60.

If a buyer wants both covers, make it $140 (plus $8 if shipped lower 48).  No trades please, prefer Paypal ('Gift' only), or will accept cash.  I might consider offers.  I am in Layton, UT for potential pick up or neutral meeting place.  Contact Art at REDACTED

The GLOCK 34 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the ""Tactical/ Practical"" GLOCK designed to be the same overall length as the Government Model 1911 pistols. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. Also available in MOS configuration.

Trigger Modification:
GHOST EVO ELITE:
 is the best self-defense trigger control connector we have ever made! 
  The EVO ELITE is Smoother, Lighter, Shorter and eliminates trigger Over-travel! 
 These attributes give you the fastest most accurate first shot hit advantage of any self-defense Glock style trigger. 
 The EVO ELITE fixes the Glock bump or glitch, this is the pre-travel resistance you feel and must overcome when the trigger bar bumps into the connector. This bump causes you to apply excessive force and will move the pistol off target. 
 Another thing the EVO ELITE corrects is trigger over-travel; the excessive movement of the trigger after the pistol fires. Over-travel causes the pistol to move off of alignment with the target, making your shot go low and to one side.
