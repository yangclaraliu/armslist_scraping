Gun is about 95%.

The Beretta 92FS has been setting the standards for best military, police and tactical pistol for over a quarter century. The reason is that it was designed--and has kept evolving--to be and remain the most accurate, durable and reliable semi-auto handgun on the market. Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards).

MSRP is $682 and sells for $649 at Cabellas.

It is in great shape.  Listed below are the modifications and what the gun comes with.  Previous owner stated that it had 1000 rounds or less fired through it.  I have fired approximately 500 rounds through it since owning.    Many consider this gun to be the best, or one of the best, AK-47's ever imported.  It is similar to the Arsenal SLR-95 and SA-93 with minor differences: original stocks,  the lack of muzzle brake on the SA 93 and 90 degree gas block on the SLR 95 as opposed to the 45 degree on the SLR-96.  All three were originally imported with a thumbhole stock, plastic on the SLR-95.  If you are not familiar you could do research on any of these three as they are all very similar.  -All of the modifications below are the highest quality components, not cheap parts, like you see on many modified AK’s.  Links are included for your convenience.  -Has been professionally cereakoted ($180) after I purchased it, so only approximately 500 rounds fired since cerakoting.  -Has a CAA, AK stock tube and FAB Defense GL shock stock with adjustable cheek riser. http://store.commandarms.com/products/AKTM.html https://www.themakogroup.com/Detail.aspx?PROD=1042638&CAT=8666  -Tapco G2 Trigger group installed for 922R compliance.  Comes with the original trigger group.  -Has Magpul rail covers and Grip Pod GPS-02 (not a knock off Grip Pod). -Has a FAB Defense AK pistol grip.  -Has a FAB Defense VFR-AK rail system.  This rail system is very rigid/solid.  System allows the top cover to be removed and the gun field stripped without removing the rail system.  The groove down the middle allows you to use the iron sights when no optic is mounted.  In combination with the cheek riser on the stock it is very comfortable to use with a higher mounting optic like an EOTech. https://www.themakogroup.com/Detail.aspx?PROD=1035201&CAT=8673  -Does not come with the pictured EOTech and Magnifier.  Would also include three used (in good shape) US Palm black magazines. https://www.uspalm.com/products/ak30-30rd-magazine.html  I am willing to ship FFL to FFL for the gun.  Buyer would cover the cost of shipping plus insurance for all items if purchasing.  If trading I would cover the cost of shipping this gun and buyer would cover the cost of shipping FFL to FFL for the gun they are trading.  I am selling the gun for $1,550 but would put the total build cost/replacement value at $2,050. AK - $1200 no original furniture - (-$100) (although I do have the original furniture from an SA-93 if someone wanted to buy it with the gun) Cerakote - $180 Rail system - $340 Stock Tube - $110 Stock w/riser - $130 Pistol Grip - $30 Tapco FCG with retainer plate - $30 Grip Pod - $40 US Palm Magazines - $90"

Chambered in 9mm for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel.

For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds.

Other models like Winchester 1300 or Remington 870 are always appealing if it's not too far out of my price range. Might consider a Maverick 88 if the price makes sense.

Unmodified is good. I'd like to make a project out of it but if it has tasteful and well-done modifications like heat shield or improved iron sights (stuff I'd probably do anyway) then that might just make it an easier sell if it's still in my budget.

Very serious, cash in hand, and not wanting to waste your time or my own. Will provide my phone # after basic info exchanged to confirm interest, and hopefully set up FTF shortly thereafter.

Will also consider other models, but I'm partial to Mossberg and on a budget. Still, if you have something available don't hesitate to get in touch; the worst that could happen is I let you know I'm not interested and thank you for your time.

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Remington's Exclusive ArmorLokt process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3-1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built- in. Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18-1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail.

First focal plane AR variable power optic. Illuminated reticle is tiny @ 1x like a red dot and about the size of my ACOG horseshoe at 4x. Very decent looking, just not for the pistol I just build. Never zeroed, never shot with, never left my house. I put it in the mount and left it in my safe. I'll sell it with the 30mm Rock River Arms mount - which is a SOLID mount for any AR platform optic. I think you could take it off and use it as a weapon. Scope has the Power Change lever for fast operation from 1-4. Cool higher end feature on a very decent lil piece of glass.

Asking $250. These are $230 on amazon all day (or $226 @ Wal-mart when in stock), and the mounts are $80-90 retail.

*** There is a cheaper version that is a second focal plane WITHOUT the PCL. This is NOT the same, nor do they cost the same.***"

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

If that's not a cartridge you've ever heard of, it's essentially a .25 or 7mm bullet in a .30-06 casing. Less recoil, higher velocity, flatter trajectory. Considered by many to be the perfect round for whitetail. 

The rifle is blued with a black synthetic stock. Bought new I think about five or six years ago? Maybe a few more. I can't quite recall. I bought it as a hunting rifle and never found a buck with it. Started taking a 336C in .35 with me instead and got a buck every time. Maybe this rifle is cursed...but maybe I shouldn't say that if I'm trying to sell it? The good news is it's only ever been fired a few times to sight in the scope and then once every season to be sure it held its zero.

It is an accurate rifle for the price for sure. It's currently wearing a Nikon Prostaff 9X scope--a $150 scope, if I recall. This could either be included or not, but it's currently priced as if included. Comes with one box, 20 rounds of high grade Hornady hunting ammo.

The other thing I'm told is worth mentioning is it was made just before the Remington corporate takeover that apparently turned Marlin's quality control to shit. The barrel is marked JM, accordingly.

Price negotiable. Might trade. Am in the market for a pocket pistol."
