The 3032 Tomcat offers all the features of the 21 Bobcat. Both pistols have a snag-proof design that permits quick presentation to the target, a slide blade front sight for fast target acquisition, and a smooth, crisp trigger pull in double/single action. QUALITY POCKET PISTOLS.  The same dedication to advanced design, uncompromising quality and strict quality control that make the 92FS, Cougar and Cheetah such international standouts is found in all Beretta small caliber, pocket-size pistols. Simplicity, safety and practical use are their best qualities.   PRACTICAL AND SIMPLE. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas.  


1) Barrel.  Forged out of special high-strength steel; precisely rifled for accuracy. The Inox  models feature stainless steel barrels.  2) Slide.  Machined out of high-strength carbon steel and specially heat treated.  3) Sights.  Notched rear sight and blade front sight for fast target acquisition.  4) Frame-mounted.  Manual, conveniently thumb operated.  5) Contoured Tang.  Top of the grip area is precisely curved and relieved to snugly accommodate the shooter’s hand, thus protecting the thumb web from being pinched by the slide and increasing the pistol control upon firing.  6) Frame.  Made of a special alloy, noticeably stronger, lighter and more corrosion resistant than stainless steel. In all other models the frame is made of special aluminum alloy forgings and anodized black or gray.  7) Tip-up Barrel Latch.   8) Trigger Pull.  Smooth, crisp pull in double/single action.   9) Snag Proof Design.  Smooth contours permit quick, smooth draw. 
3032 TOMCAT. EXCELLENT POWER VS WEIGHT. Stopping power, concealability and lightweight – that’s what the double-action Tomcat is all about. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm) hollow-point ammunition, this latest addition to Beretta’s small frame collection provides firepower equalling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short). Yet, all this serious capability is packed into a compact, lightweight 4.9” (125 mm), 14.5 ounce (400 gr.) package. A drift-adjustable rear sight provides for superior accuracy. Available in the Tritium version featuring the tritium luminous front sight in some countries.

This package includes the Military version of the Barrett 50 cal rifle….the 82A1M with the factory mounted Leupold Mark 4 optic, 4.5-14x50 LR/T, along with the Barrett Carry Handle and Mono-pod, and of course ….. The Real Military Bipod with the Spike Foot Pads. Please note the scope rings are actually manufactured by Leupold, as required by the contract. This is the Real Deal!!! This Barrett/Deployment system ships in two pelican cases as originally packaged, to include: a total of 6 Barrett magazines, Otis cleaning kits for the rifle and optic both, a tool kit with torque wrench, spare parts for the rifle, web gear / pouches, drag bag, ect. As you can see in picture 15 while stored together in the pelican case the bipod leg brushed against the top of the scope making a small mark.

Between 1938 and 1940, it bore the name Ballester-Rigaud. The Ballester was designed to offer the Argentine police and military a less-expensive alternative to the Sistema Colt Modelo 1927, which was itself a licensed copy of the Colt M1911A1 and built under the supervision of Colt engineers. Production of the Ballester-Molina began in 1938 and ceased in 1953. Ironically, the Sistema Colt 1927 was manufactured until 1966.[1]

The history of the company dates back to 1929, when two Spaniard entrepreneurs, Arturo Ballester and Eugenio Molina, established a branch of the Spanish Hispano-Suiza in Buenos Aires. Years later, HAFDASA hired two engineers, Frenchman Rorice Rigaud and Carlos Ballester-Molina, a relative of the founders. Rigaud became the chief designer of the firm, while Ballester-Molina was appointed chief executive officer.
There is lots of other info out there on these fine firearms, just do a bit of research. The S/N of my gun dates to between 1938-1942, all parts have matching s/n's, frame, slide & barrel. Colt is selected only because HFASADA isn't an option."

I have 2 items I am looking at trading. I have a R&G 22LR model 14 revolver. This is a 6 shot pistol and I have a JC Higgins - Sears and Roebuc manufactured by savage ( thats what I found on line ). The R&G model 14 from what I am reading was made in 1968. Since the R&G has no safety I don't feel I want my daughter shooting it.

These rifles are hard to find in this condition with the all wood front end and exposed op-rod style, resembling the M1 Carbine. Comes with original factory 5 rd magazine. I wouldn't mind keeping this forever and I know what it is worth. But I am moving to a free state and figure I would leave this behind to someone in NY that may want it more than I do at this point. I will be in town one day only, this Friday, and then not be back again. So that is the only day it is available. Asking price is $900. Yes it is high but these are somewhat collectible now and I don't see any other for sale for any price so this is my asking price. The first to email me and say ""I will take it for $900"" will have the first opportunity to buy it. I will consider other serious and reasonable cash offers, but the first $900 offer will secure it.

Brand New in the box NEVER FIRED 

Browning ® A Bolt 3 Composite Stalker Bolt-Action Rifles

Hand-reamed chamber and triple-checked barrel
Crisp 3.5-lb. trigger pull
Fast, smooth 60° bolt action
Bolt-unlock button
Easy-access safety

The next generation in Browning's legendary A-Bolt line maximizes accuracy and performance by focusing on improving quality down to the last detail. Button-rifled barrel is triple-checked for straightness and then air-gauged to ensure a consistent diameter throughout the bore's length. Every AB3 barrel is individually finished with a hand-reamed chamber for tighter tolerances and more precise headspace. Barrel's target-type Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in trajectory. Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy. Free-floating barrel eliminates contact interference from the foreend, enabling the barrel to perform consistently and accurately to reach its full potential. Integrated trigger design delivers a crisp 3.5-lb. pull that breaks like glass. Mount your scope close to the center of the bore using the precision-machined standard-length steel action to minimize the offset between the bore centerline and optical centerline. Fast 60° bolt lift keeps your thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action. Matte electroless nickel-plated bolt body ensures smooth operation and added corrosion resistance. Use the bolt unlock button to unload the chamber with the safety in the safe position. Top-tang safety allows easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. Generous trigger guard allows easy access, even while wearing gloves. Detachable, staggered box magazine has a rugged formed steel body and feed lips for added durability. Magazine has a three-round capacity in magnum calibers and four-round capacity in standard calibers. Innovative Inflex technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from your face when firing to reduce felt recoil and flinching. Durable matte-blued steel finish on all external surfaces minimizes reflection and corrosion resistance. Rugged matte-black synthetic stock. Pre-installed steel sling swivel studs for easy mounting of your sling or bipod. Receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mounts."

Not in a rush to sell, and i'd rather keep it, but I really want to move to a bolt action rifle, non 22. LR. I bought this about 4 months ago and ive put maybe 2 bricks through it but cleaned and took care of it well. Has iron sights, a bushnell scope (100 dollar scope) and a cheap little red dot (with a 90 degree offset rail. Was a fun plinker but I want to get into more serious long-range shooting now. 

Mainly looking for a mosin nagant or similar (enfield lee, etc), but would of course ask for a cash difference. On the same side, I'm open to other bolt action rifles and am willing to part with cash if the trade is fair.

Over-under actions must have a strong locking mechanism, because the stress of every shot causes the action to ""want"" to open. For this reason, most manufacturers place the locking lug(s) at the top of the receiver, making it strong but also taller and bulkier than it needs be. Thanks to its long experience, Beretta uses instead two conical locking lugs at mid-action, right between the barrels. This gives the 686 receiver vault-like locking strength while keeping the profile considerably lower. The advantage is that the eye of the shooter is a lot closer to the plane of his supporting hand: considerably better swing and hand-eye coordination, more targets shattered."

There is still room for adding your own personal touches with finish and fit as far as metal removal for a sleeker and more contoured frame. I built this with little detail in finish but all on fit and function…I like the rough hard core look of it with a touch of flair in the grips and sights and extras!!!I am considering moving this along as I have another I built I am keeping so I am looking at around $750 cash. less than 500 rounds through it.

These are used frequently in Varmint and Long Range AR builds where a lighter 2-Stage trigger really helps accuracy and round placement. These triggers come pre-adjusted by Rock River gunsmiths as a matched pair and drop in all mil-spec lowers with no adjustment necessary for an easy drop-in install. Rock River 2-stage NM pins are .1555 in diameter and are not recommended or designed to be used with .154 pins or .170 Colt lower receivers. .1555 RRA Trigger pins will install in any standard milspec lower receiver without modification but may be noticeably more snug than the .154 pins upon install. 

This kit includes trigger, trigger spring, trigger pin, disconnector, hammer, hammer spring, and hammer pin. This 2-stage National Match trigger kit is for a lower which already has a lower parts kit installed. This does NOT include any detents, takedown pins, or other parts to complete a stripped lower.
