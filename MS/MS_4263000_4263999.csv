They aren't much more than 380's and one place were the same or a little less. Google search found the ammo.  Fiocchi Ultra or Police. This might be one worth keeping as a collector as there aren't many pistols out there chambered in this caliber.  Walther has a few and the Walther Forums are a neat source of info on the round.

Functions really neat, you rack it, and as a safety, have to insert the mag to close the rack. Hammer is made bobbed and is flush with the back of the firearm.

I could only find one Ultra9mm and here's a link to it where it sold for 400 and wasn't NIB or unfired. So  I'll price this one at: $365.

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® and SR-762™ offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

Holds 15 rounds (14 plus one in the chamber) of 2 3/4"" shells. Has a 3"" chamber.Here's a link to a good video review or the 3rd gen UTS-15, https://youtu.be/WMl6451vFFQ This is similar to the Kel-Tec KSG but in my opinion better. This has several features that the KSG does not.  Barrel is under mag tubes. This lowers the axis of the bore, improving recoil. Windows to see how many rounds are left With the KSG, you have to flip a switch to switch which mag tube to load rounds from. You can do that with the UTS-15, or you can have it automatically pull rounds from each tube. Uses standard AR-15 grips so any aftermarket AR grip will fit. Optional light and laser combo with a switch accessible with trigger finger  Think about the possibilities. You could load slugs in one tube and buckshot in the other. Or less than lethal rounds, etc. A flip of the switch selects which one to load. Or just put the switch in the middle position and fire all 15 rounds as fast as you can work the trigger and pump. This shotgun is incredibly lightweight and well balanced. This is the latest and greatest version with several improvements over the original design. $899 plus tax. Dealer sale.

Dovetail has a pin set in it to prevent the scope from creeping, looks redneck but works better than the commercial mounts. Scope is beat up at the front, but heck, it's a Mosin. This is a mid-war 1942 example and you can tell by the machining quality it was made at the height of Russia's desperation. However it runs as well as any Mosin and doesn't suffer from sticky bolt or any other maladies.

I've shot this at about 600 yards with good effect. Was my truck gun for a while, but I've decided I prefer irons on my Mosins. Priced to sell, with the price of Mosins these days it would cost you at least $220 to buy and accessorize it like this.

The ammunition alone is worth probably $250-300. It is the equivalent of 14 boxes plus 20 boxes of brass.

Here is the package I am offering:

 1. The gun - Glock Model G37 in .45 GAP.  It has had Advantage Tactical Firefly night sights installed by the owner of Advantage Tactical - Richard Nasef. Richard is a former team mate of Jerry Miculek and knows his stuff. He had the grips stippled. I think it is an EXTREMELY good job of that. In the process the gunsmith contoured the thumb rest area of the grip to make it easier to push the mag release without shifting the grip on the pistol. Sort of like what Glock tried to do with the Gen 4, but better in my opinion. I have never felt a Glock this comfortable or this ""sticky"" in the hand. The stippling doesn't make the gun want to catch clothing like checkering would have. It is a great pistol with zero problems. Oh, the sights come with all the inserts available at Advantage Tactical. This was Richard's personal pistol. If you are a Glock guy, you will love it. It has a 5 pound competition trigger installed as well. This pistol is one year old and has been shot very little. 

 To read about these sights, here is a link. I love them and even have them on a shotgun.

 http://www.advantagetactical.com/

 2. Over 700 rounds of loaded ammunition. It is sorted and labeled. It weighs - I kid you not - right at 30 pounds. I just weighed it and was shocked. All of it is 230 grain, and the majority is hollow point. 

 3. Over 2,000 rounds of once fired brass. Richard had a couple of competition pistols in this caliber. He gave me this brass, and I am of course not charging for it here. Weight? Only a little over 14 pounds of brass!!

 Price is reduced to $500 for all of it. The ammo will come in a separate box of course.  I saw on the major auction site (Gunbroker) where somebody is selling one similar with 700 rounds of ammo. He started his auction at way over $900 and wants over $1000 plus shipping for it. That one is a standard Glock 37 without the extras here. As far as I know it has never been in a holster. It comes with its original Glock case, 5 magazines, the cleaning brush, and the Glock papers/books.

The biggest issue with a .45 GAP is supposedly ammo availability. They have it at all the major gun stores, and even at Walmart. Pricing is about the same as for decent .45 ACP ammunition. At any rate, this package gets rid of most of the problem anyway.

Thanks once again for reading my long ad.

There are Yoshimura pipes on bike that make it sound great. The odometer is at 20,xxx miles. The one big thing wrong with this bike is that it is missing the title. There are a few ways you can go around this. Either use the bike for strictly the track. You are able to get a title for the bike if you have the patience. I can explain how to get the title for it to you. So since the title is missing I have lowered the price on the bike considerably.

I'm looking to trade for a few guns. But I will consider all offers. Just let me know what you have.

I've got a loaded Ar-15 for sale here.  Its pretty new to me and has not seen much use.  I bought the lower less than a year and a half ago from Palmetto and I bought the Cmmg upper at the end of last summer.  It comes loaded with stuff and is going for a very reasonable price.  The reason i'm selling (or considering trading) this rifle is because I am much more comfortable hunting with my bolt action cheap-o rifle and I have another Ar lower in my personal inventory.  I purchased this firearm and set it up for a tactical game hunting/defense rifle capable of firing solid follow up shots not in .225/5.56.  The 300 Blackout round is pretty neat.  Estimated round count is less than 150 rounds (barely/not broken in yet).  Great shooting gun with no issues.  Packs a little more punch than a Nato spec Ar.  Its only been in the field once and I've cleaned it after every use.  Great condition/like new.  I'm willing to consider reasonable offers,  trades, or trades and cash.  I can drive around the Santa Cruz County and I may be able to be persuaded to drive into neighboring counties to an FFL closer to you.  Please don't ask for cash and carry.

Browning A bolt II with boss tuner in .308.  She is in excellent condition, and the tuner works great allowing you to tighten up groups depending on the brand of ammo.  I was able to pull in half in groups and less at 100 with a shooting rest.  The glass that is on her comes with the rifle (no extra price I just don't want it), and is not worth a lot.  The wind-age dials are all chewed up, but Bushnell said to ship it to them and they would repair them, I just haven't bothered doing it.  She comes stock with an adjustable 4 lb trigger, and a hinged floor plate with detachable magazine .  I have no use shotguns as I already have tons and I don't want anymore.  I am looking for a few different things. A 6.8 spc ii complete rifle, a glock 17 w 200 cash, a glock 42 with 300 cash, or a higher end 7.62x39 ar complete upper with working mags.  I am happy to meet in Jacksonville at a gun range for you to test her, or shooters/Gun Gallery.

Up for trade is a very nice colt 1991A1. I got this in trade from the orginal owner. It's in very good shape an comes as you see it pictured. The mags are 1 colt and 2 cmc mags, and 59 rounds of ball ammo. This finish is tough to photograph but you won't be disappointed. I would say the finish is %95 consecutively. Very little wear. 

As far as trades I am open but below are a few specifics. 

Ak-47 or ak-74 must be a good quality gun. A wasr is fine but I'll need cash with it. 

H&k VP9 depending on what yours comes with I'll likely need some cash.

S&W 357 or 44 mag revolvers (no rugers unless it's a clean security six, service six) 

M&p shield 9mm plus cash. 

Xdm 5.5 9mm

NO RUST, NO PITTING, NO SCRATCHES on any of the barrel inside or out, receiver or 5+1 internal magazine. 

People overlook savage rifles because they are meant to be the average man's rifle. This rifle averages a 3 inch grouping with 5 shots in 3 minutes at 200 yards. You just don't get a better hunting gun for the price. 

The scope is a 6-24x50mm Field and Stream. It's a cheaper scope but like I said, it's dead on and accurate every time. Mounted with Leupold crossbar and rings. Mounted professionally in a gun shop. Clarity is excellent in the scope.

Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."
