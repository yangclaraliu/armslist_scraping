This value-packed line of safes has convenience and security features reserved for higher priced models. Built with a sharp eye for utility, Hunter safes deliver optimal fire and security features paired with a versatile interior and tough finish.WHY STEP UP TO A HUNTER SAFE?Stepping up to a NEW Hunter Series safe gives you a tough 11-Gauge steel body and a larger diameter locking bolts for added security. Axis Adjustable Shelving adds convenience and versatility. Hunter safes are Made in the USA.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.HIGH CAPACITY BARREL RACKThe Hunter Series put a focus on long gun torage with a new barrel rack designed to provide instant access to long guns (13 per rack)PRY-STOP END BOLTSMore than two and a half times longer than door bolts, they attach to angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack.

This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm."

Oversized MAX Locking Bolts and End Bolts resist pry attack better than round bolts. The slick exterior finish and subtle graphics add beautiful security to any room in your home.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEMThe Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.DPX STORAGE SYSTEMIncludes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access. Pouches and pockets organize other valuables.DPX SCOPE SAVERWith the Scope Saver, long guns with optics now fit on the DPX rack without taking up space inside the safe body. The optics are also protected from the bumpsand dings of guns going into and out of the safe.MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTSMAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. Browning ProSteel designed most of their Locking Systems utilize a cam and linkage system that diverts pounding and prying forces away from the lock.HARDENED PIN LOCK PROTECTIONThe heart of a safe's securty is its lock, and that's why all Pro Series safes feature Hardened Pin Lock Protection. The lock is protected by two 1/4"" hardened steel plates and features four 1/4"" hardened steel pins designed to deflect or break drill bits during a drilling attack.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.PRY-STOP END BOLTSMore than two and one-half times longer than door bolts, they attach to angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack. The top and bottom lock bolts on the door secure the critical door corners.BROWNING PRO SERIES GRAND 26 DIMENSIONSExterior Dimensions [HxWxD]: 60""x30""x25""Cubic Feet: 26Weight: 700 LBS.Locking Bolts: 9Gun Capacity: 29 Total (11/22+7)SECURITY FEATURESBody Thickness: 11-Gauge SteelDoor Type/Thickness: 1"" FormedLocking System: Fprce DeflectorLocking Bolt Size: 3""x(3/4)"", MAXLocking Bolts Side Coverage: 3 SidesPry-Stop Bolts: 2 Pry-Stop MAX End BoltsInner Plate Specification: Full 10-Gauge PlateLock: S&G Mechanical or ElectronicLock Protection Features: Hardened Pins, RelockerReinforced Door Frame: 4-Sided, Full ReinforcementFIRE PROTECTION FEATURESInsulation Thickness-Door: 1(3/4)""Insulation Thickness-Body: 1(7/8)""Insulation Thickness-Ceiling: 1(7/8)""Fire Seal: PalusolFire Rating, NEW ThermaBlock: 1680F/90 MinutesAPPEARANCE FEATURESInterior Covering: Beige CarpetHandle: 3-Spoke, ChromeCONVENIENCE FEATURES180 Degree HingesLED LightingElectrical OutletRaised FloorStorage Solution: Axis Shelving.

This pistol is like brand new with only about 100 rounds fired through it.

Here is the info on the upgrades to this pistol:

This XDS pistol has an upgraded trigger job with Powder River Precision parts which has greatly improved the trigger pull and also how the sear breaks. This upgrade gives this pistol a really noticeably better trigger. Further upgrades also include a stainless steel extended magazine release and a stainless steel slide release. These upgrades and additional work added about another $135 to my cost of this pistol bringing the total to just over $660 (not counting tax & fees). Now while I don’t hope to, or feel I need to, recover all of my cost (especially for the fees and the upgrades) I also don't intend on giving it away... And so I would most likely prefer a trade. 

But if you are interested in what I have and can appreciate the changes to this pistol but do not have a trade, please feel free to make what you feel to be a ""reasonable"" cash only offer. My assigned trade value to this pistol is: $600.00
I will review all trade offers but my primary interests are what are listed below.

All original factory parts replaced with the above upgrades are includes making it possible to restore this pistol to factory specs, however, I personally after experiencing the difference could not see going back to the original trigger.

It allows a Lee Enfield rifle to accept a single-stack WASR magazine, and fire the 7.62x39 cartridge, which is much cheaper, easier to find, and easier on the shoulder than .303 British. Only a handful of rifles were ever converted, and this is the only Mk.III model that I have seen. The base gun was an Indian Ishapore No.1 Mk.III Enfield that was in somewhat rough shape, so nothing of historical value was lost! The barrel is threaded for a suppressor or flash hider. 

A few things are left to be done before it is ready to fire. 
-Original barrel needs to be removed
-New barrel needs an extractor grove cut
-New barrel attached and headspaced
-Minor shaping done to the magazine well to allow the magazine to feed correctly
-The bolt could use a stripping and cleaning, as it is sticky with old grease.

These aren't terribly difficult operations, but do require a few tools and a bit of know-how.

Jump on it, this is likely the only one you will ever see!"

It is in near-perfect condition, with only a bit of fading in the finish. If you have never handled a classic Mannlicher bolt-action rifle, you are missing out. The action is as slick and smooth as glass, even 115 years later. This rifle feeds from an en-bloc clip, which is ejected from the bottom when the last round is chambered. It is light, handy, has low recoil and packs surprising punch. If you like unique historical weapons, or just need a handy hunting rifle, this may be for you.

Included with the rifle are:
-An original sling
-5 clips
-Dies, bullets, brass, powder, and hand-primer for reloading.

6.5x53r can't be found on store shelves, but can easily be formed out of common .303 British brass with a little patience. 
-The shoulder is set back with a .308 die (included)
-The neck may be necked down to 7mm as an intermediate step with a 7mm-08 die (not included)
-The neck is further necked down to 6.5mm and the body is reshaped for greater taper with the 6.5x53r die.
-The brass is trimmed back to 2.1"" 
-After this the brass may be loaded with any standard 6.5mm bullet. My personal load is a 140gr bullet over 38 grains of 4350."

Since it is bonded, it is much less likely to shed it's jacket upon impact. Ballistic gelatin tests show an expansion to over 7/10 of an inch. Advertised muzzle velocity is 890 feet per second resulting in 404 foot pounds of energy. A big, slow bullet is perfect for home defense, or where you are concerned about over penetration or ricochet.

Nearly all DD parts. Only 100 rounds of some XM193/Black Hills match thru it (give/take). It is in excellent plus condition. 

Parts list include: 
- Aero Precision upper receiver 
- DD lightweight profile CHF barrel, 16"" 
- DD new 'Slim Rail' 15"" (just like the one on the new M4V11) 
- BCM Gunfighter Comp, Mod0 
- White Oak low-pro gas block with match profile gas tube 
- DD BCG 
- DD charging handle 

All of this was very properly and meticulously assembled. Barrel nut was properly torqued to 50lbs with Snap-On torque wrench. Gas block screws torqued with red LockTite. 

Super nice, top-shelf upper. Very light-weight and handy. Just like a DD M4V11. I got excellent groups while properly supported on a bench. With match ammo, you'd most likely get MOA results.  

Cost of all these parts in current market is about $924 (maybe $800 if you waited for sales) no shipping included. I probably paid about $825 total. 

I'm asking $750. Or, $650 without the BCG. I am open to offers at some point. But I feel this is a VERY good asking price for a nice upper.  

The specs see in the pics is just a little dust from being on a unit of lumber. Thanks!"

GUN: It is a nearly new Pietta LeMat Calvary model in .44  It has had two cylinders worth and two shotgun barrels put through it. This beautiful revolver is in like new condition.   MOLD:  The bullet mold is for a conical bullet. I measured it as .445 diameter. So, it's for a .44 percussion revolver.

FLASK: Original Civil War flask in very good condition with modern spring and .24 grain spout for the LeMat on it. The set includes the Ted Cash brass snail capper and the correct reproduction Eley Bros. Cap Tin and a Confederate Calvary Officer's reproduction Cap Boss, also in brass.  The Case itself is new and beautifully hand built by Hampels specifically for this revolver out of Cherry wood and glass.   PAYMENT: I prefer PayPal or Certified Check.

It has been fired exactly 140 rounds to check function and it runs great. It is 100% reliable with every magazine I have tried with it. Magazines lock up tight and function great. This is by far the most accurate AK I have ever shot. 

 To improve upon the accuracy potential it has an adjustable trigger installed. The trigger pull is crisp and breaks cleanly at 2.5 pounds. This is the best AK trigger you have probably ever felt. Or if you want I will install the factory Tapco FCG group which gives a ~5-6 pound trigger with plenty of creep.

 The Magpul Zhukov-S Stock is a no-compromise folding stock for the modern AK. The Zhukov-S Stock casts aside traditional AK stock shortcomings and offers a folding, collapsible stock with QD sling mounts, modular Cheek Risers, and a shock-absorbing rubber butt-pad for superior traction. The Zhukov has right-side folding for compatibility with side-mounted optics. Designed to fit most common stamped AK receivers without modification via a unique wedge block, the durable injection molded polymer Zhukov-S Stock redefines the human interface with the AK platform. It does have one QD sling swivel loop installed.

 This gun comes with a three, yes THREE, year factory warranty. It will also come with one free recoat of the finish anytime within that time frame. It will not require the gun to be shipped anywhere to have it recoated. I will provide details to the buyer. 

 DDI AK47 Black Stock Model , 7.62 x 39 semi auto, Destructive Devices Industries stamped AK is built using a DDI stamped receiver, Green Mountain 4140 barrel, TAPCO FCG, like new Hungarian AKM kit. This DDI Stamped Ak47 has a KG Gun Coat finish, Fenocited bolt, bolt carrier, cleaning rod, axis pins, rear sight assembly, spring guide, and Green Mountain barrel. Fenocite provides superior corrosion resistance, increased accuracy, and reduced wear, barrels can last a third longer than conventional barrels. Hogue grip/handguards, and a Phoenix Technology stock has a LARGE storage compartment in the rear. One 30 round polymer magazine, rail sections and hardware for the Hogue hand guard, additional railed upper hand guard, and slant brake found on all modern AKMs.

 The price is $800 with the Magpul folding stock or $700 with the factory stock.

 And because it is made right here in Tennessee no federal regulation will ever ban it because of the laws recently passed in Tennessee like SB 110 as well as the Tennessee Firearms Freedom Act. Get this before Hillary gets into office and prices on ALL AKs go through the roof.

 Watch review videos and read about the DDI AK here:
 http://ddiarms.com/about-us.html

 This gun is literally like new. I bought it new and installed the trigger. I fired 100 rounds to ensure reliability, which it is 100% reliable, then I installed the Magpul Zhukov folding stock. Then I fired 40 more rounds and I must say I LOVE this stock. After that it was cleaned and stored in a soft case.

 Again, this gun is literally a brand new gun with only 140 rounds through it."

Also for sale with the pistol is a Galco Jackass Rig Shoulder Holster, it is a very nice adjustable leather shoulder holster, the original model from Galco, it fits all Glocks in 9mm or .40/.357 Sig from full size to subcompact.  Also with the pistol is a bright yellow training barrel.  I am asking 500 cash, some trades will be considered, but only for firearms.  Thanks for looking, if you have any question or would like to see more detailed pictures, please contact the ad."
