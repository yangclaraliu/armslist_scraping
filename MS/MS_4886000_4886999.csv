The PT22 is a .22LR semi-automatic pistol produced by Taurus and features an 8+1 round capacity magazine. The PT22 is often viewed as a Taurus copy of the Beretta 21 Bobcat due to having a similar "" tip up"" barrel . In fact this small pistol is very different in design and function from the Beretta. The PT22 is a cast steel frame and slide, manufactured in Florida, USA. It has a spur-less hammer, and a long but smooth double action only (DAO) trigger. The ""tip up"" barrel is useful in that the first round may be chambered directly into the barrel, and the operator does not have to ""pull back"" or ""rack"" the slide.

Details: factory complete CMMG upper purchased from midway. Swapped the A3 (flat top) receiver for a A2 carry handle receiver to match the A2 fixed front sight. The forward assist is missing because the .22 bolts typically don't have or need them. And there was just a fake plastic plug pinned in the original one.
Bolt/BCG is stainless steel parkerized VERY light wear marks where bolt glides.
Barrel is 20"" 4140 CrMo WASP AKA melonite coated perfect gleeming bright bore. 
Receiver is 7075-T6 forged. And has very little to almost no wear marks inside, no blemishes. Complete minus the forward assist and I left the little plastic shell deflector off as well so a upper vise block will fit over it for assembly disassembly. I can probability find it if you want it as well.

Don't buy a cheap plastic .22 ar upper get the real deal. And get parts that function with the most common mags black dog/cmmg/sig etc. Check out the reviews on this brand make and model they are great, and you wont be dissapointed. I can throw in one of the grey 25 round mags as well for an extra $15 I think its a cmmg brand mag.

Price is non neg. (only costs a little more than the conversion kit and practically giving this way at this price. So happy thanksgiving!) prefer FTF at sportsmans warehouse in federal way at the end of HWY 18. Any questions feel free to ask away. I have more pics if interested. May be willing to ship if it doesn't sell locally in the next week or two. Buyer would pay shipping of unknown cost at this time. I'd have to get a quote. Payment would be through USPS money order only."

M16 Full Auto Style for increased mass and lock time. Our new BCG is precision machined from 8620 Steel with a shot peened bolt manufactured from Carpenter 158 and Magnetically Particle Inspected. The entire carrier assembly is NiB, Electroless Nickel Boron coated with the patented, advanced UCT EXO process, unlike standard NiB coatings. This offers extreme lubricity with a friction coefficent of .02 and surface hardness of 82-85 Rockwell C. The carriers patent pending design features unique shrouded and forward facing gas ports that have also been re sized so that gas is vented differently to a standard carrier. This results in a system that runs flatter with a smoother energy pulse. In addition the system also runs cooler and cleaner, there is also less pressurization of the upper receiver when running a suppressed barrel. The flared boss at the tail of the carrier enhances the BCG's lock position within the upper and makes it more consistent, resulting in an accuracy improvement. All critical dimensions are hard turned / ground after heat treat and the bore of the carrier and gas key have been hard chrome lined for the best possible wear resistance. All E-BCG's feature the LANTAC CP-R360 patent pending domed cam pin that is machined from 17-4PH Stainless Steel and hardened to H900 condition (45RC approx). The ultra smooth head reduces wear within the upper receiver. The BCG's 11.7oz weight helps to increase lock time and smoother operation. Gas keys are properly staked at four points and only grade 8 fasteners are used in assembly. The E-BCG's forward porting and unique shape assist in reducing pressurization inside the upper receiver that can be caused by short barrel rifles running suppressors. However, it should be noted that the E-BCG is not a complete solution for this issue and all rifles are different. 'Over Gassed' guns will suffer to a larger extent from this problem.

These holsters are a creation of necessity. I always wanted holsters that would carry high and tight outside of my waistband... Since nothing on the market really satisfied me, I made my own... exactly the way I wanted them. 

I use heavy duty bolts/nuts not wimpy leather hardware and kydex for the belt loops. Basically they are built to survive a societal collapse. They aren't the prettiest holsters in the world, but they might be the toughest and carry better than everything I have ever tested. I don't use a press. I literally hand fit them with a heat gun and a scripto lighter to get a perfect fit. They are comfortable because they are not inside the waistband, they are concealed nicely because they are high. They fit tight and retain the firearm well. I use .80 black kydex for the entire holster not .60 like most manufacturers. The Glock of the holster world. 

I will ship anywhere in the USA in a priority mail flat rate envelope for $6.

At this time we can do Glock 17, 22, 23, 19, 26, 27, XDM and Sig P226. I can do them for Tac Lights and other attachments too. Email me if your gun isn't on here and I might buy a blue gun. 

If it is a gun we have currently the main holster runs $40. Add a matching mag carrier for $15.

Blue with wood furniture. Approximately 5 years old, took on one bear hunt and never left the open dirt road with it. Bought the rifle to crawl through the thick Carolina bay terrain in order to shoot bears that were treed or bayed by dogs. It was fired exactly ONE time, ONE round, to ensure proper functioning before the hunt. The gun has been loaded exactly twice in its life with the second time being October of this year. Both times I used 325 grain Hornady LeverEvolution Flex-tip rounds. The capacity is 4+1. I have installed a hammer spur for ease of cocking especially with an optic installed. I also have a picatinny scout rail that mounts on the rifle and allows for the mouting of an optic of your choice. Red dot, 1-4x, prism, whatever you like. The scout rail is made by XS Sight Systems and alone retails for $150. Mine is new and unopened in the package. There are no major scratches or blemishes on the rifle anywhere. This gun will come with the original box and all factory shipped components. With the XS rail I am asking $625, without the rail I'll take $525. This rifle sells new anywhere from $540-$600 depending on where you look from what I've found.

Then you think about how a standard rifle is going for $200. Then you have $20 shipping, $25 FFL charges, buy ammo, and then you can't be sure of condition. You are already at $245!

But wait there's more.... Then you got to clean all that cosmoline grease out of it and refinish or replace the stock.

OR OR OR....

You can buy mine! This rifle has had a thorough cleaning, stock refinished, and a scope mounted. It also comes with the bayonet, reproduction sling, and scope.

All you got to do is buy it with no muss or fuss and then go shooting!

Scope is mounted by removing original sight which exposes the dovetail mount. That is used to attach rail to mount scope rings on. If desired the scope can be removed and original iron sight put back on. There was no permanent modifications made.

Gun passes the one finger bolt test. See it at the end of the video.

The ACOGs are internally adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics which collect ambient light. The ACOG combines traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close in aiming speed. Although the ACOG has many features which are very advantageous for military use, they were developed by Trijicon without government funding. Designed for use with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions -- without failure prone batteries.

These are serious self defense/law enforcement rounds and they're fairly hard to find.
I couldn't find these exact rounds for sale anywhere but the bonded version was going for $35/box here:
http://www.targetsportsusa.com/winchester-ranger-9mm-luger-ammo-115-grain-bonded-jacketed-hollow-point-ra9mmjhp-p-3876.aspx
I've also looked here on armslist and found other 9mm ranger rounds for $30-$35/box.
Again, these are high end self defense rounds so if you are just target shooting I would advise you to look elsewhere for some cheaper FMJ rounds.
Armslist only allows for 1 image but if you email me I'd be happy to send you a couple more pictures that I took so you can have a closer look at the rounds."
