Here is the interesting part…
Barrel is a Med Weight National Match manufactured by Nomura Machine Industries circa 1992. P (Proof Round tested) stamped into the barrel. Very rare article, I believe only 2000 were made.

I upgraded this rifle to a USGI Leopard-spotted stock. This stock is baby smooth and has no nicks or dings. She turns heads at the range every time she comes out. Pics really don’t do the finish justice. Proof P-no serif and DAS on the stock. Rifle locks up tight in this stock.
THe pics in the camo stock are older pics from when she wore a synthetic stock with a rattlecan paint job.

Comes with 3 CMI 20rd mags NIW. Bayonet and TUrner NM sling do not come with rifle.

The Tan ones do have some scuffs and scratches on them.  Unfortunately, the factory tan paint gets scratched easily.  If you ever drop one, or let them touch one another in storage, they will lose some paint.

I also have 2 more that were tan, but I stripped the tan paint off (because my SCAR is one of the more accurate black models).  They do still have the tan floor plate covers though.  They are also in great shape.

Both are ""divers"" 200m. Both have s.s.bracelets and both are near perfect. One is a white face, quartz powered with date and silver accents and a rotating bezel for diving, works perfectly. The other is a black face chronometer, rotating bezel, quartz powered with 7 dials in brushed stainless and works perfectly. True value of the white face is 450. and true value of the black face is 650. Each of these watches sold for well over 2 grand new and would appraise much higher than what I'm asking.  These are very prestigious, but not flashy, timepieces. I am more than willing to take these to a local Boulder jeweler  for authentication at trade/sale time if you want to make sure of the authenticity.

It was also featured on Robocop 2.  Not sure if this particular one was actually in the movie or not.  Main reason that I am selling is because I just never use it and I need to make room for some other firearms.

If you check the numbers, this is the perfect length for an AR pistol or SBR to keep velocity and energy up while staying nice and compact.  When you drop down to the 7 1/2""+/- barrels you loose 1/3 of the velocity from the .223/5.56 round, which will affect the performance of the projectile in a big way.  Breakdown below:  

San Tan Tactical STT-15 Pillar Billet Upper Receiver in FDE, which seem to be hard to find.

Daniel Defense 12.5"" .223/5.56 1/7 barrel

Daniel Defense BCG

TROY 11"" TRX Bravo BattleRail

Spikes DynaComp Brake

CH with oversized latch

The cost to build this upper would run over $1,000 in just parts alone, not to mention any fees in shipping and/or taxes, feel free to look up the parts.

$760 firm in cash or higher in trade, I'm not going to straight trade for your $750 retail item, my upper is around 25% off what it would cost to build.  

Looking for cash since I really don't need anything, but will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested.  If wanting to trade, please be specific on what you are offering exactly, straight trade, trade +/- cash and how much, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I have other items listed for a bigger deal on something.  

Trades considered:

Top of list of list, AR-10(or nice upper / lower), Sig 556R 7.62x39 Gen 2 only, maybe the new converted U.S. Saiga AK-47 since they are $750.  I could use a quality stripped AR-10 lower, quality 1"" AR one piece scope mount with pic rails on the rings and 1-2 GG&G Ruger Mini 14/30 scope mounts.  Clean Ruger GP100 SS 6"" .357 mag and a SA XDS 9mm(post recall), the ""essentials"" package would be fine, since they are less than $400 new now.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice FCG etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs. 

Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed for $10 more."

This a genuine Mp5 clone made by Turner Fabrications. They've been making extremely high quality German build guns for a long time! This is by far the best MP5 clone on the market. The welding and detail in this gun is second to none. Excluding the actual HK mp5.

-NAVY SEF trigger group/housing (this MP5 shoots Semi-Auto ONLY tho)

-Has a ""Action 3"" bolt group with F style bolt carrier, this means it will fire F/A with a NFA Registered F/A Trigger pack. These bolt groups are banned from further importation and cost about $1,000, check hkparts.net to confirm for yourself. Couple this with a registered F/A Sear installed in a F/A pack and your ready to blast rounds. Obviously NFA Rules apply if you take this route, and it costs $$$.

45 Super is externally/dimensionally identical to 45 acp or 45 acp+P and is designed to be used in 45 acp semi auto pistols that have been fitted with stronger than normal recoil springs and a shock buffer, plus a couple other modifications. While you can shoot 45 SUPER out of some stock 45 acp+P pistols such as the Glock 21, HK USP or the full sized all steel 1911, you will batter your pistol if you do not have them modified to handle the extra pressure and slide velocity of the 45 Super.


To learn about the modifications your 45 acp pistol needs to reliably and safely fire 45 SUPER, contact Garey Hindman at REDACTED. Garey is the foremost authority on 45 Super modifications/conversions for your 45 acp and Garey performs such conversions for a living.


The below velocities were fired from my Colt Gold Cup Govt. Model (5 inch) that was converted by Garey.

1. Item # 45S185-----------1330 fps (185gr. Jhp)
2. Item # 45S200-----------1235 fps (200gr. Jhp)
3. Item # 45S230-----------1131 fps (230gr. Jhp)
4. Item # 45S230FMJ----1133 fps (230gr. FMJ-FLAT NOSE) 
5. Item # 45S255-----------1090 fps  (HARD CAST-FLAT NOSE)

 As always with Buffalo Bore Ammunition, we use real world firearms to give you real world data and results.

All our 45 Super ammunition is loaded with flash suppressed powders so that if you have to fire in low light (when the criminal element is out) you will not be blinded by your own gun fire at the worst possible moment.


All three of the JHP loads were designed for anti-personel use and for hunting small big game like deer. The two solid bullet loads were designed for breaking large bones like a bears shoulders or skull, but will work for anti-personel use as well if you need to shoot through cover like car doors or stick frame walls."

Factory Description:
Classic Lines, Classic Feel, Modern Features. The Ruger® New Model Blackhawk® is the most advanced single-action revolver ever made. While retaining the solid frame, feel and comfortable grip of the classic single-actions, they feature Ruger’s patented transfer bar ignition system with loading gate interlock, an all-coil spring mechanism, adjustable sights, and frame-mounted firing pin. New Model Blackhawk revolvers have earned a reputation as the best value on the market due to their durability and affordability.

Convertible models come equipped with an extra cylinder and are popular with shooters who appreciate the classic single-action revolver but opt for the versatility of being able to use more than one caliber in their handgun. With its interchangeable cylinder, Convertible models can be easily converted from one caliber to another without the use of tools. This versatility allows avid shooters of autoloading pistols to enjoy shooting a classic American single-action sidearm with their favorite pistol cartridge.

I don't have the box but  do have the rifle and scope manual.


 This rifle was produced in New Haven, Conn. and again is in as new condition.

You will not be disappointed and this is a beautiful Winchester firearm. Email for additional photos.
