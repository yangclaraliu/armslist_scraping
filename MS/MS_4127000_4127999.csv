A nice shooter or maybe a collector's piece, but just not me. I am certainly not the first shooter and the box was lost or thrown out long before it ever made it to me.

From what I can tell, this gun has NOT had the Ruger safety conversion but their CS did say that it would be no charge if I desired to send it in.

First $1,000 takes it!","Mckeesport, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","$ 1,000","Listed On: Wednesday, March 11, 2015",Handguns,Wilson Combat                                                                                ,no type,Single Action,no type,"Attention collectors - semi-auto VERY RARE and HTF copy of HK P7 pistol operating design, especially in this UNFIRED new condition! REMAINS IN PRE-RECALL STATUS AS IT DOES NOT HAVE THE ADDED FIRING PIN LOCK MACHINED INTO THE UNDERSIDE OF THE SLIDE. It was never sent back per the recall.

The pre-recall condition makes this much more collectible! See detailed info below.

The CP1 pistol was intended as a concealed carry weapon for Law Enforcement and civilian use. It has an unusual, streamlined design with a polymer frame and an even more unusual safety, located at the front of the trigger-guard.

In several reviews it was characterized as being a radically designed gun that looks like something straight out of a science fiction movie. These reviews also state that it has no sharp edges, and is about as ""snag-proof"" as any combat gun can ever be, and because of its design it is a surprisingly comfortable gun to shoot, which makes it feel very ergonomic.

NOTE: The CP1 uses a gas-delayed blowback action with a gas cylinder located below the fixed polygonal barrel. The trigger is a single action. Sound familiar? Knowledgeable and expert collectors will appreciate it as a description of the highly successful and famous HK P7 design! Only four pistols have been manufactured with these same characteristics as using the same operating design: HK P7 series, VEKTOR CP1, Wilson Combat ADP, and Steyr GB

A manual safety is located at the front of the trigger guard. To set on Safe, the button must be pressed rearward from the front; to set on Fire, the button must be pressed forward from inside the trigger guard.

The pistol is also fitted with an automated trigger safety. Magazines are double stack; 10 & 12-round magazines are flush fit with the bottom of the grip, 13-round magazines have extended finger rests at the bottom.

In October 2000 a recall notice was issued for the VEKTOR CP1, because a small percentage of them had issues with the internal safety mechanisms and, when dropped, could accidentally fire. The recall states that the loaded gun can discharge if bumped or dropped. Information accompanying recall notices stated that the gun should not be loaded under any circumstances; although some firearms experts and enthusiasts may deem such recall as unnecessary for the mentioned defect, Denel probably took such steps to prevent any accident that may result in a lawsuit, as the primary export market of the VEKTOR CP1 pistol were the United States.

This recall ended promising sales in the USA, and terminated the life of this pistol on the market, although most of the CP1 pistols turned in from South African customers were indeed fixed and returned to their owners; inability to fix and return the defective pistols from foreign markets was probably the reason behind VEKTOR's decision to pay $500 to anyone who turned in their gun, and to put the CP1 pistol out of production in 2001.

It is estimated that approximately 2000 of the guns were sold in the United States prior to the recall. Most of that number were turned in, and the guns are now very rare in the United States. They are available in very limited numbers in South Africa and other countries.

Fairfax, Va. – The National Rifle Association (NRA) was instrumental in stalling the Obama Administration’s initial attempt to ban commonly used ammunition for the most popular rifle in America, the AR-15. The announcement that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) will suspend its proposed framework to ban M855 ammunition validates the NRA’s assertion that this effort was nothing more than a political maneuver to bypass Congress and impose gun control on the American people."

Great price for a quality semi-auto!

This is a beautiful and light 12 Gauge.  The action is the same as the famous Browning Auto-5, but it's light like a Franchi.

These were made in Japan along side Browning and you seldom see these anymore.

Has a 26"" barrel with a Skeet choke...perfect for upland bird or rabbit hunting, and of course, skeet shooting.  2-3/4"" shells. On the left side, also has the magazine cutoff switch like an Auto-5.

The receiver has beautiful game patterns on both sides.

I would rate the condition of the metal at say 90-95%, and the wood at say 85-90% with a very few scratches, and one small dent in stock.  Beautiful wood.

FTF in the Allendale area (West of Grand Rapids).

NO TRADES PLEASE.

Only been shot a few times...maybe 10 or so. It is very accurate at around 20 feet. I had about a 3 inch group right in the middle of the target with one in the center. It features a double action only trigger that is pretty easy to get the hang of. The pull is a little bit longer than a Glock but very smooth. The laser, when regulated with the sights is right on target and the bullet goes exactly where you see the dot..which is, of course, as it should be. It also comes with a very nice ""tacky feel"" pocket holster as well as the box and paperwork. The tackiness on the outside of the holster keeps it in your pocket when you draw the pistol. The Crimson Trace laser is an awesome sight and this one was nearly 200.00 on top of the price of the pistol. I will only sell to people that are legally able to own a pistol and I prefer handgun permit holders. This is an awesome carry gun for those that have their permits, it is light and a very natural pointer. The white out on the side of the slide is covering the serial number. Thanks and if any ?'s please let me know. God bless!"

These guns run $700-$950 on gunbroker.com magazines run $30-$40.

Rugged polymer fire-control housing and ergonomic polymer grip make exceptional durability a foregone conclusion. Full-strength hammer spring delivers consistent primer ignition.

The MIL, Inc. Thunder 5 is a large, double-action revolver chambered in the .410-bore shotshell cartridge. It is also designed to fire the .45 Colt revolver cartridge. It is similar to a Taurus Judge, but is not a copy of the gun, as the Thunder 5 predates the Judge by a decade

The Thunder 5 is a considerably large revolver, especially for a snub nose; at nine inches in length. As the barrel is rifled, the Thunder 5 is not considered a short-barrelled shotgun under United States federal law, but is under California statutes.

I bet some of you thought that the Taurus Judge revolver was an earth-shattering innovation when you first saw it. I mean who couldn’t love a five-shot revolver that could hurl either .410 shotgun shells or .45 Long Colt as fast as you could pull the trigger? Well, the thing is the Judge wasn’t first. The MIL Thunder 5 beat it by more than a decade. The Thunder Five is heaver, more well made and is Awesome!

But good luck finding one now.

Who was MIL Anyway?  MIL popped up in 1991 in Piney Flats, TN and made one product, the Thunder 5 revolver. Unlike almost every other firearms company in US history, it’s hard to dig into just who this company was. Manuals for the Thunder 5 are listed as being distributed by Dragun Enterprises with a Murfreesboro PO Box address.

This has never been actually fired and will become a highly valued collector’s item, in the near future.

It is a much better made firearm than the Taurus Judge and in addition to being a wonderful collector’s item it is an awesome home defense weapon. The ultimate sawed off shotgun.  One shot of 410 buckshot and your home invader will be history."

ZEV Fulcrum is the best on the market and currently holds several world records. The Adjustable Fulcrum Trigger Drop-In Kit gives you everything you need to upgrade your trigger performance to shoot like the pros.One of the first things a GLOCK owner should consider is upgrading the stock trigger. ZEV builds the best triggers in the business and ZEV’s Adjustable Fulcrum Drop-In Trigger Kit was used to set multiple world records. The Adjustable Fulcrum Drop-In Trigger Kit only requires one tool (a standard 3/32nd punch), and 15 minutes of your time.  You will immediately notice the difference in your gun’s performance after installation:  • The trigger face is flatter and the trigger safety is three times wider than a stock trigger; this is ideal for quickly placing your finger in the optimal firing position. This will help build proper muscle memory for improved consistency and accuracy.  • Because of ZEV’s proprietary trigger bar refinements the trigger operates smoothly through the entire length of pull.  • The trigger’s crisp tactile reset gives the user a clear feeling for the moment of reset. This feedback improves the user’s ability to “ride the reset” to improve follow up shot speed and placement.  • The trigger weight can be adjusted to as low as 3 lbs. A lighter pull weight requires less pressure, reducing trigger fatigue and improving accuracy. • The pre-travel and over-travel are adjustable to allow for a shorter pull, crisper break and faster reset.  • Trigger adjustments will give the benefit of shorter take up, post break travel and will result in a shorter reset.

These will no longer be manufactured by Remington and once it is gone, it is gone for good so come on down and pick it up while you can for only $699!Remington is proud to announce the Model 700 SPS (Special Purpose Synthetic) Tactical 300 Blackout rifle. Chambered for the incredibly popular 300 AAC® Blackout®, this new rifle features the time-proven Model 700 action and is designed to impress from the bench or in the field at a very affordable price. A long-time favorite of both military and police units, the Model 700 offers the legendary accuracy and unfailing performance you’ve come to expect.
At the core of the Model 700 SPS Tactical 300 Blackout is the machined solid-steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design ensuring uniformity, strength and solid bedding area. Unique to this precision rifle is the 16 ½ -inch, heavy-contour clean barrel threaded to accept AAC and all 5/8 x 24 threaded flash hiders, muzzle breaks and suppressors. The tactical-style carbon steel, hammer-forged barrel is the perfect balance between handling in tight spots and delivering pinpoint accuracy. With a twist rate of one in seven inches, this rifle is optimized for accuracy. These specialty, bolt-action rifles are shipped with a thread protector installed.
The rock-solid barreled action is bedded in a Hogue® OverMolded® Ghillie™ Green pillar bedded, synthetic stock with a semi-beavertail fore-end for added stability. The soft-touch, sure-grip stock is extremely comfortable for extended, long range shooting and assures a positive grip in both stressful situations and inclement weather. The dual point pillar bedding guarantees a solid interface between the action and stock to help insure cold bore accuracy and prevent point-of-impact shifts. Add Remington’s X-Mark Pro® externally adjustable trigger, designed to “break-like-glass” and set at 3 ½ pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical-like accuracy.
Other key features include a drilled and tapped receiver for the addition of optics; distinctive, laser-engraved “300 AAC Blackout 1:7” roll mark; convenient hinged floorplate magazine with 4-round capacity and a non-reflective, black oxide external metal finish; and sling swivel studs.
The Model 700 SPS Tactical 300 Blackout is the perfect tactical bolt-action rifle and available at a very affordable price. Suggested retail price is $817.31.PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS A DISCONTINUED FIREARM, AND WILL NO LONGER BE OFFERED BY REMINGTON. ALSO, THIS FIREARM FEATURES A 5R TYPE BARREL, SIMILIAR TO THE BARREL TYPE USED BY THE US MARINE CORP FOR THE M40 SNIPER RIFLE.

These will no longer be manufactured by Remington and once it is gone, it is gone for good so come on down and pick it up while you can for only $699!Remington is proud to announce the Model 700 SPS (Special Purpose Synthetic) Tactical 300 Blackout rifle. Chambered for the incredibly popular 300 AAC® Blackout®, this new rifle features the time-proven Model 700 action and is designed to impress from the bench or in the field at a very affordable price. A long-time favorite of both military and police units, the Model 700 offers the legendary accuracy and unfailing performance you’ve come to expect.

At the core of the Model 700 SPS Tactical 300 Blackout is the machined solid-steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design ensuring uniformity, strength and solid bedding area. Unique to this precision rifle is the 16 ½ -inch, heavy-contour clean barrel threaded to accept AAC and all 5/8 x 24 threaded flash hiders, muzzle breaks and suppressors. The tactical-style carbon steel, hammer-forged barrel is the perfect balance between handling in tight spots and delivering pinpoint accuracy. With a twist rate of one in seven inches, this rifle is optimized for accuracy. These specialty, bolt-action rifles are shipped with a thread protector installed.The rock-solid barreled action is bedded in a Hogue® OverMolded® Ghillie™ Green pillar bedded, synthetic stock with a semi-beavertail fore-end for added stability. The soft-touch, sure-grip stock is extremely comfortable for extended, long range shooting and assures a positive grip in both stressful situations and inclement weather. The dual point pillar bedding guarantees a solid interface between the action and stock to help insure cold bore accuracy and prevent point-of-impact shifts. Add Remington’s X-Mark Pro® externally adjustable trigger, designed to “break-like-glass” and set at 3 ½ pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical-like accuracy.
Other key features include a drilled and tapped receiver for the addition of optics; distinctive, laser-engraved “300 AAC Blackout 1:7” roll mark; convenient hinged floorplate magazine with 4-round capacity and a non-reflective, black oxide external metal finish; and sling swivel studs.
The Model 700 SPS Tactical 300 Blackout is the perfect tactical bolt-action rifle and available at a very affordable price.

Purchased New in December 2014, I am unfortunately about 20 days too late to return it for a refund. It has only been mounted to one rifle and only removed to take the pictures you see here. It was purchased from an Aimpoint authorized dealer. Comes with all original paperwork and I even have the shipping label/receipt to show you this actually a genuine Aimpoint optic with matching serial numbers to the label, box and unit. 

If you check around town you'll find these selling new for $650.00 plus tax. If you check ebay, the price on these can be as extreme as $900.00 new (which is ridiculous) to $400.00 (though usually listed as ""reserve not met"").However, most of the ebay sub-$400 optics have a no-return policy, so if you spend $400 on a $50.00 air soft optic your up shit creek, etc... That's why I feel that 550.00 is fair. You can actually put your hands on, and eyes through, my optic and take in all the evidence in person that this a genuine Aimpoint and not some Chinese knock-off. 

Specs:

Internal voltage regulator allows the CompM4 to be used with any AA size battery
Seven night vision compatible settings and 9 daylight settings
QRP2 mount has twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and the mounting knob is wider and shorter to improve operation, and lessen the chance of becoming snagged on other gear
Mount base is ""keyed"" into to the body of the sight to absorb recoil
Mount base screws directly into the sight - no separate sight ring is required
2 MOA dot for close combat and long distance engagement
Matches perfectly with Aimpoint 3XMag, (magnifier module)
Unequalled light transmission
Submersible to 150 feet (45 meters)
Vertical spacer included
Standardized as the US Army's new M68CCO
Improved adjustment caps are easier to remove, and are protected against impact
Dimensions (in inches): 5.3 (l) x 3 (w) x 2.8 (h)
Weight: 9.3 oz sight only, 11.8 oz with integrated mount
Includes bikini style lens cover and removable ARD.

I am a reasonable man, so I will entertain reasonable offers. NO TRADES. NO TRADES. NO TRADES. I need cash to put towards other projects. No low ball offers either, I don't need to sell this optic, I just want to put the money into different things. 

Thanks for looking. And have a great lunch.

1937 Tula with round receiver. Comes with 10 stripper clips, a shoulder strap, and a rubber butt plate.  Have the original metal plate as well along with the bayonet, oiling can, multi-tool and other bits of cleaning hardware.  All the numbers match.   I stripped all the cosmoline out but when I have shot it some cosmoline rises to the surface around the barrel.  Bore looks very good.

Stripped finish off and applied 10 coats of boiled linseed oil.  Looks great.  Includes 390 rounds of Bulgarian 7.64x54r, still in spam can.

Gun shoots great and is lots of fun but I am a lefty and the bolt being on the other side is more annoying than I thought it would be.  Not deluded as to value of the rifle, just looking to recoup some of my investment.  If you would like a nice, cosmoline-free Mosin and a bunch of ammo, this is the one for you.

I am mainly interested in cash but will consider a trade for a basic home-defense pistol (38 revolver, 9 mm semi-auto, etc.). 

I can meet at any shop in Simi/San Fernando Valley/Burbank you like.  You pay transfer fees (no, I will not sell it private-party, sorry).  Thanks for looking."

It was re-arsenaled by the soviets but the fit and finish is actually very nice for a soviet pick up. Almost better than most original p-38's I've seen. It is a Mauser slide on a Speerwerke frame and there are many nice crisp markings all over the pistol. When I bought I was told there were no import markings but low and behold I did find them but they very well hidden on inside of the frame. Only visible when slide is pulled back. It will also come with a war time magazine and a post war marked Walther magazine. I am also including a very good reproduction holster. There are not very very many actual ww2 issued p-38s floating around on the open market anymore (plenty of post war and p-1's though). I know this is not a high end collectors peice but this is definitely a nice start to a collection pistols that are starting to get more and more rare. I will answer any questions to the best of my ability.

Ultra light and extremely compact, Taurus small frame semi-automatic pistols offer security and reliability you can count on. The .22 LR pistols feature a blowback action and tip-up barrel for safety and convenience during loading and chambering the first round Each model utilizes low profile fixed sights and is made in the USA.
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

are well back behind the trigger, near the butt of the stock, and it has 
a 20-inch barrel. It features a polymer stock with a pistol-style grip 
and large thumb-hole, which comes with expansion plates to allow for 
some adjustment to the length of pull. There is an AR-style carrying 
handle with a slide-up rear notch sight and a front assembly with a post 
sight. It’s also equipped with three Weaver rails on the gun to 
accommodate optics, lights, lasers, different grips and even a bipod, if 
you want. In addition to the feeding position for a magazine in the 
stock there is room for storing an additional 10-round magazines. It is 
in very good condition with a topnotch fit and finish, as you would 
expect from Walther. The ergonomics of the gun are good. The gun weighs 
95 ounces, or just under six pounds, which isn’t too heavy to lug around 
while still being able to suck up recoil completely. Not even the most 
recoil-sensitive shooter should have a problem with it. It is less than 
30 inches long, so would pack and store easily almost anywhere. Hard to 
find O.D. Green finish. 
Converts from left/right handed in just a few minutes. 
Comes with original hard case, owners manual, tools and 
converting parts, and 2-10rd magazines."

The 870 Express is a rugged, value-priced workhorse, making it one of the most useful tools that an outdoorsman can own. The Super Mag has a 3-1/2"" chamber to handle heavy turkey and waterfowl loads that reach out to knock birds down at maximum shotgun range; it also functions with 2-3/4"" and 3"" shotgun shells, making it an extremely versatile firearm. At the heart of the ultra reliable 870 Remington is a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength, and twin action bars that prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action. 870 pump shotguns have great pointing characteristics—they come to the shooter's shoulder and acquire targets instinctively, and swing fluidly on fast flying birds. The Remington Model 870 Express Pump-Action Shotgun comes with a non-reflective finished hardwood stock and fore-end, and a matte black, bead-blasted finish on the receiver and barrel. The barrel has a vent rib and a bead sight, and uses standard Rem™ Choke screw-in choke tubes (comes with 1 modified tube). A premium vented recoil pad dampens recoil and helps shooter to stay on target for faster follow up shots. A myriad of aftermarket Remington 870 accessories enables owners to customize the 870 Express for specific purposes.

Action is smooth as can be and feels nicer than a lot of milled receiver aks I've handled. Has a nice even durable parkerized finish and is much nicer quality than most of the newer ones built after all the nice Yugo kits dried up. Has bayonet and with include 2 30rd mags.
