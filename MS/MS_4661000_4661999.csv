Have a nice case hardened frame factory engraved vaquero. The gun is not new it has been shot faint ring on cylinder. Bought it on a whim a couple months back strictly on looks. This is a beauty but I'm trying to consolidate on my ammo. I bought it and put it in the safe and have never shot it I don't even have any ammo for it so it's time to go. It comes with the gun and vaquero box and paperwork. It's the right kind of box just not numbered to the gun. Looking for a local deal near me
The gun is beautiful I can't get a good angle to get a good pic from its hard to photograph.

He told me how his grandfather brought back a pistol with a holster that it would fit in (a mismatch). This pistol does not have any import marks on it at all so this leads me to believe that this could very well be a bringback. This comes with a holster but it's not the holster that was made for it. That's where a VERY cool surprise comes in! The holster itself was made for the CZ-27 and it's Waffen marked! I just looked it up online and the holster itself is going for 100.00 and up with the markings on it. Holster has some wear but is overall good condition."

This is made of carbon fiber and weighs just about half of what the lightest aluminum handguard does. Additionally, it uses your existing barrel nut so there is no need to disassemble your upper unless you have a front sight/gas block assembly, it does require a low profile gas block. This is the matte black version. Also included are 2 short and one medium length rails that can be added most anywhere on the handguard.

""Troy’s Revolution Rail maintains all of the properties customers love about the Troy Alpha Rail but is constructed of carbon fiber for an even lighter and stronger option. The Troy Revolution Rail attaches quickly and easily to a standard AR. The construction allows the rail to run cool, even after extended firing.

The tactical scope is very easy to use and has extra features that aren't on normal scopes. The scope can easily be removed for use of the iron sights. On the scope there is the regular zoom (3-9) but there is also an additional zoom on the front of the scope that allows for comfortable shooting optics under 100 yards. The brand on the scope is UTG. I bought 40 rounds when I got the gun and obviously never had a chance to use them.... they are included."

Gun was only shot once by my wife and is in new condition with original box and 1 magazine. I live on Fort Hood but can meet near the killeen area. Price is $315. Must be willing to sign bill of sale and provide TX ID or CHL.

The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.

The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.

Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement."

The USP compact in 357 sig is by special order only. It's a rare firearm. Low round count (less than 500), excellent condition

Info from HK website

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life

	Hey all, 
	I have for trade or sale a awesome little entry Level AR. I got this as a compact option that would shoot my reloads for my longer range AR great (same rate of twist, chambering, and maker) but something has come up so I really need to sell or trade it off for something else. This is currently unfired and is ready to make someone a great little rifle. This has a Stainless 16 inch barrel in 223 Wylde with a 1:8 twist and A2 Flash hider. It is based on an Anderson Lower and has dust cover, shell deflector, and forward assist. It has a free floated Aluminum quad rail and a 6 position mil spec Blackhawk stock. It also has an insert in the frame to take up the slop and makes it feel much more solid than most out there. It will also come with a  set of flip up polymer sights and a Magpul Windowed Pmag and the ladder covers you can see in the pictures. For any specifics please shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet in Norman on this if possible. 
	I would also consider trades, but mainly need cash so most trades would need cash on your end (unless it is something i really am interested in). I would consider trades towards 1894C in 357 magnum, Henry Lever Action in 357 Magnum, SP101s, Security Sixs, GP100s, M1 Carbines, Glock 17 with Threaded Barrel, XDM 9mm with threaded barrel, Under-folder AK, etc. Honestly, just shoot me a message and we can go from there. Like i said, most trades that I am interested in will need cash on your end, but if it is something I’m heavily interested in I may consider straight trades or even add extras on my end. I also have a  fair amount of 50r Poly tip 223 ammo if you would like to purchase some as well. 
Thanks for looking,

After market stereo head, two 10"" Boss Subs and a 2000w Boss Amp in custom box also included. Also has a $1200 professionally done exhaust and sounds very nice. Car starts right up but has one problem. It won't engage in any gear therefore it starts right up but will only rev.The issue is the clutch and slave cylinder. I did some price checking and unless you want high end parts or performance parts then all parts can be purchased for less then $200. I just don't have the time or money right now to deal with it. I live in Jeffersonville, IN however the car is garaged at my fathers in Ingalls. If interested would need to be picked up or towed by you from that location. Has only had this issue about a month and it's been garaged and started at least once a week since. Has clean Indiana Title and everything else works and is good.

Of course it is so nice, that a collector might not want to use it as Browning quit making this model in 1997 I believe. The date code on this is PR prefix which means it was made in 1987 which was the first year that the Light Twenty were the Auto-5 Light 20 Miroku. The Invector Chokes didn't become standard until 1993, so this was pretty much a first production, loaded shotgun after a layoff from production.

Browning A-5 Light Twenty with the Invector Choke system and vented rib barrel. Comes with three chokes and the tool. You can also easily adjust this shotgun for light or heavy loads depending where you put the ""Friction Ring"". Very simple and the instruction manual has pictures.

I've looked this shotgun over trying to find flaws and it is near impossible. The blueing is flawless, cant find a chip or speck or scratch. The stocks are near perfect, showing a couple very light handling marks. They won't show up in pictures.

The bolt and loading port don't even have use marks. This was someone's baby and didn't get used much if at all. It even had the sticker on the end that I removed and put on the invector choke manual because I didn't like the look of a sticker on such bright and shiny blueing. Gun looks way better in person. 

It has the 28"" barrel and weights right at 7 pounds. I have the 34th edition Blue Book of guns and this at $1225 in 98%, $975 at 95% and $900 at 90%. I'm no expert, but the BB I have shows example pictures of their grading on guns and just happen to have an A-5 as their pic for a 95% gun. This one is definitely nicer than their pic and explanation. I won't ask the suggested price of 98% even though it is that nice. I can take pictures of any part of the shotgun. Closeups, whatever is wanted.

Note: I got curous and broke it down and took pics of the tube, inside the forestock and the third pic below shows the face of the bolt and firing pin. This is the most perfect auto shotgun internals I've ever seen.

$950. Inspection is encouraged as I would hope anyone buying this nice of Browning would be as picky as I would.

Les is a former Marine EOD tech and as such is both entirely practical and a perfectionist when it comes to a simple easy-to-carry hard use tool such as this little blade.

There are a lot of ways to build a fixed blade knife.  This is one of my favorite design theories….nothing which is not a hard-use tool and knife.  

3V steel is the schoolyard bully of steels. It is tough.  Abusive.  Can dish out punishment AND take it all day long.  It sharps up VERY well, cleans up nicely and holds an edge WHILE being beaten on all day long.

This little knife was designed with ease of carry and durable use in mind. It has a 3” blade and is 7 ¾ inches overall.  The G10 scales offer an excellent grip while at the same time they do not alter the minimal profile of the knife.  

If you were looking for an excellent hard-use tool for either your BOB, an urban E&E kit or just something to keep in the car or your briefcase for the worst case scenario, you’ve found it.

I am selling this knife for $190, cash, local pickup.

If you want this knife, hurry up and email me before I change my mind and keep it.

This pistol is the model with the thumb safety and is in excellent condition throughout. It's been shot very little and is still very tight. The previous owner didn't like the standard trigger and upgraded the trigger to an Apex. If you've ever shot a Shield you'll appreciate the difference that the Apex trigger makes on it. It comes with two magazines (one 6 round and one 7 round with finger extension), and since I don't like the cheap cardboard boxes the factory sends them out in I invested in a S&W branded soft case that goes with it. I still have the original box and the old trigger as well if you want to go full stock. My intention was to use this as a concealed carry gun but my priorities have changed. A new Shield without the upgraded trigger and the soft case will run you just under $340, not including tax. Why spend that kind of money when you can have this one with an uprgraded trigger and a new soft case for $325?

Colt:
I'm looking for a Colt that's fully functional. I don't mind wear on the grips, a few small scratches here and there, or missing blueing. .32 or .380, I'm indifferent. Rifling must be good (doesn't have to be sharp/crisp).

Gunbroker has some up for auction.

Like all North American Arms Mini-Revolvers they are covered by a lifetime warranty against defects in material, workmanship and repairs as long as you pay for the parts used or labor. 

I sent it in for a new cylinder bolt and it came back with the new cylinder bolt and a upgraded notched cylinder without any charges to me for the parts or labor.

I have had this pistol for for over 10 years and have only used it at the range and in my back yard shooting skunks and troublesome squirrels. It is still in like new condition. Comes with 25 rounds of ammo to get you started, more ammo available on Gunbroker at a fair price with fair shipping fees.

This little pistol could save your life, it will not show in your pocket and it is vary easy to find. 
The most vulnerable place can be in backing one out on the toilet, here is one place this little pistol will save your live as well as other places especially at night when you are alone.

To buy this pistol with ammo please send an email and I will meet you in a busy shopping area. 

If you buy this pistol online you will still have to pay the shipping fee before it is shipped and a transfer fee ounce it arrives, if you buy my pistol all you will only pay a total of $17.00 for all fees, $10 transfer and a $7 background fee = $17.

As with every North American Arms Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder in between chambers, (See picture number two for the notches, you will also notice the firing pin which rests in the notch) the hammers firing pin may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge.

It also has a second safety with the hammer puled back to the first click, (see picture number one) this keeps the hammer away from the cartridge. 
Both are good safety's but the rest in the notch is the best to use, this safety will insure any chance of an accidental discharge even if it is dropped on a rock or a hard surface.

Thank you for viewing my listing."
