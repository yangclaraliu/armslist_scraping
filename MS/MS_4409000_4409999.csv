So much fun to shoot, monstrous in size, but light weight. Comes with one 30 round magazine. The 20-rounder pictured has a broken feed lip, but you're welcome to have it if you want to try and send it in. Threaded 1/2 x 28 tpi. The flashhider on it is a bit thin, and was mounted on with an o-ring, and a roll pin. I swapped it out for a suppressor, or an actual compensator, and lost the roll pin. If you want the factory flashhider, ACE hardware has all manner or roll pins for $1.00 each, but I would recommend a real comp. Lowest price I could find on gunbroker was $339 (plus $35 ground shipping, transfer $10-50, and background $10), so I'll match that base price. It's had a few hundred rounds through it, mostly suppressed, but it eats everything I have ammowise. Firm on the price. Funding a graduation present for my youngest nephew. If I can't sell it, then it may become the graduation present itself.

Mike's Pocket Holster and a container of .22 LR Ammunition.  The gun shoots great and exceptionally accurate. There is one small issue with a missing spring-  2 GUNSMITHS SAID ITS THR ""SAFETY DETENT SPRING"", IT WOULD BE AN EASY AND CHEAP FIX OR TAURUS WILL FOX IT FOR FREE AND TEST IT TO BE SURE ITS AS GOOD AS NEW THEN RETURN IT.The gun s covered by Taurus's No Hassle Warranty Forever no matter who owns it. All you have to do is call them and tell them the safety spring flew out while attempting to clean it after a little bit of shooting (that's the truth) and that you need them to send you a prepaid shipping label so you can return it for warranty repair, it is literally that simple. I had an issue once with a Taurus pistol and called them and told them the same thing and it was fixed and back to me within a few weeks And was better than new. They are super easy to deal with and it is no problem at all. I would prefer the new owner take care of it bit i can call Taurus  if necessary. I WILL SELL/TRADE THE GUN FOR A SCOPE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE OR TRADE FOR THE OTHER ITEMS MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING. OF THIS AD. SEE OTHER ITEMS BELOW PLEASE!!!

***I have several new Glock 21 13 Round Magazines & Several Glock 30 10 Round Mahazines & GLOCK 30 Standard 10 Round Magazines plus the much harder to find and easier to conceal 9 Round Flush Mount Magazines that fit G30/SF/30S/Hen3/Gen4 Pistols. I have X-Grip Adapters to allow the use of Full Size Glock 21 .45 ACP Pistols in the Compact Glock 30 .45 ACP Pistols.
*I have X-Grip Adapters that fit all 9mm/10mm/.40 S&W/.45 ACP/357 Sig Sub-Compact Pistols allowing you to carry a Full Size Magazine in your Subcompacts Pistol - For Example you can use the adapter to carry a 17 Round Glock 17 Magazine in your Glock 26 Pistol which normally only has a 10 Round Capacity, plus the Larger Clip with X-Grip adapter allows you to get a better grip on the gun for much better Accuracy & Control. Plus it looks as if it were made that way. I use the adapters daily in my carry gun because I prefer the ability to grip my Glock 30 (.45) with a full 2 handed grip & the extra Ammo capacity- who wouldn't want a better grip & more ammo in the gun- and if you want to have the smaller size back just pop out the larger clip and use the stock clip. These Adapters are the best I've found & they have no negative effects and require no modifications or tools, all of my guns function perfect with the adapters and it's honestly like having 2 Guns in 1 since you can have a Full Size Gun & Grip by simply changing the Clip or go back to Sub-Compact mode by using the smaller stock clip.
 I have 3 Magazines for .45 ACP Pistols and a World War 2 Era U.S. Army Issue Dual Magazine Pouch- 
*1 Magazine is a WW2 Military Issue 7rd Magazine for Normal Size 1911's
* 2 of the Magazines are like new 6 Round Magazines made by DoubleStar- these are very high quality magazines and very hard to find- these are made to fit Compact 1911's that are the size of a Kimber Ultra Carry/Compact Model or any Similar Compact/Sub-Compact 1911 Pistol that carries the smaller/compact Magazine.   and of course they fit the rare,  super high quality DoubleStar Compact .45 ACP Pistols. I do believe these are new, unused magazines,  tgey are really nice and very well made - one is a Glossy Black Color and the other is like Chrome or something similar. 
*Also included is US Military Issue Dual Magazine Pouch

Finished in a matte black chrome the SPS Pantera is an attention-getter on the range for looks and for accuracy. The fully-adjustable Bomar-type rear sight and fiber optic dovetailed front sight make sighting in second nature. The Pantera is perfectly balanced in the hand for quick and repeatable target acquisition and shot-after-shot accuracy.

I am looking to trade this gun or sell it for cash.  This gun was $1,745 new.  They sell for $1,400 with 3000+ rounds thru them. I have ONE magazine thru this gun.  Comes with original case, 3 mags, and a tactical Wilson Combat carry bag.

Trades on used guns need to be near my value.  Cash, make me an offer I cant refuse."

Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.

By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore grips, the AFG-2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

From Aimpoint.com:

""No matter what your mission, the size and weight of your equipment is a critical factor. With the Aimpoint Micro T-1 2 MOA LRP, they have introduced an aiming system that provides the performance of their full-sized sights in the smallest package possible.

Built to offer the same battle proven ruggedness as other Aimpoint products, the Micro T-1 is able to perform under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon. Suitable for use on Rifles, Carbines, Shotguns, Sub Machine Guns and Handguns, the Aimpoint Micro T-1 is ideal as a stand-alone sight, and because it weighs less than 4 ounces including the integrated picatinny mount, it can easily be ""piggybacked"" on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics.

The performance of the Micro T-1 Red Dot Sight is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is especially suited for 3rd generation night vision technology.

 Master Mineral Solution - Why has this Product Become so Popular?

 This amazingly powerful compound, commonly known as the Miracle Mineral Supplement or MMS, has been very prominent in the alternative medicinal arena for close to a decade. The reason it has stood the test of time is because it works - & works well! The man who is responsible for its discovery & bringing it into the mainstream is Jim Humble.

 Who is this man Jim Humble?...

 It all begun back in the mid 1990's whilst Jim was on a mining expedition deep within the jungle's of the South Americas. When one of his party was suddenly struck down by the Malaria parasite, Jim struck upon a amazing discovery - a revelation that has since altered the lives of many! Learn more...

 What did Mr. Humble discover? Chlorine Dioxide Molecule

 Upon returning to the States, Jim began testing in earnest - & what he found was that the active component within his simple water purification formulation formula was absolutely deadly against the Malaria parasite - the very same parasite that is responsible for millions of deaths each & every year. Needless to say, this warranted further investigation! Learn more...
 As time progressed, it was becoming increasingly clear that the chlorine dioxide molecule was not only deadly against the malaria parasite, but also a wide range of fungi, bacteria, cancers & parasites - interestingly enough viruses as well!

 Unfortunately, there is an ever increasing push from various regulatory bodies the world over that are attempting to shut down this product - so the question is how long will this amazingly effective compound will remain available, this is the question.

Ruger GP100 Match Champion is Ruger's entry for a competition revolver. It has much better sights, stocks, and trigger work from the factory. Trigger is light-years better than a factory GP100. 

Sights are Novak fiber optic (green). 

I bought this gun with the idea that I would shoot IDPA revolver with it in the summer and kill deer with it in the winter, but I am going to focus on a semi auto competition division and this gun is not getting the love it deserves. Just shot it yesterday at the range to confirm everything and was easily putting a full cylinder into an 8"" steel plate at 50 yards. Hammer has been bobbed but replacements are available from Ruger. 

I have Safariland speed loaders and carries available for additional cost. Just grab your preferred GP100 holster and you're ready for IDPA or IPSC.

Blue and orange smoke signal 26.5mm rounds are also available as seen in the new movie MAD MAX FURY ROAD. Any person can own and carry concealed a flare pistol without a permit in all the states of the U.S.A. because it is a signaling safety product. I have for sale is a German 26.5mm all-steel flare pistol. This flare pistol was made in Germany and was imported into the US in fairly-limited quantities in the early 2000s. This is when many retailers sold them inexpensively. However, today they are nearly impossible to find. In my opinion this German flare pistol is the highest quality, strongest and most interesting of all of these type pistols brought to the U.S.A. during the last 20 years. Many feel that the HK is a better pistol, however unlike this German flare pistol , the only steel part on the HK is the barrel, as the entire frame is plastic. The lighter HK also have a very strong recoil that is painful to fire with .45 caliber barrel inserts. This German flare pistol is in very good surplus condition and made of heavier steel. That's what keeps the recoil down. There is no license needed to buy or own this flare pistol! 26.5mm to .410/.45 Long Colt adapters allow 2.5"" & 3"" .410 shotgun ammo or .45LC ammo to be safely fired. There are also .22 MAGNUM, 9mm, .40 and .45acp adapters available. The 26.5mm to .22LR insert is for the most inexpensive use. The 26.5mm to 12 gauge adapter allows the less expensive 12-gauge flares to be fired. Optional front brass bead sight, green fiber light sight, one synthetic nylon front/rear sight with bottom tactical rail and recoil pad are available at an extra costs. *Note: One FREE insert is sent with pistol. The other insert adapters are not included with the sale of this flare pistol. I have photos of these adapters to show what this flare pistol is capable of firing. I sell this flare pistol with one FREE 12 gauge flare barrel insert and your choice of extra OPTIONAL barrel inserts. Original German holster I offer is $25 dollars. One of my photos in this ad shows an optional sight base attachment assembly with tactical flashlight. The tactical flashlight is available on Amazon's website. I sell the optional sight base attachment assembly for $95 dollars.

This gun is still available in the described condition, but it's also being rebuilt. I'm modifying and refinishing the original stock. Both stocks will be included in the sale. No changes are being made to the action, and it will drop into either stock with maybe 3 minutes' work. This will give the buyer the option of having it set up as a bench-type rifle, as pictured, or more of a mountain carbine style. I will have photos available of the new stock once completed.

---Back to Original Description---
Based on a Tula Mosin Nagant action, but there's very little of the original gun that wasn't replaced, upgraded, or reworked. Check the photos for a better idea.
I built this to look rustic or distressed, but it's very solid, no junk.

It's chambered in 7.52x54r , and I'm including roughly 100 rounds of 147gr steel core Silver Tip.

The barrel was reprofiled, shortened to 20.25"", and threaded 14mm LH, the same as an AK.
The muzzle brake is VERY effective at reducing recoil, and makes a heck of a blast when you fire it. It also has those wicked sharp points for use as a close-in 'deterrent'.

All the metal has been Duracoated in OD Green and Desert Brown, with black accents.

The thumbhole stock was hand carved, epoxy-bedded, then coated in a rubberized sealant that kinda feels similar to truck bed liner material, but is thinner and less 'tacky' to the touch.
Over top of that, is a light coat of a softer, more velvety coating, that was then partially removed to give the weathered look.
You can pretty easily remove the top coat if you prefer the grippier surface.
The butt pad is thicker than most, and really cuts down the felt recoil.
Between the pad and the muzzle break, I'd say the recoil is about twice that of a 5.56, which isn't much!

The scope mount is custom machined from a solid billet of aluminum, and is mounted in a scout (forward) configuration.
Since the photos were taken, the mount was painted black black, to eliminate glare around the viewing area.
I have a cheap red dot type sight on there now, since I was setting this up for close range work, under 75 yards. You could easily mount a long eye relief (LER) or 'scout' scope, if you prefer a magnified optic.

All the internal bolt components and bearing surfaces have been polished and Duracoated. They will wear through to bare metal only where actual contact occurs. This offers the best corrosion protection, while making it look and function its best.
The bolt handle was forged from a single piece of steel into a ""spoon""-type profile, threaded, then epoxied into the bolt body. This flat profile makes it easier to open and close the action, especially while keeping the sight picture.

There aren't many truly unique guns available these days, so here's your chance to own a real one of a kind. Since I did the work myself, and fabricated several of the parts, I can say with confidence that there is not another one like this on the planet.

More photos available for serious buyers, not really looking for trades, but I would consider a decent full size (5"") 1911 in 45acp. Something like a Rock Island Tactical or similar."

I acquired this gun and it had some surface rust, and some shallow pitted areas. The gun seems to have been shot very little, but had been neglected with how it was stored.

Complete dis-assembly.
Complete ultrasonic cleaning off all metal parts.
Media blast of some parts with 50/50 mixture of 120 grit aluminum oxide and glass bead to produce a deep satin finish.
Hot tank black oxide finish (note: some internal parts were in factory condition and were not refinished).

It is NOT a CMP rifle.  It was sent over to Italy, reassembled there and then sent to Denmark until the 60's.  Because it was assembled in Italy, it doesn't have all Winchester parts.  There are a couple of Springfield parts.  The barrel and the stock were made by Beretta; in Italy.  It shots great and is very accurate.  I have a nice Plano hard case, leather shoulder strap, 31 clips, and ammo.  One can of 192 rounds in bandoleers with clips.

It has a round mark on the right side of the butt stock above the rear swivel mount.  I see in ""Enfield images""  this model of Enfield with what same circle at that location, designation unknown.

It's one badass rifle, but I've been too busy with other projects to truly appreciate it so I'm just ""testing the waters"". I don't expect to get the same amount of money I put into it, but considering the rarity and the fact that it's only had a few hundred rounds through it (which is nothing for a properly maintained AK), I'm asking $1,250. Do your research and you'll realize that buying a standard Saiga yourself will cost more than what I'm asking when you total everything up in the conversion process, especially with the price people are selling Saigas for these days. 
I'll also include a brand new Dinzag Arms front sight block with detent for the purchaser because I planned on getting the barrel cut down + threaded, a UTG side rail mount, and 200 rounds of new brass cased 762x51 in an ammo can. Don't pass up the chance to own a true Russian-made AK battle rifle instead of mediocre alternatives from companies like Century Arms.
