The RMR has scratches on it due to careless handling but I assure you, it is purely cosmetic and does not affect the operation of the RMR.

I also have a Bladetech classic outside the waistband (OWB) with tek-lok and Bladetech total eclipse holster for duty/range use and conceal carry, respectively. I'll sell those for another $100 if interested.

I will meet at The Marksman in Puyallup. I will only meet if you're ready to buy. CPL highly preferred. Below are links to pictures and to most of the aftermarket parts on the gun. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, take care!

H&K P30S 9 mm (V3) DA/SA, ambidextrous safety lever/rear decocking button, with two 15 round magazines
A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. 

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates

All of these bullets are first quality (i.e., not blems) and most are in their original boxes. Some boxes have been opened but most are factory sealed.  A few are not in their original boxes but are in another bullet maker’s box that’s been relabeled. 

Dad’s prices are 25% off current Midway prices, rounded to the closest whole dollar amount, and they do NOT include shipping.  I will ship using USPS priority mail flat rate boxes at $5.95 per small box or $12.65 for a medium one. The flat rate boxes include $50 of insurance coverage but if you want more, you’ll have to pay for the added coverage. No trades needed and no PayPal either; I’ll take cash, USPS money orders or personal checks which will be held until they clear.

It's missing the following parts :

Buttstock, upper lower & lower handguard -50$ you can get a set
Trigger group and retaining plate -50$ can get you a tapco g2 set and a retaining plate
And a pistol grip and the magazine catch is not installed , the original was damaged and I bought a tactical push release that also has the same style as the original. So you can push the lever while your hand is on the trigger guard to release the mag or it has the original style all aks have the paddle lever. Two different ways to release the magazines when this part gets installed.
I have one original 30 round magazine. Like I said the gun is completely stripped. 
There's nothing wrong with it. It has a aftermarket muzzlebreak attached. It is also missing the saftey lever, I was planning on installing a Krebs custom lever so you could manipulate the saftey without removing your hand. These also go for about 50$. 


If you want an ak for cheap nows the chance. You could probley get this gun up and running for less than 150$ if you wanted it to be basic. 

I'm firm on price of 400$
It's completely stripped down at this time and is a project gun."

Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the GLOCK 21SF delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 AUTO round with 10/13 round magazine capacity. Countless law enforcement units swear by the G21SF pistol, and that's why this powerful, lightweight, all climate workhorse is standard issue from the North to South Poles.

Please read through it carefully, I added MORE to the Trade section)
It has an eight inch barrel with the factory muzzle brake to help with the recoil.  You can shoot any type of bullet through this without having to change the muzzle brake.  Some models of SW500 require the muzzle brake to be swapped out to shoot leaded bullets.  The revolver comes with the SW blue box, papers, lock, and trigger lock key.

It's fun to shoot and it definitely draws a crowd.
You can literally hunt any North American game animal with this revolver. YES Any thing that moves in North America may be hunted with this weapon.  It's a beast to shoot and point on out to 200 yards.  Yes, 200 yards!!.  I do have a leather holster but that would be an extra $80.  The holster is brand new and worn over the shoulder and retails for about $110 I believe.

This revolver has been shot but has been well kept.  It's clean, timing is correct, no play in the yoke or cylinder shakes.

Not sure how many rounds have gone down the spout, but I think it's around 300 - I've never had a single malfunction of any kind, either!

Uses German Post #1 Great for low light and quick acquisition If mounted on a Mosin or other 7.62x54R it is stupid simple to use It is a STEEL TUBE not aluminum, If I cant sell this thing I Have a very expensive hammer because I'm pretty sure it can take the abuse. Included are MOLOT rings. This thing is 26.5mm tube. Not an inch, and not 30mm so you need special rings for it. I was racking my head for a month trying to figure out how to shim 30mm or ream out the 1 inch. Finally found these rings instead.  Somehow the mosin mount that came with it grew legs and walked off somewhere, however it is a lot easier to use a Jmeck scope mount on a mosin than to use a drill press.  The Jmeck mount causes no permanent modification to the reciever, works just the same as the real deal, and you can't feel the difference while useing it.  I spent $225 on the scope and $30 on the rings not including shipping on either one.

    .455 Webley Mk III [11.55 x 19.3mm R]: Introduced in 1898. The famous ""Manstopper"" bullet intended for police, civilian and colonial use. Essentially, the Mk III was a 218 grain lead ""hollowpoint"" design, propelled by cordite. The cylindrical bullet had hemispherical hollows at each end—one to seal the barrel, the other to deform on impact. This bullet was soon prohibited for use by the military because it was not compliant with the Hague Convention of 1899. The Mark III was withdrawn from service in 1900 and the Mark II was reintroduced.

    .455 Webley Mk IV [11.55 x 19.3mm R]: Introduced in 1912. 220 grain, flat-nosed wadcutter with cordite propellant. Designed with the goal of producing a more effective bullet than the Mark II without violating the terms of the Hague Convention.

    .455 Webley Mk V [11.55 x 19.3mm R]: Introduced in 1914. Identical to the Mk IV bullet,[3][4] but cast from a harder lead-alloy containing more antimony with cordite propellant. This cartridge was only in use from April through November 1914. Upon its withdrawal the Mark II cartridge was returned to service. Remaining stocks were designated for target practice and unloaded cases were loaded with Mark II bullets."

I ended up with more than I'll ever shoot so I'm going to let this one go.

I had featured it in a thread on here a few months back. I never did get the opportunity to shoot it. It is a Smith & Wesson model 65-2 (.357) with a pinned barrel and recessed cylinder. It features a Tyler T grip that really enhances the ergos as well as the aesthetics of the gun. This gun is super clean and as you can see by the pictures, very pretty. There is some almost imperceptible holster wear on the top rail of the frame and barrel in just a few places. I can try and get some better pictures of that wear for any interested parties. Other than that, the gun is exceptionally clean and appears to have been fired very little. I am not trying to make any money on this sale and will be just as content to keep it in the safe as I would be to sell it for exactly what I paid, $650. I don't believe the box is original (see pictures) to the gun but it came with it when I bought it and it will go with it when I sell it.

Selling price $650

Trades - what have you got? Interested in firearms of all kinds, optics etc. etc.... (Anyone have a Browning Hi-Power......?...??)

CPL and DL a must. I will discuss transfer details with the buyer. I'm in Everett and not real keen on any long drives unless an irresistible trade presents itself. PM me for any further questions or details."

Be the envy of others or fulfill someone's Christmas wish. Keltec has done a great job on this one here and has outdone the sister PMR 30 with this one. Only 500 released by Keltec with no known date for additional release.

The asking price includes 500 rounds of quality Ammo to he you started. Give me a call or send text to REDACTED.

Details: The Kel-Tec CMR-30 Rifle is chambered for the .22WMR cartridge (22 Magnum). The design is a rifle version of the popular Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol. The same 30 round magazines are used. The single action trigger mechanism, bolt stop, ambidextrous safety levers, and mag catch are also identical. The CMR-30 rifle includes a collapsible stock and the 16” barrel is threaded 1/2”-28 to accept many different muzzle attachments. The multi-position collapsible stock allows for a short overall length of 22.7” with the stock collapsed, and 30.6” when extended. The long top picatinny rail will accept a multitude of different optics, and the removable under picatinny rail is included. The ambidextrous operating handles are non-reciprocating and latch in the forward position. The stock latch lever is also ambidextrous and located just in front of the trigger guard. An integral sling loop is included near the rear of the grip, on both sides. 

The CMR-30 is constructed of hard-coat anodized aluminum for the upper assembly and rails and houses the steel barrel. The collapsible stock is made with aluminum stock rods, and a nylon butt plate. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum. The bolt assembly houses a captive recoil spring assembly. Magpul®  flip-up sights included.

The extensive use of aluminum, and a lock time lower than most bolt action rifles makes the CMR-30 a very accurate rifle."

The price is $525.00 firm for the rifle, it's accessories, and the rounds. I am willing to travel a little bit to meet up (half way or the nearest to it)."
