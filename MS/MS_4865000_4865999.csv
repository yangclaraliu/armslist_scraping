This piece was recently purchased from an estate and sadly I have no provenance. It is missing one screw and currently is inoperable. I am not a gunsmith so I do not know if this piece would be safe to fire. It is however EXCEEDINGLY rare and is accompanied with the original belt it was found in at the estate. From comparison it stands a good chance that this is the original confederate belt and holster. I can ship this weapon as it was made before 1899. Offers welcome. Lets talk."

I have a SLIGHTLY used (mounted and taken out 1 time) Vortex Viper HS LR 2.5-10x32 scope for sale. It has the XLR reticle and is a First Focal Plane scope. It has a side mounted parallax adjustment and the windage and elevation adjustments are true and accurate. This scope is in PERFECT condition and will make a great finish to any rifle! I am only selling this because I would like to get something with a little higher magnification for long range shooting.

I am asking $625 obo...it is $800 right now at Cabela's, where I bought it. If you have been waiting for a GOOD Vortex to come along, now is your chance.

Includes cleaning kit and magazine. This weapon has already been converted, and is fully 922r compliant. Includes pistol grip, Tapco no-slap G2 trigger, and a stock with rubber butt pad and storage space for the cleaning kit. Barrel is chrome-lined, which is good news if you like to shoot inexpensive corrosive mil-surp.

Includes both a US Palm 30-round magazine (this is perhaps the best AK mag you can buy), and a US-made Thermold 30-round magazine.

This is not some Century parts kit. This is a newly manufactured weapon from the Izhmash plant in Russia. Don't settle for anything less. 

On 16 July 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama signed an Executive Order banning the importation of Russian-made firearms (which include the Saiga) into the United States in response to Russian military intervention in Ukraine. The price of these guns will continue to go up.

Absolutely flawless, no issues whatsoever. Like new condition. This weapon was cleaned once to remove factory grease, then stripped and cleaned again after firing a couple of mags to ensure accuracy and reliability. No FTF/FTE or other issues. Irons are dead-on from the factory.

I also have about 100 rounds of Silver/Brown Bear. Don't settle for Wolf, and don't worry about hosing down your gun after firing corrosive mil-surp. This is brand new, top-quality, non-corrosive ammo!

Asking $800 or best offer for the weapon.

Will trade for a KSG, PMR30 + cash, Ruger GP100 + cash, any Calico weapon + cash, or a quality 1911.

I have a second weapon in 5.45x39 (AK-74); same condition, same price. You can see both weapons in the pictures. I also have over 500 rounds of new 5.45x39 Hornady and Silver Bear ammo for that weapon.

I also have a brand new UTG quick-detach side mount dual scope rail, which you can see in the pictures.

I'm willing to take $1700 for everything, or trade for an M1A.

PS:
Please don't send offers that include ""junk guns"". This is not some $500 Century WASR-10 with canted sights. I am open to reasonable offers, but please understand that this is a newly manufactured authentic Russian weapon that is now banned from import. An unconverted Saiga (which will need about $250 worth of parts and gunsmithing) is $700 from Bud's., and a converted Saiga goes for about $1000. I am in no hurry to sell, as the price on these is going to keep going up. Thanks for taking these things into consideration when making an offer.

The SUB-2000™ is a semi-automatic rifle chambered for the .40 cal. S&W cartridge and takes Glock 22 magazines. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000™ rifle can instantly be reduced to a size of 16.25 x 7 inches for ease of storage.

The polymer of the weapon is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel. Two integrated Picatinny rails come standard on the SUB-2000™ forend for mounting compatible accessories. The forend also includes five mounting slots per side, configured for various M-LOK™ accessories. 

The stock can be adjusted to three different positions for shooter's comfort. Each position adds approximately 5/8 of an inch to the overall length of the weapon, with a total extension of 1.25 inches in the further rearward position. The stock includes a single point sling loop attachment, a slot for adding a nylon sling loop (1.25"" wide is ideal), and a Picatinny rail on the bottom for adding small accessories. 

The SUB-2000™ features a push-bolt safety located behind the trigger on the grip assembly. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by cycling the bolt to the rear and rotating the operating handle up into the cutout on the receiver. The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000™ can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools."

The Ruger LCR (Lightweight Compact Revolver) is a small frame revolver with
a smooth, easy to control trigger and highly manageable recoil. These revolvers feature high-strength stainless steel cylinder that is extensively fluted to reduce weight and an Ionbond Diamondblack finish for excellent durability. The monolithic frame which supports cylinder and barrel, is made from aerospace grade, 7000 series aluminum in 22LR, 22WMRF and 38 special LCR models. The powerful LCR-357 model is made from blackened 400 series stainless steel. The LCRx model features an external hammer that allows it to be fired in single-action mode. The Crimson Trace models allow for fast and positive target acquisition, and offer the advantage of a laser sighting system in a more compact grip. It also includes a soft case.

I'm willing to sell or trade, but would prefer a trade. I've been getting some lowball offers so far. I don't need to sell it, so I'm pretty firm on price if it's a straight up sale. You may have to add cash depending on what you're trading me. I am looking for what's listed below, but send me your offer if you have something different that's similar.

Whether it is a sale or trade, you will need to provide your name and birth date so I can run a check for felonies / domestic violence related misdemeanors. Although it is not a legal requirement, I will not sell / transfer to anyone with convictions for violent misdemeanors. A valid state issued DL / ID and CCW / Police ID / Military ID will need to be shown at the time of sale / trade and a bill of sale / transfer will have to be signed. If these things are an inconvenience for you, please do not contact me. I believe any responsible firearm owner will understand my reasoning.

Just so I don't keep getting emails asking if it's for sale...if the listing is active, it is still for sale."

Ruger's LCRx has a patent pending polymer fire control housing to hold all the fire control components in their proper dimensional relationships, reduce weight significantly, and help reduce recoil. The friction reducing cam is the next generation design in fire control systems with an optimized cam that results in a smooth, non-stacking trigger pull. LCRx high strength stainless steel cylinder is extensively fluted (reducing weight) and
features an Ionbond Diamondblack finish for excellent durability.  The Grip Peg allows a variety of grip styles to be installed leaving ample room for recoil cushioning. The external hammer allows the LCRx to be fired in single action mode.

The Best Revolver Ever Made
