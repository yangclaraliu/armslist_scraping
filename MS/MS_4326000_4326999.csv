The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

Featuring two levels of tactical illumination, ambidextrous switching, a slender ergonomic design, and legendary SureFire reliability and durability, the DSF-870 is the ultimate WeaponLight for Remington 870 combat shotguns. 

This compact, lightweight system replaces the weapon’s original factory forend and features a recoil-proof LED that generates 600 lumens of blinding white light at maximum output, or 200 lumens with twice the runtime on its high setting. The LED’s light is focused by a precision reflector to create a smooth, wide beam perfect for closer-range shotgun applications typical in law enforcement and home defense—with enough reach and surround light to properly identify threats and maintain situational awareness. 

The DSF-870 features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switches on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters. Selecting the LED’s output is achieved by activating the light in constant-on mode and then pressing the output-mode selector switch until the desired output level (600 or 200 lumens) is set. The selected output can then be left in constant-on mode or switched to momentary activation, and it stays at that output level until reset. Every DSF-Series WeaponLight also features an integrated system-disable switch to prevent accidental activation during transport, storage, or stealth operations. 

A lightweight but strong aluminum module protects the optics, LED, and sophisticated electronics, minimizing length with side-by-side placement of the two lithium batteries that power the system. The module has a Mil-Spec hard anodized finish to protect against scratches, abrasion, and corrosion, while O-ring and gasket seals keep out moisture, dust, and debris. The slender forend body is made from extremely tough polymer and is textured for a secure hold and features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switching on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters. 

The DSF-870 provides unmatched power, versatility, and control, making it a must-have on Remington 870 shotguns used in combat, law enforcement, or home defense. NOTE: To see our other DSF shotgun forend models, click here.

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip.

The VIS is a polylithic upper receiver assembly that ties the normally individual receiver and handguard into a single, aggregate part. This combination overcomes many problems that are associated with the traditional “two piece” design; most notably the greatly improved structural strength and repeatable accuracy. This affords the user all the benefits of a free-floating barrel and solid railed for end."

I also have the factory box, cleaning, cloth, literature, covers, etc. This scope sells for $750 on midway (which is where I got it). It is a second focal plane scope.

The details on the scope are many. Please feel free to google the scope, the specs will come up. If you're looking at this ad, you already know it's a quality scope.

I'm selling this because I want to by a Leupold Fixed 25 with 1/2 moa dot specifically designed for smallbore silhouette (FYI, this scope sells for $650). In short, the Vortex is a more expensive scope, but I need to change the reticle, and that's not possible - otherwise, I'd definitely be hanging onto this scope. For what's it's worth I have another one of these scopes on my .308. It will NOT being coming off of that rifle. This scope is that good.

The GLARE® MOUT is a non-lethal visual disruption laser (dazzler, ocular interruption device [OID]) ideally suited for small-arms weapon integration as well as mobile crew-served applications. When a suspect individual approaches a restricted or controlled area, the GLARE MOUT is able to hail and warn that person before shots have to be fired. Its shockingly bright green dazzler beam sends an irrefutable, multi-lingual, cross-cultural message that ""you mean business"". Reports confirm that the GLARE MOUT has saved numerous lives of both soldiers and non-combatants in Iraq and Afghanistan. A hand-held kit is also available for non-weapons-mounted deployment.

The GLARE MOUT is compact and lightweight and is already approved for use by all branches of the U.S. Armed Services.

• Lightweight, small profile
• Fully weapons mountable
• Weapon shock ruggedized
• Extended battery life
• Instant on (no warm-up delay)

Comes with original Sig Sauer box.

This platform converts almost any handgun into a carbine, capable of mounting lights, lasers, slings, etc.

This setup with pistol installed is perfect for a home defense/nightstand weapon.  The ACP allows a two handed hold on the platform for accuracy, sling to add stability and keeps your hands free if needed.  Rails run along the top, and 3,6,9 o'clock to mount accessories.  Slide is actuated by a charging handle that can be put on right or left side, so controls are ambidextrous.

I will include a Sig Sauer brand two-point sling (can convert to 1-point) with QD attachment point in the front, red/green dot sight, red laser sight w/pressure switch installed, Magpul short rail for pistol flashlight in front, angled flip up sights for backup in case electronics fail.  Some of this gear is not in the photos, I will update when I take more pictures.

*Handgun and Flashlight not included.

*THIS IS NOT A FIREARM, AND DOES NOT NEED AN FFL TRANSFER*

Will sell everything described above for $350

Here is the breakdown in cost:

Standard ACP $369
Spare Undercarriage: $100
Sig Sauer Sling: $30
Red/Green Dot: $35

I live near Monona on Madison's southeast side. I also work on the west side near Menards and Target and could meet there.

Here is the description off the web:

This versatile generator transfer switch is ideal for powering essential appliances with a portable generator during a power outage. Rated 30 amps, 120 single phase, 60 Hertz

It accommodates six household circuits (120-Volt only) and can be used with any portable generator up to 3750-Watt (continuous). This transfer switch installs next to an existing load center like a subpanel. 

Ideal for powering your furnace blower (gas only), refrigerator and kitchen circuits, lights and television. If your needs change, you can easily expand this transfer switch to up to 16 circuits just by adding more circuit breakers. 

The enclosure can be flush or surface mounted indoors and allows hardwired or plug-in generator connections. 

Because it was designed with off-the-shelf circuit breakers (Siemens, Cutler Hammer-BR, Square D-HOM, GE - THQL) you don't have to search high and low for replacements and your installer can reconfigure the breaker combinations to suit your family's needs! 

This transfer switch includes an L5-30 male power inlet and dual-Watt meters to help balance generator loads. 

Includes three 15-amp 1-pole breakers and three 20-amp 1-pole breakers.

It is the most durable finish/treatment available, and can withstand carbon build up even beyond what Nickel Boron does. And being made by Seekins Precision it is USA Made. It is $150 straight from Seekins and the lowest it is for sale anywhere else is $142.50. I will take $130 cash (firm) for it. If you happen to need a charging handle too I also have one that I can include for another $20, for a total price of $150. You will not find a better BCG than this for the money, and you will not find this one anywhere else for this low a price, check around for yourself and see. The price is firm so please no offers of less, it is brand new and I am already selling it below what it would cost to buy the same thing directly from from them or anywhere else. Yes you can buy a cheaper one but you get what you pay for and Seekins stuff is as good as it gets. This is a great price for a complete BCG of this quality and well worth it. If interested please respond with a phone number to contact you on. If you do not include a phone number in your reply and you don't get any response from me, that is why. The price is $130 firm and cash only please. The only item I will be interested in trading for is a Verizon or AT&T or US Cellular iPhone 5 5c or 5s in nice condition, nothing else. I do not want to haggle on prices so please only reply if you want the BCG or BCG/CH combo for the listed price, thanks

393,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4326393,For Sale:  Vintage WWII Thompson L-Drum Pouch and strap - Boyle GC.,"NE Suburbs, Minnesota, United States",$ 95,"Listed On: Monday, February 1, 2016",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here's a WWII L-drum pouch for the fifty round Thompson drum magazines, complete with strap in good condition.
If a new pouch is what you want, this is not it....but this one must have been to some interesting places indeed......and it's affordable history at just 100.00 cash!
Look at what these are going for on various military forums and auction sites....this price is a STEAL and is firm.

You can see it has faded a bit - originally soaked with sea water and the canvas was saturated with salt and canvas was stiff as a board, buckles have light corrosion as do strap tips. The strap has some areas with light rust stains on both sides, a small bit of fraying and one area with a 1/8"" cut. Also one area of the wider part of the strap has a thinned area frayed a small bit and worn a tiny bit.
The brass snap has no corrosion at all and works nicely and the canvas of the pouch is nice and solid, U.S. markings on outside of flap visible but very faint, 'Boyle' makers stamp on inside of flap nice and clear but not real dark.

All stitching is in good condition and appears solid.
Overall, a nice, solid example of a battle pouch for the 50 round Tommygun drum at a great price!

This was carefully soaked in cold water and mild Woolite to remove all the seawater salt and then air-dried. It is now soft and pliable, a bit softer than a new one and the color has faded somewhat from it's original khaki color, common with the pouches and web gear that actually saw service in WWII. There are a couple very tiny gray grease spots (see one pic) but they are faint.

My best guess due to the seawater salt completely covering the pouch and strap is that his was used in one or more beach landings, and since more drums were used in the Pacific Theater of Opertion, I'd guess it maybe came ashore with a Marine there, maybe at Guadalcanal, Peliliu or possibly even Iwo Jima?

Good solid WWII pouch, great for your collection, just reduced to $95.00 cash FIRM. I wish I had history on this pouch as it has definitely ""been there. done that""!"

Soft cases could fit a dozen pistols on the shelf. The door is a standard sized pegboard and can be fitted with hooks, compartments and other misc accessories. the cabinet comes with two small bin which attach to the pegboard and the removable shelf.

Comes with no paperwork or presentation case, this Smith dates to the early 70's and the bluing is all original.  This is a pinned and recessed gun and is a true 6.5"" gun, NOT a 6"" that was transitioned to in the late 70's.  It has a high luster and a few handling marks throughout but blue loss itself is minimal.  I don't do percentage ratings as I feel every person has their own system in that regard.  The factory original N frame target stocks are in very good condition but have obviously been refinished by someone with a lack of knowledge in how to do so.  The checkering has also been dulled.  That basically sums up all the bad news.  
Although not a piece for the Smithsonian, this is a truly beautiful gun from a bygone era that has obviously been well cared for during its over 40 year lifespan.  I feel my asking price of $975 is very fair compared to market values of double that of pieces in stone mint condition.  I prefer a face to face sale with a Kentucky resident with a valid KY drivers license and a CCDW Permit is always a bonus.  Not interested in trades or shipping.

It is dated 44 on barrel and through the serial number ZF****. It is an British army issued tanker revolver made in 1944. This gun is in great condition considering it is 71 years old. The cylinder is still tight and will last for years to come.

This revolver was developed at the Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield in 1926 - 1927. The design is based on scaled down Webley Mark 6 ""break-top"" frame, with cylinder chambered for 6 .38/200 rounds. The hammer/trigger group was redesigned, with manual hammer safety lock added, and with separate cylinder lock. This revolver was adopted for British Military service in 1932 as Enfield revolver, .38 caliber, No.2 Mark 1. After 1938, almost all No.2 Mk1s were converted into No.2 Mark 1* configuration.

Enfield No.2 Mark 1* were developed in the late 1930s for British Tank Corps, and are distinguished from early Mark 1 by spurless, Double Action Only hammers, lighter mainsprings, and re-shaped grip side plates. The spurless DAO hammers were required by Tank Corps command to avoid snagging the hammers on tank internals."

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

Made in Russia, Saiga 308, 16"" barrel. Converted with parts from Dinzag. It goes without saying that this is a high quality, well built rifle. It is basically an AKM chambered in 7.62x51 and 308. Yes it is very safe to shoot both cartridges. Comes with a surefire 25 round mag. Also the 8 round factory mag if I can find it. Things that stand out to me would be the RIDICULOUSLY nice trigger, surprisingly soft recoil, and solid feel. Has some marring to the finish, near the safety lever that is purely cosmetic. The rifle has exactly 20 rounds of Winchester white box through it. I just never have the time to shoot the thing.  It's a BEAST!  REDACTED text is preferred as I am always busy. Thanks for looking.

The Smith & Wesson Model 686 revolver is a true workhorse for both duty and sporting use. With a major effect on both law enforcement and sporting markets the 686 has become one of the most popular revolvers ever made. This 7 round revolver comes equipped with an internal lock safety, synthetic grips, glass bead stainless steel finish, and a cable lock.
The Smith & Wesson 686+ has the more versatile round butt grip frame that can accommodate a wide selection of aftermarket grips to suit any hand size. With its intermediate size and weight, it is comfortable to grip by its finger grooved grip. Its overall configuration allows for a good position of the trigger finger around the narrow smooth trigger. The narrow, smooth trigger allows the finger to roll over its surface, preventing the tendency to pull the sights off target during the long double action stroke.

The frame is super thick (about a half inch at the rail area) and the internals are machined way better than any of the CZ's I've owned.

Suburbs, Minnesota, United States",$ 45,"Listed On: Monday, July 27, 2015",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here's great older vintage shoulder rig....a genuine Brauer Bros (St.Louis, Mo.) shoulder holster in excellent condition! It used to belong to my Dad and he carried with it a few times but not much. He passed away last year and I have a few other holsters to list, but this is the nicest! (holster only - no firearm is included!)

It's just what you need for those big autos....shown with a 1911A1 is NOT INCLUDED!), it'll easily hold any of the large frame semis with single or double stack mags, including the Hi-Power, Tokarev, CZ52, etc. This holster will also fit revolvers.....although I don't have sales information nor can I locate it anywhere.....perhaps with the model number ANS25 you can find out if it'll fit your favorite piece?

The leather is in great shape, perfect condition as is the web belting, buckle and leather lacing. The gun is held in the rig by a spring steel clip inside the leather so it won't scratch your gun. The lower strap goes around your belt to secure the holster to your side. It's very solid and to remove the gun you knock it forward by the butt and it pops straight forward, then you pull it out like a horizontal cross-draw....really great!

I don't carry a big auto and will not use this so it should go to someone who will....maybe you?

These vintage rigs are collectible but very usable, so you won't ever lose money on this rig. I have seen these go for close to a hundred bucks in worse shape than this, but I'd be happy with $45.00 cash for mine (again, holster only - no gun included!).

I have seen three of these recently on Ebay and Gunbroker all go for 75-90 bucks and none was as nice as mine!

Seven hi resolution photos here: http://tinypic.com/a/3x2z4/2

Email questions but not for what it fits....you have the model number, you do the research and I won't be responsible if it doesn't match your gun....sorry! (But if it doesn't fit, you can probably resell it at a profit!)

I will also ship this Priority mail conus for mailing cost, or you can pickup in Minnesota for free.
Thanks for looking!"

Chambered in .357 mag/.38 spec, this heavy (but perfectly balanced) ""built like a tank"" Ruger has a full lug 4"" barrel and adjustable rear sight. Only about 150 down the pipe, and the low round count shows. It's a beautiful and well-cared for gun that looks brand new (never seen the inside of a holster), and it comes with everything from the factory: Ruger hard case, lock and key, manual, spent casing. I upgraded and replaced the factory hogue monogrip with the more traditional rubber grip with rosewood inserts that the GPs used to come with (paid $50), but I'll include the monogrip as well just in case you want both. I will also throw in a box of brass ammo (paid $25).
