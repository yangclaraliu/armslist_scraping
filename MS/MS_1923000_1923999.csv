This rifle is mechanically 100 percent and all original.  The stock has just a couple of dings in it.  The metal is good with just a small amount of cancer on the inside of the trigger guard and on the rear of the hammer tang but minor.  Other than that it has the normal patina you would expect from a 120 year old firearm.  No pitting in the metal and the bore is near perfect.  I have owned this piece for 35 years and have fired it a few times over the years and it works perfectly.  These are going on the other sites for $800 and up.  Don't bother me with trades unless you have one of the following ONLY, Fender Stratocaster American Deluxe, Gibson ES335 or Les Paul, or a Gretsch from the 1960s.  This means no variations of these or other manufacturers period.  The price is fair and the rifles are not that easy to come buy and as I checked last night, did not find another one offered.  No scammers, no BS, and I don't need help selling it.  This piece will make someone a nice cowboy action piece or just a nice historical piece.

This gun is less than a year old and is in excellent condition. The Marlin 925 is accurate! With all of its upgrades, it easily shoots on par with my CZ455; sometimes better. I’ve shot less than 500 rounds through it and have invested around $600 into this. I started this gun as a project rifle and thus hate to let it go, but I already own two other .22 rifles and hardly have the time to shoot any of them.

Product Description

The Geissele Super Semi-Automatic Enhanced (SSA-E) Trigger is a finely-tuned semi-automatic-only version of our full-auto, two stage combat trigger presently used in the U.S. Special Operations Community. Built on the chassis of the Geissele SSA, the SSA-E provides enhanced trigger control and weapon accuracy while maintaining the robustness and reliability of our combat-proven two-stage trigger. The SSA-E's reduced 1st and 2nd stage pull weights result in a trigger with a smooth, light 1st stage take-up and a crisp, candy cane-like 2nd stage break. The SSA-E is ideal for use in precision Squad Designated Marksman type rifles where weapon accuracy and reliability are critical and a non-adjustable drop in trigger is desired."

These are as close as you can get to the US Navy issue 590A1’s. The 590A1 is basically a Mossberg 500 pump action shotgun with a few improvements at the request of the US Military. The 590A1 has a thicker walled barrel and receiver and a metal trigger group and safetey (as opposed to the 500’s polymer parts). Think 500 on steroids. The thing is then coated in a special Parkerizing process that makes it very resistant to corrosion (again to Navy specs). This scattergun has a picatinny rail mounted on the receiver for easy adaptation of different sighting systems. It comes with a beefy ghost ring rear sight and an AR style fiber optic front sight. The rear site is fully adjustable. Both the front and rear have protective “ears” like most military firearms. Below the 20” barrel is a 9 shot tube and yes, this shotgun comes with a real M9 bayonet made by Ontario Knife Co. (the same one you are not allowed to have on your AR). The M9 bayonet alone is worth $100. This is one bad shotgun.

It has not been shot very often. Hogue grips make this gun very comfortable to shoot and the .45 ACP gives this revolver all the power you will ever need. The adjustable target sights combined with the ultra-light weight single action trigger make this a real shooter. The lock up and timing are still tight as the day it was new. One of the coolest features of these revolvers is the ability to perform lighting fast reloads with the moon clips. You won’t be disappointed with this gun!

Don't really have a need for this one now so here is a chance to get a hard to get item, from the best name in tactical gear, for a great price. Comes with wrench, screws, and original bag. Here is the info from LaRue's site; Engage closer targets with ease and confidence. Magnified scopes are great for distance targets, but are slow and awkward when engaging targets close-in. When used in combination with a magnified scope, the LT-724 positions the excellent Aimpoint T-1 off to the side, so you'll have all the benefits of a red-dot simply by rotating the rifle a few degrees for rapid transition to close-range targets. Not only is the LT-724 essential kit for MIL/LE, it's ideal for 3 gunners. The LT-724 was initially designed to fit on the upper receiver in front of a Trijicon ACOG without the need for a railed handguard (note: a standard rear BUIS may not fit with the LT100 and LT724 combination). The LT-724 is also widely-used on freefloat and continuous-railed handguards in combination with any scope with side turrets shallower than ½"" in length, like Trijicon Accupoints, Burris XTR, Leupold CQ/T, Leupold Mark 4 w/ M2 turrets, etc. (Note: The LT724 will not fit underneath the LT104 extension)"

I bought this pistol about 6 years ago to shoot production class IPSC. It has since been replaced by a Glock 17, and has been riding a slot in my gun safe for quite some time. I shot only a handful of competitions with the weapon, and it was cleaned diligently after each use. I would rate the pistol at 98-99 percent. Minor holster wear on the very tip, and normal barrel blueing wear from the weapon cycling. 

The Beretta comes with 5 magazines. The good, Beretta factory magazines that cost an arm and a leg, not the B/S Army aftermarket ones. That's enough magazines to get one started in competition shooting if they desire. 

Also comes with two concealed carry holsters. A Don Hume H715 IWB and a CQC Holster by BLACKHAWK! designed for the 5-6 o'clock/small of back position. 

Sorry, no box or paperwork that I can find. I'm pretty sure this came in the older cardboard boxes that I didn't feel like storing long term. 

$625... It's coming with over 100 dollars in magazines and holsters, so it's a fair price. It's hard to find one of these new for under $600 with only 2 magazines. If you make an offer, don't insult me or yourself. If it's reasonable (think highest bidder), I'll consider it. 

As always, local laws apply. I must collect a Pistol Purchase Permit, and I'll want you to sign a bill of sale. If you have a concealed carry permit, I will need to see it to make sure it is current, and I will write your permit number on my bill of sale."

It's also possible the ads are being placed by law enforcement looking to make examples of a few buyers who disregard the new law, or by newspaper/TV reporters wanting to make a story on how this law should be better enforced.

I want to sell a gun to another person, i.e., a private party transfer. Am I required to conduct the transaction through a licensed California firearms dealer?
Yes. Firearm sales must be conducted through a fully licensed California firearms dealer. Failure to do so is a violation of California law. The buyer (and seller, in the event that the; buyer is denied), must meet the normal firearm purchase and delivery requirements. ""Antique firearms,"" as defined in Section 921(a)(16) of Title 18 of the United States Code, and curio or relic rifles/shotguns, defined in Section 178.11 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations that are over 50 years old, are exempt from this requirement.

Firearms dealers are required to process private party transfers upon request. Firearms dealers may charge a fee not to exceed $10 per firearm for conducting a private party transfer. Example:

For a private party transfer involving one or more handguns, the total allowable fees, including the DROS, safety, and dealer transfer fees, are not to exceed $35.00 for the first handgun and $31.00 for each additional handgun involved in the same transaction.
For private party transfers involving one or more long guns, or a private party transfer involving one handgun, the total allowable fees, including the DROS, safety, and dealer transfer fees, are not to exceed $35.00. The dealer may charge an additional dealer-service fee of$10.00 per each additional firearm transferred.

Oh yeah, most people think training on a soft heavy bag is useful. It isn't! The grappling dummy here is hard and represents what it's really like to hit a human being. You MUST train with full force with strikes to head, neck, ribs, groin, knee etc to learn how to truly disable someone. If you don't have correct form, you will hurt your hand/foot upon contact. A soft heavy bag won't reveal this whereas the dummy will! Don't be a dummy, get the dummy! 
Additionally, the reflex heavy bags teach you precise aim, reflexes, and speed necessary to disable a formidable foe. It is a great practice bag for the fighting sticks as well as it is a constantly moving target.

Additionally, the stick fighting CDs used in conjunction with the reflex bags will teach you how to instantly disable someone with a telescoping steel baton which easily fits in your pocket, purse, or belt holster. With a baton, you aim for the attackers hand and instantly break his wrist or hand, disabling him from any further action without having to use lethal force.

br> Additionally, if you buy the package, I will spend some time teaching you how to use the bags, sticks, and dummy. You can't beat this deal! You better get it fast cuz it will go quick!

You must pick up all items, no delivery possible. Many thanks!

Nightforce uses outstanding glass and coatings in all their scopes, and the 5.5-22x50 tactical gives you superb resolution at high magnifications. It is the ultimate long range scope. The 50mm objective lens gives you maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range. This Nightforce scope gives the shooter precision accuracy at the longest ranges, yet at 5.5 power remains highly effective for shots at close ranges. 

The Nightforce MLR reticle is an exceptional Mil-Radian reticle design. The MLR is marked in .5 and 1 mil divisions. This allows the shooter to easily utilize holdover and holdunder references, and easily make changes in windage without adjusting the turrets. The elevation points are numerically identified in 2,4,6, and 8 mil increments; the windage points are identified in 2 and 4 mil increments. The MLR is perfect for dawn / dusk and low-lighting conditions because it has the illuminated reticle. 

From Nightforce:

Originally developed for the U.S. military’s extreme long range shooting and hard target interdiction, both 5.5-22 Nightforce NXS models provide a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. These characteristics, combined with the extreme ruggedness and reliability of every Nightforce riflescope, make them ideal for even the largest calibers. The slim profile of the 5.5-22 x 56 NXS makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems. Its superb resolution at high magnification opens an entirely new world of extended range shooting for the accomplished marksman; Nightforce shooters are now accurately reaching to 2000 yards and beyond.
