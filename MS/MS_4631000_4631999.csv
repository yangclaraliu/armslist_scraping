Up for trade is my Shocker NXT paintball gun. This a tournament grade paintball marker. It has an installed virtue board for a fully configurable playing experience with multiple modes of firing, and you can cap the rate of fire at whatever you want.

Cosmetically this gun is near perfect, except some scratches visible on the side where my friend's keys dug into the gun years ago. This very obviously doesn't affect the performance in any way whatsoever. 

This gun has only seen approximately 5 cases of paint through its whole life. My friend bought this gun brand new in 2008 and it has ran flawlessly. I have torn the gun all the way down and cleaned and greased it. It's ready to take names at the field. It has lots of life left and is a reliable, fast shooting, and comfortable gun to use on the speedball field or in the woods. 

I am only trying to move this because right now I don't play paintball often, because I've gotten more into shooting real steel and when I do paintball, I play with a pump nowadays.

Manufacturer's Description:
The union of advanced design, quality materials and proper construction makes Kahr's CM40 the smallest, thinnest, most reliable full power compact pistol, a value that can't be matched. Kahr's CM40 pistol is a top-of-the-line performer when it comes to accuracy and reliability. The CM40 weighs in at only about 15.8 ounces, but its built to be extremely durable. Its black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a safe-cam action and an unbelievably smooth double-action-only trigger stroke, making the CM40 fast to fire in critical defensive situations. The CM40 also features drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights."

Asking Price $1000

This receiver and its accessories are a collection of high end parts that I’ve collected over time. Whether you are a seasoned AR-15 veteran or looking for your first AR, this setup is a good way to go. I have verified that the receiver functions flawlessly at high rates of fire and that you can hold 1MOA groupings if you choose Match Grade ammo and have a trigger to match. Less than 100 rnds have been fired through this barrel. If you are interested in purchasing, please contact me and I will provide you with my phone number. I will only coordinate over the phone. I am not interested in trades or negotiating pricing. Cash only.

Mega Arms Upper Receiver – This is one of this best forged upper receivers on the market. The finishing details of the machining are excellent and the anodizing is bar none the best black anodizing in the firearms industry. $120

Ballistic Advantage Performance Series 5.56 Hanson profile 14.5 inch barrel - 5.56 NATO Chamber – This is an excellent barrel that has a nice taper to it that many AR junkies have fallen in love with. This barrel can absolutely shoot 1MOA if you know what you’re doing and have the right equipment. If you buy some decent ammo from your local shop and don’t put a lot of thought into it I’d expect you’ll get 1.5MOA. The melonite treatment to the barrel means that you’ll easily get 30,000 rounds through this thing and not lose any accuracy. I’ve heard of people getting over 50,000 rounds out of melonited barrels although I’ve never shot that much myself. $195

Centurion Arms CMR 12inch rail – The CMR rail is a lightweight and rugged free float rail system. 12 inches tends to look the most aesthetically pleasing with a 14.5 inch barrel. This rail is unique with its attachment method, using screws to attach everything from scout light mounts to picatinny rails. Centurion Arms also sells many accessories to the rail. Magpul forward grips and B5 Systems Grip Stops can be attached directly to the rail. Also anything that can attach to Picatinny can be attached to the rail. The rail also features QD holes on the front and rear of the rail for sling attachment. $300 Included with the rail:
•	Black scales shown in photo. These help with grip and heat.

•	6x brown scales.

Ballistic Advantage Melonite Gas Tube – Mid Length Gas Tube. Subdued instead of the standard shiny silver. Increased heat and corrosion resistance. $15

AR Gas Vent – This is a substitute for a forward assist and helps to control gas blowing back in your face when you are firing suppressed. An extra AR-15 forward assist is included in case you wish to revert to a forward assist. The Gas Vent is nice though and I recommend trying it out. $39

Strike Industries Ultimate Dust Cover – This is a composite dust cover that adds aesthetic appeal and character to the receiver. $15

Parallax Tactical Gen 4 BCG – This BCG is Titanium Nitride coated to add both durability and lubricity to the BCG during operation. Let’s not forget that it look cool too. The bolt itself is Nickel Boron coated to add a great amount of lubricity to the function as well. Yes this is an exotic BCG, but it run around the same price as a true mil spec bolt and you’re getting a lot more for the same price. $199

Magpul MBUS Pro Iron Sights – Probably the most preferred iron sights on the market. $190

Magpul Vertical Grip – I personally do not prefer vertical grips, but I’ve included it because I know many of you do. $20

Geissele SSA Trigger – The same trigger developed and currently used in 1SFOD-D (Delta Force). Butter smooth 2 stage trigger. First stage is 2.5lbs and the second stage is 2.0 lbs for a total pull of 4.5 lbs.  $220

Initially developed for and still used by 1SFOD-D (Delta Force). Only replaced recently for their M4’s by Surefire flash hiders, which uses the patented B.E. Meyers design. B.E. Meyers co-developed the Surefire Flash Hiders to win the SOCOM contract. $96

B.E. Meyers 249 Saker Flash Hider – The newest addition to the B.E. Meyers line of flash hiders. Compatible with the Silencerco Saker silencer series. $120

Magpul CTR Buttstock – An excellent Mil-Spec adjustable buttstock. A favorite in the industry. Everyone Loves Magpul. $60

Magpul MOE + Pistol Grip – A nice secure pistol grip. You can lose your grip on this one. Excellent if you’re worried about getting water, blood, or oil on your grip during use. $24

Cross Machine and Tool AR-15 UPUR-1 Billet Upper Receiver – An extra upper receiver so you can get started on your next project. This also has a black anodized finish, but you’ll notice that the anodizing is slightly different than what you’ll see on the mega receiver. If you for some reason prefer this finish that you always have the option of changing receivers. $209

From Daniel Defense Directly:


The evolution of the SPR comes home to Daniel Defense in the MK12.  Born of necessity, raised in the Army’s Marksmanship Unit and refined to Daniel Defense Mil-Spec+ standards, it is now available.


The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible.  These barrels, some of the most accurate and durable barrels available, are bead blasted and chemically passivated to resist corrosion.  The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM.  The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated.  The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation.  The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0™ allowing for your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor.


The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements.  We equipped it with the Geissele SSA® 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target.  This precision rifle comes finished with Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™ and is furnished with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

In my book, NIB includes purchased but never fired. LNIB I would consider to be less than 200 rounds through the pipe and impeccably maintained. No obvious blemishes or wear marks. No carbon build-up of any kind. Ie., if she's been fired a few times and maintained with CLP alone, that's probably not going to fall within my definition of LNIB and wouldn't be willing to pay top dollar. I may still consider a gun with a little more use on her if she's been been well taken care of, though.

The command tower has dial on both side and make a sound during cursor is moving. The tower has a very nice stamp - eagle with swastika and letter M (Marine).
Previous owner of this tower was a famous collector from Luxemburg - Schmit (recently he is died). He had this item  in his collection 60+ years. According his story this command tower is from Z15 Erich Steinbrinck Destroyer (it was damaged in 1943 and sold for scrap in 1958).

History:
At the outbreak of the Second World War Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine had 21 destroyers (Ger: Zerstörer) in service, while another one was just being completed. These 22 vessels - comprising 3 classes (Type 34, 34A and 36) - had all been built in the 1930s, making them modern vessels (no destroyers remained in German hands following the close of the First World War). Including that final pre-war vessel, a further 19 were brought into service during the war and more were captured from opposing navies, including the Italian Navy (Regia Marina) after the Italian Armistice with the Allies in 1943.
German destroyer classes were generally known by the year of their design. Because of their size, use and weaponry, some vessels classified as ""fleet torpedo boats"", Flottentorpedoboot, are also described.
Class general characteristics are taken from the first of each class, and may differ slightly for individual ships, particularly when they were refitted. Post-war, some surviving ships had significant changes to armament."

Really two scopes in one, ideal for dangerous game, running shots and harsh light. An adjusable red dot, precisly centered on the reticle, can be turned on as conditions apply providing a quick aim point much like the front bead on a shotgun. Turned off, the flash dot functions like a regular scope. At low power, it offers ""binocular vision"" allowing you to find your target and shoot with both eyes open. 1 ) Select the appropriate brightness for the existing light conditions by turning the adjustment knob to one of 10 click stops. Best results are achieved when the reticle is just bright enough to see. lf you set it too bright for the lighting conditions, your eye will adjust to the reticle rather than your target. Experiment in different situations and always try to see the reticle brightness ahead of time in case you need to take a quick shot. 2) Even in poor light, the click stops allow you to quickly find the illumination level most suitable for the conditions. Once you have selected the proper setting, you can switch off the light and preserve the battery by slightly moving the knob out of the chosen click stop. This will turn off the light but let you turn it back on in a fraction of a second. 3) The standard, readily available battery (CR2032/3V or DL2032/3V) will last up to 60 hours. You should, of course, switch off the light when not needed and turn the knob to 0 when you are not using the scope. 4) To change the battery, unscrew the turret cover, remove the old battery and install the new one with the positive (+) side facing out. lt is imperative that you tighten the cap securely to keep out moisture. You can now hunt with the confidence that you have given yourself the advantage of one of the highest quality, most advanced ."

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

Rifle has a matching receiver, bolt and bayonet lug with an intact mum. It is missing it's cleaning rod. It is a Series 4 Nagoya Arsenal rifle with no import marks whatsoever, so the lack of import marks and an intact mum could very well make this a bringback rifle. The ammo is three boxes of Graf & Sons and one box of Norma.

I am asking $400 for the rifle and $120 for the ammo, or $500 for all of it.

The rifle includes three WWII surplus Japanese stripper clips (two brass and one late war steel).

I might be willing to part with a Japanese Type 30 bayonet to go with the rifle for an additional $100 if anyone wants that too, but if not then I'm perfectly fine holding on to it with the rest of my Japanese stuff.

Only trades I'm interested in is 5.45x39 ammo and 5.45x39 AK magazines"
