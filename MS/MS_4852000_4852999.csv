The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology.

Has a bobtail job and cerakoted professionally.  Frame cerakoted in a black/burnt bronze mix.  Giving it more of a deep brown look. Bobtail is a great upgrade from the factory pointed grip.  Much easier to conceal.  Has VZ grips that were filed down, polished off and molded in with the grip instead of just the standard bobtail grips that don't run flush with the lines of the frame, making this gun extremely comfortable to shoot.  Gun has had exactly 65 rounds through it. I bought it new and have kept it well.  If you want a clean, semi custom 1911 that shoots great and don't want to pay full custom price for one, this is one to check out.  Absolutely no marks on the frame.  The only holster wear is on the back of the slide flat where the button on my holster rubbed it but it's not through the finish or anything like that, just kind of a blurred scuff.  If interested or have any questions or need more pics, feel free to text and let me know.  Gun will come with box and factory mag it came with. Thank you, and be sure to thank a Vet., and thank God for their courage.  Have a nice day.    Only reason for selling is to get something smaller for ccw.  Thanks again. 501551349zero"

I have an echo1 MP5 airsoft I'd like to sell. This is high quality and all metal. If you would like to look it up it is a task force black model that has been discontinued. It used to have an adjustable stock but I switched to a full size mp5 stock to hold a larger battery. I also have an 11.1v lipo battery with charger... At 11.1v full auto is well over 1000rpm. It is fully functional and in great shape. I just don't have time for airsoft anymore. It will also come with the clamp to mount a red dot and 8 mags. 5 mags are 30round and 3 are hicap (200rd I believe) the fake suppressor is removable to show the required orange tip. I have about $350 in this and it is not a cheap piece. Asking $150"

The upper includes a full auto bolt carrier, 1/7 twist bbl, standard A2 flash hider, stainless gas tube attached to a lo-pro gas block utilizing a standard carbine length gas system for reliability all hidden underneath a 9"" free flaot system with removable rail sections.     Attached to the upper is a mil-spec Andeerson MFG multi-cal lower receiver with Anderson MFG lower parts kit and there very own single stage match grade stainless steel FCG(hammer&trigger) designed and matched specifically to this lower receiver. This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil when using an AR-style pistol.     Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0” – 1.2” in diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.This is as close to an AR15 SBR as you can get without the long waiting period and $200 tax stamp required by the ATF. These do not last long and this had 20rds fired to ensure reliability and funcionality only. With a 10.5"" bbl and carbine length gas system you do not end up with the issues that many other shorter barrel AR15's end up having with feeding, extraction, and gas issues. Stop in and check her out today before she gets sold as they do not last long. For a limited time we are throwing in an NcStar Red dot sight at no additional charge."

Also has sling swivels for leather rifle sling. There is also a buttplate trapdoor compartment for carrying the magazine or spare mag.

Very nice shooting gun for sure. It also has custom stippling that is rough enough to be useful, but not so rough that it is uncomfortable to wear in the IWB holster.

True 4.5 pound trigger, set to .49 trigger pull, 5.31"" barrel and so on.
Gun is 700+ if you can get your hands on one. Please DONT confuse it with a standard 650.00 34. Completely different!.
Its got a Burris Fast fire 3 thats mounted on it, was 250.00 and is is new as the gun is. Very VERY nice setup.
I shoot a Modded 17 and was given this gun to try and i'd rather just keep my 17 setup so i don't have to relearn the 34. Fired no more than 100 rounds. Comes with orignal box, back straps, rail covers, paper work and so on.
Asking 700.00 for the combo or will take 600.00 for the gun alone. 
That will save you 250.00 and nearly 70.00 in tax. If thats not good enough, I'm sorry, this may not be the gun for you...

Selling or trading my S&W MP Shield 40 with Green CT Laser. Has never been shot (welcome to check for yourself). Bought new just a couple of months ago and have never gotten out to shoot it (though I've shot Shields before). No problems with it, just want a 9mm instead.

Holsters are pretty hard to find for this gun when you buy the Green Laser version, but Vedder makes good holsters so I bought the IWB Lightuck Kydex which is included with it. Fits like a glove. Bundle also includes 50 Federal FMJ round and a couple dozen Remington Home Defense HP rounds. Gun has two mags, the smaller of which has the Pearce extended pinky grip. Lastly it includes a pistol zip rug case that's cushioned (nothing fancy) for when I put it in my backpack. The gun gets unlimited free battery replacements from Crimson Trace (the laser is $299 on the CT website).

Will consider offers and trades.  Cash only. Bill of sale and proof of age (when not obvious) required."

Processed through a Scharch Auto Reamer processor which does the following: Identifies any non 9x19 rounds and removes them (380, makarov, 38 super etc..), Pressure checks, checks for cracked cases, decaps, REAMS (NOT SWAGE) primer pocket to remove military crimp and lastly checks for a clear primer pocket. The brass is then washed again to remove any case lube or remaining grime and to clean out primer pocket. Finally we size it so that it is load ready.

I recently purchased a Benelli M4 shotgun for an awesome deal, so now I am selling my Mossberg 930SPX to replenish some of the funds. I purchased this a few months ago and have fired an estimated 150 rounds through the shotgun.

I have had the shotgun for a few months, so it will come in the original box. When I initially made the purchase, I purchased multiple accessories. The sale will come with the following accessories:

1) Mossberg 930 SPX w/original box
2) Choate Pistol Grip Stock and Regular Rifle Stock (see photo)
3) Asgard Defense 2 Round Shell Holder (attaches to picatanny rail-see photo)
4) Elite Tactical Defense Bobcat Forend (w/ 3 picatanny rails-see photo)
4) GG&G Front & Rear Sling Attachments
5) Tactical Enlarged Safety Lever
6) Blackhawk Flashlight Mount
7) Ghost Ring Rear Sight
8) The sidesaddle is velcro'd on the shotgun. If you do not like it, peel off the Velcro. I do not like sticking sidesaddle screws in the receiver.
(9) Flashlight does not come with the sale.

Everything is available for inspection if you are a local. I am willing to let everything go for $725.00 Of course, you pay transfer fees."

True stereo meaning it uses two separate imaging tubes, one for each eye. It was developed during the mid 80s by the Novosibirsk instrument-making plant (Новосибирского приборостроительного завода) as a successor/update to the PNV-57. Its performance is similar to that of the US made AN/PVS-5. Produced in the Soviet Union and later on under license in Czechoslovakia, it was the most used night vision device among Soviet forces. Even today it still sees limited use within the Russian Army. Since the Soviets fought against the Mujaheddin in Afghanistan at that time, it saw its first combat use pretty quick. Initially it was reserved for helicopter pilots only, but was issued to tank crews also to replace their old PNV-57 later on. As it was mainly used by drivers and pilots the importance of the two separate tubes become clear. They allow for a stereoscopic vision, which is obviously a requirement for that sort of purpose. The squarish box worn on the back of the helmet contains a 12v or 24v transformer connected to the vehicle’s 12 or 24 volt system. However this night vision even runs with 6V or anything up to 24V. I hooked this up to a 9V battery box that is included. field of view: 30 °magnification: 1-1.2 xrefreshment rate: 35 Hzdiopter setting: +/- 4 dioptersvoltage input: 12V or 24Vvoltage output: 14kV – 19.5kVHowever the field of view is definitively more then 30°. I assume they refer to the field of view which is not obstructed by the fish-eye effect. If you have any questions email or text me at REDACTED. Thanks for looking"

The Rifle has been assembled by my local gun store (1stClassFirearms)

The firearm is still brand new. Shoots like a dream, barely any recoil with the Strike industries Muzzle break along with the JP Enterprise recoil piston system. Each and every part that was upgraded from original has a reason, if you would like to know why please just ask. Also Have More pictures but only a max of 3 could be uploaded if you want more let me know!

Has previous salvage title due to cost of replacing steering column exceeding cost of vehicle, since now has previous salvage title. Runs and drives great. Only drive it maybe 40 miles a month, got it to just haul stuff that was too big for the car. We have since got an automatic truck (so wife can drive it as well when needed), only reason for selling. The speedometer and odometer went out about 8 weeks ago (but all the rest of the gauges still work fine), I never cared so haven't replaced it but this is a common problem in these fords and you can get the instrument cluster off ebay for about $45.
