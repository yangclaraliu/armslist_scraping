This one has a long history (as told to me by my Grandfather) on how it came into our possession - These were Army revolvers, sold to the RCMP when our Military went to the 1911's.  Then, after WW 2 the RCMP went to the P-38, and sold these with a choice of chamber for 455, 45 autorim or 45 Colt - I have another listing for the 45 autorim that I have.  My Grandmother purchased these back in the late 1940's after WW2 and have been in our family ever since.  Comes with Box and Pictured Ammo - a little over 200 rounds.  The Box is one that I found that just looked nice it is a hard wood box with hinges.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK light pull trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall crisp break. Typically striker fired guns have a pre travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. The VP9 you have a less than noticeable pre travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable back straps and six side panels accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest state of the art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left or right handed shooters.A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine 15 and 10 round capacity available.The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 M700009-A5"

Rifle has a few hundred rounds through it. Will make one hole five shot groups at 100 yards all day long. It has taken it's fair share of critters, but I now have a different rifle I use more. 

I've got well over $500 into the setup.

Outstanding pistol that fits great in your hand and has a clean, crisp trigger.   I like the trapezoidal sites but they can be switched to 3-dot if you prefer.  Easy takedown and cleaning, and key lock can disengage completely for added security.  I’ve put about 1,000 rounds through it, including some steel case; handles everything very well.  I shot many test pistols before picking this one because of it’s ergonomics and because it just shot well.

I thought perfect for me to try appendix carry, but I am still too fat. So, off it goes. Once I purchased it, I had additional custom work done by Sweaty Muddy Bloody (now sadly retired). This included a full grip reduction to 1911-ish shape, heavy stippling for greater grip, stippled pads for indexing trigger finger or off hand, relieving the area around the mag release button for easier access, and half-moon cuts to allow pulling out a tight magazine (as the 10-rounders seem to be). Comes with one mag, more G19 (15 round) available with purchase at a discount.

I have back half of a Remington model 24 but never could find a barrel for it.

I just traded for what i though was a complete 1922 model 22 short rifle but its missing the extractor assembly just to see if my machinest buddy of mine could modify another barrel to fit my other half but got to looking at it and figured just a little too much work to do it so i am just going to sell both


with the 1922 rifle the wood was refinished and looks really nice the outer surface of the barrel is rusty but not pitted the blue if it ever hand is is gone from the receiver and its missing the extractor and the barrel although will attach and hold has a lot of slop in it

Sierra MatchKing BulletsDesigned for Service Rifle competition in the M16A2/AR-15A2, our 22 caliber bullets have set an incredible number of new national records.

While they are recognized around the world for record-setting accuracy, MatchKing® and Tipped MatchKing® bullets are not recommended for most hunting applications.  Although MatchKing® and Tipped MatchKing® bullets are commonly used for varmint hunting, their heavier jackets will not provide the same reliable explosive expansion at equivalent velocities in varmints compared to their lightly jacketed Hornet, Blitz or Varminter counterparts.

The #1380 was introduced in 1984.

Sierra MatchKing bullets have very thin jackets and are held to exacting tolerances in diameter and weight. These Hollow Point Boat Tail bullets have a small meplat to produce a higher ballistic coefficient. Their accuracy has been acclaimed worldwide and they have been used to win more target competitions than all target bullets from other manufacturers combined. This is not loaded ammunition.

This is a S&W K frame revolver chambered in .38 special. This K38 masterpiece is an early 5 screw pre model 14 gun. The K38 features an adjustable a six shot cylinder, rear target sight, a wide target hammer and a grooved target trigger. It has a 6 groove backstrap, and a pined and recessed barrel. This is also a ""CTG"" gun. The original wood grips were replaced long ago with wood target grips. The original owner also added a Bo-Mar sight riser that sits along the top of the gun. It is easily removed if you don't like it. There is some slight bluing loss at the nose of the barrel, on the front edge of the cylinder and along the ejection rod. There is also a line around the cylinder from being shot. I believe the serial number dates this gun to 1954, which would make sense as I purchased both the K38 and K22 from the same individual (and he was the original owner). If you're interested, send me a message and I'll be happy to share the serial number with you so that you can do your own research.

It is the current production model, with eight ports on either side of the front end, just back of its tube threads, for reduction in felt recoil. Almost all Mossberg 500 twelves are five shot, and the magazine tube measures exactly 14 inches long from the receiver. Manufacturer is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, Connecticut. Factory sku number is 90130. Construction is entirely steel, except for the white bead front sight’s exterior, and the brass middle alignment bead that sits between the fifth and sixth posts of the ventilated rib. Finish is standard Mossberg blue. Sight system is standard .370 wide serrated Ventilated rib with double bead, .125 inch clearance above the lug. Length is 28 inches. Choke system is Mossberg Accu-Choke, interchangeable with old style Winchester Winchoke and old style short Browning Invector. Each barrel comes with a total of one choke tube, an Improved Cylinder, .715 diameter at the muzzle, and capable of handling steel shot, lead shot, bismuth, and even rifled slugs and buckshot. This barrel will fit any Mossberg model 500 shotgun chambered in 12 gauge whose magazine tube will hold 5 each 2 3/4 inch shells, and whose magazine tube measures 13 1/2 inches from the receiver face to the end of its magazine tube. That includes over 95 percent of Mossberg 500s in existence today. It also fits Western Auto Revelation 310 series 12 gauge pump shotguns; it also fits Wards Western Field models 505, 509, 524, 534, 536, 539, 550 all variants, because those were made by Mossberg for Western Auto and for Montgomery Wards beginning in the 1960s. It will not fit an 8 shot model 500 whose magazine tube is 19 inches long. It will not fit a 20 gauge Mossberg; will not fit a .410 gauge Mossberg; will not fit the dump lever of a 1947 John Deere Manure Spreader. It will only fit Mossberg 500 series pump or slide action shotguns whose magazine tubes hold five 2 3/4 inch 12 gauge shells. It will not render 1960s and 1970s production shotguns that were chambered only for 2 3/4 inch shells magnum capable. Photo is representative, but each barrel comes from a number 52120, 500 All Purpose® shotgun that was in mint condition, and that we specimens of listed for sale in other ads, accessible from our home page. Surface detractions are negligible. Few if any of the parent shotguns were ever even fired, simply transported with Mossberg sales reps and serving as showgirls at industry trade shows like the annual SHOT show. Replacement pricing on this barrel is well over $200 in most areas. We’re offering the Mossberg 12 gauge 28 inch Ported Vent Rib, double beaded Accu-Choke Barrel in the photos, or one of its identical mates,   for only           $ 149.00.            Add $15.00 for a .694 new Factory Full Choke Tube, $9.00 for a Carlson Wrench.

Perfect for training or target practice when you don't need an expensive hollow point bullet. Lawman loads duplicate the velocities and bullet weights that are loaded in Gold Dot ammo, so your practice is realistic. Uni-core construction virtually eliminates core/jacket separation, the main reason for bullet failure with conventional cup and core bullets. Clean burning propellants deliver optimum velocity while ensuring consistent chamber pressures. Non corrosive CCI primers are used for highly sensitive and reliable performance, and reloadable brass cases are manufactured to tight tolerances for quality assurance.

Tests show that the A5 System reduces the cyclic rate of the M4 Carbine and lowers bolt carrier velocity; and recently, extensive testing conducted on the M16A4 proved that the A5 System was the most reliable and consistent stock system available for that platform! The A5 Buffer and Recoil Assembly was developed by Vltor Weapons for the specific needs of the U.S. Military. As the M16/AR15 series of rifles have evolved into specialized configurations, such as the SPR, M4 and MK 18, each of these designs using a new combination of barrel and gas-systems. Attempts to universally use the standard collapsible stock on all platforms - from M16A4 to the MK18 - have proven unreliable at best. The A5 Buffer and Recoil System takes a new approach to this problem, providing a single collapsing stock and buffer system that can be used on all current configurations of direct impingement systems. The A5 System reduces cyclic rate on the shorter barreled rifles and maintains a much more consistent bolt velocity and rate of fire across all current issue weapons based on the M16.Available in Black, Flat Dark Earth and Foliage Green.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: BASIC COMBO KIT MILSPEC DIAMETER ""A5"" CONVERSION KIT"

Dealers, Departments, and Collectors, however, may take any number of extra very similar specimens of the same variant we might have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no additional shipping charges. The Mossberg model 500 has never been as prestigious as the arch-competitor Remington 870, but it’s just as tried, and just as true. Here is a close descendant to the first Mossberg 500 riot guns that saw increasing action in the United States beginning in 1964. Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Model is 500, All Purpose series; factory sku is 54169 or thereabouts. Type is pump or slide action shotgun. Construction is steel barrel, magazine tube, double slide bars, bolt, trigger and internal parts all built into an alloy receiver that undercuts the 870 on weight. Stock and forend are satin finished American Hardwood with cut checkering on the semi beavertail forend’s underside, and matching pattern to the buttstock pistol grip area laterals. Metal finish is blued steel with semi gloss black anodized receiver. Trigger group housing is high impact black polymer, with .292 gold plated smooth faced steel combat trigger. Safety is top tang type. Barrel is 3 inch chambered 18 1/2 inch matte blue steel plain bead sight, with .730 vicinity Cylinder Bore muzzle. We have added a black polymer heat shield reminiscent of the Winchester Model 12s in action beside the Mossbergs. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 rounds of 3 inch shells, 5+1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells. Weight empty is 6 3/4 pounds, with center of gravity at the breech. Buttstock measures 13 7/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch black rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. All 500 receivers are drilled to accept a Weaver # 88 or 417 series 4 screw optics base. Photo specimen and its mates are what we call factory demos. It served as showgirl for Mossberg’s sales force, on the road with their reps and writers; and at gun industry trade shows like the annual SHOT show in Las Vegas. Surface detractions are minimal, really no more streaking and faint edge whitening than what one sees on lots of new display guns in stores. We rate it as Excellent, 90 to 95 percent vicinity by our estimate. Shoppers can possibly spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. Each 500 custom riot gun comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, and instruction manual that contains Mossberg’s warranty statement. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times. Replacement pricing on mossberg com was well over $400. We’re offering the Mossberg 500 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only $ 259.00. Any ammunition or personnel showing in our photos are Not included. Buyers 21 years or older may add a factory Mossberg Pistol Grip for only $29.00.

Brand new never fired, never even racked the bolt, never even moved the safety, Arsenal SLR-104UR Bulgarian Krinkov! I purchased this rifle from KVAR when they had them, and it has sat in my safe this entire time. I wanted to SBR it, but just don't have the funds or time to complete the project. Needs money for family now so this rifle is leaving the safe. I assure you not a single round has been fired, and if you're local you can swing by to see for yourself. One look and you will agree that it is brand new.

Everything is still in original plastic, never opened!
Comes with one 30 round brand new magazine, circle 10

I am selling the rifle at the cost I paid, I still have the receipt to show you. If you check Arsenal's website they state these rifles are no longer being imported for an undetermined amount of time due to military focus and filling military contracts.

M92 454 Casull Stainless

I love this rifle, but I have decided to down-size.
This is a beauty! I have never seen one like it.
Accurate, Hard Hitting, Versatile- from 45 Long Colt Light Loads to full-house 454 Casull.
Did I mention it is Beautiful? Smooth Action, Fast Target Acquisition.
Effect on target is always a treat! At 100 yards it effortlessly burned through my 1/4"" steel Gong, but it was big fun. At 140 yards I up-ended a 200# Hog.
The 20"" barrel gives opportunity for the 454 Casull cartage to shine.
Just a great all-around hunting and plinking rifle. That's right, I actually plink with 454.

Significantly reduce your shooting cost with the more readily available 9 mm ammo. Last week I purchased a new Lone Wolf .40 to 9 mm conversion barrel as well as Glock factory 9 mm extractor,  trigger housing with 9mm ejector, 9mm spring loaded bearing, an extended magazine release for my Glock G22 .40. I had a friend offer to buy my G22 yesterday and he offered me a price I could not refuse. That being said, I no longer have a need for these parts for I do not own any other .40 caliber Glocks. The pistol will actually function shooting 9 mm ammo out of the factory .40 magazines, but for superior reliability I recommend using the 9 mm Glock mags as well. With shipping, last week I paid close to $160.
