Gunsite Academy founder COL Jeff Cooper thought this an optimum balance of power and controllability for a defensive pistol. The long slide 1911 was conceived to provide even more velocity, with an extended sight radius, to exploit this power for hunting big game with a semi-automatic handgun. The Heinie Long Slide 10mm is the ultimate realization of that concept. It’s 40 ounces of forged steel with the power of the .41 Magnum. It has the reach to smack a wild boar on the other side of the field. It has the precision to precisely place the shot on the monster whitetail slipping through thick, dark timber and, it has the power to bust shoulders, break bones, and even stop a grizzly. If saber tooth tigers still walked the earth we’d all be carrying Heinie Long Slides. You can still pretend and, with a Heinie Long Slide, you can shoot a lot of big game in the process.Features:Match grade, full gunsmith-fit 6-inch barrelForged frame and slideFully adjustable sights with Tritium night sight insertsTactical magazine release for quick magazine changes25 lines per inch checkering on the front strap and mainspring housingBall radius cut on the slideComplete frame and slide preparation removing every sharp edge for comfortable carry"

Pulling from his background in law enforcement, training and his passion for competition allowed a truly special pistol to be formed. Attention to detail starts with the one piece machined steel magwell/mainspring housing for quick and sure reloading of the 4.25 inched barreled Shadow Hawk. You will notice the chiseled look and feel of the black, flat faced trigger preferred by competition shooters. The gun is topped front and rear with Heinie Ledge Black Straigh Eight Tritium night sights. Your hands will quickly notice the high undercut on the trigger guard along with 25 LPI checkering on the front strap. The high beaver tail will amaze you with the almost seamless fit and finish. The black and gray spiral-cut grips add a subtle highlight to the black nitrite finish and the stainless bushing contrasts nicely with the slide and frame. The aggressive cocking serrations are not just for looks but provide a sure purchase to rack the slide. Stainless Steel Frame StandardBlack Nitride FinishOne Piece MagwellHeinie Ledge Straight Eight Front And Rear Tritium Night SightsNighthawk Custom Match Carbon Steel Barrel9mm Standard, Other Calibers AvailableBlack And Gray Spiral Cut Custom GripsHeight: 5.6""Width: 1.46""Length: 7.82""Weight: 36.7 oz.4.25"" Barrel Length"

Both pistols approach the precision found on the Mark 23 by adding an extended threaded barrel with a rubber O-ring, adjustable trigger, and adjustable target-type sights. The .40 S&W Tactical models are built on the USP 9mm/40 caliber frame.Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.  All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.  The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.  Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.  The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes. Features & System Characteristics:      - Threaded O-ring barrel with polygonal bore profile (no O-ring barrel on 9 mm    variants)     - High profile target sights     - Match grade trigger (not present on 9 mm variant)     - Adjustable trigger stop (not present on 9 mm variant)     - Target sights with micrometer adjustment for windage and elevation     - One piece machined, nitro-carburized steel slide     - Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes     - Patented HK recoil reduction system     - Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish     - Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame     - Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves     - Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines     - Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories     - Ambidextrous magazine release lever     - Extended slide release     - Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator     - Patented Lock-Out Safety device"

With a choice of three frame colors (green, tan, or black), the full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components.  The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.  The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy.  Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger.  The HK45T can be converted to nine different kinds of trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) mode. The HK45T is well-suited for military, law enforcement, security use, and civilian sport shooting."

Buy now: http://www.calibersusa.com/beretta/beretta-92gsd-special-duty-j92gsd1m-51560One of the most prized features of the 92G-SD is its Brigadier slide. This slide configuration is instantly recognizable by the two swells on either side of the barrel, located roughly in the center of the pistol, which add weight to the slide without altering the balance. The two main benefits of this slide configuration are 1) that it makes the pistol even more durable and rugged and 2) that it minimizes felt recoil and muzzle jump, making follow-up shots even quicker on target. The Brigadier slide of the 92G-SD accommodates two important features. One is the G-style decocker-only lever that many combat professionals favor over a more traditional safety-decocker function. The reason for this preference is that a decocker-only lever eliminates the need for one additional action--disengaging the safety--upon unholstering and firing. The other is the replaceable night sights, which are dovetail-mounted and offer the user the capability of replacing them with a variety of after-market variants. This model comes packed with a variety of additional features usually found in customized combat handguns costing much more in terms of money and lead-time. To make magazine changes quick and intuitive without taking your eyes off the target, the magazine well is aggressively beveled and the mag-release button extended for a positive feel. Gripping the 92G-SD is also positive, thanks to the deep, crisp grooving and checkering on the front- and backstrap. A Picatinny rail extends in front of the trigger guard, enabling the attachment of a variety of tactical accessories. And lastly, the crowned target barrel offers premium-level accuracy right out of the box. All this, plus the obsessive attention to detail that goes into producing a Beretta tactical pistol, make the 92G-SD a jewel among combat handguns, a joy to own and an experience to shoot."

It shoots 7.65 mm, which is 32 auto. All serial numbers match and the gun is in great condition, especially for its age. Gun still functions flawlessly, if it wasn't a collectors piece, it could even make a great ccw! I have fired about 50 flawless rounds through the pistol without a hiccup. There is great history behind the pistol; it most likely started its life at the end of WW1, its serial number denotes that it was more than likely carried by an Italian officer. These pistols were reliable and saw action into the Second World War. Everything is original on this firearm down to the magazine and wood grips. Someone who is more into history then me could probably tell a lot more by the markings and serial numbers. I do not want to sell the gun, but bills need paid. I hope to get $600, but will entertain all offers and take the best one. You can reach me anytime of the day through texting or calling REDACTED. I can answer any questions you may have regarding the pistol."

All the specifics are on the website but lets just say its an improved, proprietary bolt design that's expected to last far longer than milspec bolts, and addresses the failure points of the military spec. The barrel is cold hammer forged, chrome lined and features an intermediate gas system that softens the recoil impulse. The Lower is completely ambidextrous and the URX3.1 rail system is solid. The two stage trigger is the best out of box trigger I've felt on an AR. The BUIS are top notch and the LMT stock is of course awesome. Added to the rifle were the Magpul K2 grip and Lantac Dragon muzzle brake. It comes with the Flambeau hardcase, manual, and magazine block and lock. Anyhow this things shoots flat and fast. It really is a top of the line AR. I can be reached either by email or by phone/ text at 61 5 28999 60"

The 4506 is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge and, with the purchase of special springs, the stronger .45 Super. It is constructed almost entirely from stainless steel and is thus extremely resistant to harsh weather conditions. The 4506 is a traditional double-action/single-action pistol.

I have been wanting to try one of these and JUST purchased this but have an opportunity to buy another piece I've been eyeing - so looking to let this one go.

This gun is supposed to be FUN to shoot. Accurate, reliable and INEXPENSIVE. Uses the most abundant, least expensive ammo (9mm) so you can shoot more! Good asset to any well rounded gun collection. 

[edit]
This gun IS great to shoot! I've taken it to the range it it functioned flawlessly. Inexpensive ammo and accessories and ACCURATE! Recoil is low, its easy to shoot, and FUN! This is a gun that you'll want to take out and practice with and ammo for it won't break the bank!

I can include 200, 300, or 400, rounds of ammo in addition to the gun. Make offer.

Unless it's the deal of a year I can't afford your Ceasar or Silver Pigeon but I don't want your Tri-Star either. The budget isn't unlimited and I work hard for my money but I want something decent that I will be happy with for a while and can use. If it's already got scratches and dings that's even better, I won't be upset when I ding it. I care about reliability and accuracy more than looks. Do not ask me to spend MSRP on your used gun, my gun store sells below MSRP so I don't even pay that for new. I'm very busy at work and usually out of cell range so it may be a bit till I email back but if I'm interested I will. Thanks.

Factory Description:
Classic Lines, Classic Feel, Modern Features. The Ruger® New Model Blackhawk® is the most advanced single-action revolver ever made. While retaining the solid frame, feel and comfortable grip of the classic single-actions, they feature Ruger’s patented transfer bar ignition system with loading gate interlock, an all-coil spring mechanism, adjustable sights, and frame-mounted firing pin. New Model Blackhawk revolvers have earned a reputation as the best value on the market due to their durability and affordability.

Convertible models come equipped with an extra cylinder and are popular with shooters who appreciate the classic single-action revolver but opt for the versatility of being able to use more than one caliber in their handgun. With its interchangeable cylinder, Convertible models can be easily converted from one caliber to another without the use of tools. This versatility allows avid shooters of autoloading pistols to enjoy shooting a classic American single-action sidearm with their favorite pistol cartridge.

Upon reholstering, simply activate the decocking lever and the pistol is again ready for quick use when you need it. Super-safe against accidental firing, the 92G retains all the legendary qualities of the 92FS, including 3-dot sights, high-capacity magazine, superior accuracy out of the box and more. Ready for Use in a Split Second  Decocker-only means that in the 92G, the slide-mounted lever (safety-decocker in the 92FS) only decocks the hammer. Different tactical shooters demand different features, and some who carry concealed or for duty feel the need for a double-action semiautomatic pistol that only features the decocker without manual safety. This is especially the case if the handgun is part of a system that includes--for instance--striker-fired pistols, which traditionally lack a safety lever. In this manner, shooters may employ a single training routine without worrying about introducing additional motions such as disengaging the safety before firing. With the 92G, tactical shooters who favor a lightning-quick unholster-point routine that does not involve any other actions have the answer to their wishes. Absolutely Safe for Concealed Carry  The 92G features two built-in safety features that make it absolutely secure to carry concealed or on duty. One is an internal rotating-striker mechanism, while the other is a vault-safe firing pin block. Combined, these two safety features physically prevent the firing pin from coming into contact with the live round in the chamber, no matter the circumstances--including if the pistol is dropped hammer-first on hard cement. Simply put, the only way in which the firing pin can strike the primer is if the trigger is pulled. While this is true of all 92-series pistols, it is especially relevant for the 92G, because it grants absolute peace of mind while carrying. Full-Featured Beretta 92  In all other respects besides the decocker-only feature, the 92G offers shooters all the benefits of the celebrated 92 family. These include an open-slide design that greatly minimizes feeding and ejection problems (such as stove-piping) regardless of the ammo used, a cold-hammer forged barrel that gives superior accuracy out of the box, aggressively-checkered grips and backstrap for positive hold, and tool-free disassembly for easy maintenance. In all, the 92G is a fantastic addition to the 92 family, and one that will please the most discriminating tactical shooters who demand the most out of their pistol."

NO OFFER WILL BE CONSIDERED AN INSULT. PLEASE NEGOTIATE! PRICE DRASTICALLY REDUCED, WAS $14,500, NOW A STEAL AT ***$7995***MUST SELL 98 Mauser, Waffnfabrik-Oberndorf Commercial Action, US Big game or Dangerous game rifle, Bolt Action, Caliber, 375 Ruger or Rebarreled to any magnum caliber, your choice. Keep extra bbl.  NOTE:At this price I will change the caliber to any standard belted magnum or .532 base dia. case, <3.6"" OAL. Two barrel set. This gun was contracted by a gentlemen who wanted the finest big game rifle in the world. Built on deposit, he passed away before he could finish payment and take delivery. I'm kinda stuck with it in inventory.  ACTION The commercial, WAFFENFABRIK MAUSER – OBERNDORF, early 20th century, utilizes a large ring with small shank barrel and provides a receiver ring nearly 1/4"" thick around the barrel as opposed to a normal receiver wall of .150 in later Mausers and clones. This action is blueprinted in the following way using custom jigs for all processes. The front ring is cut to the same plane as the inner ring. This required a cut of less than .0005. The recoil lugs are lapped to 90+% contact. The receiver threads are relieved to an H-2 fit. This enables the barrel to self align with the internal and external seating surfaces. The bolt face opened to .532 for magnum family, extractor beveled for controlled and single feed. The bolt face is then lapped to achieve parallelism with all other working surfaces. This action will shoot 1/4 moa if the shooter can do it. Receiver hand polished to 2000 grit, buffed for future engraving and hot blued. Man sized bolt handle is lathe fabricated by me and welded in custom jigs to protect bolt temper. Bolt is beautifully polished and jeweled. The extractor is contrasting hot blued. Bolt release custom checkered and blued, spring jeweled to match bolt. Safety is a 3 position or 2 position, (your choice, mod 70 type) which locks the bolt and lifts the cocking piece off the sear. Trigger is Dayton Traister, 2 to 4 pound adjustable. STOCK AAA fancy California Claro Walnut. The Fiddleback on this collector grade wood extends for the entire length. Classic Monte Carlo Comb with shadow line and 14"" lop. Furnished with Pachmeyer ""Decelerator"" recoil pad. Coco Bolo tip and grip cap accents. Finished with 20 coats of hand rubbed polyurethane varnish, uv resistant and non yellowing. The barrel is free floated and the action is glass bedded with two steel recoil bolts hidden by Coco Bolo inlaid plugs. Action pillars are glass bedded into the stock. Stock is hand checkered in a very generous classic 22 lpi pattern. Inlaid custom rear two screw sling swivel stud. Custom made barrel band with front swivel. BOTTOM METAL 03-A3 Springfield, machined bottom metal. Chosen as the most elegant form of 3.6"" magazine. Custom hinged and retained with Mod 70 type plunger retainer for maximum convenience and security. Hand polished for flatness and hot blued with receiver. Custom hex head action bolts, hardened and Neider blued. This gun was originally contracted for $17,500 but only deposits were paid. It comes with ammo and 375 Ruger dies. This was a year long project and I need to sell it so I will take offers far below the original price. Rifles of this quality regularly sell for over $20,000. If you don't like the caliber, I can re-barrel for any belted magnum cartridge. This would then be a two barrel set. This beautiful firearm has been machined, hand fitted, hand finished by me."

If you do not know about these guns you should look them up.  They are really cool.... they are made from aircraft grade aluminum and are great for conceal carry.  The barrel is on the bottom of the cylinder instead of the top so it reduces the amount of lift from the recoil so as a result your recovery for your point of aim is a lot faster.

With decades of reliable performance to its credit, the J-frame line offers models capable of firing .22 LR, .22 Magnum, .38 S&W Special and the more powerful .357 Magnum loads.

This rifle is a LEAD rebuild,considered by many to be the most desirable rebuild.( almost all M1 rifles were rebuilt after WW2 and Korea) this rifle has an IHC receiver,operating rod and bolt. It has a milled Springfield armory trigger group and a Springfield 1952 barrel. The barrel has a muzzle reading of 1 and throat reading of 3, these are very good numbers. This is a CMP rifle that comes with the certificate and everything that came with it including a heavy duty case. It does have the LEAD triangle stamp on the birch stock. I have fired about 50 rounds with it to ensure good function. This is the kind of rifle that the gun show guys ask $2000 or more for,when you can find one. I would be glad to answer any questions or E -Mail more pictures. Face to face only at my shop in Dixie Manor shopping center.  Sorry I have to list the manufacturer as Springfield as Internationl harvester is not an option.  Please no silly low ball offers,for sale only- no trades. Thanks for looking!"
