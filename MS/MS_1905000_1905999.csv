Constructed with a hammer forged slide and an injection molded polymer

double action only autoloader in .40 S&W that weighs a mere 22.6 ounces. It
joins Taurus' family of ultra compact personal defense Millennium
autoloaders. The Model PT140 features a 10 round magazine capacity for 10+1
firepower, but the most central feature of the gun is its rugged recoil
operated action instead of the simple blowback mechanisms found on many
other pocket size pistols.

This will be a perfect Varminter for someone.
I bought this May 26th, 2013.
Paid $470 for it.
Also  8.50-20x50mm Mueller Eradicator Scope...$239 +tax.and Rings, $23.
The scope has been mounted for my eye relief, but NOT bore sighted...so you will need to adjust for your shooting style.
I got this to take Prairie Dog Hunting but plans fell thru and I am looking to sell or trade this...with or without scope.
For those 'scope bashers' who only like or use Nightforce, Schmidt & Bender or Swarovski scopes...well good for you :) I have had 4 of these Muellers on my rifles from 17HMR up to 300 Win Mags and I LOVE these things...
NEVER had any failures.
The Redding Cometition Seating Die was $110.00 alone, at GRAF,
Brass was $40.00 at Cabelas, 
Redding Body Die was $30 at Midway 
Lee Collet Dies were also $30.00 
Ammo was $44.00 for two boxes..
So to replace these...at least $250.00+++++


I have over $900 in This Package...!!
Cash is $599

Idiotic offers will be treated with the respect they deserve.

I am retired and trade for fun and to try different guns...so let's keep it fun for all.

Trades I would look at:
I really like, BUT NOT limited to:
.45 acp 1911 handguns...but also .357 wheel guns in Carry size,
Open to Interesting Trades...Sorry, No Shotguns, No Blackpowder.

Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a
top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and
usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S,
the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.

This 338 Win. Mag. load offers the rapid initial expansion of the tipped (TTSX) TSX bullet, yet it still penetrates deeply as do all TSX style bullets. This bullet is best suited for use on animals under 800 lbs where the greater impact damage is beneficial and where enormous amounts of penetration are wasted. Even though I have killed 1500lb moose (with one shot) with this exact load, I prefer the deeper penetration of our item 52B (225gr. TSX) for animals that large."

Matched with the simple and ultra-reliable blowback operating system, the HK USC is a radical departure from traditional firearms designs. Extensive use of the same durable, reinforced polymers used on HKs line of military and police arms ensures lightweight and durability. And the highest grade of weapons steel is used where it matters in the cold hammer forged target barrel and the solidly constructed bolt mechanism. User ergonomics are not sacrificed. The skeletonized buttstock is topped with a comfortable rubber cheek rest and recoil pad. The web of the pistol grip is open for a comfortable shooting handhold. Hard points located on the top and front of the receiver make attachment of optional Picatinny rails easy, allowing almost any kind of sighting system or accessory to be mounted."

For the few that do, this shouldn't be overlooked.
Bought this sweet thing a year ago. While I was big into archery, this was my dream bow. Being such, it was only used for a few flight shooting sessions and sat in its box for a year. Need to find it a new home, with an owner that'll use it more. This thing's up there with other $500+ traditional bows. Completely handmade by a master Korean bowyer. Amazing speed and cast, out-ranged my 60 LB Samick and 100 LB wooden English longbow. Very smooth draw out to 31"", with minimal stacking.



It's 55#@31"" with a max draw of 33"". Shortest traditional bow I've seen, measuring at 48"" strung.

I stuck velcro on the shooting side to silence the strike of the arrow, and protect the leather from shaft wear.

Comes with string, Korean archery belt/arrow holder/pocket, in original box.

This is a modded PS3, allows you to rent games burn them to the external, return game and keep playing it off of the external hard drive. I have a slim PS3 with 79 games. This is jailbroken and you don't buy games; it has CFW Rogero 4.40 and Multiman 4.30 installed. You can play online and there has never been a problem with it. Selling it because I don't really play games anymore. Also selling my Wii. It is like I said a slim PS3 and plays online. It has a 500GB internal hard drive and a 1TB external hard drive, 2 controllers and the HDMI cord. This also has the ability to play PS1 or PS2 roms. They are super easy to get and free. If you have any questions ask. Thanks.

I have a question about a value on a gun. I was contacted by a lady selling some guns that her husband had left behind and she had a gun that I had never dealt with before. It is a lever action 357 marlin (looks just like my marlin 30/30). I did some checking on these and I believe it to be a 1894c model and it has a leupold scope mounted on top. I am trying to find out what it is worth, IE what someone like yourself would be willing to pay for it as it sits. I know that you could buy them for like 600ish a while back but now every site appears to be sold out and out of stock on them. So, I was wondering what kind of market price these have now. It is in near perfect condition cosmetically and functionally. I know that my 30/30 sells for like 350 in great condition, but she is talking numbers a good amount higher for hers. What kind of value do these have? I do have a picture of it, but it just shows zero wear or damage on it. I just didnt want to take advantage of her or overspend on the gun because Ive never dealt with one before. My cell is REDACTED if you want to shoot me what you think shes valued at or just email me here. Please only TEXT or EMAIL as I am at work or school 99% of the time so I cant really answer to talk on the phone. But if you cannot do either of those simply call and I will answer if I can, or just leave a voicemail.Thanks in advance for all yalls help on this.

They only made 750 of these with this barrel length (confirmed in the blue book of gun values).  This is one of the most collectible Rugers out there.  

Here is a quote from a gunblast article:

""The 7-1/2” and 10” barrel lengths were also introduced in 1959 as part of the Type 4 production.  The April 10, 1959 Distributor price sheet lists the 6-1/2” and 7-1/2” suggested retail price as $96.00 and the 10” as $106.00  Production number estimates of the 7-1/2” and 10” barrel guns vary.  It is generally believed that between 1,000 to 1,500 guns with 10” barrels were made.  The 7-1/2” barrel estimates seem to vary quite widely.  Estimates of 750 to 2,750 believed produced have been given by different sources.  For what it is worth, my personal observation of 7-1/2” versus 10” barreled .44 Flattops over the years tends to support a lower or middle of the road estimate.  When thinking of the ones that I have handled, seen, and/or heard of, it supports that there were fewer, or at least no more, 7-1/2” Flattops made than the 10” guns.  No matter what the estimates, both of these longer barrel .44 “Flattops” are rare!  They are some the most desirable and sought after guns by collectors today.""

You can read the whole article here: http://www.gunblast.com/Hamm_44-Flattop.htm 

I also posted this on the Ruger Collectors Association forum which you can see here: http://www.rugercollectorsassociation.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=6564&e=0 

I do not have the original box or paperwork.  Everything else is original.  Original grips, sights, finish & trigger/hammer mechanism (has not had the Ruger safety upgrade).  

There is some holster wear at the muzzle and on the cylinder.  There is wear on the cylinder where the sight adjustment screw was down all the way.  There is also a small chip in the bottom of the frame by the grip.  I can only post three pictures with this listing.  I can send more pictures upon request.

This gun functions perfectly and is very, very accurate.

Standard charging handle, standard bolt carrier group. Comes with muzzle brake. Good shooter with low recoil due to the weight and muzzle brake. I will not be selling the lower.
