It was a well used police trade in then and has many hundreds of rounds through it since. Hardly broken in! The original butt stock has been replaced with a Speed Feed model that holds four additional shells for quick reloads righty or lefty. Also has an enlarged recoil taming buttpad for those full house slug loads. That stock retails for about $110. Has the heat shield and the SafariLand/Speed Feed fore-end on it, too. That's another $50. Also has a six shot side saddle that goes for about $30. Total rounds on and in the gun can be 16 and that's a lot of firepower.

Looking to move into another Mossberg model for three gun and HD. This gun is no spring chicken but well cared for and well made. If it doesn't sell I'll hang onto it and not be unhappy about it.

You can get a brand new six-shot Mav 88 at Academy Sports out the door for $206 taxes and all so with the extras already installed I'm going to ask two-fifty for this 12 banger. Has never failed to rack, chamber, go into battery or go bang!

Rounds shown in the photo are not included, just there to show how many rounds this bugger carries.

Also interested in trades so what have you got? AM NOT interested in wooden stock anything, AK/SKS, anything hunting oriented. Am more a practical/tactical type shooter."

The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually de-cocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.Chambering : 9mm LugerMagazine Capacity : 14Magazine Type : Double StackFrame : SteelGrips : PlasticTrigger Mech : DA/SASights : FixedBarrel : Cold Hammer ForgedBarrel Length : 3.800 inWeight : 2.030 lbsOverall Length : 7.240 inHeight : 5.030 inWidth : 1.380 inSafety : Manual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block SafetyShop online CZ Pistols"

$1400 plus shipping. These are factory made and amazing. I am only willing to trade 1:1 on a Preban IMI model B uzi in similar or better condition. At the moment I am not interested in anything else. I'm not going to add cash unless you have a bunch of extras, this is a VERY fair trade for both of us.

Description:  The SR-556 offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art. 

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

I have a 2003 Yamaha V-Star 650 (XVS65/A) that I am looking to sell or trade. The V-Star is in fantastic condition and has an easy 6547 miles on it (subject to go up). The bike has no issues and has a clean title in my name, however I would suggest to have the carbs cleaned due to some fowling being present causing the choke to be open a little more to idle. I wouldn't second think hoping on it and riding to Nashville in it's current state. It has a few upgrades aftermarket chrome exhausts (sounds nothing like a 600cc and would have to hear to appreciate) running boards / radio (not wired) / windscreen / new battery / saddle bags and backrests. I currently have the windscreen / saddle bags and backrests off but can all be placed before purchase in 10 minutes. Bike has been garage kept and will come with a cover as well. Purchaser must have cash in hand to test ride and a valid M-License. I would be open to,

Seller must be willing to sign bill of sale and provide a copy of a government issued photo ID. I will do the same. I am a legal and responsible firearms enthusiast and seller not requiring a bill of sale is a huge red flag.

I might consider other models but prefer that the criteria below are met. Offer can be adjusted to value of specific item. I'm trying to keep my budget in the $400 range.

- Full metal frame; I don't want a poly receiver. That's a deal breaker so no M&P's (already have one and looking to add a rock solid and reliable workhorse to my collection).
- Stainless preferred.
- 9mm Luger preferred (might consider the right .380 or .40)

607,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4484607,"For Sale:  NEW COLT ""PYTHON"" ~  6"" BLUE BARREL (early style) ONLY! **PRICE UPDATE!**","North Phoenix, Phoenix, Arizona",$ 500,"Listed On: Saturday, July 4, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"OK, I STILL HAVE THIS BARREL.  I don't want to marry it so it's time to move it along.  I've dropped my price $100... LET'S TALK!  TELL ME YOUR INTEREST.

*******PHOTO!!!******  THERE IS ONLY ONE (1)  BARREL IN THIS PICTURE,  I WANTED TO SHOW BOTH SIDES (LEFT AND RIGHT) SO I ""CLONED"" TWO PICS TOGETHER!!!!!  ALSO, I ""PHOTOSHOPED"" THE ""HIGHLIGHTS"" TO SHOW JUST HOW PERFECT IT IS!!!!      ***** PLEASE READ THIS*****

I have ONE NEW COLT  (no OE packaging) ""PYTHON"" BARREL, IT IS A  6"" BLUED COLT BARREL With the TWO HOLES  (EARLY DESIGN) (2 holes)  for the front site mount  (THIS HAS NO FRONT SITE ON IT, NOR HAS ONE EVER BEEN MOUNTED ON IT)...

THIS BARREL HAS THE  3 (qty)  ""PORTS"" on the top of this COLT BARREL.. They are shown in the pictures.

As for the ""LENGTH"".  I have this set  next to a ruler.  REMEMBER ~ You measure the whole length of the barrel from the tip of it's threads to the end of the bore.

Colt ""Python"" 6"" BLUED Barrol, 2 Hole front sight (NO SITE INCLUDED), 3 ""Vent"" ports on top,   To my knowledge this has NEVER had a round ""FIRED"" through it, I say this because MOST manufacturers fire 1~3 shots or more THROUGH COMPLETE ASSEMBLED GUNS. 

As for PRICE, I had been told a few different ways to price it.  I like the thought of $100 PER INCH, which makes this a $600 NEW BARREL!   Talk to me if you have interest!

As for ""SHIPPING"", I'll deal with that, If I have to pack it I will, AND IT WILL BE PROPERLY PACKED (probably foam encased in a box) and I think that should be worth about $15 and then ""shipping COST"", well I have no control over that, so it will have to be priced per shipping choice (I would recommend FedEx OVERNIGHT,  it's worth the difference to me)  I would recommend INSURANCE,  at least that is what I would do if I was the buyer. Usually it's about a $1or so per hundred of value (IIRC) (I would really ""OVER VALUE"" this and list it as a ""vase"" or something....).

Now it comes to ""funds"" GENUINE POSTAL MONEY ORDERS WORKS FOR ME!!!..  IF YOU ARE NOT LOCAL TO ME.  CASH works IF YOU ARE LOCAL to me.   The ""buyer"" will have ample time and availability to not only contact me BUT I will offer up something that no one has ever OFFERED TO  me... A VIDEO CALL, Skype, Facebook, ETC. (now that is IF YOU ARE NOT LOCAL TO ME.)  Some service that is mutual to you and me.  This offer is so you can see exactly what I'm going to put in a box for you.  

I would really NOT want to ""track another"" one of these barrels (in this condition) down because of ""cheap freight"" or NO INSURED VALUE...  I hope you understand this.

***LAWS*** PLEASE KNOW YOUR LAWS!  I am no lawyer, nor do I want to be one.  AZ is a pretty straight forward state...   I just don't know ""other states"" even when it comes down to ""GUN parts""... 

So..$600 + $15 + Shipping method $TBA + INSURANCE $TBA = FUNDING CLEARS MY WELLS FARGO BANK in Phoenix, AZ 85024.... THEN YOU WILL OWN THIS BARREL.

BTW... I think this falls into the ""antique firearms Parts ""category"" for whatever....

I am going to put this ad up on multiple sites tonite, EVERY site will have the same deal and terms, so.... The FIRST ""DONE DEAL"" will get the ball rolling for me and we will walk thru this nice and clean!
