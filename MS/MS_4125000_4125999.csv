These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Postal Money Order/Certified Check or Credit Card.

The announcement that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) will suspend its proposed framework to ban M855 ammunition validates the NRA’s assertion that this effort was nothing more than a political maneuver to bypass Congress and impose gun control on the American people.

""Today’s announcement proves what we have said all along -- this was 100% political. President Obama failed to pass gun control through Congress, so he tried to impose his political agenda through executive fiat. But every gun owner in America needs to understand Barack Obama’s hatred of the Second Amendment has not changed,"" said Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the National Rifle Association.

Chris Cox, Executive Director of NRA-ILA criticized the dishonest campaign to ban this common ammunition: “The lies used to justify the ban were shameful. This proposal was never about law enforcement safety – it was about the Obama Administration’s desire to pander to billionaire Michael Bloomberg and his gun control groups. Since they haven’t been able to ban America’s most popular rifle, they are trying to ban the ammunition instead.”
Since the BATFE announced its plan to ban commonly used ammunition less than a month ago, the NRA rallied its five million members and tens of millions of supporters across the country in strong opposition. In addition, the NRA worked with congressional leaders in both the U.S. House and Senate to oppose this misguided proposal.

“The NRA would like to thank House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and House Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman John Culberson for leading the fight against this unconstitutional attack on our Second Amendment freedoms,” continued Cox. “This was a significant victory for our five million members and tens of millions of supporters across the country.

“Make no mistake, this fight is not over. We will remain vigilant and continue to fight against President Obama’s attempt to dismantle the Second Amendment,” concluded LaPierre.

I'm setting up... and have experience in... restoring stainless pistol finishes, especially S&W Gen 3 and earlier.

I will be offering:

1. S&W ""Frosted"" finish as on Gen 3 and earlier pistols.

2. ""Brushed Finish"" as on S&W stainless Gen 2 ""two tone"" frosted/brushed stainless pistols as well as various revolver cylinders.

3. ""Satin Finish"" as found on many manufacturers slides and revolvers.

If you have a light weight aluminum alloy frame, I have a source I can refer you to, to refinish aluminum alloy frames as found on 6906, 669, 4013 and other aluminum frame models (using Duracoat).

I do not offer buffing or polishing, only media blasting of small parts (slides, frames, receivers, etc.) to create the above finishes and... hand finishing to restore/create brushed finishes.

Understand... I do the refinish.  You... or someone else... disassembles the parts.  I can disassemble/reassemble S&W and Glock autos but have no experience yet with other manufacturers.  1911's are next on my list.  At this time I ""job-out"" other manufacturers components to a local gunsmith.

If you have any of the above and are willing to take the risk of letting me restore your pistol frame/slide/small parts to like/near new condition, then reply to this email.  I'm legit, just an old guy that wants to keep busy and make a few bucks to pay his ""Obamacare"" bill.

CONDITIONS !!!:

At this time, I prefer you are local to Toledo and you deliver in person.  You see me and I see you and we can discuss your expectations.  If you're out of the Toledo area, email me to discuss your needs.  I do work with an FFL so I can receive and ship frames.

Price?

Well, I understand you're taking a risk at the moment, kind of like taking your car to a Technical College and letting students do the repair.  But... my results, so far, are excellent.  

So... as far as pricing... how about 1/4 of what the S&W Performance Center charges?  Sound fair?  I'll consider offers as I'm ""testing the market""    ;-)    I may even do it for ""free"" just to gain more experience, take ""before and after"" photos to show the results.

Retail value of $260, I am selling for $140

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines."

I have a bersa thunder 380 that is in great shape.  I am meticulous about cleaning  my guns the night of or the day after i get home from the range.  I have two magazines for this handgun and 22 rounds of 380 to go along with the purchase.  I have the owners manual and original box for this weapon too.  

It is an extremely easy shooting and accurate gun.  The blow back design makes walther designs, such as the bersa 380, very accurate bc the barrel does not have to tilt to make up for room in the slide.

Anyway, great shape and great design.  I just am cleaning out my gun collection to....well make room for more.  I would be willing to trade for a small 9mm...perhaps with some money thrown in to make it equal if the gun you are looking to trade is higher priced.

A great little Florida Deer Rifle with very little recoil.  It is tapped for a scope and I have a set of scope mounts that came with it from the original owner.  Overall the rifle is in good condition with some minor wear from being stored for 20+ years (per the original owner) and my use since buying it.  I will throw in an old hard case with it so you have something to take it home in to keep it protected and 35 rounds of ammunition (pictured)."

Unfortunatly, the original barrel did not come with it when I bought it, I wish to God I knew why, this would be quite a bit more spendy with original barrel. However it does have a Bar Sto barrel in it. It's a $300 barrel if you wanted to go buy one today, should also work in G35 and G22 but not in 23 or 27. It's got night sights but they're not very bright anymore. Stainless steel uncaptured guide rod assembly. The trigger feels lightened, but I can't say for sure, I haven't detail stripped it to see. I actually haven't even shot it myself but I can tell you it's been shot, no idea on round count. I would guess 1000 or less. I already have another Glock 24, this was kind of an impulse buy just cause you almost never see them for sale and I don't really need two. Not really interested in trades.

From Springfield Armory's website:

In the post-War years, as 1911s became increasingly common in the civilian market, shooters and custom shops found new ways to upgrade their .45s. Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have.

Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application."

The lower is an Anderson lower and has the JP reduced trigger spring installed and has a very crisp trigger break. I don't know exact weight for the break, but is pretty low. It has the thorsden custom pistol cover on it, so no worries about the sig brace. It will also come with 2 PMAGs. Pistol has about 400rds down the tube at this point since I've been reloading for it. Also has a streamlight TLR-2. Also has the KAK flash can.

This is one of the most unique plate carriers available on the market because it has Level IIIa soft body armor panels permanently sewn in and completely sealed from sweat and prevents other moisture from getting inside. What this means is unlike any other plate carrier this is stand alone NIJ standard level IIIa body armor without rifle plates installed! This makes the vest extremely versatile and lets you avoid wearing a separate soft body armor vest under your plate carrier which can help you get down range operational faster, keep you cooler and improve your mobility without sacrificing ballistic threat protection. This Eagle Industries Coyote colored vest is completely set up and ready to go and everything on it meets or exceeds true MILSPEC standards. It includes attachment straps for optional upper arm and groin armor available from Eagle.  A great deal of time and effort was devoted to setting this vest up by a certified law enforcement firearms instructor who is also an experienced operator with enough real world down range trigger time to know what works in either a combat or law enforcement tactical environment, therefore with practice you will find that you can be in or out of this vest in well under one minute.  It is brand new (not military surplus) never deployed or worn. It was set up by a civilian security contractor for an individual who changed his mind about employment in the field so the vest was never issued to him. The vest is size Large but is so individually adjustable that it will fit sizes Extra-Large down to Small. The vest and all accessories from the Surefire light, to the pouches...even the carry bag are all brand new and never used.  The original cost of the vest without pouches or anything else is $1159.00. Note: None of the costs for the vest, plates or gear on the vest reflect the considerable shipping costs from the various suppliers, only the original costs of the equipment so you will realize the value in what you are receiving.

Yes, $125 each (shipped) is expensive, but bear in mind that HK has clearly fallen behind on mag production for these models as it is, and I'm certain that 10-round mags are the last of their worries at this time and probably for the foreseeable future, (welcome to HK.)  Factory 10-rounders WERE averaging about $95 on eBay recently, but now the supply has completely dried up.  They were only about $50 as recently as January.  Those days are now definitely gone.

Again, these are not shady/questionable chopped/hacked 15-round magazines, they are authentic HK 10 round 9mm mags.  They are NOT in plastic baggies because these are the ones that came with my gun in the HK box, not purchased off a rack.

12k gold: 16.700 grams
14k gold: 85.810 grams
16k gold: 4 grams

Calculated down to melt value of pure gold in ounces:

10k gold: 0.0154. $17.94
12k gold: 0.2683. $313.56
14k gold: 1.6070. $1,878.11
16k gold: 0.0858. $100.16

Total market value: $2309.77

For a cost of about $100 it can be smelted down to a bar of pure 24k gold in the weight of about 1.9756 ounce. Market value of it is about $2300 depending on when you do the calculations. 

With gold value always changing I'm setting my trade value at $1600. If I get a chance to take my gold to the smelter before trading it off the price will change. I just wanted to try listing it before I smelt and ell it outright. 

No I will not just sell the gold as is. My plan is to try to trade it or next week I'm going to smelt it and have it poured into a solid 2 ounce bar.

Now for what I'm looking for. I'm really looking for guns, AR's, bolt actions, lever actions, pistols. I will also trade for ammo, reloading supplies, gun safes, hunting equipment.

Modular Combat Suppressor Rail (MCSR) is a high performance, free float hand guard system designed to be compatible with the use of a suppressor. Precision machined from 6061-T6 aluminum, the inside diameter is large enough for most suppressors to fit inside, protecting the shooter from suppressor burns.

Versatility
Unprecedented Durability
Shockproof and waterproof to 197' (60m), and proven in heavy surf from Tahiti to Northern California and everywhere in between, GoPro cameras can handle it thanks their highly engineered polycarbonate exoskeletal housing. Ready for action—from scuba diving to dirt track racing, and tough enough to take a spin across the asphalt or launch into space, GoPros are built to take a beating and keep filming. Replacement lens kits and housings are available, so there’s little worry while going for glory—even while diving with sharks.
Wear it. Mount it. Love it.™
GoPro mounts enable you to capture a fully immersive experience of your most exciting moments while ensuring your camera is securely attached and with you for the ride. Helmets, poles, boards, vehicles—and even yourself—whatever you’re into, there’s a GoPro camera mount that will help you get the perfect angle and POV for your most epic adventures. The HERO3 comes with a few basic mounts to get you started.
HIGHLIGHTS:


Smaller, Lighter...Better
Weighing in at a scant 2.6 ounces, the HERO3: Black Edition is 25% lighter and 30% smaller than previous models.

2X Faster Video Performance
The HERO3: Black Edition captures professional, cinema-quality video at 2X the resolution and 2X the frame-rate of previous models while delivering 2X better low light performance. Slow-motion aficionados and industry professionals will love the HERO3: Black Edition's 1080p-60, 720p-120, WVGA-240, 960p-100 and 1440p-48 video modes while those desiring a cinematic look will appreciate the ultra-high resolution 2.7KP-30 fps and 4KP-15 fps (Protune only) video modes.

3X Faster Photo Performance
The HERO3: Black Edition's photo performance is 3X improved, now boasting 12MP burst capture at a staggering 30 frames per second with 2X better low light performance compared to previous models. Still Photo and Time-lapse Photo modes remain the same but are now joined by a new Continuous Photo mode that captures continuous 12MP stills at a steady 3, 5, or 10 photo-per-second rate, up to 30 photos at a time.

Improved Sharpness, Less Distortion
The HERO3's reduced-distortion, 6-element aspherical lens combines with user-selectable Ultra-wide, Medium and Narrow field-of-views to deliver more perspective-capture options than ever before. Add the totally updated flat-lens waterproof housing that delivers stunning image sharpness both above and below water and you've got one of the most powerful and durable image capture solutions on the planet.

Redesigned Audio System
Understanding that sound quality is as important as image quality, GoPro engineers completely redesigned the HERO3 to be as adept at capturing the subtle, natural sounds of voice and music as it is at capturing the immersive sounds of sport. Also improved is GoPro's already famous wind-noise reduction, ensuring that you'll hear more of your passion, be it your engine or expletives, and less of the wind during high speed activities.

Built-in Wi-Fi
Built-in Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi Remote Included)The HERO3 Black Edition features built-in Wi-Fi and includes GoPro's Wi-Fi Remote accessory. The Wi-Fi Remote is normally available as a $79.99 accessory but is included with the HERO3: Black Edition. The Wi-Fi Remote is waterproof, wearable and can control up to 50 Wi-Fi-enabled GoPros at a time from a range of 600'. The HERO3's built in Wi-Fi means it can also be controlled by iOS smartphones and tablets running the GoPro App.

Protune™—Powerful Control for Professionals
