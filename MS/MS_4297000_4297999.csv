So much so, Gerber Legendary Blades uses it in their logo. First introduced by Gerber in 1966, and advertised directly to our troops in Vietnam, the Mark II quickly became a runaway best seller. When Gerber wanted to create a knife that would celebrate their 7 decades of knifemaking, a special Mark II fit the bill. To celebrate 70 years of American made cutlery, they have updated this classic pattern with one of the best knife steels on the planet: CPM-S30V. Gerber has combined the wasp-waisted blade with the most sought after of all Mark II handles - the grey ""cat's tongue"" grip. This finish is created by a proprietary process applying stainless steel particles to the die cast aluminum handle. In the hand it feels much like fine sandpaper, and the result is a grip that is not only non-slip, but good looking and durable as well. The sheath is classic Mark II style, and made from black leather. Knowing full well that many of us will never carry such a beauty in the field Gerber has created a beautiful display box which will be included.

This is a practically brand new KAC URX Rail. This is a very comfortable, light, and modular rail to fit almost any need. The bottom section can be removed for fitting of bottom mounted accessories. This is such a versatile and awesome rail. Barrel nut included.
Description:

The KAC URX III Rail is a free floating, fully modular replacement forend for the AR-15 platform. Unlike traditional quad rail designs, the URX III incorporates short sections of M1913 Picatinny rail at its front end for mounting accessories, eliminating the commonly unused sections of rail for reduced overall weight and a more comfortable grip. A QD sling swivel socket is provided on each side at the rear of the rail for ambidextrous sling compatibility. Add-on KAC URX 3.1 Rail Panels and additional rail sections allow shooters to customize the forend to their needs (both sold separately). 

Specifications: 
Length: 8""
Weight: 8.6 oz
Free Float: Yes
Material: Aluminum
Finish: Black Anodizing

Rifle Requirements: This URX III rail requires that the rifle have a pistol or carbine length gas system and a low profile gas block. It is compatible with mid length gas systems but will leave a small portion of gas tube exposed in this configuration. Disassembly of the rifle's gas system and removal of the factory barrel nut will be necessary. Barrel Nut is included

The gun is nickel plated. Square butted checkered walnut grips. The bore is very good and bright, lines and groves are great. The barrel cylinder gap is tight. Cylinder locks up tight on all 6 chambers. The grips are the correct type, and are NOT cracked, stained/discolored, or chipped. The grips are evenly worn and seem to be age appropriate for a 109 year old gun. The gun has some very slight abrasions on the right side on the barrel tip, and along upper frame edge, maybe holster wear. There are very slight nicks and bumps on the trigger guard and some other raised surfaces, but nothing significant.The nickel plating is slightly worn and freckled in some spots. The plating is worn on the barrel tip, cylinder edges and other high points as one could reasonably expect. I estimate the plating to be 88-95% complete.  I rate the condition at a minimum of 75% to 85%. The “Blue book of Guns” has a value of $775.00 or more. I would like to sell this gun and I am asking $395.00. The SN is 144107 on the bottom of the barrel and on the butt.Cash only and a FTF meeting only. Ohio DL required, and CC permit preferred. I will do a bill of sale if desired, (please let me know in advance if you want a BOS). In my opinion this is a good gun, and to the best of my knowledge 100% functional and as described above. I am offering No warranty or guarantee, this is an AS-IS sale.I am willing to meet within about 25 miles of Parma Ohio. I will answer all messages first-come-first-served. Please feel free to ask questions and I can supply more pictures if needed. I reserve the right not to sell this gun. All most all of my ARMSLIST encounters have been great, but one guy weirded me out, I ended up not selling to him. Apologies if this seems harsh, but I will not sell if my substantial gut tells me not to.I work nights so please excuse any delays in returning your messages.

I have never fired this upper...I bought it earlier this year and never got around to shooting it and have since decided to get a 6.8 SPC upper instead. It appears to be a great upper, very well built, looks great, and is very light weight. The only thing I have done with it (other than let it sit in the safe) is briefly mount an EOTech sight, a QD sling mount, and a weapon light (all have since been removed and of course are NOT included). 

Current price on BCM's site for the upper in this configuration is $824.94. ($754.95 for the upper and an additional $69.99 for the added bolt carrier group and charging handle)

The Ruger LC9 is a double-action-only, hammer-fired, locked-breech pistol with a smooth trigger pull. Control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. The Ruger LC9 features smooth melted edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing.

One seven-round, single-column magazine is provided with each LC9 pistol. The magazine’s standard flat floorplate aids concealability, while the provided finger grip extension floorplate offers an option to shooters who prefer a longer grip surface with more hand-to-pistol contact.

Firearm Features
The Ruger LC9 is compact and just slightly larger (less than 1 inch in both height and length) than the popular LCP. Its rugged construction consists of a blued, through-hardened alloy steel slide and a black, one-piece high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame.

Ruger’s dovetailed, high visibility 3-dot sight system on the LC9 contains a windage-adjustable rear sight and a fixed front sight. Safety features include an internal lock, manual safety, magazine safety and a loaded chamber indicator which provides visual and tactile indication that chamber is loaded.

She comes with a fake can from the factory to try to prevent morons from putting their fingers in front of the barrel.

I have put around 200 rounds through it.  The magazine loses spring tension if you leave it at full capacity for too long, so I would only load 20 instead of 30 rounds if you want it to last longer.   I did notice some surface rust starting to appear in the finish on the hand grip  and charging handle.   If no one wants this beauty, she is going to get brass or nickel plated.

I think I am the second owner based on original receipt and the wear that occurs inside the upper after I shot it.     I don't like the play the magazine has when locked into place, the magazine could have been designed wider at the base and it would fit perfect."

Fewer than 65,000 of these great pistols were made just after World War I, and of that number, fewer than 55,000 were chambered in .380 ACP. These pistols were in use long before Walther produced the PP or the PPK, long before Mauser produced its HSc. Yes, this brainchild of John D. Pedersen was patented in 1915, with the first specimens coming out of the Remington factory in late 1918 (only 25 made that year). Production geared up in 1919, but in only eight years the Model 51 was relegated to the history books, aside from a few assembled from parts after 1927."
