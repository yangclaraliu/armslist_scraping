In the past, I have been jumped, robbed and vandalised. But only recently have I felt like it is time to consider owning a firearm. I am not a novice. I am skilled, trained and experienced. This will not be a range weapon, so there is nothing wrong with a Hi-point or Taurus. If you use high grain rounds they will shoot true enough.

I would like to barter my skills or trade some of my valuables. I am a skilled tradesman. Demolition, construction, home remodel. Mechanic and auto-body. Appliance repair. Home theatre and car audio.

It's also scope ready with the Burris 1"" rear adjustable dove-tail rings with bases attached.
I just put a brand new, premium Limb Saver's recoil pad on it. 
The bluing is great and the wood has only a few minor 'handling marks' on it.
It has what feels like a 3 to 4 lb. trigger pull. Doesn't appear to have had much time in the field if any and doesn't appear to have been shot much, is very clean.  
The model 700 and the round are still popular in North America, Canada and Alaska for big game and the left hand bolt, they aren't just everywhere.
And, it should easily take down a fully growd Sasquatch where ever you may be though ;)-

*Ruger blackhawk .45 LC single action revolver: Another amazing gun. Loads of fun to shoot, however not as smooth as the competitor. $500 obo or trade value of $600

*Also have a Pink Ruger LC9. Only had a few rounds through it. Purchased it for my wife however she never uses it. Asking $300 or trade value of $350. 

***THE LC9 AND 1911 HAVE BEEN SOLD**** 
STILL INTERESTED IN MAKING A A TRADE WITH THE OTHER 2

The M1A1 carbines feature many of the same characteristics of the original Inland Carbines and are manufactured in the USA!

The M1A1 carbine is modeled after a late production 1944 M1A1 Paratrooper model with a folding ""low wood"" walnut stock, type two barrel band, and includes the same adjustable sights which were actually introduced in 1944.

The M1A1 includes a 15-round magazine and offers the same common features of the 1945 M1 model. Attention to detail has been carefully taken to produce a replica as close as possible to the original Inland production including cartouche marks and stampings in the wood specific features of the Inland Carbines.

In 1941, with the US being pulled into one of the greatest conflicts in world history, a division of General Motors was tasked to support the war effort.

The result was firearm history with Inland Manufacturing becoming one of the largest gun manufacturers in the US, producing nearly 3 million firearms in less than 5 years.

The most notable of Inland's firearm production was the .30 Caliber M1 carbine and the folding stock variant, the M1A1 Paratrooper model."

I'd like to get a first hand experience to know whether it will be worth it for me to build one.

I'd pay you a couple bucks for your time.  

If you have an AR15 pistol and are willing to meet at a local gun range (Holmen Rod & Gun in Holmen, WI) please contact me and we can work out a time to meet up.  Holmen is a private range, but I'm a member can bring someone as a 'guest'.  Preferably you have a 7.5"" or 8.5"" barrel but I'd try anything (10.5"", 11.5"" etc).

I'll use my own ammo so you don't have to burn yours - don't worry, I only shoot good brass cased .223.  

Let me know!  Again, I can pay you a little for your time.  Thanks for looking, I hope someone can provide me the insight I need to nudge me in the right direction before I spend the money."

Info from LWRCI

Not to be confused with the Ultra-Compact Stock, the LWRC International Compact Stock is a drop-in replacement for AR15/M16 carbines with mil-spec diameter buffer tubes. It is a lightweight, no-nonsense stock that features integral sling attachment points, easy one-hand adjustments and excellent cheekweld.

The rubber buttpad prevents slippage during firing. The stock locks up tight and is a great foundation for putting accurate fire down range.

The LWRCI Compact stock weighs in at only 7.9 oz.

This gun is in great condition with all numbers matching and several markings on the stock itself along with the star on the receiver. I'm looking to sale this gun outright or possibly trade for something different. I do have cash to add for the right deal. I know there value and the rarity to find a Russian model in this condition so please no low ball offers. I am open to offers but be resonable and consider what also comes with the gun.

A Tribute to the pistol used by US forces in WWII.  If you want the real deal, actual WWII era Colt, Springfield, Remington, etc 1911A1, that's great.  These are the historical items and are priced significantly more than this one.  This would be great for re-enactors, as the basis for a custom 1911 since there are no bells and whistles on it as it comes, or for someone looking for a great, reliable, affordable 1911 model pistol.  5"" barrel, parkerized finish.  Hardly used so finish is in excellent condition.  The pistol came with wood grips having U.S. carved in each.  This is not how they came during the war, so I have added reproduction grips that are true to the times.  The Springfield US grips are included, as is the factory box and cleaning tool.  Comes with one magazine and there are literally millions more available at any gun store, eBay, Brownells, and more.  Face to face, cash only.  Must have handgun permit or concealed carry permit.

I'm ready to let her go for a great price. Or trade for a sports bike, a sweet set of rims with brand new tires 5x100 or a LEGAL firearm. Talk to me but through email. 

ABOUT THE CAR: It's an 03 Hyundai Tiburon GT V6 6-Speed MANUAL transmission, clutch was replaced just a hair over a year ago so it's still gripping NICELY as I do not abuse this car because the last thing I need is a ticket. 159,xxx miles and counting. I am not the first owner, I believe I am the 3rd owner if I remember correctly from checking her Carfax over a year ago. The car has never been involved in an accident, broken into or vandalized. I recently(less than 3 months ago) installed brand new front axles and inner-outter tie-rods. Aways do oil changes on time and did a transmission fluid swap about a year ago. Those don't have to be done I believe every 75k miles or so I believe. All of the work on the car has been done by me except for the clutch. 

INTERIOR: Black leather interior that does show typical wear and tear, power windows and sunroof. I installed a short-throw shifter which helps you shift a bit quicker than the stock one. I also installed interior LED lights where your feet rest and also LED dome lights with a cool little LED ambient light similar to what some of the newer cars have now-a-days. The car came with an aftermarket head unit but it can't be operated because the face was broken off by a very curious nephew and cables already ran for an amplifier and subwoofer. I never installed a new radio because it's not something I cared for enough but I can hook you up with a new radio if you buy the car. Alpine speakers in the front and stocks in the rear. The yakima roof rack is off the car and it's staying with me. 

EXTERIOR: The factory color is a very dark blue, I plasti-dipped the entire car Olive Green(Military green) and added a bunch of graphics to make it look Militarized but I'm willing to remove the plasti dip only if you're serious. The entire rear(bumper, tail lights and muffler) of the car was swapped with the rear of an 07 Tiburon which looks way better than the 03. I installed a set of ZG Flares and the rims are 18x10 XRR 521s. I custom made the headlights from an extra set i had(not illegal). It has tint all around front: 35% all rear: 5%. No this car is not a cop magnet, I haven't been pulled over for anything other than my driving and even then I haven't gotten a single ticket on anything about my car. I have a Viper alarm/keyless/remote start system installed but I deactivated the remote start because it's dangerous to have on a manual transmission vehicle but everything else works great.

THE CONS: When my father took my car in for the clutch, the people who did it and put it back together didn't set the alignment perfectly so it does pull to the right a tad bit which to me doesn't really matter but we tried to go back to get it re aligned and they had closed literally 2 weeks after my clutch install. There's a small rust spot where cars this age typically get where the rear bumper meets the quarter panel on the driver side. Its maybe the size of a typical light bulb(only common thing i could think of). Last thing is since I drive to DC a lot, I park in garages all the time for work. While I was at work from what my friend believes it was, a truck with big tires backed into my passenger side fencer and ruined it which is why in the pictures above, it's red. Later that same week, I believe the same douchebag did it again but this time he missed my fender but damaged my rims lip, it's nothing big and structural but its there. An honorable mention would be my E brake doesn't like to be used in the winter because the brake line freezes which keeps the brakes engaged, I never use my e brake anyway because I leave it on gear but I believe it's something you should know. Other than these small problems the car is very very solid and runs as strong as when I first bought her.

Alright, I know thats a lot to read but I want to be as honest and as open as I can with this because buying a car isn't a small purchase. So now you know pretty much everything about my baby.

I appreciate taking your time to read all of this, let me know what you think!"

Simply put, the Caldwell AR Mag Charger revolutionizes the way ammo is handled and loaded into AR magazines. It is designed to accept 50 loaded rounds directly from any common 50 round ammo manufacturer box or from aftermarket 50 round plastic storage boxes. Simply align bullet tips and dump a box of ammo into the Mag Charger. The ammo is automatically aligned without touching a single round. Once filled with ammo, insert any AR magazine into the Mag Charger just as you would into a rifle. Then actuate the plunger back and forth loading 5 rounds per stroke as the spring loaded ammo carrier automatically advances aligning the next five rounds until magazine is fully loaded. The entire process of filling the Mag Charger with ammo and loading all 50 rounds into two magazines takes less than 15 seconds. An Ammo Transfer Tray is included to invert ammo that is positioned in boxes with the bullet tips oriented down or to stage bulk ammo for dumping into Mag Charger. Highly durable Polycarbonate construction, compatible with .223, 5.56 and.204 ammo. Patent Pending."

I am getting rid of some of my wrestling autographs to help out on Christmas this year. All autographs have been collected over the years with most of them coming from Ebay. I do not have any COAs though. Therefore, I am selling them cheap where they can still be at a good deal for presents for kids or where someone can still have room to send them off to be authenticated if they have a business. If they do not sale by middle of next week, I will be putting them on auction. I have 4 different lots available. This one is a small binder with 25 autographs. Some may be one magazine page or photo but with 2 autographs on them. This one has the following autographs Kelly Kelly, Big Show, Layla x2, Rey Mysterio, Hulk Hogan, Sheamus, Kofi Kingston x3, the Truth, Prime Time Players, Triple H, John Cena, Ted Debiase, Batista x3, Aj Styles, Ryback, Cm Punk, Undertaker, Randy Orton, and Jeff Hardy.

I am located in Hixson, TN and can meet at Target off 153. The only trades I will consider are on firearms, ammunition, or case knives. 

Sunday through Tuesday of next week I will be in Crossville, Tn and can meet at the Walmart there.

Thank you for your time and have a good day"

The revolutionary HUD/DMR features quick ranging, wind holds and leads calibrated for deer and coyote sized targets using .308 or .223 chambered rifles. No math needed, no digging through the data book. A side mounted parallax adjust knob keeps the reticle parallax free and the target image sharp at extended ranges. This tough scope is shockproof, waterproof, and fog resistant, and comes with a 3 year warranty. The illuminated center reticle features 6 brightness settings with an “off” notch between each setting. Optional sun shade PA4-14SS sold separately.

When you field strip it you don't find the typical signs of cheap manufacturing like you usually do on lower cost guns: tooling marks, etching and pitting, it is as smooth as it is on the outside. The feed ramp is like glass, highly polished. It is not snappy at all, the recoil pad which I thought might be gimmicky really works. I spoke to SCCY about the warranty and they said it is a no excuse warranty, they will fix the gun no matter what including ""squib loads"" or if you drop it, etc. They are really serious about standing by their product."

If you are not familiar with this model, please do your research, it is the finest 380 on the market. Sig discontinued this model a year ago, and the demand is high, especially the 2 tone. There is a new one on Gun Broker for $1495.00 (I think he is on Drugs, but it shows how hard this model is to find)

I need the funds, or this one would not be for sale. I am asking fare market, not inflated price. This Gun is in excellent condition and only has approx 100 rounds through it.
While I need the funds, I am not hard up, so please dont low ball. I have other items for sale too, and if I end up getting the needed funds from those, I will keep this.

Shoots like a dream, and with the longer Barrel, the 380 ballistics on the ammo box will be accurate, as this is the length they test them from. Smaller barrels= lower the ballistics. This is not a mouse Gun!!

I have 4 Mags included, the Nights sights still work well, Not as Bright as brand new ones, (Still many years of use left on them) I tried to get a good picture of them glowing, but my camera doesn't do low light well, they are brighter then the picture shows. 
Sig made some slight variations over the years, I think this one is the nicest. It has the Stainless trigger, hammer and de-cocker, which later version did not. 

I have Original Box and the 4 total Mags seen in picture as well as both the original grips and Hogue rubber finger grips (my personal favorite)

I do have a R Grizzle custom Pocket holster I would sell separate for $50 if interested. I can send a pic if you want, it is in Mahogany color and is like new. Stays in pocket on the draw nicely if you pocket carry.

This is a Double action/Single action, meaning the 1st pull in double action, all remaining pulls are single action. A truly safe way to carry.

I can take it to and FFL for out of state buyers, but you would be responsable for the small fee they charge

You can call me too at REDACTED"
