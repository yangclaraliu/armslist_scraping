This rifle is chambered in 5.56 nato. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."

Model: T4
Type: Semi-Automatic Pistol
Caliber: 9MM
New from Nighthawk Custom, a 9mm 1911 designed for Concealed Carry that contains some of the newest features offered by the company. The T4 resembles the popular T3, but on a shorter 9mm platform. Reliability was the most important consideration when plans for the new pistol began mid-summer of 2012. The proven Bob Marvel Everlast Recoil System was modified to fit into the smaller T4 frame, thus reducing felt recoil and decreasing recovery time between shots. The frame is thinned just like the company’s popular Lady Hawk. The proprietary barrel is crowned and cut flush with the slide. On the outside, the front of the slide has new cuts designed to reduce weight. They taper in towards the crowned barrel, giving a unique look to the T4 like no other handgun produced by the company. Grips are like the T3, but are thinned for less bulk.

I have a Gen 1 Sig Brace AND a pistol buffer too I am wanting to sell, I have no use for them anymore!

I have the original box, paperwork and strap or it as well. 

The brace sells for $160 new and mostly between $120-$140 online across various retailers. 

The pistol buffer tube is used and SHOWS sign of wear, i had bought it used, it's marred and had been cross threaded by the original owner. It STILL works and fits tightly in any mill-spec receiver. I have shot over 1000 rounds using it and never had any kind of wobble.

This is a package deal, I will not part it out sorry. 

With this in mind you are getting a Gen 1 Sig Brace no markings or excessive wear, a pistol buffer tube. The two fit together! You may need to use talcum powder to help the brace slide over but it does fit!

I'm asking to consider the package for at $120, the brace sells for $120-160 and the new buffer sells for $40-50, so you're getting a $200+ deal at 60% of the cost.

The price is negotiable but no low balls.. I will take trades as well.. please be an equal value or be ready to add cash.

I am also looking for trades that are about equal in value, I am able to be flexible. I am looking for iron sights. depends on the quality"

After the Concealed Carry Handgun (ACCH)-Defensive Pistol Class
Class Size: 8 students (4 hours)
Prerequisites: 18 years of age or older (Exceptions can be made with an attending guardian)  Handgun, 2-400 rounds of ammo, proper holster, spare magazine, magazine holder, eyes, & range ears (gear can be ""borrowed"" if needed)
This class is designed to teach the student the fundamentals of defensive pistol shooting.

The student is instructed in firearm safety, grip, sight alignment, stance, presentation, trigger control, target acquisition, & high and low ready position during the (.5) half hour of classroom lecture.  The class then moves to the indoor range for (3.5) three and a half hours of live fire instruction. 

This is a ""lost brass"" class.  (Please choose ammunition accordingly)
The fundamentals of defensive shooting are taught from distances of (1) one to (10) yards utilizing a variety of targets.  Call targets of different colors, shapes, and compositions are used in order to challenge the shooter regardless of skill level.   We designed this class to give any shooter, which has completed their NC CCH, a series of exercises that will improve both skill and confidence.  We designed this class to instill familiarity with the actual handgun being carried. Once the student gains proficiency with the firearm he/she will no longer view the handgun with intrepidation and he/she will look forward to the range.  Once the student becomes comfortable and self-assured, the range time will become more enjoyable and productive. Upon completion of this class the student will no longer look at the handgun as a mystery but as a tool.  When the barriers are removed, we see the improvements in shooting ability promptly and following a natural progression.  It is for this reason that the live fire exercises are designed to be both entertaining and fun.  The student will improve her/his skills and gain a new confidence in both himself and her/his firearm of choice.

The maximum class size is (8) eight students with multiple instructors and a dedicated RSO (Range Safety Officer) to ensure each student receives personal instruction.  Each student is assessed and then the live fire drills are adjusted to be commensurate with the student's abilities.  This course is exciting, fast paced, and above all...FUN. Upon completion of the course each student will receive a certificate of completion and an ACCH grad T-shirt.

Just took the ACCH defensive pistol course and was very impressed with the level of instruction, professionalism of the staff, and length of course. Worth every penny! In my opinion, this course should be mandatory for all novice shooters and should be taken before any beginner thinks about applying for their Concealed Carry Permit. This course really emphasises the importants and responsibility of carrying a weapon for self defense and more importantly the reprocussions of not being prepared to handle real life shooting situations. Thanks to Roger Pettit and his staff for helping create more responsible and proficient shooters. -Todd Drzyzga"

New price for front $144.00 New price for rear $119.00

I have them sighted in at 100 yards so if you have a quality rail and an AR with a 16"" barrel , you can install them and be pretty close before you shoot. Even if the barrel length is longer they will only be off zero by a few inches saving you time and ammo. 

They will also work great on .308 Caliber rifles and any rifle with a flat top rail.

Model: T4
Type: Semi-Automatic Pistol
Caliber: 9MM
New from Nighthawk Custom, a 9mm 1911 designed for Concealed Carry that contains some of the newest features offered by the company. The T4 resembles the popular T3, but on a shorter 9mm platform. Reliability was the most important consideration when plans for the new pistol began mid-summer of 2012. The proven Bob Marvel Everlast Recoil System was modified to fit into the smaller T4 frame, thus reducing felt recoil and decreasing recovery time between shots. The frame is thinned just like the company’s popular Lady Hawk. The proprietary barrel is crowned and cut flush with the slide. On the outside, the front of the slide has new cuts designed to reduce weight. They taper in towards the crowned barrel, giving a unique look to the T4 like no other handgun produced by the company. Grips are like the T3, but are thinned for less bulk.

It has been refined and enhanced by Taurus to surpass the original. Most notable on the Taurus PT92 AFS is the innovation of a three position frame mounted ambidextrous safety which allows this gun to be carried in classic double action - cocked and locked - mode, as well as functioning as a double action decocking lever. Manufacturer is Forjas Taurus, S.A., of Porto Alegre, Brazil. Manufacturer and warrantor is Taurus International of Miami. Construction is polished coated alloy frame with stainless barrel, slide, trigger and levers. Class is Beretta 92 type short recoil operated semi automatic pistol. Chambering is 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Barrel is 5 inch Government Size, 6 groove 1:9.84 right hand rifling. Slide is brushed stainless with serrated rear laterals and non glare matte upper. Its guide rod is steel, not polymer. Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator. Front sight, like the parent Beretta, is integral to the frame with red dot insert; and the rear sight is plain black anodized, dovetailed in and with white dot fills. Trigger is polished stainless .350 smooth faced, 1 1/8 inch travel distance on double action; and 1/2 inch two stage single action pull. Photo specimen gauged at 5 1/8 pounds on single action, with minimal felt creep and overtravel. Hammer is .300 modified Commander type black matte steel. Main safety levers are extended serrated ambidextrous, and they serve as decocker. Main safety will engage with the hammer fully cocked or completely resting. The PT92 AFS also has a firing pin safety, and a keyed internal mainspring lock positioned inconspicuously on the grip frame back strap, furnished with two keys. Magazine release comes set for right handed shooters, but is readily reversible for southpaws. Frame is type two smooth square trigger guard, and incorporates a two slot Picatinny rail for lights. The grip frame is serrated fore and aft. Grips are flat checkered service type polymer, with flat head grip screws. Overall length is 8 5/8 inches from the muzzle to the end of the grip frame strut; height is 5 1/2 inches from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the magazine floorplate. Slide thickness is only 1.10 inch at the ejection port, with 1.3 inches grip thickness. Weight empty is 34 ounces, with center of gravity at the trigger pin. Each PT92 comes with a total of two magazines, factory Taurus 17 rounders, so 17+1 rounds of 9mm ammunition fully loaded capacity. Each PT92 AFS comes in its factory box with instruction manual, inspection tag, chamber protector, two keys for its internal lock, and factory registration card for Taurus’s well known lifetime repair warranty. Like its parent Beretta, the Taurus 92 is garbaged mouthed enough to feed and function with any 9mm loads from steel case Russian ammunition to lead head reloads to +P+ Cor-bons. This pistol's Beretta parent in Inox Stainless commands prices upwards of $900 apiece. In our area, if a person can find one of these PT-92 stainless guns, they price out at upwards of $600 apiece.

Truck needs a Clutch Slave Cylinder and Clutch Master Cylinder, it ran and drove when I bought it about 2 months ago, then the Slave started spewing fluid out, tired of messing with the truck, it ran like a raped ape and still does, just won't drive cause of the slave cylinder. The truck has the rare Factory Tachometer, only spot of rust on the body is in the picture, passenger cab corner. Truck is worth more than I'm asking. Toolbox goes with the truck, and it has some spare parts in it as well, also have a spare radiator I'll include since this radiator leaks a little.

Will take trades for Handguns or AR's/AK's, and I won't just give the truck away.

You may have the idea that these are just rip off Berettas, but here is a little history on Taurus:

""...Beretta had won a huge contract in 1974 to produce small arms for the army of Brazil. Part of the deal was that Beretta construct a Brazilian factory and use Brazilian labor. This they did, in the southwestern coastal city of Sao Paulo. When the contract ran out in 1980, Beretta sold the plant, literally ""lock, stock and barrel,"" to Taurus. Taurus now owned everything that once belonged to Beretta, including drawings, tooling, machinery, and a very experienced work force. Taurus was in the pistol business, and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus PT-92 and PT-99 9mm pistols.""

Like satin finish Walnut and deeply blued steel. It's been said that ""no one blues a gun like Browning"" - handle a BPS hunter at your local gun shop and you'll see what they mean. This gun embodies tradition and is built with quality that will be passed down for generations to come.

Pump-actions have long been lauded in the world of shotguns for their reliability and ability to cycle just about any load they are chambered for. The BPS stand head an shoulders above the rest with it's superior forged and machined steel receiver - combined with dual steel action bars, it has the strongest action of any pump gun on the market.

Also unique to the BPS is its bottom feed and ejection port. Shells are loaded and ejected from the bottom, leaving one less port for dirt and debri to enter the action. Likewise, a left handed shooter won't end up ejecting empty hulls into their face. Combined with the top tang safety, this gun is truly ambidextrous."

Per Aimpoint's website:

U.S. Army’s M68CCO  
The CompM4s is the latest version of the U.S. Army’s M68CCO (Close Combat Optic), continuing an Aimpoint legacy since 1997. 
Designed for 3rd generation night vision technology 
The CompM4s sight can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility. 
The performance of CompM4s sight is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology. 
The clearest, brightest image possible 
Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD). 
Ready for use around the clock 
With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4s sight is ready for round the clock use.

I would like to sell both cases together for $300, however am willing to consider selling the cases individually for $160 each ($0.25/round) if there is no interest from buyers looking to purchase both.

$159.99 is what I originally paid for these cases (before prices soared to the current levels of insanity, and when there was actually availability regarding purchase of this ammo).  I am simply looking to recover the cost of what I paid (less the sales tax).  This is a chance to snag 7.62x39 ammo for far less than current market prices (prices being asked by sellers actually having ammo in-stock for shipping out upon sale).

Specifics on this particular Herter's 7.62x39 ammunition:

+ 122 grain
+ Full, bimetal jacket (FMJ)
+ Non-corrosive, 
+ Steel Case
+ Non-Corrosive, Berdan Primed
+ Packaged 32 boxes (20 rounds each) for a total of 640 rounds in the case

I am located in Northwest Indiana and anticipate a fair amount of flexibility regarding potentially traveling 'half-way' to meet up.  If buyer is not in the immediate Northwest IN area (e.g., Hammond, Munster, Highland, Dyer, Crown Point, Gary, Lake Station, etc), I may be able to meet half-way (within reasonable distance).

Thank you for your time in looking as well as your consideration. Happy shooting- Cheers!"

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

This particular model has the upgraded Trijicon fully adjustable, 3-Dot tritium night sights installed from the factory, as well as the integral accessory rail. This 1911 is truly a work of art and has the potential to be the centerpiece of any gun collection. Included with the pistol is a hard carry case, hip holster, twin mag carrier, original grips, Hogue grip, cleaning brush, factory literature, and two 7 round magazines, three Chip McCormick 10 round magazines, and a custom kydex holster from K-Rounds.

The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

TRP level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.
 Sometimes performance isn't optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the TRP Operator.

Its a great rifle and I hate to part with it but im cleaning out some space in my safe and ive got so many rifles I dont ever have time to shoot anymore and this is one of them. Gun has very low rounds through it, under a hundred and cosmetically is in great shape, the heel on the grip is a little chewed up from shooting prone but thats common with over mold stocks. Im not in any hurry to sell this gun so reasonable offers will be accepted but I wont respond to lowball offers. Im asking 700 for the rifle and scope its got over 1200 in it.

GP100 revolvers have issued with factory logo Hogue Combat black rubber grips now for a decade, but at press time on this ad, we were in stock on some of the old style grips and want to make them available for our tradition minded shoppers. Here is as close as most of us will ever come to owning a Ruger Speed Six or a Smith & Wesson Model 65 three inch. Beyond that, this is the best available, or even the best ever, Medium Frame 3 inch .357 Magnum ever marketed on some folks's view. This is the Ruger GP-100, fixed sights variant with 3 inch tapered lug barrel. Manufacturer is Sturm Ruger Newport NH facility. Old factory letter code is KBPF331. Construction is entirely stainless steel, with exception of the front sight, internal springs and the grips. Type is traditional single and double action revolver. Chambering is .38 Smith & Wesson Special and .357 Remington Magnum calibers interchangeably, and cylinder capacity is 6 rounds. Barrel is one piece full lug, shrouded ejection rod, with taper at the muzzle. Bore is 1:18.75 six groove right hand. Sight system is pinned in black blade front, solid serrated low rib, and frame integral fixed notch rear. The GP100 is point of aim from the factory with 125 grain loads, if the operator does his or her job right, the equipment will follow. Trigger is .300 smooth faced combat type, with a 7/8 inch double action pull in the 10 pound vicinity, 4 3/4 pound vicinity single action with negligible to minimal felt creep. Hammer is .310 flat serrated spur, flat face against floating firing pin ignition, and Ruger bests all comers with certainty of ignition. Cylinder is Ruger’s triple lock, with detent and locking lug built into the yoke. Weight empty is 31 1/2 ounces with center of gravity at the cylinder stop. Frame top strap thickness is .265 above the forcing cone by .675 wide, nobody else touches that stress point strength either. Those measurements explain why the 3 inch GP100 won its 20 year competition against our much loved Smith & Wesson model 13 and 65 revolvers. Safety system is internal transfer bar type that prevents the hammer from touching the firing pin unless the trigger is fully depressed. Grip frame is stem type and accepts a variety of grips, same as the Super Redhawk. Grips furnished are factory Ruger Phoenix logo, Hogue Finger Groove Combat, made by Hogue for Ruger. Buyers may add a set of factory Ruger 70083 grips for $40 extra. Replacement pricing on a Smith & Wesson 2 1/2 inch 686 or a 3 inch model 65 these days is $800 or more. We're offering the 3 inch stainless GP-100 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only $ 589.00. Transferable to eligible civilians in all jurisdictions of these United States. Add $40 for a set of 70083 old style Rosewood Panel factory grips. Shipping. $15 lower 48; $40 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority, insured with Delivery Confirmation.

This rifle is chambered in 5.56 nato. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."

From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."

-3 factory 13 round 45 acp mags

-1 factory 15 round 10mm mag

-box of 40/50 defender 10mm rounds from double tap

It is a 1 of 100 banjo produced by Cox back in 1993. The banjo was purchased by my grandfather from Raymond Fairchild in 1993. The only time it has ever been played was when Raymond Fairchild played a few songs on it for my grandfather when he purchased it. It has been stored in the original case since that time.

Cox banjos have long been held as some of the highest quality and best sounding banjos in the world. This Banjo is the Gold Engraved model with gold plated hardware, curly maple neck and resonator, ebony fretboard, mother of pearl inlay and 20-hole, flathead tone ring.

The condition is like new, as i stated the only time it has been played was when it was purchased. It has been stored with the strings loosened as to not cause stress on the banjo. The banjo speaks for itself. The build quality is amazing, the wood is some of the best i have ever seen on an instrument.

Cox just last year released another edition of these banjos, with the nickel version selling for $3500 and the gold sold out (the gold editions were selling for $5000). This banjo was over $3000 new in 1993.

For Sale-      
M14ALCS M14/M1A Sage EBR Mod-0 Chassis:
Chassis is precision machined from a solid billet of high strength aircraft grade aluminum. Standard M14 and M1A actions are easily installed using existing M14 tools, making the conversion a true drop-in. Rigidity of the chassis increases accuracy and reliability of the standard M14/M1A setup. The forearm formed KYDEX handguard, minimizes heat transfer generated by high firing rates. Accepts the specially designed Sage International, Ltd. vertical foregrip (Included) when the detachable forearm is mounted. And is easily removed from stock chassis. The collapsible stock can be adjusted horizontally to comfortably fit anyone's desired length. And the cheek rest can be adjusted vertically in 1/4"" increments. The chassis has a 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock rail. 6 o'clock rail. And a 12 o'clock one piece machined top with integral rail. All mounting surfaces are Mil-Spec 1913 Picitanny Rail. The barrel tension screw, and its locking screw, serve as a bump stop. A barrel that whips will make brief contact with the screw and the severity of the whip will be greatly reduced improving accuracy. WILL NOT WORK WITH A LUGGED RECEIVER FROM SPRINGFIELD. WILL NOT WORK WITH HEAVY-WEIGHT BARRELS. Stock features the five-screw top cover & KYDEX ERGO Grip. 

M14DCSB Sage Detachable Cantilevered Sight Base:  
The Sight base is a Picatinny rail that bridges the action to the rear sight by connecting to the existing top rail of the EBR chassis. Effectively providing the perfect platform, and needed eye relief, for mounting optics. Sight base is supported on both ends. On the fore-end, positive rail engagement is achieved by two (2) robust actuating cams that can be can be locked firmly in the closed position while the rear is secured with the steel stripper clip insert and stainless steel screws. Installation requires no modification to the rifle. It is machined from aircraft grade aluminum.

Sage Vertical Foregrip: 
Made by Sage International, Ltd. as an alternative to having to remove the KYDEX handguard to attach a Picatinny foregrip. It is specially designed to attach firmly by simply choosing your desired position, and screwing into the chosen threaded hole. It is braced by a ""dummy"" rod that fits into any adjacent screw hole.

Sage Full Auto Cut-out Cover:
The cover is used to block the hole left in the EBR chassis for a full-auto selector switch M14's use. Will only be need by M1A users. Basically covers an unneeded hole for M1A's that dirt and debris could potentially enter and cause malfunctions. Adorned by the Sage logo."

Info off site:
With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Nightmare, features a black hard coat anodized frame and Nitron coated slide, black G-10 grips and nickel accents.
