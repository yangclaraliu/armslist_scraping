I will be happy to add more boxes of 9mm with the purchase of this set, at a very good price to sweeten it up more for you!  I have extra Winchester 9mm 124gr NATO for 13$ and the Remington would be 11$ per box with the purchase of a set like you see in the picture!

***I have 4 sets of what you see, take all 4 sets, I will toss in two more boxes of 9mm for free!"

I've always been fond of these Eastern Bloc PP/PPK style pistols.  The rock-solid dependability of Soviet regime weaponry, combined with the style and SA/DA function of the ubiquitous James Bond Walther pistol.  Reliable and compact enough to be sensible for carry, and really accurate.  What's not to like, right?

Now, some will tell you that the recoil is a little snappy (it IS a really lightweight gun after all), and the double-action trigger pull is heavy.  And it can be.  But, this particular pistol has had the sear and hammer surfaces polished, and a slightly softer hammer spring, and slightly heavier Wolff recoil spring installed.  Wolff makes several different weights of springs for both the hammer and the slide; you can dial the gun in to suit your preferences.

The original parts also come with the gun.

I bought this because it was just like the first pistol I ever bought, and I had a lot of fun with that gun.  And this one looks nicer.  But, as soon as I got this and put some work into it,  I ran across a Tokarev... the only way I can justify purchasing the new gun is to get rid of something.  

So, this is up for sale.  Check out the pictures; they tell the story pretty well.  I tried to get a good picture of the bore and chamber, but just couldn't get anything to turn out well.  Rest assured, the barrel looks as good as everything else.

Any other questions, just ask.  I am pretty busy with work this time of year, but will get back to you as quickly as possible.

Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

This is, to my knowledge, a one-of-a-kind handgun, customized for PPC shooting by an unknown gunsmith. It features a slab sided bull barrel, DAO trigger job (smooth and light), adjustable hammer spring, chamfered and numbered chambers, and Aristocrat sights. Also can include parts for a conversion back to the single/double action if that's your thing, I had them left over from a previous Ruger. Just seemed a shame to change anything on such a rare find.

Also have the original 2"" barrel and soft case, if anybody wanted to convert it back to a carry revolver with an excellent trigger.

It's been spending its time decorating my gun safe, but I've had it to the range and it works great. Can't say enough good things about how it handles, just a bit too big to be practical for me.

Open to trades or partial trades, worst I can say is no. Not really a .40 guy and have enough .22's. Willing to ship, if you cover the cost. I'll be driving from one side of the state to the other during the next couple weeks, so meet ups are possible. Thanks!"

I am willing to pay a fair price but I'm not going to pay new gun prices as I could just go buy a new one if that's what it takes. I prefer a ""bone-stock"" gun as I don't usually change out the sights or anything on my Glocks. I actually like the stock sight setup. I guess what I'm saying is, if you put a bunch of different stuff on the gun, that's fine but don't expect me to pay a lot more for it because I'll be changing it back to stock anyways."

Due to age and health Dale has officially retired and no more of these will ever be made. Dale built a great reputation over the years for military knives and more than a few found their way overseas on deployment.They are becoming quite collectable.

This particular model is actually a WW1 bayonet that he mated to one of his numbered, hand cast aluminium, full guard skull crusher handles and matching numbered, hand made leather sheath that the original metal scabbard locks into.

This knife has never been used or sharpened. There are some minor markings on handle and sheath just from being in a drawer for years and on the blade from being drawn from the metal scabbard.

This is a one of a kind, custom made knife from a well reputed Smith that will never make any more. He was featured in knife world magazine in 2000. I am asking $200, possibly may trade for an OTF knife."

I am primarily interested in Gen 4 models due to the smaller grip being more comfortable for my hands and shooting style. I would be interested in 9mm models (17, 19, and 26), .40SW models (22, 23, or 27), and maybe a .45 (21 only). My absolute preference at this time would be a model 22 or 23, but I will consider any of the above. 

I am willing to pay a fair price but I'm not going to pay new gun prices as I could just go buy a new one if that's what it takes. I prefer a ""bone-stock"" gun as I don't usually change out the sights or anything on my Glocks. I actually like the stock sight setup. I guess what I'm saying is, if you put a bunch of different stuff on the gun, that's fine but don't expect me to pay a lot more for it because I'll be changing it back to stock anyways."

Wear and tear is normal for someone who wore the gun just about every day (as did the previous owner). If you are familiar with the gen 4's, you already know that when in constant contact with skin, the slide coating starts wearing off. I don't know why. I kind of wish they would have just stuck with the gen 3 Tenifer coating, but oh well. It still functions flawlessly, and like stated above, only real signs of wear are on the slide. No dings or scuffs. 

Also comes equipped with the Clipdraw holster, but I could easily remove it if you would like. Also comes with the MIC (minimaly invasive carry) holster. If you've never seen these before, check out the youtube videos. I am incredibly pleased with the combination of the above products. They combine to make a very comfortable and concealed carry option.

This is a lightly used 8 inch Colt Python. There's just the hint of wear around the front cylinder edges. This beautiful handgun hasn't been shot enough to wear the bluing out of the bore! The stock factory grips are in near perfect condition, with no nicks or gouges in the checkering. There is a scratch on one grip panel visible in pic 2. It would probably rub out with some paste wax! This fine Colt has the adjustable rear sight and the red-ramp front sight. The Bianchi shoulder holster is in fine condition!

This AK 47 was made in Romania and then assembled by CAI. This is a fine rifle, it has roughly 350 rounds through it.

Accuracy with this rifle is great. It will shoot 3-4 inches at 100 yards with a cold clean bore. Once it heats up the groups open up some. Nevertheless, the accuracy is much better than what most people attribute to the WASR. The condition of the bore is great - the rifle and bore were well cleaned after every trip to the range. 

The front sight is not canted at all on this AK and it has been zeroed properly. There is not any excessive magazine wobble and the stock and steel are both in great condition. My only reason for selling the rifle is to consolidate calibers. 

The AK comes with 1 Romanian steel 30 round magazine. 
I also have 6 steel black 30 round South Korean magazines and a front sight adjustment tool that I would like to sell with the rifle.

I also wanted to note that this rifle has a Tapco G2 trigger (very smooth) and a side scope rail, both of which were installed at the factory.

Additional Information:

This fantastic, unfired and un-cycled gold-plated commemorative rifle came in from an estate. Originally produced and commissioned from Winchester by Investment Arms of Colorado, these county commemorative rifles are extremely rare with only ten produced of each type, including a PROOF rifle – which this is one. The PROOF numbered rifles are of course the most collectible of this series, and we have yet to see even a Kosciusko County, Indiana numbered version for sale in recent years. This is a one-of-a-kind rifle with no equal.

This rifle shows beautifully and we see no defects in the gold plating or heavily engraved stocks. See photos for details of the inscriptions and engravings."

Reviews from web
Great for USPSA major loads, flows well in my Dillon 650 press. Works great in my STI open gun. what more do you say.


N350 is my go to powder for 9mm. I have used it for years in this caliber, and have found none to be it's equal. I have experimented with many powders. This one has the whole package. It produces accurate, consistent, high velocity rounds without undue pressure. It meters well and is clean burning. Muzzle flash is not objectionable like other powders I have tried. It is great for both target and defensive rounds. For me, it actually produces better than advertised velocities especially near starting loads. The only drawback, as another pointed out, is that it is more expensive than other powder options. To me it is worth every penny.
BOTTOM LINE Yes, I would recommend this to a friend


This is the first powder I used when I began reloading. Since then, I have tried many different powders, but Vihtavuori N350 is the best of all by far. It is a small stick powder that meters very well(better than any other powder)in my Dillon press. I load 38 special, 357 magnum, and 45 ACP. The powder performs excellently in all of these calibers. The only negative for this powder is that it has become all but impossible to find it in stock anywhere.
BOTTOM LINE Yes, I would recommend this to a friend


Ive been using N350 for over 20 years with great results. I load both 9mm and .38, and have worked up a few max loads to duplicate defensive ammo and it has functioned flawlessly both in my Lee 1000 (a very finicky press), and in my guns. The only drawback I can find is when used in .38s with light to average loads the powder doesnt fill the case and can shift around, making velocity a little erratic (so dont light load .38s!)Otherwise its GREAT!


Very clean powder. I used it in my ruger BlackHawk 45 lc. 250 gr. xtp very accurate good recoil. Will use this powder again as long as I can find it where I live. The rounds were in the 1000 fps range.


An extremely clean burning powder useful for a wide range of pistol cartridges. The load data supplied is not entirely truthful, but it is conservative. The Vihtavuori book number 1 is recommended over later publications. The powder is very forgiving and versatile. Though it is a small stick powder, it meters well in my Dillon 550B reloader and throws uniform charges.


This powder meters very well in my Lee Pro 1000 Auto Disk. Burns very clean. I use it for 9mm, .357mag, .38 spl and .45 auto. As the other comment mentions the load data is very much on the safe side. The only down side is the price.

Good looking Kriegsmarine U-Boat Badge which was given usually after two war patrols. Some of the very successful commanders were awarded the badge after only one patrol.  

The U-boat War Badge was originally instituted during the First World War and awarded to recognize U-boat crews who had completed three war patrols. The badge was worn on the lower left side of the uniform and was oval shaped resembling a wreath of laurel leaves. A submarine lay across the center and the German State Crown (Reichskrone) was inlaid at the top center of the wreath.

On October 13, 1939, the U-boat War Badge was reinstituted again. It was very similar to the original badge with the exception of the Prussian crown which was replaced with a German Eagle. A swastika was added and a more modern submarine now facing towards the left was used.

There were several ways to be awarded this medal. The most common would be the completion of two war patrols because it was extremely dangerous as the U-boat has to endure constant attacks by Allied aircraft and warships.

During the later part of the war, U-boat losses were so great that many crewmen never made it past the second war patrol. Therefore, the other occasion when this badge was awarded was on completion of an especially successful first patrol or having been wounded or killed in action."

Sako Vixen Deluxe in .222.  This rifle is a family gun and has been owned by us since new.  No import marks  show and by my best reckoning it's Pre-Garcia.  Condition is very nice.

The rifle is available to individuals legally allowed to own firearms.  Shipping is possible to an FFL only and the buyer pays transfer and shipping costs.  Payment would be by USPS money order.  Local FTF sale is preferred for cash, to an Ohio resident.  Feel free to ask questions.  Price is firm and I'm not accepting trades.

 Carbon Express 20261 Intercept Axon Crossbow Package 

 We believe that every hunter deserves the highest level of quality and performance. So Carbon Express® crossbows not only have power and speed, they are designed for all types of hunters, with an optimal balance point that helps deliver deadly accuracy. Each bow is manufactured using state-of-the-art performance carbon-infused limbs, CNC-machined risers, premium alloy cam sets and tunable synthetic strings and cables for superior precision. Whatever you're hunting, wherever your hunting--you can be sure you're getting a best-in-class weapon, expertly engineered to deliver the feel, the power, and the kill. They are simply the best in the field.

 Introducing the best of both worlds: military AR-style design in a top-of-the-line crossbow, with devastating speed of 360+ FPS. The new Intercept SuperCoilTM has many of the same customizable fit and performance features in a more lightweight version.

  Picatinny design platform accommodates most military and commercial AR parts, so you can 
 customize the forearm, grip, stock, quiver and other critical areas to achieve a
 personalized length-of-pull and proper, full-view eye-relief for an optimized custom fit.

  Premium top-of-the line components that adjust to multiple positions, giving you the flexibility
 to fit any shooting style and situation.

  Compact design at only 13.5"" axle to axle when cocked, makes it easier to handle in tighter
 spaces like a tree stand or ground blind for increased accuracy.

  Precision engineering and advanced features, including a no-creep trigger that achieves a 
 clean break at a pull weight of just 3.5 lbs. for more lethal results.

  Designed and assembled in the USA of domestic and imported parts.

 Includes SilenTech Coating, a rubber-like exterior finish that reduces vibration and dampens sound on crossbows for improved and quieter hunting in the field.

 Micro Adjustable 6-Postion Tactical AR Stock Design:
 Provides optimal Length of Pull (LOP) for customized fit and proper eye-relief to deliver improved accuracy in any shooting situation.

 Multi-position Picatinny Rail System, including Finger Grip with foldable foregrip and internal storage compartment:
 9"" multi-position adjustable rail system is perfect for mounting accessories. The custom tactical foregrip features 6 positions for optimal shooting position fit and comfort.


 Compact Profile, with Low Profile Foot Stirrup:
 Slim line 13.5"" limb design with Bull-Pup trigger and one-piece aluminum low profile foot stirrup that provides a compact weapon for all hunting situations.

 Precision-Engineered Aluminum Alloy Cam Sets:

She went from liking chic/tacticool to caring about pinpoint long range accuracy, so I am interested in trading for a good low-mid range .22 target pistol. Below is my trade wish list. Prefer used (i.e. well broken in). Merry Christmas and I hope to hear from you!

This is a Classic side-by-side, double barrel . . . cap gun! Realistic in every way . . . just kid-size. MADE IN ITALY It’s a Limited Edition, and clearly one of the most realistic looking toy guns ever made. You won't find this one at Target or WalMart. If your young hunter isn't quite ready for his own shotgun, he can now own the next best thing. This authentic looking side-by-side toy shotgun, scaled WAY down to 33"" and very lightweight - is a great way to learn gun handling and safety. Die cast metal receiver, steel barrels and double triggers, this cap gun also has a true break-open action. It includes two “shot gun” shells for youngsters to practice both loading and un-loading. The receiver has “engraved” scrollwork, which was then antiqued to look very authentic. This piece also has a functioning safety, placed right where it should be. The stock set is a thick, high quality wood-grained synthetic. It uses proprietary caps that resemble shotgun primers, but can’t shoot projectiles. The caps are put into mini- shotshells (like primers would be) and then inserted into the gun. It just doesn't get more realistic! Overall length: 33 in. Weight 2.1 lb. Length of pull: 11.5 in. Metal double triggers, metal barrels and receiver too.  Barrel and stock have swivels installed.  Includes 2 two mini-shotshells. Alternative use ... It looks so real, hang it on your wall and watch everyone do a double take! $100 each ENTREPRENEURS – Buy my stock! Will consider dealers discount on multiples. These sell very well at Gun Shows,  Flea Markets and  Swap Meets.  They are unique, quality gifts for any age.  Each comes in a full-color factory box.

Scope is a Nikon Monarch UCC 2x20 Model 6565 extended eye relief pistol scope with Burris Mounts.  Expensive and accurate scope.  It is dialed in at 50 yards. Miss by much and the shooter either needs a stiff drink or something to rest on while shooting.  Sorry about the third pic.  My junk camera can't get a good pic through the scope.  It is incredibly clear though.
