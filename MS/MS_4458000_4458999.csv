Built by the SIG SAUER Custom Shop, the 1911 Max is a single-stack, 5? all-steel pistol with all the custom features that a world-class shooter requires. “We’re proud to be associated with a competitor of Max’s skill and character,” Bud Fini, Vice President of Marketing. “He also brings years of elite-level match experience, which is incorporated in this pistol.” A Nitron-finished stainless slide features forward cocking serrations, on top of a natural stainless frame with 26LPI checkering on the front strap. Max’s “MM” logo is custom engraved on the slide and machined into the Hogue® custom G-10 “Chainlink” grips, which offer a very aggressive, non-slip surface to the shooter. “I’m pretty particular about what goes into my guns,” Michel said. “In my world, a broken part or a malfunction could end my shot at a world title. I wouldn’t put my name on a gun unless I was certain it would measure up to my standards.” Built to Michel’s specifications, the 1911 Max has a host of custom features, including SIG SAUER flat trigger, external extractor, a Dawson® Ice Magwell®, a Koenig® Speed Hammer® and EGW® sear and firing pin.

The handle is African Black wood. A very dense hard wood that takes a great polish. The bolster and hilt are brass that has been allowed to attain its own unique patina. Comes with a full grain cowhide case. Chops like a machete or slices a tomato.  These knives were back up to pistols in the day when pistols were not all that reliable. They could do limb amputations with one terrible blow. What a great conversational piece or take it camping. You could be the owner for only 380 dollars.

By Tanfolgio For the discerning female shooter who appreciates Italian design and craftsmanship. The new WITNESS PAVONA POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use. The new WITNESS PAVONA is beautifully designed, elegantly packaged and sparkles when you hold it; a sophisticated pistol for the woman that desires everything.

The much anticipated Super Vinci ""supersizes"" Benelli's revolutionary Vinci shotgun for use with 3-1/2 inch Magnum loads. At the heart of the Super Vinci lies the In-Line Inertia Driven action system, the strongest, cleanest, and most reliable operating system ever designed. Built to reliably chamber light 2-3/4"" loads up through the most powerful 3-1/2"" Magnums, the In-Line Inertia Driven action is powered by a single spring, making it incredibly simple, rugged, and efficient.

The innovative ComforTech Plus System makes the Vinci the world's lightest and softest-kicking shotgun throughout the complete range of loads. In recent lab tests, the competition's guns produced peak recoils that were as much as 15% greater and total felt recoils that were as much as 22% greater than the Super Vinci's. The QuadraFit Buttstock Module customizing system allows easy adjustment of drop, cast, comb height, and length-of-pull in just minutes, with no tools required. The system securely connects directly to the receiver by a simple turn-and-lock, steel-to-steel attachment.

By combining the In-Line Inertia Driven action, ComforTech Plus System, and QuadraFit Buttstock Module, the Super Vinci improves your Practical Speed Performance (PSP), the speed at which you can shoulder your gun, acquire the target, shoot, and recover from recoil to prepare for the next shot. You'll get peerless performance from the Super Vinci.

Made as a drop in upgrade for any M16 or AR15, the Seekins Precision Bolt Carrier Group (BCG) is auto sear and RDIAS compatible and built to far exceed MIL-SPEC requirements. The coated gas key is properly staked to increase the system reliability and prevent failure of this critical component. The chromed and then Melonite coated carrier and gas key resist wear and corrosion even during sustained full auto fire. Melonite is a non-glare finish that also greatly assists cleaning, as carbon fouling will not adhere or build up on this as readily as it does on standard Parkerized finishes."

Many shooters with small hands are forced to carry a revolver for self-defense because the grip of a semiautomatic is too large. Enter the Aegis®, a 9 mm pistol that combines the real-world advantages of a 1911 in a platform with a smaller grip.

Small, light and accurate pistols get carried. Bulky guns get left home. Light weight, compact and absolutely reliable, Aegis® models are built in the Kimber Custom Shop for shooters with small hands. Thin grips, altered controls and rounded edges make them easy to shoot. A great single-stage 1911 trigger that breaks clean at 4-5 pounds makes them easy to shoot accurately. Standard features include night sights, 30-lines-per inch front strap checkering and a premium two-tone KimPro II finish that is both self-lubricating and extremely resistant to moisture. Self-defense is no place to compromise. Carry the best. Carry a Kimber Aegis®.

Came from the factory with telescoping side-folding polymer stock, adjustable cheekpiece, and A2-style pistol grip, however I have changed it over to a Vltor combat custom stock, and Ergo custom hand grip, and Magpul forward grip. All stock parts are included in the sale and are in the box. This rifle comes from the factory with one magazine, however I have purchased two additional magazines (which are $50 per mag retail). This is a top of the line rifle that you don't come across often, and while it's tough to part with, I feel it's time to find her a new home rather than keeping her in the safe. If you are interested, please feel free to text me at REDACTED, or e-mail me at REDACTED. I am asking $3,100 obo (have over $3,700 invested in it, it has never been shot).

1) Lawrence 1C #585. I have been notified by a forum member that this is for a Beretta .25 Bantam. $35 Shipped


2) Bianchi marked S&W#5B MP. This one is nicely broken in but in great shape. This one is for is for a S&W 2"" M&P. $35 Shipped


3) SOLD
4) SOLD
5) SOLD

6) The only markings on this is a stamped 160. One of the snaps is marked Schoellkopf Jumbo---I have never heard of them but maybe you have??? The snap on the retention strap needs to be replaced, other than this is seems to be a heavy duty holster with lots of life left in it. I tried a 4"" Security six and it is too short. I tried a 6"" Security six and it hangs out just a hair. $25 Shipped


7) Pair of cheap plastic factory Glock belt slides. These are well used and one has a custom repair with leather where the plastic belt loop broke. These might just be perfect for a creative idea like strapping one on the steering column??? $10 Shipped for the pair.

12) Roys Leather Goods 27-28. This is another very well made holster in great condition. The snap on the retention strap needs to be replaced. I don't know what this was intended to fit but my 4"" Security six fits in it like a glove. $35 Shipped


13) SOLD

14) Unknown maker stamped 4 68 6 on the back. Decent old holster with 2 snaps on the retention strap for adjustable length. I have no idea what might live in this one, but if I were to guess I would say an old pencil barrel 6"" S&W of some sort. $15 Shipped


15) Frisbie Leather, Portland, Oregon is the only markings on this one. Again old school vell made holster in pretty nice shape. I am guessing this was made for a S&W, but it fits my 6"" Security six just fine. $30 Shipped


16) Safety Speed Holster stamped 38 and 4 which I would guess back in the day meant 38 caliber and 4"". I think I just saw officers Reed and Malloy on Adam 12 carrying this same holster. This one has definitely been around the block a time or 2. If you collect old cop stuff you will probably should add this to the collection. $20 Shipped


17) Uncle Mikes size 5 adjustable flap holster. This is a lefty with velcro on one side of the flap. This allows you to adjust how far up or down the flap will be depending on what you have in it. It says size 5 if this helps. My 4"" Security six fits pretty low in it, and my 6"" Security six is a bit long for it. I would guess a 5 inch barrel would be a perfect fit. $20 Shipped


18) Ted Blocker Leather. I don't know if this is for a flashlight, baton, or mace can. Used buy certainly has plenty of life left in it. $10 Shipped

With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Research & Development teams, developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF. The TAVOR® was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the “father of the TAVOR,” spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities – seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990’s through the early 2000’s, the TAVOR underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies around the world. IWI and IWI US have brought the same dedication of craft and commitment to performance and reliability to the American customer with the TAVOR SAR rifle. TAVOR® SAR Features Include:Bullpup configuration allows for short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracyOptimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease-of-useClean, long stroke gas piston operation5.56 NATO detachable, cold hammer-forged barrel (CHF), chrome-lined with 1:7 twist, CrMoV steelOptional 9mm Parabellum conversion kit with CHF barrel, 1:10 twist, CrMoV steel100% ambidextrous configuration and operation with optional left-hand bolts for 5.56 NATO.

I have a brand new SIG556R Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. My family surprised me with an Arsenal for my birthday so I don't need two.  Here's some more detail on this awesome AK:

Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail features a SIG SAUER® Mini Red Dot sight . The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable operation and function. 

These are the newest Generation of the SIG rifles out often referred to as Generation 2.

Includes Mini Red Dot and one 30 round Magazine and Blackhawk bag with five mag carry capability.

In the realm of full-size combat pistols, one would be hard-pressed to find a model more suitable than the new Glock 41 Gen4 in .45 ACP. Using a Glock Gen4 frame—with its multiple backstrap system that includes four backstrap sizes (two of them beavertails), a reversible magazine catch, a high-traction texturing that wraps fully around the gripping surface—the G41 sports a 5.3-inch barrel. The Glock Safe Action system, with its adjustable trigger-pull weight capability, is included in the design and contributes to the gun’s competition-worthy range capabilities. The extended slide length of 8.31 inches gives users a sight radius right at 7.5 inches, a length that also has a salutatory influence on accuracy.Item #: PG-41301-03UPC_Code: REDACTED39Description: GLK 41 GEN4 45AP PST 13RD ASManufacturer: GlockModel #: Gen 4 41Type: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: Black MatteStock: Black PolymerSights: FT: White Dot RR: Adjustable with White OutlineBarrel: 5.31""Overall Length: 8.90""Weight: 27 ozCaliber: 45APCapacity: 13+1Action: Safe Action# of Mags: 3Packaging: Black Plastic CaseReceiver: Black Polymer with Accessory RailFeatures: Magazine Loader, Cleaning Rod and BrushInterchangeable Backstrap, Reversible Mag ReleaseIs this handgun legal in your state?

The Trade list isn't exclusive you can make me an offer but I am not interested in Bolt Guns, Aks or AR-15s less than 16""

It has a 16"" Barrel, standard A2 flash suppressor, piston action runs really clean, all black, has the side-collapsing/telescoping stock. I can include a GripPod or KAC Foregrip with it as well as 4 USGI Aluminum Magazines. Features and adjustable gas port for suppressed use. 

It will feed any and all .233/5.56x45mm ammo, from cheap 55gr wolf steel cased to 77gr Sierra Match Kings. Very easy to take apart and clean, and it has very little felt recoil.

I am putting up my trade list in preference. Depending on what it is will determine how much cash is on your end/my end. Again I prefer to TRADE it. I am very firm on prices except for anyone in 1BCT/101 AB or 3-5 SFG, I can take a bit off.

  Out of my safe and personal collection: I have a Sig Sauer P226 DA/SA in 9mm.  This is an old school P226 that is all original.  It was imported through Herndon, VA: pre-Exeter, NH days.

  It was manufactured in WEST Germany and has the original style checkered grips.  This was made back in the days when all the parts were machined - not MIM.  And also when they were hand fitted - not mass produced on an assembly line.

  It has the original yellow, red velvet lined box.  Original manual.  Original hang tag.  Original zipper back magazine.  Original test target.  The S/Ns match on everything: slide, barrel, frame, box and target.

  The gun has been fired, but I would rate it at 97% plus condition.  These are nearly impossible to find in this condition anymore.

  Regardless of whether you have a NH pistol permit or not, this pistol MUST be transferred through an FFL dealer.  No exceptions.

  Thanks for looking and have a great day."

Super rare,super collectible Steyr package! This may not be a ""Once in a Lifetime"" deal but it's close! This listing is for a Black Pre Ban Steyr AUG A1 with a 16"" barrel. I believe only two thousand or so of this model were imported for LE and Military. The chamber,receiver and barrel all have matching #s starting with the 906 prefix. ( I have not disassembled the rifle to check any other numbers)The only real flaw this AUG has is the top of the scope is missing some of the finish.The optic itself is good and clear.Now for the kicker! Also included in this listing is the super rare 24"" HBAR barrel with factory bipod.(Only 350 or so ever imported!)I bought the HBAR barrel from the original owner that had put only 20 rounds through it. The bore is perfect as well as the bore on the 16"" barrel. The only flaws on the 24"" barrel is where the bipod folds up and puts wear marks on the finish of the barrel. The 24"" barrel is marked 5.56/7""and the bipod legs have 5 height settings. Also included is a soft case and one new Steyr 30rd. mag. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have. I answer emails daily. Shipping will be $50. I will ship the rifle in the soft case to the FFL and I will ship the 24"" HBAR barrel directly to the buyer.

These are out of my ""Personal Collection"" I have had both for years. I have never even put a round through the 24"" barrel. I hate to sell these but,I'm trying to raise funds for a classic car project. These will surely continue to go up in value! I will not seperate the 24"" barrel from the package. Either it all goes or it all stays. Thanks."

Super rare,super collectible Steyr package! This may not be a ""Once in a Lifetime"" deal but it's close! This listing is for a Black Pre Ban Steyr AUG A1 with a 16"" barrel. I believe only two thousand or so of this model were imported for LE and Military. The chamber,receiver and barrel all have matching #s starting with the 906 prefix. ( I have not disassembled the rifle to check any other numbers)The only real flaw this AUG has is the top of the scope is missing some of the finish.The optic itself is good and clear.Now for the kicker! Also included in this listing is the super rare 24"" HBAR barrel with factory bipod.(Only 350 or so ever imported!)I bought the HBAR barrel from the original owner that had put only 20 rounds through it. The bore is perfect as well as the bore on the 16"" barrel. The only flaws on the 24"" barrel is where the bipod folds up and puts wear marks on the finish of the barrel. The 24"" barrel is marked 5.56/7""and the bipod legs have 5 height settings. Also included is a soft case and one new Steyr 30rd. mag. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have. I answer emails daily. Shipping will be $50. I will ship the rifle in the soft case to the FFL and I will ship the 24"" HBAR barrel directly to the buyer.

These are out of my ""Personal Collection"" I have had both for years. I have never even put a round through the 24"" barrel. I hate to sell these but,I'm trying to raise funds for a classic car project. These will surely continue to go up in value! I will not seperate the 24"" barrel from the package. Either it all goes or it all stays. Thanks."

This is the ultimate in low light scopes. It has an super large objective for extreme low light conditions. It has a very impressive appearance and out performs anything in its class.  Don't be fool by the low price.  This scope will out perform many others top name brands costing many time this price.  The large multi coated 50mm objective and 30mm tube allow more light for a bright clear sharp image. This scope makes an exceptional long range low light tacticle scope.  The large 1/4 MOA finger type adjusting knobs can be reset to the zero position after sighting in. They can be adjusted in the field for range and wind drift conditions then returned to the zero position with confidence. Manufactured by a major OEM company that manufactures scopes for many popular brand names. Why pay high prices just for a name when you can get the same for less.

It is a 20 inch SXS shotgun. I have had it for about a year and put roughly 30 shells through it. It is in great shape, no rust or anything like that. The only signs of handling are some marks on the top of the stock which I try to show very clearly in the pictures and some modifications the previous owner did to the hammer tops for smoother quick cocking. This thing is perfect for cowboy action shooting or just reenacting your favorite Tombstone scene if you happen to be a fan of Doc Holliday. Or, if you're just the practical type, it's a reliable home defense weapon. I keep it in the bedroom with shells loaded and hammers down. Ready to go in a moments notice, though luckily I've not had any need to use it. However, I tend to clear out firearms I don't shoot often enough and I'm trying to free up some funds for the next toy, and since I have other home defense options this is getting the axe. Thanks for looking.

-What I have for sale and trade. All rifles are in their original configuration unless stated otherwise. I will state if the rifle comes with something in the post next to it. If I don't state anything with it,than its just the rifle.
-Hungarian 91/30. Really minty,no import marks, good bore,Arabic stock painting numbers,never shot this rifle myself. Everything matches except the end plate. $750
-Hungarian M44. In ok to good condition overall,has a ok to good bore. Cant remember off the top of my head if its matching. This is actually a really good shooter also. $250
-Gew 88 made in 1891 at Loewe,updated to modern 8mm Mauser,has a Turk bolt but I have not noticed any other Turk stamping on it. Trigger and bore on this are amazing. Shows signs of use but this rifle was made in 1891 folks. $325
-Finnish M28/76 ""no date"" with built in scope mount and aftermarket rail. This rifle is in 7.62x53r and is amazing. The Finns sure do know how to build rifles. Great and mirror like bore and of course a two-stage trigger. With the aftermarket rail,$750
-Finnish M28 ""ski trooper"" version. Great bore,great two stage trigger,and is very accurate. $500
-x2 Tula Mosin Nagant 91/30 Ex sniper PE&PEM rifles. Both in great shape and I think the ex PE side mount rifle is all matching. One is a side mount PE,and the other is a double date,top mount PEM sniper rifle with a bent bolt. I also have a real 1938 Progress PEM scope with an Accumount top mount for it. I wanted to make the double date ex sniper back to her former glory with it but it just got pushed back. $275 for the ex side mount sniper rifle,and $375 for the double date ex PEM top mount rifle with a bent bolt. PEM scope with mount $700.
-PTR PDW .308 pistol. 8.5 in barrel,bought it brand new,turns heads at the range with it. In great shape also. Comes with PTR hard case,2 HK mags,HK cleaning kit,and mag pouch. $850.


-What I will trade for. I do not like ""sporterzied"" or chopped up firearms. Im also not interested in hunting rifles or hunting shotguns. Please dont offer those to me.
-Police issued revolvers,shotguns,AR-15s,and ect. Really looking for a Minnesota police issued firearm.
-S&W Model 29. Not a 629,just a Model 29.
-Certain SKS rifles. Looking for ones that can take AK mags,Yugo M59s,Yugo M59 ex sniper rifle or one with the scope base still,Yugo SKS rifles with the factory full auto stock,Yugo 30rd SKS mag,Certain Russian SKS rifles,East German SKS,N. Korean,N. Vietnam,SKS bring backs WITH PAPER WORK to prove it,and Romanian SKS rifles.
-Certain Mosin Nagant rifles. If you have not noticed from above,I collect these rifles and im only looking for rare and interesting ones. If you have a standard 91/30,M44,or a common year M38 I wont be interested in it unless its cheap,just being honest folks.
-AK rifles. I love AKs and AK style rifles. Really would like a Tabuk rifle,PSL,M76,Chinese Type 56,,and ect. As long as its original,not beat up,not a .22 version,not a WASR,not a single stacked AK,ill be interested in it.
-AR rifles. Not interested in AR-15s,they're boring to me. Only AR rifles im looking for are,RR LAR-47.CMMG mutant,select AR-10s(nothing modern or anything DPMS),and im looking for a CMMG mutant lower or a CMMG lower that takes G3 mags. If you have an AR and its not what I listed above,I wont be interested in it. 
-SVT-40 rifles. If the bore or the gas port looks bad,frosted,rusty,and ect im not interested in it unless its really really cheap.
-Suomi M31 semi auto rifles. 
-TT-30's and TT-33 pistols. Not interested in a Romanian TT-33 unless its cheap.
-German WWI and WWII pistols. Looking for ""shooters"" C96s and Lugers. Dont need a museum piece but i don't want a beat to death one. Also looking for a Chinese .45 cal C96.
-Firearms with bring back paper work. It has the legit paper work im interested.
-Surplus rifles and pistols. I pretty much like anything from the 1890's to 1970's as far as surplus firearms goes. Like how I want a WWI Colt .45 pistol or would love to have a Colt M16A1 parts kit to build or a Swiss K31. If its a surplus firearm,you have a better chance of me liking it more than any AR rifles towards trading at least."

This is a top of the line rifle that you don't come across often, and while it's tough to part with, I feel it's time to find her a new home rather than keeping her in the safe.

This is not your normal everyday gun, so I will not even entertain low ball offers.

She started her life as a Glock 17 gen 2 made in the early 90's, in the past a owner polished the slide and internals (nobody likes a chrome glock but I digress) and the owner before me decided to use an at home cerakote kit (the coverage is acceptable but by no means professional). Factory night sights, extended slide release, all she needs is your ammo and love. 

I fired 200 rounds of factory ammo and a few hand loads through the weapon with no problem or failures. The stippling although not visual pleasing is extremely ""grippy"" and makes an excellent grip surface for sweaty palms.

the weapon covers both worlds of accuracy from the G17 barrel and concealment from the G19 grip length. 

I will include two G17 mags and 1 G19 mags with this weapon and can probably round up a generic glock box if you need one."

Both are in good shape; just used them both this season.  Plow was pre-owned but unused when I bought it.  I've used it for 4 seasons, still has the original cutting edge on it. Wiring and mount is for a chevy truck. I have mounts that will work for '73-'88; '89-'11; and ultra mounts for '11+ with the uni-mount conversion bracket. I used it on an '05 1 ton chevy, then on my '13 2500. And I have the hand held controller for it.
Spreader has a new motor as of last season, only used once this year.  It has a trailer hitch mount, so its easily removable between snows. I have the original wiring harness and variable speed controller for it. 
Can text pics, can't seem to upload them. 
I'm asking $2000 firm for the setup. Plow comes with one mount.

And thank you for supporting a made in America product.Some things to consider when purchasing from Sparks Trust:First we would like to thank you for coming down this far and reading this entire ad in its entirety. With crowdfunding being very popular nowadays, we doubt that we would be able to meet the $15k goal in the time allotted. Not to mention many of those places take a fee off the top.We decided to start selling the flare gun sights on several websites in order to generate funds for this ongoing project. The flare guns sites have gone through thousands of changes, tweaks and upgrades over the past 18 months. They have gone from a concept stage all the way through to a work of art in addition to its obvious functionality. We have also implemented additional accessories for the sight including the lower rail and a new ammo caddy. The lower rail was designed to allow the user to attach a laser or flashlight to the bottom of the flare gun. The ammo caddy will allow those same features, in addition to holding additional ammo at your fingertips.There are also other features and accessories I would like to bring to the market, however financing is a big challenge not only for this project but for several other projects and innovations to the firearms industry.By purchasing a flare gun sight you are helping to fund these projects. Donations are also accepted to further the projects. We appreciate and value every sale, every customer and every donation.The next big innovative project we would like to bring to the firearms industry is The Double Standard. We do have a Patent Pending. Do you own a firearm that only comes with one size of magazine? Do only some of the magazines you have work flawlessly?The Double Standard is a magazine adapter that allows the user to take two standard capacity magazines and turn it into one higher capacity magazine. So many firearms on the market today only come in one size of magazine. You couldn't buy another size even if you wanted to. For instance, the Ruger SR22 only comes in a 10-round magazine. The Sig Sauer Mosquito, The Walther P22 and the tt-33 series only come in 8 or 9 round magazine capacity. The Romanian PSL has a lot of magazine seating problems, as well as the magazines themselves are ridiculously expensive. The Double Standard eliminates the problems associated with magazine seating correctly as well as provides you with additional ammunition for your firearm. PRE ORDER OPPORTUNITYThe retail price on this will be approximately $27. If you pre-order you will get 2 for this price. We have secured the patents. We are past the proof of concept and functionality stage. Now we just need the funding to procure manufacturing for this product. Will you help take part in The Double Standard change?Please contact me for additional information.Thank you, Sparks Trust Arms Research and Restoration."

This firearm is designed to handle high pressure loads under SAAMI specifications.Taurus Security System (TSS)rsTaurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.Transfer BarThe transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.Specifications:Item #: 2-850029PFSUPC_Code: REDACTED71Description: TAU M85FS POLY 38SP REV 2.5SSManufacturer: TaurusModel #: 85 Polymer FSType: Revolver: Double ActionFinish: Stainless SteelStock: Rubber GripSights: Front: Fiber Optic Rear: NotchedBarrel: 2Overall Length: 6.3Weight: 16.5 OZCaliber: 38SPCapacity: 5Action: Double ActionReceiver: Polymer FrameIs this handgun legal in your state?
