First off it's a new in the box/never fired NAA Guardian chambered for the awesome .25 NNA round! NAA only does a very limited run of the 25 and the bigger 32NAA Guardians. If you don't know the .25naa is a bottleneck cartridge based off the .32acp. But shoots a .25 cal bullet out of a 2.5"" barrel at around 1250 fps!!!! I had mine on special order for 9 months(also about 20 calls to LGS/NAA). Then I had the pistol engraved by one of the worlds best master engravers. I had the useless factory sights removed, extreme high polish to all surfaces and engraving to at least 70% of the pistol. If your looking at this ad I'm sure you know something about engraving. And I wouldn't have to tell you about the quality of this work. You will also know that my asking price is about what the engraving alone costs. This particular engravers work has been doing this full time for over 40 years. And the value of his work goes up every year. And I know there is an extremely long waiting list and for new work. The pistol comes with a signed letter of authenticity from the artist. I am also including an extra pinky extension mag, Desantis ankle holster, a genuine shark skin wet molded pocket holster and 3 boxes of Corbon .25 NAA ammo. All those extras were well over $200. This would not only make an amazing investment but also a great CCW/Back-Up pistol. This is honestly the last thing I ever wanted to sell but I need the cash. I will take $700obo. I have way more than that invested and I am sure if I put it on an auction site it would get close to twice that. But I only feel comfortable meeting someone in person. Serious LOCAL buyers only!! I have many more pictures and info on engraver for serious buyers. I will only consider face to face transactions for CASH ONLY. Please email with any questions."

From Beretta:

Pico - The Most Concealable .380 for Personal Defense and Home Protection

At only 18mm wide, the Pico is the thinnest .380 semiauto handgun on the market, making it a best in class for concealed carry and home defense.
Besides being light, small and concealable, it offers easy use, adjustable sights, an ultra-reliable low-recoil mechanism and a tough, durable finish that--with proper care--will give you a virtual lifetime of service.

Comfortable to Conceal and Carry

Weighing only 11.5oz unloaded, this double-action-only (DAO) pistol is comfortable and unobtrusive to carry, no matter your preferred mode. The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts.

Soft-recoiling and Absolutely Reliable

The Pico is soft-recoiling and makes target recovery lightning-quick after every shot, thanks to its minimal barrel tilt. This feature also makes feeding utterly reliable, even with more open hollowpoint designs or the hotter .380 commercial loads. This means that when you need it for concealed carry or home protection, the Pico will always deliver the performance you expect of a Beretta.

Easy to Disassemble and Customize, Loaded with Features, Made in USA

Like its slightly bigger brother the Nano, the Pico is engineered to be easy and intuitive to take apart and reassemble. Its heart is a serialized modular chassis, meaning that the frame can be easily swapped to accommodate the user's preferences. Shipped with a storage case and two 6+1 stainless steel magazines (one flush, one with grip extension), the Pico features adjustable, quick-change sights with no gunsmithing required. It also offers ambidextrous magazine release, as well as a super-low-profile slide-release lever to keep the slide open when desired. The Pico is made in USA and brings all the reliability and quality of Beretta as the leader of a new generation of concealed-carry firearms."

Has approximately 90 rounds through it.  Directs flash/sound of AR/SBR/AR Pistol forward and away from the shooter.  Also has the ability to take the tip off and not run the prongs.  I shot the 90 rounds through my AR then had to take it off because I needed to send my upper back to the manufacturer.  I recently received my upper back and it came with a different muzzle device already installed, so I don't want to go through the hassle of taking that one off and putting this back on.

The flash hider does have some surface scratches on it from where the person who took it off my upper did not use the appropriate strap wrench needed to assemble/disassemble.  The scratches are on the surface only and have not gouged the flash hider itself.  Because of this the price will go down drastically.  This device sells for $139 from PEC Armory.  I'm looking for $75 or best offer.

The gun is in great shape. Mechanically it's flawless. It does have some slight wear on the finish.

I did shoot 25 rounds of Blazer .44 mag through it that a friend had and it did not like that ammo, but with Magtech or HPA it has always functioned flawlessly.

Small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, always handy when needed. Hunters can stay on target much longer and concentrate better when using Little Sure Shot Gun Rests. They are more relaxed especially through the shoulder, upper arm and wrist areas and more comfortable waiting for just the right shot. Highly effective for deer, turkey, elk, moose, bear, varmints and small game. All models are no bigger than your hand, small enough to put into a shirt pocket. Made from heavy-duty polypropylene plastic resins for enhanced strength and durability. The colors are blended throughout the entire device so that if a scratch does occur, it is less visible. Big Mouth models wrap around odd-shaped items ranging from 3/8 to 1 1/2 inches including branches, fence posts and sign posts to make an ideal shooting platform. Our guarantee is no questions asked. No if and buts about it. If not completely satisfied, simply return the items with your mailing address receipt and we will refund the full cost of the unit. Made in USA.

This gun is in great condition overall. Mechanically flawless. Never had a hiccup or misfeed with it. I've kept her super clean, cleaned after every single time it's been shot, stripped down and reassembled. This gun is an absolute blast to shoot. Very crisp trigger pull (it's the stock M1A trigger, not the loaded or match trigger) and it gets back on target super fast. I actually still love this rifle so I'm in no hurry to let it go, I just want to try something different/new. There is some minor wear on the finish, near the gasblock/muzzle break but other than that, she's still looking pretty mint. The tritium in the Trijicon front sight is not as bright as it used to be, but you can still see it in low light."

This is a chance to own an extremely rare rifle. This rifle is very accurate, I have hit small steel targets at 400 yards with this thing no problem. It's quite capable, with the current configuration of reaching 600-700 yards with repeatability. If you wanted to invest in some even nicer optics I don't think 700 yards would even be a chore with this rifle. Read more about the rifle here:

http://www.thektog.org/Lost-Kel-Tec-bolt-gun-The-Grendel-SRT-The-KTOG.html

It's always been very well maintained and cared for. I've hunted with this rifle a couple of times and taken it to the range quite a bit. It's very light (6.7 lbs stock) and the folding stock makes it ideal to carry into the field or to hunt all day with. Trigger pull has never been adjusted, but I've been told you can adjust it all the way down to 2.5 lbs. It's a very crisp and clean break with very little slack as it stands right now. This rifle is only going to go to the right home for the right deal, I'm not looking to sell this off for low value to someone who just wants to liquidate it to a collector. I'm in no hurry to move this thing, I just want to see what kind of offers I can get. I'm looking to fund some other projects."

Pair of Vintage Remington Model 12 and 14 in 22 and 35 Remington Calibers. These guns were a birthday gift from Babe Ruth to teammate and fellow Hall of Famer Ki Ki Cuyler. Babe and Ki where avid outdoorsmen who hunted, fished and sang together. The guns were gifted for the purpose of hunting and Ki did just that. Babe had them engraved “TO MY PAL ""CUY"" A REAL STRAIGHT SHOOTER BABE RUTH”. We have a photo of Ki Ki with a black bear that he just shot with the 35 Rem. As well as a photo of his moose. In the bear photo you can make out the special mount that was used to switch the scope back and forth between the two rifles. We have documentation from Collecting Consultants (Don Flanagan) appraising the rifles in 1996. Don was a sports consultant with Christies for 14 years. Also there is a letter from Ki Ki’s Grandson Harold (KI) Cuyler to his friend Joseph Artiglere for whom these rifles are being sold. Harold (Ki) Cuyler and Mr. Artiglere were best friends and the guns were purchased in 1996 by Mr. Artiglere as an investment…he never fired or hunted with the rifles, knowing that their value as a collectable would only increase over time. Here today is your opportunity to own the same guns that “the Babe” had purchased and gifted to his friend Ki Cuyler.

This is the true world phone model A1586 that has the extra 4 TD-LTE bands for Europe, Latin America, and Asia, and can be unlocked for any carrier worldwide, including all US carriers. It would cost $710 with tax to purchase. It is brand new, has never yet been activated, and still has the plastic on it. I just got it at the Apple store myself, and I have the documentation. Once activated on an account, it can be unlocked for use on any carrier, anywhere in the world. If you want the most globally capable phone on the market today, this will save you over $100 on it. I will consider trades but they would have to be a pretty good offer. If interested you can call or text me at REDACTED.

The following quotes regarding this model of the iphone 6 are taken from tech/cellular sources on the internet.

""If you buy the Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile iPhone 6/6 Plus models (A1549/A1522, respectively), and unlock them, you will be able to enjoy them not only on all major US carriers, save for Sprint, but also across the globe, with the notable exception of China Mobile, SoftBank in Japan, and a few others that use TD-LTE. 

*If you, however, get the Sprint version of the iPhone 6/6 Plus (A1586/A1524), you get all sixteen LTE bands of the A1549/A1522 versions, PLUS the added benefit of four extra TD-LTE bands 38 (TD 2600), 39 (TD 1900), 40 (TD 2300), 41 (TD 2500), for a truly global LTE phone for the first time in 4G history.""

""A1586: This is the most versatile version. This model works on CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B (800, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz), GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz), UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz) and TD-SCDMA 1900 (F), 2000 (A). Compatible 4G LTE bands are FDD-LTE (Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29) and TD-LTE (Bands 38, 39, 40, 41 which are corresponding to frequencies 2600 Mhz, 1900 Mhz, 2300 Mhz and 2500 Mhz). Along with the iPhone 6 Plus A1524, this model supports both TD-SCDMA bands of China Mobile and band 39 for TD-LTE.

The rifle is an original Romanian factory built gun and is not from a kit. The sling, scope and magazine is also original to the gun and I am the original and only owner and this gun has NEVER been fired (I'm strange that way). This is a great original Communist Soviet designed sniper rifle in the cheap and accurate 7.62x54R cartridge!

The 10.5"" barrel is Black Nitride / melonite treated which is more accurate and lasts longer than chrome lined. The extremely lightweight 10"" MCSR V2 Keymod rail is $200+ and has a 1.8"" inside diameter to accommodate suppressors. The Seekins adjustable gas block is over $60 alone and offers you complete tuning capabilities (see below).

This is an awesome package and it is brand new, never fired, $450 cash. Or I might trade for a decent 1911, S&W .357 or larger caliber revolver, NIB Glock if I like the model, CZ or other quality pistol or revolvers, Mossberg SPX, AK, Mini 14, or ?

From the manufacturer:
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block lets you to fine tune your rifle's gas system for smoother cycling and operation. Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability.
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block.
Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes.

The MCSR V2 rail is comfortable, extremely light weight modular rail system that will work in any situation as well as comfortably fit a suppressor inside the rail. The MCSR V2 was designed to make using a quick mounted suppressor easy to install or remove while inside the rail.
The MCSR V2 rail is designed so that the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions will accept all keymod accessories and have two anti-rotation QD positions per side (6total). The internal dimension has increased to 1.8"" to accommodate most suppressors on the market."

It's a .44-40 calibre with a most rare 17 inch barrel. It has a three leaf express rear sight that looks like it has been on the gun for some time, however, I do not believe it came from the factory as there is no mention of a special sight. I was looking in the trapdoor and found a damaged rear carbine sight in a piece of cloth that is the early style carbine sight like those of the 66 and early 73 style. The gun has the barrel address between the barrel band and receiver, which is correct according to Madis, and I quote, ""Carbines below serial number 112000 which were made with special order fifteen to eighteen inch barrel lengths have the barrel marking the usual distance in front of the frame, from two to three and one half inches, behind the barrel band."" This gun also does not have a step on the frame behind where the barrel joins and fore of the chamber, and I quote from Madis' book, ""Short rifles and carbines in calibres 44 with shorter than standard twenty inch barrels do not have this step before serial number 100,000. The rare special short carbines with shorter barrels than the standard twenty inch length have forends which are eight inches long in early issues and seven and three quarters in later issues."" On the buttstock is seen a stamped banner that has a star inside the banner at the top and below that are initials M. J. P. I am told this is an acronym for Municipale de Juarez Policia. The wear is consistent with a border gun. This gun has seen heavy use and the middle leaf of the express sight has been broken. Of course both sights go with the gun. The guns works as it should with a little play in the dust cover but that could be tightened with a ping or two. All parts less one screw appear to be original to this gun."

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

26"" Heavy Barrel (free floated), HS Precision stock (aluminum bedded), Capacity is 3 +1, a Leupold Remington 700 STD 2-piece mount with 1"" rings (medium height I think), comes with a black TacOps Cheekpad.

There are rubbed spots on part of the finish of the barrel (in pictures), they aren't overly obvious, but they're there nonetheless. I contacted Remington and they said the barrel is fine. The marks came with the rifle when I bought it new, I did not make these marks, nor did I realize they were there until it was too late. The store on Gun Broker that I purchased the rifle from were such a nightmare that I had no interest in having to deal with them a second time by sending my rifle back, so I left it alone. Again, they're a basic finish issue, there's nothing wrong with the barrel.

It's had 44 rounds through it (I keep the brass).
I bought it to be a long-range target gun, but I rarely use it these days and have only had the chance to shoot it around 100-200 yards, just haven't had the time to go out and do the long range stuff, and I'd rather it not turn into a safe-queen.

Asking $900 for it, FTF/Local only, if interested text me at REDACTED or email me back. 
I'm selling this rifle to fuel purchasing an FNH Scar 17S, and this is a long shot but if you happen to have one you'd want to trade that's in excellent condition, preferably black although FDE is okay, I may be interested in a trade + cash. I currently can't afford much more than the rifle, and I'm pretty particular with accessories, so just a plain Scar 17S would be great, no bells or whistles. Other than for the Scar 17S, no trades please!"

Shot very well; just decided I wanted a mil-dot scope to learn on.

While not explicitly marked on the scope, the consensus over at SavageShooters is that it is indeed a Prostaff albeit a previous generation as it does not have finger-adjustable turrets- they're the coin style. Still makes for a great entry-level scope, IMO.

Scope comes with factory rings and Butler Creek lens covers (clear on the objective, opaque on the ocular).

We use only factory stock firearms in recording velocities, so that you get true, actual field velocities with our ammo --- not exaggerated test barrel velocities

All .45-70 Magnum loadings are intended for use in the following firearms:

New England Arms Handi-Rifle
Ruger #1 and #3
T/C Encore

The 500 gr. load uses a dual diameter, bonded core bullet by Alaska Bullet Works. The bullet diameter in front of the crimp groove is .449 inch, while measuring .457 inch on the shank. This dual diameter allows for reliable chambering in rifles with short or no throats. This is a non-expanding Full Metal Jacket bullet designed for the deepest penetration on the largest game animals. This load is safe for use in any firearm designed for the other BBA .45/70 MAG. LEVER GUN cartridges.
