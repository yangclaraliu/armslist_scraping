Only 100 rds of quality ammo fired. 60 rounds Hornady subsonic match and 40 rds Remington subsonic match. That's it and it looks like new. 

I wanted to see if I even wanted a 300 blackout so I bought this upper to try out the cartridge. I loved it but I admit to being a bit of a name whore so now I want a Noveske at about 7 times the cost of this perfectly good upper. The upper is factory Hardened Arms, good people and we're attentive and friendly when I called about buying it. I used an FN milspec BCG and a R-guns charging handle. These are included. So it's ready to pin to your lower and start shooting. I had good results firing suppressed subsonic match ammo. It printed 1.5 minute groups, not bad considering the 220 grain subs barely fly fast enough to remain stable. I bet it will shoot a ragged whole with decent supersonic ammo. 

Priced at a very fair $375. Pick up or ship on your dime to your door. Price is rock solid and i dont want to drive more than 20 miles. No trades unless you have a 9 inch Sig M400 300 blackout...then I have cash to make up the difference. Same with a Rock River 9mm AR pistol. I have cash for one of those too. Must be RRA or a new unused PSA 9mm pistol kit.

BULLET INFORMATION:
Thanks to its unique projectile design this load possesses a higher ballistic coefficient than standard M855 ball. The noticeably longer projectile ensures it better retains both its velocity and energy over distance. The end result is it shoots flatter, drifts less in the wind and hits harder compared to standard M855. It also possesses greater sectional density for deeper penetration."

I am very put off by the way your customer service is, although you do have competitive prices and top notch parts your smug attitude makes me not want to come back and I won't. the fourth instance that I had was last week when me and a friend came in to see what was available. When we entered the store it was immaculate, so I began to look around to gather the parts that I wanted for a AR build. The associate that helped me, after 10 mins of staring at the parts I was ready to purchase asked if I needed help. I kindly told him what I wanted and asked a few questions about the parts and how they would be interchangeable with my existing setup. After answering my questions which seem to be stupid to him he turned his back to me and ignored me and the fact that I was ready to spend $200-$500 on parts. I will also let you know that my friend that I spoke about was looking for a nice carry/conceal pistol. I hope this post will help you in the future because you let $1500 walk out the door at the last 10 mins of your day.. FIX YOUR ATTITUDE please!"

At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition.

 A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

 Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.

If you’re not already familiar with the Mossberg Model 500, it’s time to get you acquainted. The venerable ‘Mossy’ is a pump-action shotgun that feeds from a 5-round tubular magazine. Its barrels are easily removed by unscrewing a captive knurled screw from the end of the magazine tube. Unlike the Remington Model 870, the Mossberg’s magazine capacity cannot be increased by installing an extended mag tube without also replacing the barrel.The alloy receiver is not a stressed component. Instead of locking to the receiver, the bolt of the Mossberg Model 500 uses a single locking lug that cams upwards into a matching hole in the barrel extension. A sliding safety is positioned on the rear hump of the receiver, and a bolt-release button protrudes slightly from the left rear of the trigger guard. The action is operated by twin action bars that prevent the torsion and binding which plagued some earlier pump shotgun designs.
The FLEX 500 is the newest variant of this 52 year-old design. It uses rugged and simple quick-release fittings to swap out buttstocks, fore-ends and recoil pads. This allows the shooter to use a single receiver as the core component for many different shotguns."

The technology that lies within this compact reflex sight offers you significant advantages: the illuminated dot has a manual as well as an automatic digital control system - ensuring maximum security and precision in terms of function. A further security feature is the combination of batteries and solar cell. This leads to virtually unlimited function and total reliability.

It's a great optic that I originally intended to mount on my AR.  I've changed my mind and am now using a Leupold scope.  I did use it on my Hi-Point 995 for two weeks.  I know, I know.  Using a Zeiss on a Hi-Point.  Bwahaha!  A $600 optic on a $300 carbine!"

This was my daily driver for the summer but there is a few hiccups. The battery likes to get low on power and I haven't investigated why. It has some small spots of rust like the billet chrome steering wheel and some on the shifter and on the frame. It has a slow power steering pump leak. I just top it off every 2 weeks and it's fine. Other then that it's a sharp looking jeep inside and out and a total power house. Hearing all offers."
