Low round count through this Gen 2. Maybe 300 rounds. If you do not know the difference between a newer PS90 and this, then do your research first. This has a highly desirable Gen2 trigger pack which alone have gone for $650. It is in great condition, functions as should with no issues, misfires, misfeeds. DO NOT make an offer unless you are willing to follow through. Too many kids not following through after an offer is accepted.  Lowball offers will be ignored, If you want to negotiate on price, step up and do it in person. If you are close on my asking price, then ask if I will accept it. But if you show up and then try and negotiate from there, I will walk away, because a deal had been made. May consider partial trade, but 1/2 MUST be in cash.
Also, yes, you will see some on gunbroker for less. Some of these have been bought through LEO program and are not covered under FN warranty. This is a Gen2 tri-rail. Please do your own research, I am not here to educate you. If you have a question about my PS90, please ask, but don't bombard me with questions you can answer on your own about the differences of different gens. I realize this all seems to be more than some can handle, but just being upfront due to previous experiences here on armslist.

Made of a Fiberglass reinforced polymer, It's a great stock, and it comes with a 1/4 in. rubber recoil pad. very light weight and makes the Ruger a very handy and light rifle. Mine includes a used Stainless Forend Liner & Stock Cap Assembly for free, (Price for a Used one hovers around $12 or so).
Unfortunately for myself the Length of Pull is longer than my short Asian arms and is very uncomfortable for me to shoot. I would posit that the Average male with a height of 5""10"" and above would find this an extremely comfortable stock when compared to Ruger's original stock that has a much short length of pull. Cost on the Choate Tool Corp website is $77.99 + shipping for just the stock. I will Include the Choate Tool Corp Handguard as well, MSRP at $13.65 for an additional 5 dollars.
I would like $70 for the Stock, the Forened liner and Stock cap assembly (used)  and Hand-guard shipped to your door. IF you come to pick it up I'm willing to let it go for cheaper.
Picture 4: is a Custom Mini 14 Gas block, It replaces the top half and has a dove tail that has a XS White stripe front sight blade installed. it is machined out of 303 stainless and Made in America by Lee Hadaway, who is a renowned Mini 14 Gunsmith, it Retails for $100+shipping, I'd sell it for $75 shipped to your door or 70 if you come to pick it up.
Open to reasonable negotiations if anyone wants to buy all 3 of these shoot me a message and we'll try to work something out.

I have for sale a Glock 23 Gen 3 .40 S&W that has been shot very little and not carried at all. In the pics you can see that it is like new with no scratches or dings of any kind. There is a minor wear mark on top of the barrel but that happens as soon as you shoot one magazine. This is a very nice Glock .40 cal. and really clean. It was bought new as well as the 5 extra Glock branded mags ( total of 6 mags ). Not pictured are 2 Glock magazine loaders. Also, included in this package deal is 220 rounds of premium hollow points and 22 rounds of practice ammo. I would like to sell all together but will split up if the price is right. Another thing to note is that I do not have the factory box or paperwork. This is a one owner gun and I have a current CWP for those who like to know. Thanks for looking and email me with any questions."

Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.Snag-Free, Modular Design, Loaded with FeaturesLoaded-with-FeaturesThe lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.Easy-to-MaintainReliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to MaintainThis pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.SpecsModel: PX4 StormType: Semi-Auto PistolAction: Double / Single ActionCaliber: 9mmCapacity: 17+1# of Magazines: 2Frame: Polymer FrameSights: 3-DotBarrel Length: 4Overall Length: 7.59Weight (empty): 27.52 oz.Can Not be Sold in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Hawaii, D.C., Illinois."

Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.Snag-Free, Modular Design, Loaded with FeaturesLoaded-with-FeaturesThe lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.Easy-to-MaintainReliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to MaintainThis pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.Specs9mm Luger4"" barrel10 roundsAmbidextrous Safety/Decocker, spring loaded, positively on or offInterchangeable checkered backstraps gripsFiberglass reinforced technopolymer frameBruniton coated steel finish3 dot sights27.3 oz"

Too busy cleaning my competition guns. The insides of the barrels have no pitting! That's a relieving feature. It has a big splinter out of the forearm right against the barrel. The stock and forearm have plenty of blemishes. This would make an excellent duck or goose gun for someone who's serious and appreciates a fine, well-functioning although not perfectly gorgeous firearm.

The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® redefines what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition.

The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M)®, which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XD(M)® features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place.

I hate to part with it, but it's served me well and I need cash for my 3Gun addiction or possibly a boat motor/trailer.

First off, it's a 1943 Tula ex sniper with one of the cleanest barrels ive ever seen. I'd give it an 8/10 plenty of rifling and it shines. You can see inside the reciever where the original p/u scope was removed. It is not matching numbers (who cares). It is an absolute accuracy machine. At 100 yards you will get 1 inch groups. At 50 yards you will chew out the damn bullseye. I have kept the barrel clean meticulously. 

Now let's talk upgrades. 

-eBay butt pad
- trigger slack spring (poor mans 2 stage trigger)
-bent bolt handle
- Texas precision products muzzle brake (thing rocks)
- sling lugs drilled into the stock for bipod and monopod (secured with JB weld. Solid as a rock)
- genuine Harris side to side swivel bipod 9-13"" 
-accu-shot monopod (that's right. A fucking monopod)
-Jmeck barrel wrap tall scope mount (let's you see through the iron sights)
- eBay cheek pad.
-eBay pistol grip is also drilled into the stock and JB welded

Currently mounted is a Primary Arms 4-14x Mil-Mil FFP mil dot scope. A true first focal plane scope which is revered throughout the shooting world as outrageous bang for your buck. Is mounted with some nice beefy hi quality rings and has butler creek flip caps.

The scope is optional and is a $300 set up on its own.

I would say conservative estimate of the rifle without the scope is $600. I spent 2 years, blood sweat and tears on it and that is a great price.

I took this bad boy to a distance shoot 2 weeks ago and was ringing stee targets from 200-700 yards with ease. That's how good the scope is. I was even ringing the hostage flapper at 240 yds no problem. Let's face it, this is as close as you're gonna get to a legit distance rifle without dropping over $1000 and it shoots 25¢ Ammo. I'm selling because I need gear for 3gun and ammo and it is sucking up all my damn money.

Serious offers please. Will consider ammo(.223, 9mm, 12g) other stuff, interesting firearms, steel targets, trolling motors, boat trailers, maybe a sweet compound bow, tree stand trail cams. 

I got more pics just ask and I get around I can travel for the right deal. I got some ammo for it too. Russian silver tip.  I'm located in Middlefield text or call 330-607-3194"

Make your Glock 19 a .40 and shoot limited in uspsa or pack a little more punch in your CC pistol!  This is a Gen 3 pair (no guide rod/recoil spring) that was refurbished at one point and remarketed as NIB-X (nickel boron) coated. This makes for super easy cleaning after firing and offers what is basically known as self-lubricity. I tend to more so believe that it just does a better job of lubricating in conjunction with a quality firearms lubricant because of the material that it is. The barrel has just 150 or so rounds through it. Thhe slide has some holster wear on the outer (right) side from my team partner practicing with dry fire in a holster that was too damn tight and I wasn't aware until it was too late. Because of this and because I am not offering sights on this pair, I am cool with letting it go for $170/or best REASONABLE offer.

It is a small gun but considering the short length of the grip it actually shoots pretty well as long as you control muzzle flip as needed. The original green G10 Scorpion grips come with it. The Hogue rubber wraparounds installed are very comfortable however. The factory FDE cerakote finish is in excellent shape with no scratches, dents or dings. The round count for this fella is about 120. All of that was quality brass cased loads and not one malfunction was recorded. Comes with box, papers, lock, brush and unfortunately only one 6 round magazine. The P2388 Scorpion model sells new for around $699 typically. The Hogue grip addition was $30 but I realize I won't get that back. Because of the excellent condition of this pistol and its ability to historically hold its value, I feel an asking price of $625 is a good start. I also have a ton of .380 ammo both target and high quality self defense rounds. If need be we can do a bundle deal on the gun with some or hell with all the .380 I have and make you a REALLY happy person lol! Please, once again NO TRADES and call, text or email REDACTED. Must produce a valid North Carolina DL or ID card as well as CCH permit or Pistol Purchase Permit and sign a bill of sale. This is all to verify that buyer can legally purchase a handgun in the state of NC. Someone will get a very nice carry gun here as it functions much like a 1911, most beneficially because it can be carried in the notorious ""cocked and locked"" configuration. NO TRADES and Happy Thanksgiving. God Bless."
