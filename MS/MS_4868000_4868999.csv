This pistol shoots the powerful 9X18 Makarov cartridge, inexpensive and readily available everywhere.  It can be fired both double and single action.  It is NOT a .380 or 9mm Parabellum.

There is a slide-release button on the left side of the frame, which makes reloading fast. Reloads can be accomplished by inserting a full magazine and hitting the slide release button. 

Clean, simple, not very expensive, and it works. What more could you ask of a pocket auto?  

This would be a perfect pistol for personal, home or automobile security use. How about giving this as an awesome Christmas gift for somebody special. Contact me so we can meet and let you inspect this Makarov. I know you won't be disappointed. The price is $350 cash only, and you must show me your Oklahoma Driver's license.

We are scared to sleep here at night because we were minutes from being here when this occurred. I know $200 isn't going to get me a block but we need something reliable enough to protect us and our children. Also if anyone has any old clothes/shoes/baby boy things for a 1 old they don't need anymore we could really use them like I said they took EVERYTHING.

Never any jamming issues with any ammo... it just eats up whatever you put in. 

I have owned this gun for many years, but have not run a ton of rounds through it. I started carrying a smaller piece and have shot that one most of the time. I bought this used, so I don't know how many rounds it has total, but it's a glock... it will last for years to come.

I bought this gun about 2 years ago but have not shot it much. The guy I bought it from said he had a few hundred rounds through it and I have only put 100 through it (tops). I ended up getting another .45 shortly after this and tend to shoot that one. Time for me to let this one go to a good home. 

Gun has some light wear, but it's a glock... it's going to last forever :)"

The Ruger Police Carbine is a pistol caliber carbine designed as a companion to the Ruger P Series pistols. As of 2007, Ruger has discontinued production. It is a semi-automatic carbine using a blowback action. The Carbine uses the same ammunition and magazines as the Ruger P Series 9mm and .40 S&W caliber pistols.

Both the PC9 (the 9mm version) and the PC4 (.40 S&W) are patterned after the highly successful Ruger 10/22 carbine. The Carbine is intended as a shoulder weapon for police use, although it is available for sale to civilians as well. The intent is that an officer will carry a Ruger P Series pistol as a sidearm, and keep a Carbine available (for example, in his/her patrol vehicle) as a shoulder weapon if needed. Since the carbine has a 16-inch (410 mm) barrel, it provides more power with the same ammunition used by the 4-inch (100 mm) barreled pistol. The carbine also provides additional accuracy and range over the pistol."

When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.Transfer Bar The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.Fiber Optic Sight Light gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic"

Gaston Glock's masterpiece would go on to gain acceptance worldwide with consumers in both professional and civilian circles. The GLOCK 23 Gen 3 has become one of the most popular duty and concealed carry pistols ever produced.Police, military, competition shooters and those looking for a means of defense turn to the Glock 23 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments.

Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery ,providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling. 



The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you''ll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot. Text REDACTED for more info"

I am not a trap shooter so I have very little use for it. It is a 12 gauge SKB 85TSS with a trap combo that includes two barrel kits (one 34"" unsingle barrel with adjustable rib, and the other being a 32"" over and under ventilated rib barrel ). In addition this combo brings a full set of factory SKB chokes and some aftermarket competition chokes totaling 11 chokes combined. The shotgun also features an adjustable cheek piece and an adjustable GraCoil recoil pad. It comes with accessories and tools (pictured) including a custom SKB hard case, a multi-choke wrench/tool, and a set of multiple HIVIZ sights in a neat holder. Needless to say this is a serious competition gun with everything you need to get started in the sport of trap, skeet, or bird hunting. 
The condition of this firearm is excellent to say the least. The wood finish is pristine, with only a few very very minor blemishes. The metal on both barrels and the receiver is in great condition (easily over 95%). It has only had one owner and looks like new!
This shotgun is rare and hard to get these days since it is no longer made and most people hang on to theirs because of its high quality. SKB is well known for its great costumer service and quality products; my grandfather has always talked this gun up, you're getting a great premium package here!

Interstate Arms Hawk 981R in a Bullpup Unlimited Remington 870 SG Kit with upgrades.
This has been my Home Defense weapon for about a year or so. Because of it's compact design, it lets you maneuver around corners without exposing part of your weapon.  , unnecessarily. It eats everything you feed it in 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells. If you have an AR, you will like the trigger, safety selector, and angle grip.

The SG: I chose the Interstate Arms 981R as my platform as it is an identical clone of the Rem 870.  The only difference found between the two, is in the barrel. In every other aspect it resembles the Rem 870. I searched the internet and found plenty of positive information on the Hawk 981R and the bullpup kit before starting the project.

The kit: It simple and solid. The kit makes a Remington 870, go from 38.25 inches in length to 28.5 inches. AR style grip, trigger, and selector switch. Remington recoil pad takes a ton of the kick off. 15.5 inches of picatinny rail on top lets you place your optic wherever you want it. It has two, 2.5 picatinny rails on both sides to attach a light or anything else.

Here's the list of the whole conversion plus upgrades cost:

Hawk 981R SG - $172
Bullpup Kit - $295
Wilson Combat Extension - $42 
Fab Defense Side Saddle - $ $32
Bullpup Unlimited 90 degree side rail - $10
Magpul style angled foregrip - $15

Total: $566

I am asking $535. You can't put it together for less than what I totaled above. I don't want to get rid of it as this was my project SG, but my wife recently surprised me with a KSG, so I don't have the need for this one to be my HD weapon, anymore.

I have a Cobra Tactical Systems ergo grip that I will throw in for an extra $20.

Battle Arms Development - Combat Ambidextrous Safety Selector - Semi Auto - Short Throw (BAD-CASS-SA-ST). The shorter rotational distance allows for lightning fast manipulation of the safety.  Perfect for competition where speed is essential.  The shorter throw also allows more lever clearance and reduce lever interference to the trigger finger knuckle. 

What is different with the BAD-CASS family of safety selectors vs. the original BAD-ASS family of safety selectors are the way the levers are attached.  The DOVETAIL lever attachment of the BAD-CASS allows for superior strength and dependability by removing the stress from the screws.  Originally designed for military applications, the BAD-CASS Combat Ambidextrous Safety Selector is now available to all.

I'm primarily looking for something that would be more practical for conceal carry. Mainly in the market for a single stack 9mm. Would really like a basic (Armscor, RIA, etc) 9mm 1911, but would also be interested in a basic officer size 1911 of any caliber. Otherwise would be interested in other single stack 9mm pistols (LC9S, BP9CC, Sig P290, etc- NO Shields though). Would also be interested in a S&W J-frame.

This Rossi is as new and has never been fired.  The action is very smooth.

Lyman Barrel Mounted Folding Rear Sight
Marble Tang Peep Sight
Stainless Steel Magazine Tube Follower and Magazine Spring from Steve Gunz
Custom Handmade Leather Gunstock and Lever Cover
Refinished Wood with Casey Stain and Tru-oil

Being the overly cautious person that I am, I prefer to transfer through FFL and will split the transfer.  Will consider direct sale with Concealed Carry or Pistol Purchase permit and NCDL and signed Bill of Sale.  Send your email address and I will send some great close up shots."

If you look up reviews on this gun you'll find it's highly rated and very accurate. I have also had the type F mod/upgrade done to this that turns the safety into a de-cocker. Awesome gun, only selling because I recently acquired two Glock 9mm's and would like a 38/357 snubnose revolver for a night stand gun. That being said I'm asking $375 FIRM for this package. This gun lists for $549 new and I am throwing in 150 round of ammo and a holster so $400 is very reasonable. I may consider trade or partial trade for a nice snubnose revolver? I have my CPL and would prefer you did too and had all the paperwork needed to purchase. You can email me or call or text at REDACTED thanks for looking! Also I have more pics if needed."

The HHS I provides a solution for engaging threats in close-quarter combat situations, then quickly transitions to a 600-meter targeting or surveillance situation. A quick switch-to-side (STS) mount offers simple, fast disengagement of the G33 magnifier.

The S.L. Variant speed loader is the loader most preferred by revolver pros! The S.L. Variant earned its reputation as the most secure and positive-loading speed loader in both competitive and real-world venues. It is also the only ""adjustable"" speedloader we know of.
The S.L. Variant holds its rounds more securely than any competitive speed loader.  No more reaching in a pocket to find loose rounds accompanied by an empty speed loader!   The S.L. Variant is also the most positively-loading speed loader on the market because the rounds are forced out with a “punch” due to the loaders individually spring loaded chambers.  

This are as new...except for playing around with them for a few minutes, I have not used them...they have been in my safe since purchased.  The price is for the leather case holder and three speed loaders as pictured.  If you are not familiar with how good these are search Google for info or YouTube for video reviews.  Price may seem high but these are comparatively bargain priced.  Sold as set will not separate."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

In its lowest position the stock will allow for the use of iron sights or the stock can be raised up to 1.25″ higher for use with mounted optics. This stock system features an improved magwell relief that allows for easier operation of any M14/M1A magazine.

It is a 2dr 5sp with 198111 miles on it. Mileage will go up because it is my daily driver right now. It runs and drives great. Has almost new Michelin tires. The interior is in excellent condition. The only thing wrong with it is a small fender dent on the passenger side. I bought the car that way so nothing to really worry about. It had a jasper transmission put in at 175670 and it is still under warranty. Needs nothing to be a great dependable car. Only selling due to needing money for bills.

The Klipt Appendix ""Inside the Waste-band"" holster"" is the perfect way to conceal and securely carry any small or medium frame auto or J-frame revolver. Its ultra-thin signature makes it very comfortable and extremely low profile. It can be carried undetectable without printing even when wearing minimal attire. Your firearm locks securely into the holster with the signature Blade-Tech click. The Blade-Tech Belt Clip is very secure while still allowing for quick removal from the belt when necessary. It fits all belts up to 1 3/4"". This holster was originally developed in conjunction with Covert Special Operators working in theater, designed to be carried as a front strong side appendix holster for extremely quick access in CQB environments. Because of its simple design it can also be carried on the weak side in IWB cross draw fashion or as a straight drop IWB holster on the strong side hip. Wearing this holster in the appendix mode is where it really shines since it requires a minimal amount of movement during the firearm presentation allowing for a lightning fast non telegraphing draw stroke getting your firearm into the fight when precious seconds count. As a driving/anti-carjacking holster it is second to none. Whether you are a civilian or a Law Enforcement officer the Klipt holster makes a great choice for use as a back-up holster when carrying a larger firearm as your primary weapon.

I originally purchased this rifle as a 5.45x39 Saiga that Century had converted the back end of the rifle on. I fired about 300 rounds through it in that configuration, then sent it into Rifle Dynamics to have the whole rifle worked over and made amazing. They went through the whole rifle and smoothed it up, made sure everything was tight and right and straight, they removed the accessory rail from the side, installed their trademark Bolton gas block/sight combo, cut the barrel down and pinned/welded a Smith Vortex flash hider for an OAL of 16.1 inches. They bead blasted the whole gun down to bare metal, parkerized it and then coated it in their gray Norrell's moly resin finish.  The Rifle has a Magpul front handguard, a shaped and stippled US Palm grip, a trigger/hammer pin retainer plate, an ALG AKT trigger, a Zenit oversized charging handle, Ultimak top rail, the Rifle Dynamics m4 tube stock adapter and a MFT Minimalist stock. 

Having started life as a Saiga, this rifle has the cold hammer forged and chrome lined combloc barrel.  I have only put about 200 rounds through it since I got it back from Rifle Dynamics and they were not corrosive.    I never seem to have the chance to take serious training classes with this gun like I had intended, and it's a shame to see such a beautiful gun just sitting in my safe.


 I am not including the optic you see in the pictures.  It come with the pictured Rifle Dynamics branded case with one Bulgarian Circle 21 Magazine and I have 12 additional magazines I can include for another $200.   I can sell it without the MFT minimalist stock for $50 less if you have another Stock you'd rather use.

The gun has about 500 rnds through it, has worked perfectly since day one. There are a couple small marks on it, nothing major, just basic wear and tear. It was only used in indoor ranges. Just need to sell it because i'm in between jobs and have bills due soon.
There is one grip screw missing in the pistol, i didn't bother getting a new one in hopes the one i lost would just turn up. You can order a whole set online for no more than 10 dollars though.
