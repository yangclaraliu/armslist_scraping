Ruger's LCRx has a patent pending polymer fire control housing to hold all the fire control components in their proper dimensional relationships, reduce weight significantly, and help reduce recoil. The friction reducing
cam is the next generation design in fire control systems with an optimized cam that results in a smooth, non-stacking trigger pull. LCRx high strength stainless steel cylinder is extensively fluted (reducing weight) and
features an Ionbond Diamondblack finish for excellent durability.  The Grip Peg allows a variety of grip styles to be installed leaving ample room for recoil cushioning. The external hammer allows the LCRx to be fired in single action mode.

Got this pistol from a trade and I am not really a Beretta fan so trying to see what my options are. It is on california roster but no longer manufactured. One unique thing about this pistol is that it has a rotating barrel unlike other pistols. The gun was never fired per the seller but when I quickly inspected the firearm at ffl, it had some scratches. Comes with 3 mags and bianchi leather shoulder holster but no box or documents. I'm interested trading with something interesting in semi-auto 22lr or 9mm format. No revolvers please. Let me know what you have via email."

This weapon system is all in like new condition and the 300 Black Out has been fired very few times and the 6.8 has not been fired at all.  This is my second XCR-L and they are awesome rifles for 3 gun or hunting since they make several different caliber conversions.  I personally wanted the 300 to shoot suppressed and the 6.8 for hunting purposes.  

This XCR-L comes in Field Dark Earth color with their new Keymod rail system. Side Charging Slide that remains in a fixed position when firing weapon. It is a piston operated system with each caliber having its own gas adjustment system.  The 300 Blackout is a 16"" Barrel and very light weight with 1/7 twist and threaded.  The 6.8 is a 16"" Barrel and is made heavier with 1/11 twist and threaded.  Has an excellent trigger system.  The Robinson Armament Fast Stock is Folding, extendable and has an adjustable cheek rest.  It comes with all manuals.  The rifle is easy to break down and clean and easy to reassemble.  Caliber changes are quick and easy.  Loosen one bolt located underneath where the barrel attaches to the upper and pull the barrel out, then open the upper and pull out the piston system and BCG.  Replace with the new bolt and piston and drop in the receiver.  Put in new barrel and tighten bolt.  Very easy and is a tac driver.  Rifle with both calibers is $2400.00

Eotech and magnifier will only be sold with the rifle at this price.  $600.00 for both the HWS and magnifier.  Both are in Field Dark Earth Color and match almost perfectly.  This is the Op Mod system from optics planet and cost $1100 new.

So can purchase rifle for $2400 and eotech for $600 - Total $3000.00

If you go online and try and order this system it will take months to get in your hands.  However, you can get optional caliber conversions from Robinson Arms website.

Best way to reach me is by text at REDACTED.  I will call back as soon as I can.  FTF transaction preferred but will ship through FFL.  I have hard case for both rifle and eotech."

Clean rifle that functions and shoots excellent.  Will send additional pictures of groups I shot with it and barrel machines markings.
The stock could be in better shape, but that doesn't effect the functioning of the rifle.
Stock is actually pretty neat, has foreign writing carved into it, and a thumb nail marking where one might dig their thumb into the stock during combat.

Chinese Sks were MILLED on the same machinery as Russian SKS.  Russian Sks are known for being the gold standard.  Russia sent Russian made tooling and mills to China and this Sks was produced on that machinery.  Vice yugo or other Sks which are stamped, more bulky and less stream lined.

This is chambered in 5.56/.223 and has fired EVERY round I've put through it without a hitch. Not one single FTF, FTE, Stovepipe, jam, etc. I've used crappy Govco mags, P-Mags, tilting followers, etc. This rifle just keeps dishing out the rounds one after another.

However; it is time for me to say farewell to my starter rifle and begin building my dream rifle.

Upgrades on the rifle include:

1) Forend upgrade with picatinny rails.

4) MBUS Style rear sight (flip-up)
5) Generic but reliable front Flip-up iron.
6) Ergonomic Pistol Grip with Storage.
7) Two Point Sling and Picatinny front sling mount.

9) Improved Extractor
10) A2 Flash Hider.

Hey all,
I decided to change up my 45 load. So, to keep things simple I'm selling off all my other factory ammo. I priced these at lower than what I saw in stores. I would cut a little better of a deal if you buy all or large lots. This is all brass cased factory ammo (no reloads). May consider trades for certain reloading powders, primers, projectiles, casings. ,May consider gun trades as well. Just shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet in Norman. 
Here is what I have on hand:


HP/Defense
-19X 50RD boxes of Federal Hi-Shok JHP 185 grain Defense rounds- $30 each


Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

 Second is a CZ Model 27 32 acp. This is also a waffenamt pistol produced after the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia and took over the CZ factory during WW2. The frame and slide are matching numbers and even the barrel contains a waffenamt. Comes in a nice leather holster. This gun shoots well with no issues.

It began its life as an everyday, off the shelf G19 in FDE. The original owner who purchased it decided a stock handgun was not good enough and proceeded to upgrade it. Here is a list of what I know has changed about it:

Titanium Nitride barrel ported at 15 degrees.
Titanium Nitride ejector and safety plunger.
Titanium Nitride stainless steel pins.
Pyramid adjustable trigger.
Pyramid extended magazine release.
Pyramid magazine baseplate.
Zev stainless steel guide rod.
Zev 18lb guide rod spring.
Zev spring kit.
Zev ghost trigger spring.
Trijicon hi-def front sight.
Williams adjustable rear sight.
Slide has had Raptor cuts to lessen the guns weight.
Trigger has been undercut to facilitate a better grip.
All internal parts have been mirror polished as well.

After the gun switched hands a couple times for whatever reasons (and I have to assume the fact that the FDE, TiN, and black just looked awful), it wound up in my hands.  I then had the trigger guard rounded over to fit my liking and also had the frame shot in a black Duracoat. The slide and extended magazine release (which was also TiN at one point) were then Cerakoted in a similar black to match.

The gun now looks very sharp and is a real head turner.  The gun comes with the original case, 2 magazines, and all original paperwork and accessories.  I'm not actively seeking trades but I do know this is a lot to swallow. I'd be glad to do a partial trade/cash if that helps the right person into such a great gun. 

My reasons for selling are that: 1. Not a Glock guy.  2. I know nothing about Glocks.  3.  I'm a .40 fan, not 9mm.  4.  It deserves to be used, not just sitting in a safe.  

Thanks for looking."

Nothing is wrong with the gun at all. It is just is a bit thin for my hands and I'm getting away from Glock in general.
Price is fair on this gun so don't tell me it's only worth $300. Got it new at Cabelas for about $550, so you're getting a deal on a good new gun. Comes with both original magazines and the factory box.

Current configuration is for AK type magazines and ammunition.  16"" Barrel with Yankee Hill LTA suppressor mount.

In my experience, it works with some drums and magazines, but is slightly finicky.  The MGI trigger group with extra strength Wolff hammer spring works fairly well, but aftermarked trigger groups such as the Geisselle SSA and AR-Gold triggers don't seem to have enough power to reliably ignite the primers on bulk steel cased ak ammo.  Strangely, they do run steel case Wolf 6.5 grendel ammo flawlessly.

The bolt and mags work fine with the cheap steel Wolf Grendel ammo, and with the modular upper you can swap barrels in seconds.  The Wolf Grendel ammo runs well in drums, especially, but better grade 6.5 ammo is loaded a bit longer, and tends to stick in the mags & drums.  

Currently configured with 45 degree offset iron sights.  

I have a stainless, nitrided, 18.5"" fluted 6.5 grendel barrel also available for my cost of $275 that works with this setup as long as you're running the cheap steel case ammo.
