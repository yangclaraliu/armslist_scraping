Within the GripZone™, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.   The GripZone™ doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone™ advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel.

They made these rifles for 25 yrs in a different caliber each year. The first year they made the rifle in the legendary 7x57mm Mauser, They only made a  few more than 2,000 for this introductory year. Not only did this rifle survive but it is in very close to perfect condition. The rifle is so nice that I only take it out of the safe to show it off. I have never hunted with it. It should be treated like the rare ""classic"" that it is. It has leupold rings and bases and a nice vintage Weaver K4 scope, which looks appropriate on this rifle. If you collect the LE series of 700's you know it starts with this one. I will ship this rifle at buyers expense. I will email or text you better pictures upon request."

Got the gun from Liberty Arms (gun store) brand new last year (2014). I've kept the firearm in good condition. It has a somewhat dark colored (dark brown) wood stock and wood grip, a metal trigger, a metal safety, and a green plastic sight. It's a well made firearm that feels great to shoot, and on top of that it's pretty to look at. It's smooth and easy to rack, and it also makes a really cool metallic sound when you rack it. 

Some perks:
1) This gun works very well even with the cheapest shotgun ammunition (like federal rounds). No need for pricy ammunition with this CZ 912, unless your hunting of course! 

2) Included with the sale of the gun is the box it came in, the chokes/choke key, and the fancy satin packaging of course.

Thanks for looking! Hopefully we talk soon.

2 magazines - factory  9 round capacity


I bought it used from Gander Mountain and they had to send it in to Taurus. After waiting for it to come back I decided I really wouldn't want to keep it even if it does function perfectly.
Took it to the range today and it functions flawlessly, shot after shot. So I am vacillating, but I think I still have too many guns.
Full specs from Taurus are below.  This gun's serial number says it was manufactured in 2006, but you would never know it. And the rosewood grips are very attractive.
 Need permit and license to purchase. If it is here it is available. Please, no lowball offers. Thanks.

Ultra light and extremely compact, Taurus small frame semi-automatic pistols offer security and reliability you can count on. In .22 LR or .25 ACP, these pistols feature a blowback action and tip-up barrel for safety and convenience during loading and chambering the first round Each model utilizes low profile fixed sights and is made in the USA.

The magazine is supposed to hold 30 rounds, but if you want it to maintain it's spring tension, I would only load 20 rounds.   If you want self defence, pass this up and buy a glock.

I went to the range today to test it out and out of about 130 rounds down range it had about 3 failures to feed.  I don't know if the spring in the magazine was the problem or if the brass was a part of the problem.     30 round magazines are about 30 dollars before tax,

From the factory:

The Range Master shares several of the inherent performance traits as the Target Master. The overall body is more typical to the classic 1911 platform in looks only. The forged steel, Master Series frame provides the solid foundation for a hand fit, buttery smooth slide actuation from the first round to the last. And competition ready checkering and adjustable rear sight put you in the hunt right out of the box. So if you are the type that is serious about hitting the same hole multiple times, the Range Master can get you there.

No scratches or marks of any kind on anywhere throughout the gun. This is not the newer model with the bull barrel, regardless, it is still super clean and tight. As you can see, the night sights have been polished but the rear portion is still black. There aren't any dents on the sights so if you really wanted to paint them back, you can. We all know that Kimbers have a series 80 safety but I've removed it and put in a series 70 firing pin. I don't have those parts for the series 80 mechanism anymore but if you really wanted them back, you can order them through Kimber, they are pretty cheap parts from what I've read online. 

I've probably put less than 500 rounds through the gun since the series 70 firing pin and have never had a problem. You're welcome to test fire it at a range but bring your own ammo and cover my range fees. 

Other than touching the sights and replacing the firing pin, nothing else on this gun has been modified.

This pistol was built by Anderson Manufacturing. Overall barrel length is 10.5 inches. Comes with a factory installed aluminum key-mod free float handguard w/ picatinny rails. The pistol is fully functional (with BCG and CH included). I have added a upgraded Full Auto Black Nitride Bolt Carrier Group. Nitiride is much slicker and harder than chrome or even Nickel Boron. It allows that Bolt Carrier Group to operate much longer without lubrication than standard chrome or parkerized finish. It is also much much easier to clean.

Also comes with a 30 round MagPul PMag magazine and single point bungee style sling for easier carrying. This is pistol, no different than a handgun. NO tax stamp is needed to own, use, or carry (yes, it can be carried as a CCW pistol if you wish).

Purchased with an idea in mind and never made it around to finish the project. Never shot a single round from it. 

This pistol was built by Anderson Manufacturing. Overall barrel length is 10.5 inches. Comes with a factory installed aluminum key-mod free float handguard w/ picatinny rails. The pistol is fully functional (with BCG and CH included). I have added a upgraded Full Auto Black Nitride Bolt Carrier Group. Nitiride is much slicker and harder than chrome or even Nickel Boron. It allows that Bolt Carrier Group to operate much longer without lubrication than standard chrome or parkerized finish. It is also much much easier to clean.

Also comes with a 30 round MagPul PMag magazine and single point bungee style sling for easier carrying. This is pistol, no different than a handgun. NO tax stamp is needed to own, use, or carry (yes, it can be carried as a CCW pistol if you wish).

Price is $750 OBO. FTF only, no shipping. Must be 21 with a VALID OH ID. CCW (like myself) preferred. No Trades. Thanks for looking."
