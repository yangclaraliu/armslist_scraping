Text me @ REDACTED
Introduction
The Spike's Tactical LW BAR2 12” Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that’s machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The main benefit of the BAR rail is to those who wish to have a suppressor inside of the rail or for those shooters who have large bear paw hands and who feel that skinnier rails are just too small ( the BAR is about the same circumference as a DD rail with the popular Magpul XTM covers). 

Inside dimensions 1.80"" Outside dimensions Picatinny to picatinny 2.42"" 

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling. 

But wait, there’s more! The BAR has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it’s compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it’s made right here in the USA and backed by our LIFETIME WARRANTY!

Selling my almost brand new Springfield Armory XD-45 Mod.2 semi auto pistol.
This is their newest ""XD"" handgun, introduced at the SHOT show.
Bought it on 3/12/15. Has 470 rounds through it.
Has factory front fiber optic sight, and has extra red and green fiber optic tubes with it, and rounded factory rear sight. 

Unfortunately, as a mechanic of 30+ years that already has a beat up back and set of hands, this 45 caliber 3.3"" barrel combined with my love of shooting, has made my carpal tunnel re-emerge. I seem to be fine shooting long barreled handguns or rifles, but this one causes some nerve pain for a day or two after shooting it, so I have no choice but to sell it.....

Anyway, here is what is included:
- One month old XD-45 Mod.2 semi auto pistol
- One factory 10 round mag with ""X-Tension""
- One factory 9 round mag with Pearce pinky extension
- Two extra Springfield 10 round mags with Pearce pinky extensions (these function perfectly, but are not flush fit, and stick out maybe 1/4"")
- Midway pistol rug
- 50 rounds of Perfecta brass FMJ 
- 20 rounds of Federal Premium Hydra-Shok JHP (already in mags)
- 20 rounds of Federal Premium Hydra-Shok JHP (new in the box)
- All factory paperwork
- Factory hardshell, lockable case
- Factory ""XD GEAR"", which includes cable lock, bore brush, extra fiber optics, magazine holder, holster, and speed loader

As for a 1911 trade, I can also add cash, a 10/22 RIFLE, .22LR, 9mm or .45 Auto ammo if need be.

Any transfer is to be done either at FFL that is LOCAL TO ME (in or near the 21220 zip code) or GOLDEN RING MSP Barracks. TRANSFER FEES PAID FOR 100% BY THE BUYER...

OBVIOUSLY, as per Maryland ""rules"" you must have your MARYLAND HQL in order to purchase and own this firearm...

Payment is to be made FTF and by CASH ONLY. 

I am looking for a 1911 in .45 caliber, so that is only ""trade"" I will even consider...

Serious inquiries only...please.
The pictures attached, are all the pictures I have.
Can meet at Freestate Gun Range to test fire with serious buyer/trader

I also have a very nice RUGER 10/22 and ammo ""package deal"" that I will make an even BETTER package deal price for BOTH..."

Hello
My friend and I want to try going to a few rendevious and need a couple of old style rifle or pistol muzzle loaders.
The muzzle loaders we require must have wood stocks and side hammers or be flint locks; They must look like fire arms used in the mid to late 1800's to be allowed at a rendeviou.
we don't want to start out spending a lot of money so if you have a less than stellar gun that we could do some refinishing and cleaning on that would be best.
Thank You"

Originally from a Glock 35. It's in excellent condition and would be great if you want to build your own Glock - this frame will support 9mm, .40SW and .357sig uppers. It would also be a great part if you wanted to build out a Mech Tech upper, which is why I bought it in the first place, but my plans/priorities changed, and I want to move this on to a lucky buyer while it's still legal in this state to do so.

Price is $195.  Would consider a partial trade toward a Hi-Point 4595 carbine or a Kel-tec Sub2k in 9 or 40, preferably for Glock mags  (if the price isn't too high). 

Get it now before SB941 passes and costs you even more in time and money. 

As this is the portion of the Glock that is the actual 'firearm', I'm going to need to see a current Oregon ODL. Bonus and move to the top of the line if you have a current CHL as well.

We'll meet in the general Portland Metro area, with preference to SE down to Oregon City.

Common Questions

How much are your holsters? Our holsters normally run $40 for an average size gun with flat basic colors. Our IWB holsters run $5 more due to a stronger material used.

How much are your mag holsters? Depending on the type, they begin at $34.95. More complicated holsters with various mag types are available.

Can you make a holster for an FNX .45? Yes

Do you make holster with custom light/laser attachments? We do not carry ""ALL"" the custom light/laser attachments and can work with you depending on the model. In most cases, it is easier if you show up with the gear for us to measure and assess the work needed.

What kind of materials do you have? We use Kydex, Holstex, and Bolatron in varying sizes from .60 (thin IWB), .80 (medium IWB and OWB), .93 (Thick OWB) to .125. (OWB and complex projects)

What types of holsters do you make? Inside the waistband (IWB) concealed carry is our specialty but we can make outside the waistband (OWB) as well. We have designed custom mag carriers for 3 Gun competitions to include mag holsters for a Kriss Vector.

What is your most popular holster? Our most notable is our patent pending ""switchblade"" made especially for concealed carry. Very easy to conceal, you can't even feel its there and is designed for faster extraction than traditional style mag holsters.

One of the screws came loose and I lost it, can you replace it? Yes, we offer lifetime warranties on the holsters and will mail you a replacement to keep you going. We only ask that in certain cases, you pay for shipping costs if required.

Do you make leather holsters? At this time we are not able to make leather holsters but may explore that option at a later date.

The rifle is in great shape, almost new condition with less than 200 rounds through it. If you are not familiar with these rifles they are patterned off the Czech VZ58 rifle, and while similar in appearance it is not an AK clone.  Has a solid forged receiver but is very lightweight despite this and only weighs about 6 pounds unloaded.  Also very accurate and has a side folding stock.  Will come with three 30 round magazines, cleaning kit, and original leather sling.  I also have a little bit of ammo I can include but I will have to check to be sure exactly how much.

I hate to see it go but I just don't use rifles much.  Would be interested in trading for a quality handgun in 9mm, maybe 40, such as a Glock, Beretta 92, CZ75, XDm, or similar.  Would also consider a 1911 of some sort, or a 38 or 357 revolver with a 3-4 inch barrel.  Not interested in other shotguns, rifles, Tauruses or Kel Tecs. 
I also have a S&W M&P9 I could include for a higher value trade depending on what you have.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 16 six 19 nine 853 with questions or offers, texts preferred. 

Thanks!"

They sent Colt Firearms a 'cease & desist' letter which halted production of these guns. Colt continued producing this 1911 without the USMC roll-mark, which in turn made the pistols WITH the USMC roll mark highly collectible!

7 shot, double action revolver.

Here's one that sold for $185 + shipping on Gunbroker. I haven't found any other working examples that have sold.
http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=476804656

Many of these guns were made in .32 and .38, but .22 is rare since not many were made in this caliber.
This is a second model, made from 1898-1908 (roughly), so it's even more uncommon than the third model that was made from 1908-1941

Overall it's in decent condition, some flaking on the left side mostly, a bit of rust on the top strap and the bore has some pitting. Both grips are broken on the bottoms, one is built up with some putty but it doesn't effect function. Both seem to hold to the frame well enough.
It's a small little thing, only 6 1/2 inches full length.
But it seems to be perfectly serviceable, the lockup is tight and opening/closing is smooth. Double action trigger is heavy but that's just the nature of it.

I haven't shot it but it seems to dent primers OK. Would make for a neat little range toy. Don't shoot hypersonic or hot loads in it though, I would stick to subsonics or even powderless loads to keep it in shape.

Cash or trade."

The action is smooth as glass, and the craftsmanship is amazing. Even though the stock has seen better days. The original wood finish was removed because it was unpleasant to look at, and its currently bare wood, ready for a possible refinishing project, or if you prefer, it could easily be sporterized. The receiver is ""in the white"", meaning it never had any bluing, and it could be polished to a mirror-like shine if desired. 

The side of the receiver reads ""WAFFENFABRIK, STEYR, AUSTRIA""

I've only shot about 40 rounds from it. It functions great and the bore looks clean and shiny. The rifling is very visible. 

This rifle was a 7mm Mauser that was re-barreled with a 1903 Springfield barrel back in the 1960's in Austria for a contract with Chile. The chamber was shortened to accommodate the standard 7.62x51 NATO round. This is only intended to fire 7.62 NATO, not full-powered .308 loads. Commercial .308 like PMC bronze or with a muzzle velocity under 2800fps should be fine. I've fired TulAmmo .308 out of this without problems. Accuracy was decent with the cheap ammo too.

I have 10 or so stripper clips for this rifle I can throw in for free. They are Swedish mauser clips and they work better than any clip I've ever tried.

I'm also including 20 rounds of Silver Bear .308 ammo for free.

I'm asking $200 for the rifle with the stripper clips. I will meet you near a gun shop where you can freely check the weapon over before you buy.
