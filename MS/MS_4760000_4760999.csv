His loss, your gain!Is it possible for a pistol small enough to carry every day to have all the features and capacity that you’d expect in a larger pistol? If that is the XD-S from Springfield Amory, the answer is yes. The XD-S 3.3” Single Stack 9mm offers so much that you’ll be astonished that it all fits in the small, concealable profile.The XD-S Single Stack from Springfield Armory has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Use your XD-S Single Stack with an X-Tension magazine and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there.If you’re looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S 3.3” Single Stack in 9mm. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort, nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S 3.3” Single Stack today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s noticeably unnoticeable.SpecificationSCaliber9mmRecoil SystemDual Spring w/ Full Length Guide RodSights Fiber Optic Front & Dovetail Rear (Steel)Weight (With Empty Magazine)23 ouncesHeight4.4 inches with Compact Magazine, 5 inches with Mid-Mag X-TensionSlideForged Steel, Melonite FinishBarrel Length3.3 inches Hammer Forged, Steel Melonite / 1:10 TwistLength6.3 inchesGrip Width0.9 inchesFrameBlack Polymer"

First off, this is an Austrian proof marked glock. This glock was made, assembled, and proof fired in Austria. It is stamped made in Austria. Check your glock frame, I bet it says Smyrna, GA. This one doesn't. Glock perfection straight from the homeland and rare since not many of these were imported.


The sights have been upgraded to steel Ameriglo sights. The rear is a Kyle Defoor and the front is a thin tritium night sight with lime green phosphorescent ring surrounding the tritium. This is similar to a Trijicon HD, but it's not a fat blocky sight like the trijicon so you can actually aim at small targets and HIT THEM!

The trigger has been enhanced to perfection with the addition of a properly tuned Ghost Evo Elite 3.5 trigger bar in addition to Ghost springs. This setup utilizes lighter trigger springs, but a heavier striker spring than stock. The result is an amazing, CRISP, perfect glock trigger that breaks at 4.5#'s and provides an even more powerful striker impact, assuring ignition on even the hardest military primers. This setup is not like the soft, mushy crap trigger jobs that you have tried. This setup is Glock Perfection.

The slide release has been upgraded to the Glock extended version that all glocks should come with. 

3 15 round mags are included, one has a pierce extension.

A really nice holster made by Comfort Holsters in also included. This is the Bentley model, currently unavailable but retails for $125, that utilizes a suede covered gel pad on the kydex portion providing the utmost in comfort. This holster rides nice, conceals well, and is comfortable enough that you won't leave your gun at home.

My asking price is fair and firm since I've saved you the trouble of perfecting this glock."

Love her for trying.  Alas I'm after a 5x magnifier for my rifle and this red dot isn't what I'm after.  Never even been mounted.  I put a battery in and tested it to make sure it works and it's perfect. 

This is also going to be a tough thing for a lot of folks and I realize it could be a deal killer, but I run my own business out of my home and I am a slave to my computer/phone from 10-30 til 7 since I have to work with west coast folks a lot.  So, unless it's a weekend you would have to come by my home.  Sorry not trying to be difficult it's just how it is.....if I'm not at my computer with phone in hand when it rings it's money lost.  

So, if a trade sounds like something that might suit your fancy perhaps we can make a trade that suits both of us great.  Please feel free to ask any questions and thanks for your interest.  Please feel free to share all pertinent info like make/model, age etc.  I'm looking for a scope in perfect flawless condition like mine as well please.  Thank you."

(Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward"

Here is info From Daniel Defense, a bit wordy but sums it all up:


Description

Daniel Defense is the Sole Source Provider of the RIS II to the United States Special Operations Command!

The Daniel Defense Rail Interface System (RIS II) was designed at the request of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for the SOPMOD II program. SOCOM had a specific requirement for a free float M203 solution and Daniel Defense responded, designing a revolutionary product to meet the government’s need.

The Daniel Defense RIS II allows the individual operator to free float the M203 grenade launcher without additional parts. As importantly, special tools are not required to mount the M203 grenade launcher. This was accomplished by integrating all of the needed parts to free float the M203 into the rail itself.

The Daniel Defense RIS II M4A1 FSP feature a cut out in the top rail to accomdate a standard front sight base on a carbine length gas system.

The Daniel Defense RIS II free-floating Picatinny rail systems are designed to allow individual operator to quickly, and without special tools, mount M203 Grenade Launcher and precisely mount SOPMOD accessories to host weapon without effecting point of impact.

Materials & Construction

Precision CNC machined from Aircraft Grade Aluminun and Military Specification Type III Hard Coat Anodized.

    Material: Aircraft Grade 6061-T6 Aluminum
    Finish: Military Specification Black
    Length: 12.25""
    Width: 2.23""

Do some research and see if you agree with the critics in the reviews. These don't come along often.

The PCR is near identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, but thanks to its forged aluminum alloy frame it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

I understand you can purchase a Glock 42 roughly $450 now for just the gun with one mag and nothing else. So please before you offer me some lowball price realize I am not trying to get out of the weapon what I have put in it but I'm also not giving the weapon away for what a new factory stock weapon with no extras is worth either. Go online and do your math and realize I have roughly $825 or maybe slightly more in this package so I will take 600 or best offer."

This particular rifle is in excellent condition, without a trace of rust anywhere as far as I can see. It comes with three magazines (two 30-round and one 10-round). It is in perfect operational condition and is very clean. It shoots like a dream, too. All in all, this is not only a piece of history, but is a lot of fun, as well.

I tried to get as representative a set of pictures as I could, given the filesize upload limit. (Click on the pictures to zoom.) Let me know if you have any questions, and thanks for looking.

I also bought a set of 3 DS-10-IMC speed loaders with a loading block case and belt attachment to hold the three loaders on eBay for $120, which would have ran about $170 new. These are in excellent shape and are really slick. Finally, I have a brand new soft-sided Smith and Wesson revolver case that was about $20 after tax and shipping. I'll sell it all (I can throw in 200 rounds Of CCI Standard velocity too) for $850. I really want to sell it all, but if you just want the revolver I'll CONSIDER $775 if you make it easy and quick.    To be honest, you will regret not paying the extra $75 for what I have.  Again it's brand new and unfired in the original case.  I'll need to see a WI DL and ccw if you have it. If no ccw, you'll need to confirm you are allowed to own a firearm, etc.   I’ll be available to meet in western Wisconsin.  NO TRADES."
