The revolver has a small amount of wear from being carried but barely shows signs of a 'cylinder ring' so it hasn't been shot too many times. (I can provide pictures if you would like) it comes with the Ruger small carrying bag as well as around 20rds of Blazer .357mag Hollowpoints and a handful of Hornady .357mag Hollowpoints.

Price is firm and yea I know it's used but I will not let it go for less than what I think it's worth. Only possible trade I may make is for Glock 34. Located in Gordonsville."

The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight.

This way I know you are serious. Too many clowns on here that are just not serious and like to waste time. If you don't need ammo or optic, let's make a deal. Otherwise, a very good value and investment.
 I've watched these disappear in 20 minutes at 1200.00 on armslist/similar sites recently. I may entertain several gun trades but Cash is king. It is basically unused and will accept  M14 mags with a minor mod. The Original mags go for 100 dollars if you can find them. 3 original ten round mags included. They( these rifles) just keep going up in value. Not a scratch. Look up for pics. Zastava  Yugo M77 Thumbhole  stock, 2013 Production, I have never been impressed by an AK style rifle but this one is very nice. No welds or value killing mods or regulatory manipulation. I have never seen these options anywhere on an AK pattern rifle. I had a 2 inch grouping at 120 yards with one of these that was nowhere near as New. Sold out everywhere never to be imported again, hence very sought after. 1500.00 obo if cash. Serious inquiries only. Don't like the price,  OBO is as appears but please don't be offensive. Look around and you will see these are pure investment at this point. None left on market!  This one looks and feels new as the day I got it. 10 rounds fired. New fit and finish. I never got out to use it. No time, not much interest.
-Serious inquiries only. Please don't waste our time(mine and yours) I've had so many people stand me up or no-show, that piss poor business.

Smart move. It's probably because you want a rifle that no matter what the conditions are, you can 100% depend on it functioning when it's NEEDED. If you are looking for a Egyptian Maadi RML specifically, you already know why. If not I will explain it to you if you contact me. Now if you really know your stuff about why it is that you want a Maadi, hopefully you have been patient enough with your search and you know why. It's because you've been waiting for a Pars Import. Specifically the one with the thumb hole stock to become available. Again, you already know why. Well today is your lucky day because I am letting mine go. Now is your chance to own the absolute closest thing to a true Kalashnakav available for sale in the US. This is your chance to not only to scoop this baby up but also get all the extra goodies needed you would have to go out and buy separately. As of this minute I have dug out 2 new 30 round mag's. 1 steel and one tapco. I will keep looking because I'm sure I have 2 brand new 40 round mags as well. I am also adding ammo into the package. As of this minute  1300 rounds of WPA go with the deal. I don't know how I could make this any better of a 1 stop and get it all you need at once deal. The Rifle is in great shape. Great rifling. Nice wood. It is ready to spit rounds out as fast as you could possibly pull the trigger and do it time after time after time. I am also amazed at the accuracy of this Maadi. It shoots much smaller groups than any other AK I've ever owned. Actually comparable to my Carl Gustof 6.5x55 Swede. I have personally taken very good care of this Maadi and have NEVER ran it hot.  The ammo is stored in original plastic shrink wrap bricks (1000 of it) 300 boxed and all kept 100% DRY and ready to go. This is your chance. Get it before someone else does.. I guarantee it won't last long at this price.."

Makes an excellent conceal carry pistol. Comes with 1 7rd mag, lock, and original box.

The LC9S is a double-action-only, striker fired, locked-breech pistol with a smooth trigger pull. Control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9S are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. The Ruger LC9S features smooth ""melted"" edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing. Capacity is 7+1.

Gun is in very good condition. Just a little bit of holster wear on the nose of the barrel which you can see in the picture and is very slight. Other than that is in excellent condition.

Looking to sell but might consider trades if interested. Only thing I can think of I would like to have is an entry level lever action rifle like a Henry, Rossi, Mossberg, etc. (.22 LR, .38/.357, or other caliber would be considered). If it is the right gun might be willing to add a little bit of cash and/or some ammo. 

But if you have something else you are interested in trading just let me know. All I can say is “No Thank You”:).

The 1892 revolver was the standard issue sidearm for officers in the French military during WWI, and most were re-issued to French pilots during WWII in case of crash or bailout over enemy territory. Contrary to most revolvers (and to the pleasure of southpaws) the cylinder swings to the right, the idea being the French officer would be on horse back, holding the gun and reins with his left hand as he re-loaded with his right. This particular example has a lot of ""character;"" it was pulled from a safe in the ashes of a house fire of a relative many years ago. It was gone through by a gunsmith to ensure safety and has been fired many times over the years since. Grips were replaced since the bottom of the originals were singed. Additionally the barrel was squibbed at some point (possibly during its service lifetime) and was replaced, although the original barrel (bulge and all!) is still with the gun, the replacement is dated 1921. I have no idea what it is worth, looking to trade with someone who will appreciate the history as much as I do. Not the prettiest girl at the party, but she dances just fine. Comes with 50 rounds of Fiocchi 8mm 111gr Lebel, and another 50 of once fired brass."

If you have 1500.00, I will re-nig and accept your offer, other wise it should be gone in an hour or two for I have a deposit. Last chance. Some were afraid to come to ""the city""and some just stood me up while others get a big thank you to those who didn't call to waste my time or complain about the color/coating. These things help in the real shooting world, anyways. People should read more and be less skeptical over what you do not know about. I had so many clowns just call and not show or ask for more ammo and less money because they had to drive when I stated that I could not travel. I am so done with this site!! Stop watching Pawnstars and be part of the brotherly gun community where it is scratch my back and I will scratch yours atmospere. Greed gets you nowhere!! I will not name names. There was a time not so long ago...  Happy Holidays
I have a couple very nice  rifles/pistols that I just don't use and have a money crisis so they must go now. This is my favorite and a safe queen that I wish I could afford to use but That's life. My price is more than fair and I can't afford to lose more than I already am . There are more than 500.00 in extras that I am including and this took a year to build and is my most prized possession. All parts have a warranty and were assembled by a licensed local gunsmith. It has been in a safe for a bit over a year and has a few  scratches to the lower, which is Cerakoted with a Duracoat base in Kryptid Camo pattern. If a scratch or two bothers you, please don't bother. Most of this gun is Custom coated which aids in heat dissipation and just looks good. I am mentioning this because I had a guy tell me he wanted it but he didn't like the lower coated. It is a Spikes Tactical Punisher Skull marked lower that matches gun very nicely. Just has dinged around in safe a bit. It stays cooler than  untreated guns. Not completely coated but just where it helps this gun will have a long life Cerakote is an enamel with ceramics incorporated and does keep guns much cooler as it helps to dissipate heat quicker and the upper is specially treated with NibX(nickel Boron/Teflon) as an inner lining and Cerakoted to match free the floated Cerakoted handguard and can operate lubless and remain unbelievably cool under regular rapid fire  use. Gun cycles smooth as glass.  All in all, this thing has all new parts and I will include a BRAND NEW M-16 BCG that I got in the maul today. MPI tested and not used once. I still have the packaging to much of the parts.

Can include as much ammo as desired for extra up to 400 rounds. I have over 1900 in this gun before labor  and that does not include mags or ammo. Safe queen!!! First  with 1300 cash takes all of it!  I want to keep it but it is that time of year, baby on the way, etc. I never use it anyways. If you don't want ammo and mags, I'll take off 50.00 for these are excellent parts and I am gifting you with the extras for your business so please don't lowball. Get it Friday and it's 1275.00 for you!! Otherwise I'd rather sell my car. 
 Leave me a number so I may get back to you. I do not like playing e-tag.
Under a 20 round mag down tube, 17 rounds to be exact. Smooth as glass cylcling, very quiet action. All of my friends just love it and always ask how much but only the seasoned eye or experienced shooter would know how nice of a gun this is. Not even yet broken in. Match grade parts for the most.

Rifle has been cerakoted Atomic Burnt Bronze by Atomic Tactical. Gold inlay was done using Forsters gold fill kit, not a crappy paint job. Rifle has the straight cut rather than the slant cut receiver so it will accommodate just about any after-market stock. Rifle has a Midwest Industries rail, synthetic Tapco grip and butstock, vertical fore grip and UTG LT-TL 101 flashlight. Rail has low profile rail covers. Rifle was made 922r compliant with Tapco double hook trigger/hammer group (3 compliant parts) (original Chinese components included-pictured in plastic bag). I also installed a retaining plate in lieu of the hook (drop in piece). Synthetic thumb hole stock is included. Will come with two mags. I am not the original owner. I have owned the rifle for almost two years and have only fired it twice: once to test it and once after it was cerakoted. No issues at all and less than 100 rounds fired by me. Smooth as butter! Cleaned after both trips to the range and was been oiled on a regular basis. What else can I say? It's a sweet piece, but I've got some trips coming up that need funding and I just don't shoot this beauty that often. 

I will only sell/trade to a 21+ year old person with a CURRENT MN PTC or PTP and MN ID. Buyer/trader must be willing to present these at the time of sale and complete a Bill of Sale. NO EXCEPTIONS! I am not willing to ship and prefer transactions around the St. Peter area.

Any questions, just send me a message. I do work for a living so I usually cannot respond between 8:00am-5:30pm, but rest assured I will get back to you ASAP.  Reasonable offers will be considered.

I can send more detailed pics of the cerakote and gold inlay. Just let me know.

From the manufacturer:
HK USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

This rifle is produced in the molot factory in Russia, and is based off of the RPK, with a thicker, hammer forged, chrome-lined barrel, and a thicker receiver.  I've heard from different people that these rifles are currently banned from import, however, I don't have 100% confirmation on that.  It was however, very difficult for me to find one to purchase, and they don't seem to have gotten any easier to find as time as gone by.

When purchased, mine was in ""sporterized condition"" having a finished thumbhole stock, a welded on muzzle nut, and the ability to only accept 5-10 round factory magazines, which included two.  Aside from the original factory instruction manual, (translated into English from Russian, poorly) it also includes the AK cleaning kit, and AK cleaning rod.  The barrel length is 16"" and the rifle is a Wolf Performance Arms style import, not a robinson arms import.  I have done the following to the rifle:

Added the Slant Adapter, this allows it to accept standard AK stocks.

Added the bullet guide, secured with red loctite: This allows standard AK 30 round magazines to feed.

Filed down the Magazine catch: This allows standard Ak 30 round magazines to actually lock into place, so that they may feed the rounds properly.

Added a black Magpul MOE AK stock, along with a .75"" extended butt-pad

Added A US palm pistol grip.

Removed the welded muzzle nut, so that it will now accept standard AK 14x1 LH threaded muzzle devices.

Added a Slovak style muzzle break from bonesteel arms.

Added an ALG AKT trigger group https://algdefense.com/ak-trigger-akt.html

I have also purchased a AR style flash hider from CNC warrior.

As per law, this rifle requires four US made parts, these parts are the following: the buttstock, the trigger, the hammer, and the sear.  I have shot a little over a hundred rounds through the rifle, using brass cased ammunition, in order to make sure that the magazines I have properly feed, which they do.  The gun includes three 30 round magazines, two new Croatian magazines, and one surplus Romanian Magazines.  I am also including 500 rounds of Yugo Surplus M67 ammunition with a plastic ammo case.  This ammunition has mildly corrosive primers, but it is brass cased, and does not have a bi-metal jacket, so it is completely range safe.  It also includes a plano rifle case, as pictured.  I also still have all of the original wood furniture, and magazines.  

Truth be told, I do not actually want to sell this gun.  But I need to buy myself a car before winter really kicks in, and getting to work is more important that having a hell of a rifle.  If interested, please give me a call or text at 320-twonineeight-2101.  Thank you.

For As Is:

If I have a personally customized Remington 700 SPS tactical, chambered in .308 Winchester, for sale. Modifications to the gun include: 
Bell & Carlson Medalist Style 2 stock with full length aircraft grade aluminum bedding block, Talley Manufacturing receiver bases and rings, and a Nikon Prostaff 5 scope, 3.5-14x40.  The gun comes with factory X-Mark Pro trigger.
The bipod will NOT come with this rifle if purchased. 

The gun was purchased brand new on January 1st of 2015, and all modifications done the same day.  The gun was thoroughly cleaned, and then taken to my farm the following week for proper break in procedures.  In total, the gun has had approximately 45-55 rounds through it, cleaned thoroughly  after every use, and in absolute wonderful condition.  With a skilled shooter, the gun shoots sub MOA with Federal Gold Medal Match and Hornady TAP (the only two kinds I've ever shot through it).  The scope has been properly leveled to the action, and has been 'zeroed' to my preference at 100 yards.  

Again, the gun is in absolute wonderful condition with zero issues both mechanically and cosmetically.  Please contact me at REDACTED via call or text.

It is mostly because of the super low felt recoil of it’s high polished ROTATING BARREL. This is not your grandfather’s Glock. EVERY single part is CNC machined and de-burred. NO MIM PARTS !! I am not going to write poems about it. If you do not know about this gun and the brand – it’s probably not for you. For those guys that know Grand Power and K100 MK12– well, you know what you are looking at here ;—) Tenifer slide, stainless CNC-machined body in polymer frame. This is a solid low recoil full frame pistol.

NOTE: Please note that this is not the old MK7 K100 model – it is the latest MK12 version. This video from Sooch00 will tell you how just how special this pistol is:

THIS VIDEO IS WORTH WATCHING even if you are not interested to buy ;—)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pu0Kj5Vpvk

This gun (and the 4-4.5lb TRIGGER !!) is really amazing. SUPER accurate and smooth shooting pistol. Just got it last month and the ONLY reason why I am selling it because I just bought Grand Power flagship – the K100 X-Calibur.

Comes with two 15rd  magazines and the original box. Excellent – LIKE NEW condition, no scratches or dings of any kind, could EASILY pass for a NEW GUN!! Purchased only last month – less than 200 through. Also comes with 4 exchangeable back straps, fully ambidextrous, 4.5 barrel, VERY smooth 4-4.5lbs trigger.

MSRP on this gun is $629 + tax. Internet deals are about $100 less, but by the time you pay for shipping, CC charges FFL transfer fees, you are in it for close to 6 bills.

My price is ONLY $475 !! Not interested in any trades or ‘offers’ at this time. Price is FIRM at $475, ....and no –”$450 will not take it”, so please save your or my time. Thanks for your understanding. Only ‘face-to-face cash deals anywhere in greater Tampa Bay area.

I am located in East lake / Palm Harbor / Tarpon Springs area. If seriously interested, please text or call at 727-365-22_six_six instead of using just FB messages, because I am Cross-posting in several FB groups & Armslist. This one will NOT last long !!"
