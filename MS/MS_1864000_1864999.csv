I got a Beretta 96G S.D. in 40 s&w. This version is a decocker only instead of the safety/decocker, but is still the traditional DA/SA, and was only made for a few years!!  It also has trijicon night sights, which is also pretty rare for the berettas, and has the heavier brigadier slide. The gun is in 90+% condition, no noticeable wear that will show up in pics!! It comes with 5 mags, (3) 11 rounders (2) 15 rounders and the box. I also have roughly 350 loose rounds of 40S&w WWB, that id trade off with the gun if I was offered a 45/9mm pistol.

I got a Beretta 21A chambered for 25acp. Comes with( 3) 8 round mags. Condition is pretty good, does have some wear but nothing major. The gun features a tip up barrel for easy loading (ideal for people who have trouble racking slides) and multiple ways of carrying with safety on/off or in DA mode. Great ccw gun for our long awaited concealed carry. Easily fits into your pockets or the many holster options, and is light weight and easy to handle. Considered to be one of the best 25acp handguns in production today. No the 25acp isnt a 357 mag, but with 8+1 rounds it beats a lot of guns in capacity that are this size!!

There is a repeat scammer that has been posting on here. He is posting guns at great prices (first warning sign). After you talk to him for a while, he will soon ask you to wire money (never wire money!).

Easy way to spot him is that all he is doing is pulling images from the internet and using direct text from the manufacturer website or retail/auction sites. He generally posts 2 guns at a time. Usually AR-15s, but lately he has tried just uppers and handguns.

I didn't realize how much kick a little .380 could have! Anyway, the gun is ALMOST brand new, I fired a total of 6 shots through it (one magazine) and knew it was too strong for me. It's in PERFECT shape and includes a factory mounted Lasermax laser which is awesome. I'm also including an additional 7 shot Ruger factory magazine that hasn't even been used and everything you see in the pictures including the box of ammo which only has 44 rounds left (minus the 6 that I shot). Asking $425, cash only and no trades please. You must also show me a picture ID so I know you're a WA resident and I'd prefer that you show me your concealed carry license as well."

Barrel:   A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine gas system.   The barrel  has a conventional .750"" gas block diameter, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.  Barrel is finished off with a YHM Diamond Free float rail, low profile gas block, and A2 flash hider.  

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, these uppers are made for us right here in the USA.

Each upper is assembled to order with care, and test fired at the factory.

Magpul flip up backup sights
Magpul vertical foregrip
3 black 30 round pmags

As shown with extras listed looking to get $1350
I am willing to sell as the rifle came from manufacturer which is still with the magpul stock, forend one pmag and grip, I would take $1200 which is less than what I paid 2 months ago.

Due to the dynamic changes in the modern battlefield, the threats of global terrorism and the demands of ever-changing combat situations, there was a need for a new versatile, innovative and technologically advanced weapon.

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

Bull pup configuration.
Optimized ergonomic design.
30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
Detachable barrel.
Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.
100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
Equipped with a last round stopper.
All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing.
Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability."

Winchester Supreme Elite PDX1 ammunition was tested by the FBI to see if it can stand up to real world, life threatening situations, this ammunition has impressive expansion and notable velocities at various ranges thanks to Winchester's proprietary bonding process. The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. 

Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection.

SPRINGFIELD INC XDM 4.5 Standard 

Springfield Armory 19 + 1 Round 9MM XDM w/4 1/2"" Barrel/Black Finish

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about
function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged
Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a
thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the
shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a
similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for
faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package
of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2)
magazines and a holster.

Hello! Here's what I have:

Triple Serial W. German P228- Date Code: 1990
Original cardboard box with small corner ding (not from me, from previous owner) and test target
3x13 round factory mags
2x15 round mec gar mags
1x18 round mec gar mag
Galco stow n go holster
Nightingale leather OWB holster (I believe it is Raven V)
Hogue rubber grips (not finger groove ones, plain)
Original solid (no lanyard loop grips) grips
New ""P228, M11A1"" grips (with lanyard loop)

I am open to offers, both cash offers and trade. I REALLY want an HK P2000SK, OR USPc 9mm, but I will entertain other offers (no USPc .40/45) Prefer 9mm only.

If I had to rate the gun I would say it is roughly ~90% condition. Holster wear on typical high points on slide. Minor wear on trigger guard and magwell, (very un-noticeable). I will show what I'm talking about in pictures. For being 23 years old, It's in great condition.

The date code on the gun is 1990, and I am the second owner (as far as I know). I have shot less than 500 rounds through it, with only (1) one light primer strike with 147g Fiocci ammo. (I think this was a fluke with the ammo).

Anyways, I love the gun and don't want to get rid of it, however it doesn't fit my hand ""just perfect"", is too heavy for me for ccw. Ever since my first HK something keeps calling me back...I love sig to death but when it's not right it's not right. It has been my carry gun for 3-4 months.

Again, DO NOT HESITATE to offer, and I am willing to work with you within reason. Thanks for looking!!

This is the stainless model with a synthetic stock. It comes with a Simmons Whitetail Classic 2-10x44 scope, approx 65 mixed brass, and lightly used RCBS die set.

This is a great rifle. The stock does show some light field use, but its in good shape. I would guestimate the round count at about 150.

Has Trijicon Night Sights, spare 40 barrel, and is in excellent condition!  Has a APEX Spring kit so the trigger is not your ""typical"" M&P sandbox!  Very smooth and nice pull compared to factory!

The 357sig version of the M&P compact is SUPER hard to find since it's been discontinued by Smith and Wesson.  

MSRP before being discontinued was $727, without the trigger spring kit, extra barrel, or night sights!  Add another $320+ in cost for those to the MSRP and you see what this thing is worth!

This is a VERY rare gun, and even comes with the night sights and spare 40 caliber barrel.  Swapping the barrels takes only a few seconds, and will save a ton on range costs when comparing the price of 40 FMJ and 357SIG personal defense rounds.  Get the best of both all in one package!

The semi-auto hunting rifles VEPR are designed for medium-sized and big games. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). 

VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market 

The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope. 

All VEPR rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory, included in the manual."

It has had exactly 240rds down the pipe and and was cleaned after ever trip to the range. It will come with original case, paperwork, lock, the two extra back straps and three 15rd glock factory mags. Also trigger guard has been professionally undercut to allow you to get a higher grip purchase. I am only looking to trade for a few things that I will list below all other offers will be ignored and I'm not interested in cash. The only reason I want to trade is that I carry this regularly and now that it is summer the gen4 grip is rubbing me the wrong way literally. The gen 4 is about $100 to $150 more that the gen 3 and its worth it for the reduced recoil due to the double recoil spring so I think anyone who trades with me will be getting a good deal.
