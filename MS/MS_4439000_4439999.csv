It has all the usual Saiga features - rugged reliability, bolt hold open, chrome lined barrel, spring-loaded magazine release, etc.  It also includes the following extras:

Tapco T6 adjustable stock with pistol grip - $69.99
Tapco Intrafuse handguard with bottom rail - $49.99
Quick detach side mount with scope rings - $49.99

180+ rounds of ammo (new factory brass, mix of .308 and 7.62x51) - $137
Push-button quick deploy vertical foregrip/bipod - $65

It's a used gun, if in excellent shape, so I'm not expecting retail on the package (around $1,350 new for everything).  I simply put the current list prices (before taxes/shipping/fees) so you have an idea of the value.  $850 cash price FOR THE RIFLE ONLY.  I will add the ammo and hard case in for another $120.  Lowballers will be completely ignored (as will any e-mails asking what my lowest price is or if this is still for sale).

These were banned a year ago by Obama, so they're pretty expensive IF you can find them in stock somewhere.  If you've ever wanted a semi-auto .308 like a PTR 91, Cetme 308, M1A, etc, this is a great option for less money with the entire package, and perfect for hunting season."

I started with a higher quality, new Mosin ($220), installed: Archangel stock ($200), Rock Solid Bent Bolt ($80), Rock Solid scope mount ($100), Timney trigger ($110), and compensator ($40). After I installed all of those parts I put a very nice Bushy scope on it: Bushnell Elite Tactical 5-15 x 40 ($390). $1100 into this.

In the picture you will notice a bipod and hard case, these will not be included.

I load the rounds one at a time into the chamber as opposed to using the magazines, the magazines do not seem to feed too well but could be a simple fix.

... manufacturer's description...
The Model 597™ is easily the most advanced autoloading rimfire rifle ever built, and the most technologically advanced breakthrough in autoloading rimfire rifle technology in 35 years. The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy.

Of course, we didn’t stop there. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597™ all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot “hold open” magazine feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine."

This semi-auto gun is about 50 years old and in remarkably good shape for it's age and use (No, it hasn't been shot to death). It has been thoroughly cleaned and tested for function. It works. The feed latch is secure. This is a common complaint about the 1100s not wanting to feed or complete the firing cycle. It has pressed checkering on the stocks that is not beat up. There are some pressure dents, but none are severe and if you want to remove them, a wet towel and a steam iron should do the trick. There are no scratches or gouges in the wood. There are two or three very small places where rust was, but have been cleaned and are hard to see. The bluing is not worn and there are no dents or dings in the metal surfaces. 

Price is $400.00 picked up in midtown Houston, or I will ship to your FFL for $35.00. I'll entertain offers and trades. Please don't be offended if I decline to accept your offer.

For those who are not familiar with the SP2022, its internals are much like the Sig 226.  Its exterior breaks down like a 1911 and is held together in an identical fashion to the 1911.  The SP2022’s “chassis” is made of steel.  The SP2022’s significantly lighter than the P226 making it suitable for everyday carry.  The SP2022 can be converted between being a .357 SIG with a barrel that can be dropped in.  The magazines are made for .40 and .357.  This Sig is capable of a 1/2"" group at 15 yards.  

I purchased this sig new a bit over a year ago for my wife.  I has been shot aprox 50 to 60 times.  It handles perfectly, functions flawlessly and groups very well.  It is a little to much gun for my wife.  We are looking to replace it with something on the order of a 9mm Walther, PPQ  a Glock 19 Gen 4, or a smaller frame 9mm Sig or Glock.  We are willing to trade or sell.  We only ask that what you offer be in the same type of condition and quality or firearm we are offering.

The SP 2022 came new with 1 magazine.  I have since purchased 3 extras.  These are expensive SIG PRO magazines.  We also have around 700 rounds of ammo, 600 of it being quality winchester target ammo and 100 rounds being Remington Jacketed Hollow Points.

We are willing to entertain up, down or even trade offers along with cash offers for just the gun or cash/trade offers for the whole shebang."

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

I have had this unit since I bought it new in November of 2013 from TNVC.  I have used it a total of three times, and it has sat in my safe with the batteries out for the rest of its boring life.  Selling it because I just don't use it.  It is in as new condition; looks and functions flawlessly and includes all original accessories, as well as an adapter I bought at RadioShack that allows you to plug the external video cable into a TV.  If you are considering this unit then you probably already know all about it.  It can function as both a clip on in front of your day scope, or as a stand alone weapon sight with its built in reticle. It has a native 640x512 sensor with an advanced OLED display.  This unit is rated to handle recoil up to and including .50BMG.  It has the traditional grayscale color pallets with white hot/black hot, but also offers several other options like a full color aka rainbow pallete, iron pallete, and a fire and ice pallete where you see a traditional grayscale pallete but with the added bonus of hot objects appearing red and cold objects appearing blue. It also features FLIR's DDE mode as an option.  DDE is basically a spatial filter designed to enhance the high spatial frequencies (edges etc.) of objects, giving the image a more ""real"", textured look.  This unit has a 0.5x or wide field of view mode which offers an excellent FOV, and was perfect for me when used in conjunction with a 4x ACOG as it provided a 2x total magnification (.5x X 4x) which was excellent for fast, close in shooting.  It also has a 1x mode and a 2x mode, which would offer 4x and 8x total magnifications when used in conjunction with a 4x ACOG.  This can all be adjusted via the controls on the side of the unit, as well as with a remote control that comes with it that allows you to place the exact controls wherever you want on your rifle.  If you are looking for the ultimate thermal clip-on sight for short range (up to 6x) optics, look no further.

The Ruger SR-22 Rifle is an autoloading rimfire rifle that combines the legendary reliability and affordability of the Ruger 10/22 with the ergonomics and configurability of the SR-556. The SR-22 places a standard 10/22 action inside a top-quality, American-Made, all-aluminum chassis that is custom manufactured to Ruger specs by Nordic Components, Inc. The final product is an affordable, feature-loaded rifle that faithfully replicates the AR-platform dimensions between the sighting plane, buttstock height, and grip. The SR-22 utilizes AR-style ergonomics with the industry-leading Hogue Monogrip and a six-position telescsoping buttstock on a Mil-spec diameter tube. Every rifle is built with a precision-rifled, cold-hammer-forged barrel that's 16-1/8"" long and forged of alloy steel before being capped with the same flash suppressor found on the SR-556 and Mini-14 rifles. The SR-22's round, mid-length handguard is mounted on the standard-thread AR-style barrel nut with a barrel support block that ensures accuracy. The legendary Ruger rotary magazine makes the SR-22 one of the most reliable, trusted autoloaders available and the Picatinny rail allows for a variety of sight or scope options. 1:16"" right-hand twist. 10 + 1 capacity."

951,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4439951,For Sale/Trade:  COLT 1911 Rail Gun / Bi-tone Stainless and Black Model. Absolutely pristine!,"Rockford, Grand Rapids, Michigan","$ 1,000","Listed On: Thursday, June 18, 2015",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Not much needs to be said about this 1911. If you are looking at this you already know what it is. It's a thing of beauty is what it is! So much so that I'm scared to put it into a holster and scuff up the finish! This thing is absolutely pristine!

This gun has no handling scratches. No idiot marks. Notice the trigger and beaver tail grip safety have almost NO noticeable finish wear? The stainless slide has no scratches on the finish either. In fact if I didn't tell you I had shot this gun, I could pass this off and brand new.

This pistol has one box 50 round box threw it and it's been played with using plastic/brass snap-caps, that's it!

This thing spent most of it's life oiled down, in it's original plastic bag and case. I was going to put some different grips on it, add some night sights etc but I just never did. I was so paranoid about messing it up I just wanted to leave it as is.

As this is a standard barrel and bushing setup, this would be perfect for IDPA for those of you who want to use a 1911. The extra meat on the end of the frame (the rail) helps balance the pistol out but it's not heavy at all.

This is the stainless model with the Black Cerakoted frame and semi-black grips as you can see from the photo.

As most of you know COLT just filed bankruptcy. They also just discontined their XSE and Rail Gun lines of pistols so these are about to start getting hard to find. I like the way this looks but I'm too scared to do anything with it for fear or ruining the value.

A quick check of Gunbroker tells me they are going for around $1100~1150.00 and most people are charging another 25~50.00 for shipping plus don't forget your FFL fee's. Haven't seen one of these locally in a long while now.

I'm after a trade. I'm looking for something from Heckler and Koch. More specifically something in .45ACP. I do not want their older USP's though. I want something like the HK45CT or HK45T. Not too concerned with the condition as I intend to shoot the piss out of it anyway but I would really prefer something with a threaded barrel as I have a Ti-Rant 45S but I'm open to offers.

I MAY also consider one of the HK P30L's in 9mm but I'm after a .45ACP first as I already have a GLOCK 17, 19, M&P 9 full-size, M&P9 Shield etc. The only .45ACP's I have are a couple COLT 1911's and I'd really like a HK so I've got something for the upcoming Zombie Apocalypse!

Shoot me an email if you want to talk more. I would also take cash to buy what I want. I put $1000.00 dollars but I'm open to REASONABLE offers. If I have to ship, that's on your dime.

I'm located in the Rockford / Grand Rapids area and would like to keep this as semi-local as possible as I drive an old SUV with crap gas mileage."
