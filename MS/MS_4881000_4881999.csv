For those unfamiliar with it, this particular model is a clone of the Jericho 941/Baby Eagle compact, which itself is a mechanical clone of the CZ-75 compact. As such, it has a high level of parts interchangeability with the CZ-75, including grips, magazines, and sights. This piece was purchased new by me less than a month ago. It has been stripped and cleaned, loaded and carried a couple times but as of yet is unfired and is in like new condition. Will come with everything it came with new, the case, mag loader, and 2 Mec-Gar 15rd magazines.
I'm primarily looking for something that would be more practical for conceal carry. Mainly in the market for a single stack 9mm. Would really like a basic (Armscor, RIA, etc) 9mm 1911, but would also be interested in a basic officer size 1911 of any caliber. Otherwise would be interested in other single stack 9mm pistols (LC9S, BP9CC, CW9, Sig P290, etc- NO Shields though). Would also be interested in a S&W J-frame. I would also consider a trade down plus some cash for a Kel-Tec PF-9 or Taurus PT111 G2.
Will also sell for $350- considering condition, price is firm. FTF transaction in the Winfield/Wellington area preferred, but can meet in Wichita for the right deal. Have my CCL and can sign bill of sale if desired. Reach me by PM or text to REDACTED."

Barrel proofed Springfield. Other internal parts appear to be proofed according to Springfield at the time. Period correct trigger as well. There is some blue wearing on the backstrap and finger hold area, hand slide wear near front end edges , but still have that nice blue colt look to it..the barrel condition is great no rust or is sure with barrel..feels great in the hand. And every functions great on it..as it is it more of a shooter grade gun than high collector value since it doesn't have original mag, grips , and since it's been reblued...but it's cool to shoot this old gun..questions please ask.if you wanna see it in person that's fine..also if you have any information to why the markings may of been removed please share with me and I'll update this post"

Mostly looking to trade this upper for one of equal value in 5.56x45/.223. Mostly looking for an M4 configuration but willing to entertain other offers.

 What I have is a Forged BAFE upper with a 16"" heavy barrel in 300AAC Back Out. This was a custom built upper by an armorer in Williamsport PA can't remember the name at this point, it has been a few years. This has a free float hand guard and A2 flash suppressor. The bolt is a CM which is a Colt- Martin/Marietta. The upper has a square forge marking, this from what I can tell is BAFE Corp. which is one of the suppliers that Colt uses. The barrel is a 1x7 twist. I put 40 rounds through this to start the break in. It has functioned flawlessly so far and proves to be very accurate. I had it topped of with the 3x42mm VISM optic and this also worked very well. I also have 200 rounds of Remington super sonic ammo. 2 of the boxes are reloaded with 135 grain Speer bullets designed for the 300aac. 160 rounds are new. I have a set of LEE dies to go as well. This is a quality built upper.

 Value is as follows.
 Complete upper $400
 200 rounds of 300aac ammo, $160
 Dies, $30
 VISM 3x42 optic $75

Top quality handling, performance, and safety features make the M22 Target model a standout among rimfire autoloaders. Designed for inexpensive, high velocity 22LR ammunition, the accurate rapid-fire performance of the M22 offers the shooter an economical shortcut for modern defensive pistol practice at the range. The M22 gives shooters the opportunity to shoot with extreme accuracy due to the combination of a 4.375"" threaded, match barrel, an extremely crisp, 4-lb. single-action trigger and a windage-adjustable rear sight. The M22 pistol from ISSC has five safety features: safety decocker, loaded chamber indicator, trigger safety tab, magazine disconnect, and an external key-lock. It uses easy to load 10-round magazines in a lightweight polymer frame with an integral rail for training with lights and lasers.

It is in the original Colt plastic box, with the instruction book and papers.  The gun is used, but fired very little and is still in like-new condition.  It is all-steel, both slide and frame, with a matte gray durable parkerized finish.  The serial number indicates it was manufactured in 1985.

The Colt Officer’s ACP pistol was introduced in the mid 1980’s to compete in the growing concealed carry market. The full size 1911 with its 5-inch barrel was often too big for concealed carry.   Colt introduced an all-steel copy of the original Colt government with a 3 ½ inch barrel –  1 ½ inches shorter than a full-size Government Model.  Colt also shortened the length of the grip to aid in concealment, dropping the capacity to six rather than the usual seven rounds of 45 ACP.  At the time it was introduced, it was one of the smallest weapons of that caliber. 

The Officer's ACP comes with a functional three-dot sight system and a grip safety that protects the hand.  This gun is prized for its compactness and robust power in  .45 ACP.    The Officer’s  ACP was discontinued in the 1990’s.  They are a piece of Colt history that some people collect just for the nostalgia of it.   As a result, this model is getting very difficult to find.

This would be a perfect concealment pistol for personal, home or automobile security use. How about giving this as an awesome Christmas gift for somebody special. Contact me so we can meet and let you inspect this Colt Officer's ACP .45. I know you won't be disappointed. The price is $795 cash only.  All reasonable offers considered."

This pistol was purchased to be used with local pistol leagues, but due to me breaking my dominant elbow, my aspirations will be put on hold for a while. The barrel and slide are ported, trigger was worked by the Performance Center of Smith and Wesson. I shot approximately 270 rounds through this in practice and it's the most accurate and smooth 9mm I've shot. It has tall sights to allow for a suppressor or co-witness through a red dot. I will include all factory supplied components. I added skateboard tape to the frame for added grip and can easily be removed.

Just for my rifle with metal flip ups and no Vortex I will do $500.  Since buying this online I have put only 100 rounds downrange in both 223 and 556.  Since I rarely shoot it and Christmas and credit card bills are waiting just around the corner I need to let it go. The upper has a midlength free float rail in 223 wylde so it is accurate with all kinds of 223 or 556 ammo.  I only used brass ammo and none of the cheap steel stuff. I cleaned it after both trips to the firing range so it is almost broken in. The red dot is zeroed already to this rifle and if you want that I will ask $650.  For the case + red dot + ammo + 5 30 round magazines with 4 still new in saran wrap and one 40 round MSAR magazine I would say $700 for the whole package and thats a fair price from what I see on here for sale.  $700 is way less than I have invested into this set up, please shop around before lowballing to save your time and my time.  This AR is dead-on at both 50 yards and 100 yards and I haven't tested it any farther than that.  It is all palmetto parts other than the MOE grip+ trigger guard + stock. I can price it out for you in whatever variation you want but the base line is going to be $500.  I can also meet this afternoon at the Walmart in Glenpool since I will be headed that way around 3 or 4. 

If only my rifle sells I will sell off the red dot ammo or mags separately at a different price or a package deal.  Unfortunately I couldn't add more pictures to show the logo on the carrier but I figure the new owner may inspect it before making any final decision.  Also all of the ammo is good-to-go and is a mix of 55 grain 223 and 556 + one box of 62 grain fusion + 2 boxes of uncommon 60 grain noveske glow tip.

It's the dust/sand in all of the nooks and crannies. These rifles have served overseas, mostly with the Ugandan troops in police and guard activities. This rifle has all matching numbers and carries the original Romanian chrome bore barrel. The rifle has been test fired since I received it, so you know you will be getting a functioning rifle. Being a used rifle, they carry no warranty from the distributors and are sold as-is. I, as well, do not warranty these rifles, but I have personally test fired to verify function. This rifle also come with the trigger guard ID ribbon which will be the ONLY way to authenticate these rifles years from now. This rifle has the usual desired carry wear that most of them display, but appears to have been shot very little. Sights are straight with no cant. Comes with one mag with equal finish wear. This one even had a dirty cleaning kit in the stock when I received it. If you missed all the other chances to get one of these rifles, this might well be your last chance to get one that is the real deal and has the articles to prove it. …………………………………………………………………………………………………………… After the terrorist attacks of 911 the US government began using overseas contractors to supplement their military forces in various regions including Afghanistan and Iraq. These forces were often issued US supplied weapons including the DPMS AR 15 and the AK47 Romanian WASR 7.62 x 39. We believe that these rifles were employed by a firm known as SOC USA doing US government security work ( http://www.soc-usa.com/ ) and possibly Ugandan defense contractors shown in the pictures below. The Rifles will show the Flavor of deployment on the battlefield. The guns have a neat a slightly collectable niche for those who may want a conversation piece and good shooter. There were a very limited number of these in the market a few years ago, and they are ALL sitting in collections, you just can't find them. Don't miss out on your chance to own an actual rifle that wass issued in the Middle East conflict (Iraq)."

This design of this piston system is just incredible, especially when shot suppressed. It has 5 different gas settings for numerous applications (ie, subsonic) and is unique in that it can fit under most handguards that use a standard barrel nut, instead of having the block poking up in front of the handguard and disrupting the profile.
