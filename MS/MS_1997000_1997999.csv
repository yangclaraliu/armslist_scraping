This unit fell into the serial number range where the tolerances were known to be tight, and USFA shipped me a rebuild kit, which I installed. It made no noticeable difference in the function of the gun, but hey, extra parts are good, right? Now you don't have to buy the life extension kit.

Hornady XTP bullets were designed for hunting, self-defense, and law enforcement. One of the great things about the XTP bullet is reliable performance, it features controlled expansion where six serrations divide the bullet into six symmetrical sections. These sections weaken the jacket to allow controlled expansion at low velocities and ensures fragmentation does not occur at high velocities. The XTP bullet is really known for its stopping power. They were designed from the beginning to expand reliably at a variety of handgun velocities and deliver deep, terminal penetration with every shot. Most handgun bullets are designed to perform at a single factory-specified velocity where the XTP bullet is designed to offer controlled expansion over a range of velocities. 

Each XTP Bullet has a swaged core and drawn copper jacket to ensure uniform expansion and in-flight stability. Adding a cannelure to this bullet keeps the core and the jacket locked together while also allowing the cartridge case to tightly crimp, adding security at high velocities. This is not loaded ammunition."

Nosler Ballistic Tip Hunting bullets have been trusted by hunters for nearly 25 years. They are precision made and individually inspected for the utmost quality which translates to incredible accuracy with every shot. The heavy jacket base prevents bullet deformation during firing and holds together at extreme velocities as well as a polycarbonate tip that resists deformation in the magazine and initiates expansion upon impact. The bullet's mid-section keeps it together at any velocity until impact, and a uniform, pure lead core eliminates possible imbalance and erratic flight caused by air pockets. Great for thin-skinned game like deer, antelope and sheep. This is not loaded ammunition"

Nosler Ballistic Tip Hunting bullets have been trusted by hunters for nearly 25 years. They are precision made and individually inspected for the utmost quality which translates to incredible accuracy with every shot. The heavy jacket base prevents bullet deformation during firing and holds together at extreme velocities as well as a polycarbonate tip that resists deformation in the magazine and initiates expansion upon impact. The bullet's mid-section keeps it together at any velocity until impact, and a uniform, pure lead core eliminates possible imbalance and erratic flight caused by air pockets.

Featuring band-pass lens coating, the PRO is compatible with every generation of night vision devices and provides a crystal clear 1x image for quick target acquisition in close quarter situations. The modular QRP2 mount securely attaches to standard picatinny rails and includes a removable spacer that provides optimal height for co-witness with iron sights on carbine style weapons. Additionally, the QRP2 incorporates a torque limiting knob to completely eliminate over tightening. You won't need to worry about turning the battery on and off with the PRO. The 3-year battery life allows you to turn the unit on out of the box and leave it on for an always ready sight. Other features include a see through ocular lens cap and standard objective flip-up lens cap that are both recessed to prevent impact damage, a rugged 30mm tube, threaded objective bell for use of ARD (Anti-Reflective Device), 4 Night vision settings and 6 daylight settings, battery and adjustment cap retainers to prevent them from being lost in the field, and a ten year pesronal use warranty.

Musket was designed as a single shot .58 cal. rifled muzzleloader featuring iron buttplate, ""C"" shaped hammer, bolster with clean out screw, two leaf sight, iron trigger guard, three flat barrel bands held in place with springs, two strap hooks on middle band and trigger guard, tulip head ramrod with bulged shank and threaded end, iron nose cap.  Springfield Armory supervised the manufacturing and distribution of the Model 1861 musket.  In order to fulfill shortages, production was sub-contracted to a number of private manufacturers, William Mason,  Taunton, Massachusetts, produced 30,000 muskets under the subcontract.  Lock is marked ""1863"" behind the hammer, with eagle and ""US / WM. MASON. / TAUNTON."" in front.  Barrel is marked ""VP"" over eagle head and ""1863"".  Buttplate is marked ""US"".  Three bands each marked ""U"". Cartouche in wood on left side indicates government inspection.  Barrel length 40in.

After every shooting session, I thoroughly cleaned it for at least an hour to make sure it was like brand new again. The scope is a 3x9, it was zeroed in at Dicks Sporting Goods. Also included are 2- 25rnd Remington magazines, as well as the original 10 round magazine , an aluminum framed hard case, and gun lock. I'm also including 100 rounds of ammo as well.

315,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1997315,For Sale:  Polish PPS-43 Machine Gun Parts set Plus Receiver section and Trunnion,"Arlington, WA, Seattle, Washington",$ 175,"Listed On: Saturday, August 24, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Have too many gun builds going on at the moment, so this one needs a new home.

This is an ATF saw cut, demilled, Polish PPS-43 submachinegun parts set. The PPS-43 is the wartime production model of the famous Soviet PPSH-41. It is constructed of almost all stamped and welded parts, and is one of the easier guns to rebuild into a functioning firearm. The PPS originally fired the potent 7.62x25 Tokarev round at over 900 rounds per minute. This gun, originally manufactured in Poland in the 1950's, has been cut through the receiver into pieces, and is no longer considered a firearm. Before it was cut it was in brand new, never fired condition. 

This package includes all parts needed to rebuild into a functioning gun, minus the barrel ($50 online) and a trunnion stabilizer ($5 online). Also included is what's called an 80% receiver that requires you to cut a few parts off of the metal, and drill some holes, and then weld it to the original receiver scraps. A Stenparts.com template is included so you can finish it in spec. Also included is one original 35 round magazine, unissued with a couple spots of surface rust.

ALL NFA AND GCA RULES APPLY! Rebuilding into a legal semi-automatic rifle or pistol will require shop equipment like a welder, grinder, drill press or dremel, etc. Although it is possible to complete one with a file, hand drill, scrap steel, a car battery, jumper cables, and a welding rod. It just takes more time.

There are many step-by-step instruction guides online for building these guns into legal shooters. I can not provide any instruction in the assembly of your gun. If you have a lot of experience as a machinist or gunsmith, this is an easy day-long job to rebuild into a semi-auto firearm. This is normally a full weekend job if you have the tools. Do your research and see what is involved in legally rebuilding parts kit guns, or buy it for the investment. These parts will only grow in value as guns are restricted in the future. Once completed, you have a legal semi-auto rifle or pistol with no serial number, and it's completely untraceable and legal to own. It's a really fun hobby for rainy weekends when you can't make it to the range.

I have over $220 in these parts. I'm selling this package for $175 through Paypal plus $20 shipping, or $165 in cash or trade. You can't find all of these components online for a lower price. I've checked. 

5% discount for NRA Members, just send proof of your membership via Email.

No ID or FFL required to purchase. 

I will accept trades for items below. I WILL ALSO ACCEPT PAYPAL AND SHIP to anywhere in the U.S. where high capacity magazines aren't banned, otherwise I will have to disassemble the magazine before I ship. Shipping is a flat $20 anywhere.

I would prefer to sell through Paypal and ship because it's more convenient for me, but if cash or trade is the only option we would have to arrange to meet at the Norpoint gun range in Arlington either in the evening or weekends.

Will trade for: Original GI M16 parts, AR Lower receivers, AR 20"" Pencil barrel, an older 9 shot .22 Revolver, Military surplus bolt action rifles, 8mm Mauser, .223/5.56, 9mm ammo, cool old stuff, etc. What do you have?"

If you don't know about this lawsuit what happened was Heckler & Koch sued German Sport Guns and ATI because their line of GSGs were practically exact clones of the H&K MP5 (just in .22LR). H&K won the lawsuit and GSG was forced to alter all of their new guns quite a bit, making it highly apparent they were not H&K MP5s. However, this gun released before the lawsuit is unaffected, and a .22LR virtual clone of the H&K MP5PK. 

This pistol has a new HK-GSG-5PK Vertical Grip With Left & Right Side Picatinney Rails., HK claw rail Picatinney top sight mount, a box of approx 400 rounds of CCI ammo, laser sight, and it comes with two brand new magazines that have only been test-fired

** The vertical grip IS NOT installed on this weapon due to Federal Regulations restricting such grip on this weapon **

The pistol also comes with a detachable compensator, GSG tool, and original case.

Im open to offers of similar value. Please remember this is considered a collectible due to this weapon not being manufactured any more due to the lawsuit with H & k.

Here is a detailed description of the shotgun from the Stoeger website: http://www.stoegerindustries.com/firearms/stoeger-defense.php The gun I have is the Stoeger P-350 Pistol Grip Home Defense shotgun. It is a 12 gauge pump shotgun. I have fired the gun once when I bought it to test it (worked perfectly) and it has been sitting in my closet since. It is in excellent shape except that in one of my moves, it slide down the wall in the closet and got some drywall scuff only on the barrel - but there are no metal scratches or dinks anywhere on the gun. You can probably polish off the drywall scuff. The pistol grip version of this gun sells for about $350, I'm selling it for $285 with the ammo carrier on the butt and 10 rounds. In the attached pic, the shotgun is obviously the gun on top. The AR on the bottom was already sold.  Only for face to face, I don't feel like shipping the gun. If you're interested, message me."

Then, continuing my dummy-like state, I opened up both spam cans, thinking I would go through these rounds in no time. 

Fast-forward to the present day. I've sold off the Mosin...8 months ago... (too much work for my liking) and I still have some 800+ rounds left. Oh, and before I forget, my right shoulder still aches with the memory of firing the gun. And I'm pretty sure I have permanent nerve damage in the heel of my right hand from trying to slam the bolt out of its concrete-like Cosmoline prison every time you work the bolt. So please, help me out, make me an offer. I'll take ammo, cash, PMAGs, something. Honestly I just want to get rid of these, in my opinion, space-wasters.

 5.56 NATO (223 Remington), 16 in, 6 Point Collapsible Stock, Black Finish, 30 Round Detachable Magazine PRICE FOR $ 850 LESS BI-POD AND CARRY HANDLE

 This rifle was built for the price conscious user who is looking for a good quality and inexpensive AR15 style rifle for range practice and/or home defense. They were able to do so by changing some features that should NOT upset the majority of target shooting users out there. The barrel used is made in house – 16″ without m203 cuts, melanite coated inside and out, 1:8 twist rate, and 5R rifled. The 5R rifled barrel designs have been in use by Thompson Center, a S&W owned company, for a long time in order to produce an inexpensive and very accurate product. Those looking for a milspec rifle, this isn’t the one for you, but melanite has proven itself a durable, corrosion resistant, uniform coating that can be considered more accurate than chrome lining. Other differences on the Sport models include: an upper receiver lacking a dusk cover and forward assist, a lower receiver with integral enhanced trigger guard, LMT style removable rear sight and A2 style front sight, chromed gas key and bolt carrier and other standard A2 styled parts. For those budget conscious shooters out there looking for a rifle that offers good quality with a low sticker price, the M&P15 Sport rifle may be just what you’re looking for.

Both of the 7-round magazines have Pearce Pinky Extensions.  I have Talon adhesive grip tape grips on it but that can be removed simply by peeling the grip off and there is no residue.   
 The XDs is an excellent carry handgun and is a dandy shooter especially in 9mm.  I purchased two of these.  This one was for my wife but she says she wants to stick to her wheel gun.  So it's up for sale. 
You get the black XDs 9mm with standard kit; gun, 2 mags, case, holster, mag pouch and other Springfield goodies, plus the extended 9-round mag and the Pearce Extensions.   

$525 Cash (I am taking a $100 loss and you don't pay tax and its a private sale.) 

I am in the south metro and can meet anytime in that area. This is a cash face to face sale in the Minneapolis/St Paul South Metro Area. No bill of sale unless buyer wants one, I just need to see valid Permit to Purchase/Carry and valid Driver's License. You show me yours and I show you mine.

As of July 1st, butterfly knives are legal to own and carry in the state of Kansas, in case you were concerned. It is in excellent condition, easily a 9/10. I have carried it once and quickly discovered that it is a bit too big and cumbersome for an everyday carry blade. As a display piece it works pretty damn well though. It was pretty sharp out of the box, but not sharp enough, so I went ahead and put a nicer edge on it.

There is also some varnish wear on the stocks. Only one little nick in the rear stock of the wood... less then an inch. The internals look pretty clean.

The bike also has new tires on her as well as new fork seals,headset bearings, front and rear wheel bearings,new clutch, chain,sprockets,valves adjusted and new belts.Thank you , also for 200 more I have a nice little trailer I can throw in.

Your efforts at Mayors Against Americans Owning Firearms (I know it is suppose to be MAIG) are pathetic. Your reading of the names of criminals killed by law enforcement officers and the Boston bomber as victims of gun violence on your City of New York financed no more names bus tour is inexcusable. 

Here is a little information on bloomberg dot com:

“It’s a loophole so large you could drive a mack truck through it,” Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who served on a House panel on gun violence, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “There’s a way to get around” the existing state and federal firearms laws, she said. 
Perry Tarrant, a police captain in Tucson, Arizona, who has worked in law enforcement for 33 years, said the Internet has compounded the gun violence in his state. 
“Historically, we’ve always thought of Arizona as being the Wild West and a very strong gun culture,” he said in an interview. “The Internet is an even wilder West. Behind a computer, the origin of a seller can be anywhere around the world.” 
“It’s really scary when you look through the online want-ads seeking private sellers,” said Lanae Erickson, a policy director at Third Way. “Why would you need to buy it from a private seller unless you are trying to get around the background check?” 
(these stories from Bloomberg chronie Heidi Przybyla and her story bloomber dot com titled .Sales Online Prompt Gun-Control Groups Against Internet, I just wanted to reference my source to avoid plagerism).  

This is the blood on your hands, you are forcing sales like this, making the legal purchase and ownership of guns a gargantuan process of red tape and BS it forces people to circumvent the process. 

The criminal element is cheering your efforts though as it will greatly reduce the dangers of their jobs.

Just one other note, suicide is not illegal, your including this figure in your firearms violence stats is bogus."

For those wanting the deep-for-weight penetration of the all copper (lead free) Barnes XPB 125gr. bullet in a “tactical” loading, here it is. We use low flash powder so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire, as nearly all self defense shootings in America occur in low light when the criminal element is out and about.

Our tactical 357 mag. ammo generates less felt recoil and blast (flash and noise) than our Heavy 357 mag. loads and as such is a better choice for those carrying light weight short barreled revolvers. This is still a full powered 357 mag. load, but allows for faster follow-up shots and greater shooting comfort.

Below are real world velocities taken from my personal real world stock guns. The established use of long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings are essentially misleading to the public who won’t be firing ammo from laboratory test barrels.

    1642 fps - Marlin 1894, 18 inch barrel
    1333 fps - S&W mod. 27, 5 inch barrel
    1383 fps - S&W Mt. Gun, 4 inch barrel
    1295 fps - S&W mod 66, 3 inch barrel
    1235 fps - S&W mod 66, 2.5 inch barrel

Yes the more modern 4-inch S&W Mt. gun did shoot faster velocities than the older 5-inch model 27 and this is due to different internal barrel dynamics of the newer gun.

This ammunition is safe for use in ANY/ALL 357 magnum firearms."
