Included with shotgun is a TLR-4 Streamlight light and laser combo original box with paperwork even plastic that it came wrapped in and a black winchester sling. I've put about 50 target loads through the shotgun, the only wear on the shotgun is on the tops of the sight i think they may have rubbed in the case. It's a great shooting shotgun I'm just in the market for something different. I will also include the remaining ammo I have for it(25 winchester target load and 5 ends military buck shot roughly $13). Shotgun was 499.99 New, Laser/light combo was 129.99 new and sling was 19.99. Since I can only put up one picture if your interested I will send detailed photos of the shotgun which i already have taken this morning. Will sell with bill of sale or through a FFl at your cost Preferably New Hampshire residents because I do not know the laws in other states and do not know if the shotgun is compliant in your state if you want to take the risk thats up to you no refunds if you choose to take that risk, but i will only ship to a registered FFL."

I will personally draft and customize your N.F.A.firearms trust for purchasing such Class 3 items. A Gun Trust is a revocable trust, which you may revoke, or amend whenever you wish. No additional charge for up to an hour in-office, or telephone, consultation. As I will not simply be inserting names into a template, the usual turnaround time for completition is four (4) business days.  If circumstances require, for no additional charge, I probably would be able expedite the process to as little as 24 hrs.   Owners of Class 3 items should avoid relying on boilerplate forms, trust software, or trusts that are not drafted by an attorney, because they may not comply with the unique issues involving suppressors, silencers, fully automatic rifles, SBRs, and other Title 2, or Class 3 weapons regulated by the National Firearms Act (NFA). A N.F.A.Trust will allow you to: avoid Chief Law Enforcement officer sign offs; Avoid having to get finger printed; Avoid having to get photographs taken; Have the capability to file electronically; Allow more than 1 person to LEGALLY take possession and use your N.F.A.devices;and Streamline inheritance, and passing down of firearms to future generations. The majority of Gun Trusts are prepared for a total price of $250.00. Sure you can probably find an online $29.99 form, but having a trained chimp lawyer wannabee prepare your N.F.A. Gun Trust, if done improperly, can result in your firearms being confiscated by the ATF, a $250,000.00 fine, and your potential exposure to felony violations of the National Firearms Act. “Intent” is not a requirement for being convicted of a violation under the National Firearms Act. Contact Elliot Goldstein, Esq./J.& G.

Up for trade is a very nice colt 1991A1. I got this in trade from the orginal owner. It's in very good shape an comes as you see it pictured. The mags are 1 colt and 2 cmc mags, and 59 rounds of ball ammo. This finish is tough to photograph but you won't be disappointed. I would say the finish is %95 consecutively. Very little wear. 

As far as trades I am open but below are a few specifics. 

Ak-47 or ak-74 must be a good quality gun. A wasr is fine but I'll need cash with it. 

H&k VP9 depending on what yours comes with I'll likely need some cash.

S&W 357 or 44 mag revolvers (no rugers unless it's a clean security six, service six) 

M&p shield 9mm plus cash. 

Glock 34

The gloss finish on the Walnut straight grip stock contrasts beautifully with the deeply polished blue finish on the receiver and the barrel. This is what a serious lever-action rifle should be, and what every other lever-action wishes it was.

-The button-Rifled barrel is triple-checked for straightness and interior finish and then air-gauged to ensure a consistent diameter throughout the bore’s length.
-Individually finished with a hand-reamed chamber for tighter tolerances and more precise headspace.
-The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.
-Low-Profile adjustable square notch rear sight and a high-visibility front blade with gold bead fitted on a raised ramp-style base.?
-Richly blued steel finish on all external surfaces --  a stunning reflection of the gunmaker’s art.
-Aircraft grade alloy receiver is precision machined to provide outstanding reliability and years of dependable service.
-The slick-sided receiver houses the BLR’s lightning fast, glass-smooth rack and pinion lever action.
-Rrotating multi-lug bolt head that locks into the barrel extension to produce bolt-action accuracy and magnum-level strength.
-The BLR is one of the few lever-action rifle designs that is strong enough to use today’s most popular magnum cartridges, giving you the extended reach and flat bullet trajectory other lever-action owners can only dream of.
-Recessed bolt face that surrounds the cartridge head for added strength and lasting dependability.
-The BLR’s generously-sized side ejection port allows fired cases to instantly clear the action without hitting you or your scope and bouncing back onto the receiver, potentially creating a jam.
-The folding hammer on the BLR provides an added measure of safety when the hammer is at half-cock, having two positions in that mode so the status of the rifle can be instantly seen and felt.
-The folding hammer on the BLR has four basic positions; Full-cock, half-cock, folded hammer position and the dropped or fired position.
-The trigger is unique in that it travels along with the lever as it’s cycled, meaning that pinching your fingers between the lever and trigger on closing the action is a thing of the past.
-Fingerpiece on the BLR’s trigger is nice and wide with vertical friction ribs to prevent your finger from slipping, giving you more precise trigger control for those demanding long-range shots.
-The detachable steel box magazine makes for quick reloading, both in the field and on the range.
-Unlike lever actions with tubular magazines, the BLR’s detachable steel box magazine lets you use aerodynamically-superior pointed bullets, which opens up a whole new world of ballistic performance that is usually found in bolt-action and autoloading rifles.
-Magazine capacity is 3 rounds in the magnum calibers and 4 rounds in standard calibers.
-Stock sculpted from fine Walnut and the cut checkering in the grip and fore-end is crisply executed for lasting good looks and a more solid grip.
-The straight grip BLR stock is true to the classic lines of the lever action rifle and has a traditional carbine strap at the fore-end.
-Stock has a deep, glossy finish that brings out every nuance of the wood’s warm color and grain.
-The well-formed recoil pad helps reduce felt recoil and flinching.
-Steel sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling or bipod."

I am only asking $50.00 because I am trying to clear out some closet space. E-mail or you can phone me at REDACTED. Thank you.  NOTE-GUN NOT INCLUDED and it is a K frame S&W which fit pretty well, but a little loose (not loose enough to fall out )"

Comes with a British sling, buttstock cleaning kit, and spike bayonet with scabbard (not shown).  

The only issue with the rifle is that part of the rear peep sight is cracked, as shown.  However, you can flip the sight up and there's another adjustable rear peep that allows for more precise shots.  This second rear peep is unbroken, and the rifle works fine using just the flipped-up adjustable rear peep.

I'll also include an extra No. 4 Enfield rear sight that is unbroken, and you can swap them out if that bother you.  I've included a shot of the spare rear sight.  It's a later, stamped version of the rear sight, but they're interchangeable.  (There were about 4 different types of rear sights used during No. 4 Enfield production.)

 The Sigma was Smith & Wesson 's first venture into using synthetic materials in gun construction, using high-strength polymer material for the frame. The gun is similar to a Glock safe-action pistol in both its design and operation, leading to some controversy and speculation as to the legality of the gun's patents.

 In 1999 Smith & Wesson introduced the VE series. These models were billed as 'enhanced' and featured an improved grip, improved trigger, and enlarged ejection port. This model returned to the black coloration of the polymer frame mated with a stainless steel or black melonite slide.

 At this time Smith & Wesson retired the 4.5 inch barrel and switched all Sigmas to the 4.0 inch barrel. Sigmas from this era onward are considered '2nd generation' Sigmas. Shortly after the introduction of the VE series, Smith & Wesson further improved it by adding an accessory rail but did not change the model number to reflect this update."

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability.

I am not hurting for money, so Low-Ball offeres will probably just be laughed at- my wife found out I bought an AK & the money I spent & she demands that I sell a gun.
I could sell another rifle that isnt setup well & doesnt shoot worth a crap (ive got one in 30-30win if thats really what you want $350-- a cheap gun that won't hit anything) but I am the type of guy that Will Not sell something to just make a dollar-- it has to function just like I would want it to if i were using it.
As stated above this one is setup & shoots very well & I really hate to sell it, but since i've gotten the AK I figure I can cull it from my collection even though i really dont want to...
    If you've shot an SKS before then you know some shoot well & some don't, some feel awkward because of the length of pull short stock etc, this one is perfect. I will meet you at the range & let you try it out before you buy.

Unlike other new-comers to this specialized market, who just modified their existing 2 3/4'' - 3'' shotguns, the 835 was designed to stay the course. The robust bolt, receiver, and other components are specifically sized for the longer shells and the downrange punishment they dish out. In addition, all 835 Ulti-Mag smooth bore barrels are overbored to 10 gauge bore dimensions, reducing recoil and producing exceptionally uniform patterns from both light and heavy shot charges. Working in tandem with the performance-enhancing overbored barrels, strategic placement of eight ports on each side of the 835 barrel direct gasses upward and outward to not only reduce felt recoil, but to minimize muzzle jump for quick second shot recovery., **This is a special order item and IS NOT STOCKED IN OUR STORE and full payment must be made prior to us submitting the order.

Invented in 1866 by Captain J. Vincent Meigs, the Meigs .50 cal was an early expirement with repeating rifles. The most notable feature of the rifle was the 50 round removable magazine that was contained in a tube located in the buttstock. It was a lever action firearm, and could practically fire 50 rounds a minute, something not seen again until the introduction of semi auto rifles.
Only three of these prototypes would be made, one was fired 38,000 times without malfunction. Unfortunatly this gun was too expensive and too difficult to manufacture at the time. The Meigs rifle would never go into production.
One can be found on display at the Cody Firearms Museum, Cody, Wyoming."

-Used one season… I have shot two rounds of 25 on skeet, 41 shots on opening day of dove season (I remember limiting out at 41 shots), 1 box of “Teal Steel” during Teal Season, approximately 3 boxes of Black Cloud during duck and goose season, approximately 2 boxes of prairie storm during pheasant season, and 5 three and a half inch Third Degree shells (3 to pattern gun, 2 to shoot gobblers) this Spring. The gun has been cleaned after every use and only malfunctioned (failure to eject) once in the first round of skeet which I believe was because it was so new. I am not going to lie to you and say the gun has only been shot ten times like many people try to pull. However, the gun is in great shape.

-Only selling because I need cash and it hurts me to sell because I bought this gun with the intention to keep it forever. It would make a great autoloader for someone. Read the reviews online. It is made to shoot everything and stands up next to all other brands on the market.

Gamo Silent Cat 1200 fps .177 break action rifle. This is the silenced model that reduces sound 52%. With PBA pellets, it is 1400 fps (but it makes a cracking sound due to being so fast). Regular pellets are near silent and plenty for small game hunting. It also comes with a $50 3x9x40 scope I bought from Academy because the scope that came with it was...awful. The one on it now was a display scope with no name but is very clear and is BDC, it was listed for higher. The gun is like new and will come with several tins of high quality hunting pellets. Gun is dead on accurate and made for small game hunting, not a BB gun toy. It was used for quiet pest control...and did well. The silencer reduces noise way more than other rifles this powerful, and it completely legal. It is sighted in with Benjamin HP pellets perfectly.

Honestly I love this pistol, but am switching to a Glock 43. We can even discuss me throwing in a little .380 to boot for the right offer as this is the only .380 I own."

The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.Manufacturer: Heckler & Koch Model: P2000 SKCaliber: .40 S&WAction: Double / Single Action Barrel: 3.3""Capacity: 10"

This listing is for One pistol. Here is one of a few All German Sig-Sauer P-226, 9mm Pistols that served our country with the US Department of Energy, special response team duty, protecting our Nuclear Plants. According to their JJ date codes, they were manufactured in 1988. Manufacturer was Sig Sauer gmbh of Eckernförde, Germany. Importer was Sig Arms of Herndon, Virginia, and the slide is so marked. Type is locked breech hammer fired traditional single and double action semi automatic pistol. Construction is steel slide, barrel, trigger, hammer, and internal parts all assembled into a lightweight alloy grip frame. Barrel, frame, and slide all bear matching serial numbers. Chambering is 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Barrel is 4 1/4 inch with six groove 1: 9.75 right hand rifling. Slide has serrated rear lateral surfaces and is 1.02 wide at the port. Slide has a removable breech block. Sights are steel dovetailed, white dot front and white bar rear, drift adjustable only for windage. Trigger is .350 serrated face combat type, housed inside a square trigger guard. Hammer is .312 serrated spur. Trigger is two stage on double action, 1/4 inch to engagement with 1 inch of travel to fire position, 12 pound vicinity pull. Single action pull is two stage as well, about 1/4 inch to engagement with a crisp original 4 pound pull. Sigs all have a firing pin block safety that prevents accidental discharge if the pistol is dropped, yet even with that, they always have the best single action trigger pull of all from the factory. Grips are factory black polymer. Each 226 comes with One original factory issue Sig Sauer 15 shot magazine, so fully loaded capacity of 16 rounds. Weight empty is 31 ounces, with center of gravity just forward of the magazine release. Weight fully loaded is approximately 42 ounces. Surface detractions on this specimen and its mates are minimal to moderate. Each one of them underwent an armory refinish at some point, and shows faint residual edge wear to the frame and strut, with dimness to the slide lettering. Grips show some wear on the right panel as the photos show. We rate them as Very Good, 80 to 85 percent vicinity by our estimate, but photos ought to help our distinguished shoppers determine finish grade for themselves. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. We estimate each pistol has been fired between 1500 and 2000 rounds; slide to frame fit is tight, not loose. Replacement pricing on a 226 these days is upwards of $900 in our area. We’re offering the Sig in the photos, however, or one of its very similar mates, each for only $ 489.00.
