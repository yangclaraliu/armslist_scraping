I bought it a couple of months ago and had planned on going the .308 route, but plans change, so I’m letting this one go. She is as new as she was the day I got her, just moved from the hard case to the safe. 

The GI model comes with green furniture (HK OD green), parkerized finish, 18” barrel, flash hider. It came with one 20-round magazine, I bought 10 more surplus 20-round magazines which are included with the rifle.

Looking for a fine .308 battle rifle at well under the cost of most AR’s in .308? This may be for you.

What you get:

•  PTR91-GI .308 Battle Rifle – New, unfired
•  Original hard case, paperwork
•  (11) 20-Round Magazines

My price is $849 and I’ll cover the FFL transfer to you if we meet at my choice of FFL.  I prefer to sell outright, but I am open to a few trades, so long as I get at least $300-$400 cash out of the deal (after transfer fees), which depends on the value of your trade. See below for some trades I might be open to.

Sale/transfer will be at my choice of FFL in the Portland Metro area (likely Oregon City). If you want to meet at another FFL, I’ll put $25 toward the transfer/BGC, you can cover any additional cost. If we trade, we'll split the two-way transfer and BGC fees - you pay the fees on yours, I'll pay the fees on mine. 

**FYI - I'll be on the Oregon Coast, Tillamook area, from Sept. 12-19 if someone on that area of the coast is interested**

If you’re interested, please use the “Contact Seller” button on this page. I can usually get back to you within 1-2 hours during the workday.

I'll try and get some photos up in the next day or two after I can get it out and get it photographed. For now, I'm including some stock photos (not my own)."

The Most Up-To-Date & Reliable Civilian Magazine Available

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Choose from our high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” Updated material and design features like those in our 30-round magazine have been adapted to our straight-bodied, 20-round model. All models are available in standard military Gray. Since we manufacture these mags ourselves, we can maintain a large inventory. So, if you need magazines in a hurry, even in quantity, we can get them to you ASAP.

The P-01 is based on the CZ 75 design, but with improvements in metallurgy, quality control adn design. The components of the P-01 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01 with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful redesign so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. The P-01 is the ony NATO spec pistol on the market that is available to the public. After 3 years of the most aggressive small arms testing ever by any manufacturer for any pistol, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75's previously used by the Czech National Police. 
Reliability: The U.S. Army ""Mean Rounds Between Failure"" (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!    CZ P01 features:
A forged aircraft grade aluminum alloy frame for light but reliable day-to-day carry.
A Hammer forged barrel for accuracy and durability.
De-cocker action and a firing pin block for maximum safety.
The P-01 is also equipped with an M3 rail to accept lights or lasers.
Dual slide serrations for easy slide operation.
Generous squared triggerguard for gloved hands.
Re-contoured trigger for smoother, consistent trigger pulls
Durable, chemical resistant, matte polycoat finish.
Lanyard loop on butt.
Checkered rubber grips and serrated front and back strap for superior handling.
Easy disassembly for cleaning.

The CMR-206 Rail Master® is compact, yet powerful, universal green laser sight designed to fit rail-equipped pistols, rifles and shotguns. The laser sight fits onto virtually any firearm with a modern (M1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style) accessory rail. Ambidextrous control tabs allow the user to instantly activate or deactivate the laser.
The human eye processes the color green more effectively than any other color, and Crimson Trace offers the brightest green laser allowed by law, (5mW peak, 515nm, Class 3R). The CMR-206 Rail Master boasts 2 hours of (constant) run time on a single 1/3N Lithium battery, and features a 5 minute auto shut-off for power conservation.
The CMR-206 offers 3 modes of operation: Momentary, Strobe, and Constant-On. This allows the user to easily set their mode based on personal need or preference. The unit is quickly and easily user-installed in moments and can be painlessly transferred from firearm to firearm. The CMR-206 is securely fastened using Crimson Trace's Secure Lock Technology (SLT™)."

I am a Marine Corps combat veteran and Tampa native. I have decided to try to make a difference in our community by uniting Post 9/11 veterans and showing the public what good we can still bring to the bay area. The goal is to provide a platform where we integrate veterans in local charity events to encourage a sense of community and inspire through actions. By building a strong community through social outreach and neighborhood events we can change some of the negative stigmas surrounding OIF and OEF veterans. We are currently selling t-shirts in a fundraiser to get our 501c3 designation as a Non-Profit! The links for the tshirts and donations are below.Please feel free to review and share the page on Facebook. If you have any questions or would like to speak with me in person please contact me via email. I want to reach as many of our local veterans as possible.

Yes, these are the better higher grain bullets that are used by many law enforcement officers and have some solid studies/research and feedback behind them. NOTE: these are the FIFTY (50) round boxes, people. They are NOT the expensive twenty round boxes that normally cost $27.95 per box (about 29.89 with tax or $1.49 per round) and that's when you can find them. I have yet to find the 50 round boxes locally anywhere. I will sell these for what I believe to be a reasonable price of $41.00 per box which is only about 82 cents per round. All I ask is that you are over 21 years of age and can legally own a firearm (ie you are not a felon).

""The 5.56 Midlength Base 16"" Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the m4 style handguards. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.""

The M202 has been out of production for a while and they're getting hard to find.  Armscor discontinued this model to cut costs (cheaper to parkerize) but unlike it's brothers, this gun is actually pretty attractive.  The full size frame and grooved polymer grip also make recoil extremely manageable.  It is also worth noting that it is all steel and there are no zamak or aluminum parts to be found here.

Six round capacity, transfer bar safety, and an excellent trigger in both double action and single action.  The action locks up tight in both double action and single action and fires just fine too. This gun would make someone an excellent defensive firearm.  Shoots great and is in excellent condition with almost no finish wear.  I'm only selling this because I picked up another handgun and it's just collecting dust now.

They're made by the same company that builds the Rock Island Armory line of 1911's, which are also known for their great cost/performance ratio.
