It has a 16"" match grade bull barrel, the wide triangle HK foregrip, and welded top rail.  I added a custom trigger pack from Bill Springfield that lowered the trigger pull from about 8lbs to ~4.5lbs (I have the original trigger pack as well).  I also added a simple riser rail, and a Leupold VX 3x9-40 scope.  That is an option, and can be removed before the sale/trade.

Now, for the ""Special Edition"" part.  This was part of a custom group of weapons put out by PTR.  I challenge you to search PTR's website for this rifle....you will not find it.  The A3R is close, but that has the 18"" bull barrel.  I was lucky enough to grab one of these.  I would rather have this foregrip than the vented aluminum/poly ones.  This remindes me more of a true older HK rifle.

I got to take this to the range once.  I was working up some 308 loads for a bolt action, and took this along.  I had about 10 minutes left at the end of the session, and unloaded the 3 10 round HK magazines I have.  It shoots VERY nice.  Not much recoil (since it is not the lightest gun in the world...9 lbs without the scope or magazines, close to 15 fully loaded).  It didn't give me a chance to zero the scope, but I just wanted to get a feel for the rifle itself.  

I don't NEED to sell this.  I am just seeing what is out there, and what offers are to be made.  NO low ball offers!  This is not your ""off the shelf"" PTR.  If you are worried about it being an HK clone....go read up on the PTR.  It is made with true HK tooling from the Portugal HK factor that closed down.  It is the closest thing to a true HK that you can get for under $3k.





This has been to the range once, and about 30 rounds through it.  I had multiple weapons at the range, and had just enough time to go through my pre-loaded 3 10 round HK magazines."

This started life as a POR P415 16"" rifle that cost over $2000.  I then started modifying it to make it the lightest, most accurate weapon possible.  

I built a custom upper with the M4E1 Enhanced Aero upper receiver that integrated the foregrip into the upper receiver.  The barrel is a Daniel Defense Hammer Forged 14.5"" barrel.  It is finished with a Surefire 5.56 Muzzle Brake.  I have a low profile, slip on, gas block, and VooDoo Lifecoat gas tube.  This goes to a Nickel Boron (NiB) Bolt Carrier Group.  The charging handle is a Rainier Arms (AXTS) Ambidexterous handle.  

For the lower, the only thing I added was a JP Piston Buffer.  It adds just a little bit of weight vs a stock buffer, but it reduces recoil so much, it makes followup shots 10x easier.  The rest of the POF lower features a built-in ambi bolt release (built into the lower receiver), an ambi safety, KNS anti-rotate trigger pins, a Magpul grip and buttstock, and topping it off, the POF trigger group at 4.5 lbs.

Optics wise, I have a real Aimpoint T-1 Micro 2 MOA dot sight (LaRue QD mount) with a Vortex 3x magnifier with ""flip to the side"" capabilities.  It gives rapid acquisition with just the T-1, or more accurate, longer range, shots with the magnifier in place.

As I said, this is by far the best AR platform I have ever shot.  I have at least 100 ARs over the years, and this is the best of everything I have learned.  Accuracy: Check!  Light Weight: Check!  Reduced Recoil: Check!  This has it all, and then some!"

I have my Sig Sauer SigArms P229 (E29-40-BSS) w/ Stainless Steel Slide for sale. This is the Same exact Handgun the Secret Service and U.S. Air Marshalls Carry but in .357 Sig which can be done by swapping barrels. 
-Unlike Glock, this Sig is multi-Strike capable in case of FTF. Dont need to rack the slide to fire again. 
  -Frame -""Made in Germany."" It has the factory Night Sights I think Meprolite makes them for Sig. I've owned this nice handgun for about 5-6 years and only have shot 2 mags on two range trips to check functionality. - it's a Sig. Come on, You don't need to function test these! Anyways, I'm moving out-of-state and need to sell some of my toys.

  -It's in near perfect condition and really not looking for any trades except for a chrome lined barreled AK74 (5.45x39) rifle in good condition (Saiga, Vepr, Bulgarian, etc). Sorry, No Romanian or parts kit rifles. Prefer one put together by a named outfit. 

    -Please don't send me links to online stores. I paid over $850 and I'm not asking for top $. I don't care and I'm not a FFL but will need to see your Ohio Driver's License and by purchasing you're acknowledging that you are legal to buy and own this gun.
- .40 S&W Caliber
- 2 factory .40/.357 sig ""Made in Germany"" Magazines
- Pair of Hogue rubberized grips included
- Upgraded short Sig Trigger and Factory Trigger included

I can and WILL split these up if requested!!!!

Lets start with the lower receiver first.  It is an Aero Precision lower, with a Timney Gold Skeletonized 4.5lb Match trigger.  It is a single stage match trigger with the best break of any trigger I have ever had.  It is held in place with KNS anti-rotation trigger pins.  The Takedowns are Yankee Hill EZ takedowns.  A BAD Ambi safety, Magpul Battery Asssist Device, and Magpul trigger guard are also installed.  The buttstock is a Magpul UBR.  

The upper is a POF upper receiver with a Wilson Combat 5.56 marked ejection port cover.  The Foregrip is a Yankee Hill Todd Jarrett Competition 15"" Extended Rifle Length with a Yankee Hill endcap is installed.  The barrel is a BCM 20"" 1:7 twist Competition barrel.  I am not sure if they even make this barrel anymore, I have had it about 2 years.  I don't remember who makes the muzzle brake.....  The bolt is a Nickel Boron (NiB) Bolt Carrier Group, and a Rainier Arms (AXTS) ambidextrous charging handle.

The Optic is a Nikon M-223 3x12-42 scope.  It is mounted on a quick release riser with Nikon rings.

The 300 Blackout Upper is build on a M4E1 Aero Enhanced Upper with a 9"" foregrip.  The Enhanced Upper intergrates the upper receiver and foregrip into a solid mount platform.  The barrel is a Rainier Arms Match 300 Blackout 14.5"" barrel with a pistol length gas system.  The barrel is topped with a Yankee Hill flash hider.  It has its own Rainier Arms (AXTS) charging handle, but shares the same bolt as the 20"" AR (since they use the same bolt anyway).  The optic is a Vector 1x6-28 First Focal Plane scope. This means that when you zoom, the reticle zooms with you.  It is dual illuminated red/green.

The 20"" rifle will shoot sub MOA all day, and the 300 Blackout is capable of being fired with Super or Sub Sonic ammo.  The 20"" 5.56 upper has about 200 rounds through it, just enough to get the scope zero'd and shoot some 30 round groups.  Infact, when I had it at the indoor range about a month ago, I was shooting tighter groups with an AR @ 100 yards than either guy beside me.  One had a 308 bolt, the other had a benchrested AR @ 50 yards.  Both were very impressed.  The 14.5"" 300 blackout was just recently built.  It has about 50 rounds through it, 30 building a Super Sonic load, and 20 building a Sub Sonic Load.  My intent was to register the lower as a SBR, and put a 7.5"" barrel on the 300 Blackout, then add a suppressor.  The 9"" upper would put part of the suppressor under the handguard giving an much better look.

I don't NEED to sell this, and I don't NEED help selling this.  I am just looking to see what is out there and what offers I get.  No LOW BALL offers.  I build these almost daily, and know what is in them."

Bought new only a couple of months ago. About 120 rounds through it so far with no malfunctions of any kind. I’ve been very happy with it and I’m only selling because I want a 22/45 “lite” model with a threaded barrel and this has to go to help fund that.

Comes with all original factory stuff (box, manual, lock, 2 magazines, scope rail). Also, before I ever fired it I removed the magazine disconnect and in its place installed a TandemKross steel hammer bushing made specifically for these guns. For those who don’t know, the magazine disconnect is supposedly a “safety feature” that prevents the trigger from being pulled without a magazine inserted. In the case of Ruger 22/45s, however, this also makes the trigger very gritty, it prevents the magazines from dropping free when released, and it makes disassembly/reassembly way more more troublesome than it already is for these models. Removal of the disconnect and replacement with the hammer bushing makes a world of difference and I believe is an almost necessary upgrade.

It still has the manual safety, however if you’re more comfortable with the original factory magazine disconnect in place, I have the original parts and can easily replace them in a few minutes while you wait. Even if you want to keep it like it is for now, I’ll include the original parts with the gun.

The reason for its popularity is because it shoots great, looks great and is remarkably affordable – about half the price of the competition’s rifles.
The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself. This one has the highly popular ""Octogon Barrel"" a true indicator of Old West style rifles."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

You can purchase the barrel nut for $36 from here: https://www.boltcarrier.com/product/knights-armament-urx-barrel-nut/ 

- The listed price does account for the barrel nut not being included. If you want the barrel nut, I can order it for you, the price with the barrel nut is $285 ($35 + shipping)

- Kac Urxii/Iii/3.1 Barrel Nut Wrench- $116.00 (Required to install KAC rail)

Everything is is LNIB and has less than 30 minutes of range time; this was only used to test and it never got hot. Perfect condition!  

Even though the barrel is in the pictures, the barrel has been sold and not included, this is for the hand guard and wrench only."

The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts.

Up for sale is my BCM BFH 14.5"" lightweight KMR rifle, I am only selling it to fund my first step into SBR-land. The combination of the mid-length gas system, Gunfighter comp and A5 assembly make this thing spooky steady when fired, I first thought it was short-stroking when I shot it based on how non-existent the recoil/muzzle movement was but it was functioning perfectly and has nice strong and consistent extraction, the brass lands in a 1-2ft pile. This upper hasn't been shot much and has probably 200 rounds through it of brass-cased Wolf Gold. I have about $1,900 (non-panic dollars) into it. Here is the full list of parts:

The 745 was designed specifically for IPSC (International Practical Shooting Confederation) a shooting sport designed from the start to  promote, maintain, and advance practical marksmanship.

Much like the Colt Gold Cup, this was designed as a target gun, and as such it excels.  The trigger is exceptionally short and light, with a lightning quick reset.  The trigger stop can be used to further tune trigger travel to an absolute minimum.
The slide-mounted safety is a hammer block only--flipping the safety down blocks the hammer from the firing pin, but does not act as a lock.  This gun cannot be considered ""cocked and locked"" like a 1911, however this gun was never meant for daily carry, only target and sport shooting use. 
Because of the superior trigger and barrel muzzle/slide lock up the 745 generally displays better accuracy than its' contemporary Gold Cup counterparts.   The 745 is an exceptionally accurate gun aimed at shooting sports and informal target shooting.
This 745 will easily put a box of 50 rounds into a two inch hole at 25 yards, shooting from a sandbag  rest. The 745 was made in small numbers (5000-6000 total).
Befitting a target/sport shooting gun, the 745 sports an oversize and aggressively checkered magazine release as well as an adjustable trigger stop.
The extremely light and short single action trigger can almost be adjusted until no pre or over travel can be felt.  In short, this trigger almost can be made to behave like the click of a computer mouse.
The full trigger pull weight on my 745 is around three pounds.  That pull weight is from the factory without any additional work.  I cannot describe just how great this trigger is to use, it must be experienced to be appreciated. Grips are pachmayr, and pistol comes with original box, papers, two 8 round clips and 17 rounds of ammo. The 745 is in great condition, and I doubt that I've put more than 2 boxes of ammo through it."

- Loading port opened (see picture) to make dual loads or quad loads much easier than factory. Cost for this service ranges from $100 - $150.
- Stock hammer spring replaced with Ruger 10/22 spring. Give a reliable strike every time. Some 930s had issues with light strikes. This one never did and was upgraded proactively. Factory spring included.

I'm clearing out room and won't be paintballing anytime in the foreseen future. Both markers are in prime condition. Details below. Complete package with both markers for $120, or individual markers (w/ gear as detailed below) $70/each. Serious offers only. Prices are non-negotiable. Must be over 18 to purchase. ID will be required to verify at purchase time. No exceptions.

Tippmann 98 Custom : 
I received this as a starter package late in my paintballing days so I only ever got to shoot this thing once. It is all original. No add-ons or modifications. It is a stock paintball marker. I do not have the original mask with his package so the only things that you can consider “missing” is a mask, which there are more and better ones out there, and the hopper. All in all this is an excellent starter or even intermediate level marker. It is extremely well built and a tough little marker. It was manufactured in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, USA. 
Included with this package:
• Tippmann 98 Custom paintball marker
• Pure Energy 20oz CO2 tank w/ thread protector and stock adapter.
• Pure Energy 9oz CO2 tank w/ thread protector and stock adapter.
• Barrel Plug

Spyder Compact :
This was my first paintball marker I ever had. In all of the time I’ve had it it’s been a solid performer all around. While it is a much older model of paintball gun it is still extremely tough and reliable. I’ve taken it to scenario games in La Porte, IN, and have had zero complaints about it. The marker works fabulouslyand is an excellent entry level or collectable piece for your paintball arsenal. This package does include the factory original barrel and a modified 12” Viewloader ported chrome barrel for longer range and stability. I’ve noticed that the 12” barrel does lend the marker considerably better performance in the field. The kit and bag are all included with this deal, it is a modified Compaq laptop bag but it’s got cut foam inside to fit the marker and protects it very well. 

Included with this package:
• Spyder Compact paintball marker w/ original 9.5” barrel
• Viewloader 12” ported chrome barrel
• Original 12oz CO2 tank w/ thread protector
• PMI offset Deluxe Elbow
• Paintball marker oil. 
• 2 Viewloader 100 round speed loader tube
• Viewloader 200 round hopper w/ camo sleeve

It is considered by many to be the best CZ75 clone, even putting it in its own category.
