This new 9mm pistol is a double-action, striker-fire designed platform that incorporates an ergonomically driven polymer double stack frame with a stainless steel slide.  With extensive research on the form and function of the tactile-enhanced grip, the operator will find the design enhances control, while providing consistent hand placement. The flared magwell aids in fast and reliable reloads while the extended magazine base pad provides a secure grip during loading, handling and shooting the DB FS Nine.

Diamondback has incorporated a trigger safety and firing pin block safety with a short, positive reset, minimizing trigger travel for faster cycle times. A cocking indicator is located at the rear of the slide, providing visual and tactical recognition. For quick target acquisition, fixed, three-dot sights are mounted onto the stainless slide.  Both front and rear tactical serrations provide firm engagement between the user’s hand and the DB FS Nine's slide, allowing for a better grip during manipulation.
The dust cover has an integrated MIL-STD1913 Picatinny rail for tactical lights, lasers and other accessories, extending its versatility for everyday carry, home defense, training or use on the range. The 4.75” Chromemoly barrel on the DB FS Nine provides a long, 6.25” sight radius, aiding the overall accuracy of the pistol during practice and competition."

Not a 226 or 228but the Sig Sauer quality is there. This is the first Da/Sa trigger I've ever used and I gotta say I love it, this gun made me a more accurate shooter. The one and only reason I'm willing to let this gun go is because I'm a slim guy and this isn't the easiest gun for me to conceal, others can but I can't. It comes with two magazines that hold 15 rounds in each, Sig factory holster, 2 backstraps, and the case. Thanks for viewing my ad, send me a offer, details below.

Very, very accurate and good shooter for what it is, it shoots more like a good 4.25"" gun. Excellent trigger!

$500 for the firearm, 2 magazines, IWB Holster and the factory supplied box / accessories.

Otherwise for $600 it comes with a total of 3 magazines, one of which is extended with the 'pinky' grip extension which essentially makes a short barrel Compact. 50 rounds of Hornaday Critical Defense and 500 rounds of Winchester 115g FMJ. Also includes soft handgun case.

You probably already know this, but this pistol can be changed from any size (Fullsize, Carry, Compact, Subcompact) with each one having the choice of Small, Medium or Large grip size, and in 9mm, .357 Sig, .40 S&W, .45 ACP and there is even talk of a .22 kit being available soon. All of this and each kit can be shipped to your door without the hassle and expense of going through an FFL dealer because the actual firearm is the trigger assembly.

Would like to deal in person, otherwise if shipped you'll have the cost of shipping and FFL transfer. I'm firm on the price right now, the gun alone was $630 + tax. I've probably got $850 in everything... If it doesn't sell at the upcoming Novi gun show then I'll consider offers.

I've fondled too many of these little guns with endshake, poor triggers, .010"" gaps, forcing cones unparallel to the cylinder, and overall bad fit and finish. So when I saw this one I just couldn't help myself, unlike the majority of the latest Rugers this one has a bunch of good things going for it: lockup, trigger, cylinder to barrel gap, machining and overall fit and finish are well above Ruger standard. This one must have been made on Wednesday morning.

B west is a company that was banned in the 90s by the atf for assembling unregulated Chinese imported parts into ak47s and other communist firearms like makarovs. They would buy the parts from China and assemble them here in the states and stamp made in USA on the receivers. The company is no longer in existence and there guns are rare and no longer available. Making it a pre ban ak. This is a late 80s early 90s model before bwest became a bad egg company. 

It shoots great and looks beautiful. Looks very very sexy i don't even want to part with it but times are tough. And I've had it for a long while its just been in the safe.  Its got all wood parts including the pistol grip unlike new aks I've seen with the plastic grips. Also has a fold out bayonet that looks awesome and would do its job if needed. 

This is a b westnorinco  import model. It IS heat treated and has original Chinese bluing. The serial reads bwc which is the letters of aks that were heat treated late 80s early 90s. Before the company started to short cut and consequently was banned.



Here's the breakdown:

900 obo ak47 bwest import, with the original mag and Chinese sling. With 2 extra open bolt Yugoslavian magazines (haven't tried with this ak so idk how well they work but throwing them in for fun), a universal hardcase for any gun, aswell as 2 boxes  20rnds ea of wolf steel ammo to get u started. 

350$ for 1000 rounds of steel ak 7.62 x 39 ammunition in bulk new in box wpa military classic. 

2 500 round boxes of brass 7.62x39 very very rare after Russian ban. Steel ammo is easy to find but brass ak ammo is not at all easy to find. This is high quality full brass (bullet and casing) precision ammo I don't even want to sell so Im doing high priced like 250$ not even sure if I want to part with this.

Also not working at the moment so I'm firm on the price and not accepting any trades. This ad is for the package deal. I have separate ads for everything. I only do cash, face to face sales and require signing of a bill of sale.

Yes I have a CHL. Here's the list:

Rifle: DPMS AR-15 with 16"" Stainless Steel Barrel. Full length hand guard. Fixed stock. Standard AR sight system. The plastic carry case in the pic is included. It's a cheap one (Gun Guard Brand) but better than nothing.

Mags: 4 total. 2 metal, 2 polymer. 30 rounds each (All pre-loaded)

Scope: Bushnell Red T Dot/Green T Dot 1X32mm like new with a good battery. Model# AR730132

Ammo: All .223 Total count is a little over 1,520 rounds. 720 are steel core on stripper clips (72 total clips) in an ammo can. There is also pouches to carry the clips in the can. 560 of American Eagle black box. 80 of Winchester Razor Back. 40 of Winchester JHP. Also have an open box of Federal so hence the 1,520+.

So for $1,300 you get the rifle w/plastic case, 4 pre-loaded 30rd mags, Bushnell scope, 1,520 plus rounds of ammo, ammo can, stripper clips and pouches. Again price is firm, cash/face to face sale only and no trades. Thank you."

Yes the finish is worn, from most of the dealers and collectors I have shown it to, in order to get a proper feel for what I have, all said most likely due to wartime use. I'm doing what they told me to do is post it (show it) and say make offer, it is a perfectly functioning finish worn down due to use by the U.S. Army in 1944. It's a piece of WWII history, not just a perfectly functioning 1911 with finish worn down. Make offer, no low ballers I will ignore you and if needed shipping is extra to FFL of your choice."

The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

You can set to constant run, or specify a certain humidity level to maintain. You can also have it shutoff when it fills it's 70 pint tank up, or hook up drain hose to the back and let the internal pump drain it directly into whatever you want....even uphill. It's a wonderful unit that was a great investment for us....just don't need it anymore. Paid just under $300 including tax less than a year ago at Lowes.

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. Contrast or Night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous. Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol.

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. Contrast or Night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous. Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol.
