I am not interested in trades, with the exception of AK’s featuring combloc receivers and CHF, chrome lined barrels (cash to be added on either end depending on value of items being traded).

I am most interested in a face to face sale, which would take place in the southwestern suburbs.  Cash is the best form of payment.  Although I’m willing to ship, all associated costs would be on the buyers end, and I’d require either a USPS or Walmart money order before shipping to an FFL.

Although I am not requiring an FFL transfer for a face to face deal, I do reserve the right to use one if I see it as necessary.  In the event I ask for an FFL transfer, I would pay the full cost without increasing the purchase price (ie, I’ll foot the bill for it).  Having sold a few items through Armslist/GB, I’ve encountered situations where I’d feel more comfortable with an FFL performing a formal transfer.  It’s nothing personal, and very unlikely that I’d request this – after all, it will cost me money and time."

The shotgun is new, in box.  The shotgun comes with all original accessories.  I have never fired it, and have only installed the barrel once to test fit.  This is a great value in semi-automatic shotguns.  It's worth noting that the shotgun is pictured here in a plastic carry case, which will not come with it.  Rather, it will be packaged in the original cardboard box it came in.

I am not interested in trades, with the exception of AK’s featuring combloc receivers and CHF, chrome lined barrels (cash to be added on either end depending on value of items being traded).

I am most interested in a face to face sale, which would take place in the southwestern suburbs.  Cash is the best form of payment.  Although I’m willing to ship, all associated costs would be on the buyers end, and I’d require either a USPS or Walmart money order before shipping to an FFL.

Although I am not requiring an FFL transfer for a face to face deal, I do reserve the right to use one if I see it as necessary.  In the event I ask for an FFL transfer, I would pay the full cost without increasing the purchase price (ie, I’ll foot the bill for it).  Having sold a few items through Armslist/GB, I’ve encountered situations where I’d feel more comfortable with an FFL performing a formal transfer.  It’s nothing personal, and very unlikely that I’d request this – after all, it will cost me money and time."

However, it has never been loaded or fired (except for the factory round).  Everything that came it when I purchased it comes with it now: two (2) magazines, an eight (8) round and a seven (7) round, lock, soft case, field tool (if you need), assorted paperwork, and the ever so popular Ruger sticker.  I also have a Bianchi IWB leather holster that has never been worn and a Bulldog slip tension belt holster that has also never been worn.  I bought those for another 1911, but found a couple more suitable holsters so I am including these two with the SR1911.  Together they are about $60-80.  

I am not hunting for any trades and I do not need the money.  So if this doesn't sell for the asking price then it will go back in the safe.  I am not trying to be rude, but if I do not respond to an email it is because of a low offer trade, low offer price, or ship request.  The price is what it is.  

A bill of sale will need to be completed for both mine and the buyer's peace of mind.  MS residents only and proof of age/ residency (ID) will need to be shown.  The only way I will ship is from an FFL to another FFL at buyers expense.  However, after those costs it will just may be a little better for the buyer to purchase from their local FFL."

Refinished with Brownell's Aluma-Hyde II Coyote Brown because I wanted it to match something else.  Just as in my other ad (the Blackhawk Mossberg 500) this one also comes with the scabbard in the photos.  Yes you can carry the scabbard on your shoulder and mount it to a pack, but you can also mount it to many other things.  I do have an extra black stock that I will put it with this sale.

Will NOT fit RG14.This listing is for ONE Cylinder Pin. Buyers, however, may take any number of additional pins we may have at the same per-pin price and with no additional shipping charges. Here is the part most often lost from the good little RG14S Revolvers manufactured in Miami by RG Industries during the 1970s and 1980s. Manufacturer is one of our friendly local machine shop here in West Tennessee. Construction is entirely steel, with blued finish. It is designed to fit through the frame and cylinder of an RG14S revolver, and be retained by the cylinder’s internal detent spring, showing in one of our photos right through the center of the cylinder assembly. RG14S Revolvers were manufactured in the late 1970s until the late 1980s, when RG Industries shut down. These will NOT fit an RG14, the earlier models, because the older RG14 had threads on its pin, as the photos show. Any RG14S revolvers will be marked with the S on the left side of their frames, next to the left grip panel, as the photos show. No other RG parts or papers are included. Our pins are machined tighter than the originals. They require a bit more force to insert and remove, but they’re much less likely to fall out from recoil.

Flat Dark Earth (FDE)

PRODUCT DETAILS:
The Magpul STR (Storage/Type Restricted) is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M4 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. A storage-capable version of the CTR®, the STR has improved cheek weld and two water resistant battery tubes on a compact, reinforced polymer A-frame design. A shielded operation lever and supplemental friction locking system prevent accidental operation and minimize excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy.* The STR incorporates two integral sling loops, a reversible push-button QD sling mount, and a replaceable 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

FEATURES:
- Mounts on mil-spec sized carbine receiver extension tube (not included) from manufacturers such as Colt, Armalite, S&W, LMT, and others (please see the note below)
- Two water-resistant battery storage tubes located on the left and right sides of the stock
- Each tube will store up to two (2) CR123A lithium or AA batteries

SUMMARY: 
I'm selling my Magpul STR Carbine Stock made for Mil-Spec buffer tubes. It's still in excellent condition, having rarely been used, with all of it's original packaging and package contents. I purchased this stock because of its superior cheek weld and spare battery storage (for my weapon light and optic), and it met those requirements perfectly. The reason I'm selling it is because I'm modifying my current AR build into an SBR soon (pending application), and have decided to eliminate/replace several of my accessories (including this stock) in order to make a lighter rifle.

I am not currently an FFL holder, although that is in the works. I will not be able to keep your firearms overnight and all work done on ATF designated firearms will be same day turn around and pickup. Non firearm work can be completed same day, or if you would like to pick up at a later time that can work too.

here is a basic price breakdown for the hobby services that I provide:

I have a genuine military British Jungle Carbine No.5 Mk I. Even the barrel with the forearm removed has the flutes cut into the barrel at the base of the receiver like it should be. With the high demand for real WWII military rifles, real (not converted SMLE's) No.5 Mk I Jungle Carbines are getting harder to find.

Only the bolt is not matching, every thing else matches including the magazine which many times does not. Bolt locks up tight. Correct 800 meter sight for a No.5 Mk I. Stock is in nice shape with usual dings, but nothing major and the rubber on the buttstock is good too. 

There is still cosmoline in the action. The person I got it from years ago said he got it from Century Arms in the late 1990's when they imported a bunch but never shot it, nor have I shot it as I left the cosmoline there until I was ready to use it, which I never did.

It was made in July pf 1944 in Fazakerley, England according to the serial number. The left side of receiver electro-pencil markings from the factory are covered up by paint, however barely visible. This paint was typical of Century Arms imports as they tried to ""beautify"" military guns they imported by slapping on dark paint to darken bluing.

Any questions, please ask.

FTF in Allendale until July 8th, then will consider shipping CONUS with buyer paying shipping to FFL. 

Thanks."
