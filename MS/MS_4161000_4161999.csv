IVE HAD TONS OF PEOPLE INTERESTED BUT NOTHING SET IN STONE...
In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014.

I would honestly rate the exterior (paint & body) a strong 8.5-9 out of 10, the interior a strong 8-8.5 out of 10, This car has been sitting in a garage for several years and just needs a few minor things installed to make it a great and reliable (very fast) car. Car cranks right up and will make someone a very nice reliable and fast car at a fraction of the cost of a comparable car. Clean and clear TN title in hand and car recently passed the Marta inspection. Car was in a very minor and I do mean minor front end collision - its nice that the potential buyer can see the damage - see photos - previous buyer attempted to fix it himself but ran out of time, money and patience. I have most of the parts to complete the repairs. If you know anything about these cars you know they are bullet proof, reliable and fast compared to its competitors. Even though it's a 1993 model, it's in really good condition and would make someone a very nice car.

The Trijicon ACOG ECOS is the ultimate sight for both Close Quarter battle (CQB) situations and longer distance shooting where accuracy and pinpoint bullet placement are required. This dual-sighting system gives the shooter a distinct tactical advantage with the option of either the Trijicon ACOG or the RMR Sight. With the quick target acquisition of the RMR Sight or the precise aiming capabilities provided by the magnified 4 power Trijicon ACOG- the shooter has the ability to select the proper aiming solution for the situation at hand- truly the best of both worlds. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the ECOS also features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps.

The TA01-ECOS 4X32 Trijicon ACOG Scope mounted with the 4.0 MOA Trijicon RMR (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) Sight is the ultimate combination for both Close Quarter battle (CQB) situations and longer distance shooting where accuracy and pinpoint bullet placement are required. The unique combination provides shooters with the ability to select the proper aiming solution for the situation at hand--delivering pinpoint accuracy for distance shooting and quick target acquisition for close range situations. With its unique dark earth brown color, the TA01-ECOS scope offers concealment, directly contributing to the safety of the operator. Thanks to external windage and elevation adjusters no tools are needed for adjustments aiding in fast target acquisition. And, thanks to Trijicon's self-illuminated tritium lamp, the TA01-ECOS scope illuminates in any light conditions entirely without batteries. Both scope and sight are constructed of exceptionally durable, military grade aluminum housing and come with Trijicon's lifetime warranty. The TA01-ECOS Scope's Tritium Lamp is guaranteed to illuminate for a minimum of 15 years from date of manufacture.
TA01-ECOS 4X32 Trijicon ACOG Scope:
Calibrated for 0.223 M16/AR14 rifles, the ACOG (Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight) TA01-ECOS scope is an internally adjustable, compact telescopic sight with a tritium illuminated reticle pattern for use in low light or at night. The TA01-ECOS combines traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. Designed for use with the M16 family, each feature of the TA01-ECOS's mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions--without failure-prone batteries.

The TA01-ECOS delivers pinpoint accuracy out to 800 meters. During the daytime the scope features clear black crosshairs. A self-illuminated tritium lamp illuminates the reticle in amber at night without batteries. The scope protects the shooter by providing concealment with its dark earth brown coloration. The scope is further distinguished by its crystal-clear and distortion-free Broad Band Anti-Reflective Coated Lens and maximum eye-relief and large exit pupil for ease of use. Constructed of military-grade aluminum alloy, the scope is dry nitrogen filled, and waterproof to 100 feet/30 meters. The scope's metal structure and optical system are backed by a lifetime warranty and the tritium lamp is guaranteed to glow for 15 years.

Trijicon ACOG Scope Features:

Broad Band Anti-Reflective Coated Lenses: Multi-coated lenses provide superior clarity and light gathering capabilities with zero distortion.
Trijicon Tritium Phospor Lamp: Aiming reticle glows in low-light conditions for quick target acquisition--with no batteries to fail. Lamp is guaranteed to illuminate for up to 15 years.
Internally Adjustable: Since only the prism housing moves, the ACOG is much more rugged than conventional designs.
Longer Eye-Relief: Maximum eye-relief for larger caliber rifles and large exit pupil for faster target acquisition.
Military-Grade Aluminum Alloy Housing: Forged 7075-T6 aircraft aluminum alloy housing provides for a nearly indestructible sighting system.
Waterproof to 100 Feet/30 Meters: Dry nitrogen filled to eliminate fogging.
Totally Battery Free: Trijicon ACOG delivers increased hit potential in all lighting conditions--without the use of failure-prone batteries.

I have four magazines. This gun is currently brand new and unfired, with beautiful fit and finish. If this gun isn't bought soon, I'll be firing it, so the ""unfired"" part won't be true anymore.

The Lusa is designed to have ergonomics (and some parts) in common with the MP5, but using a more simple blowback operation (like the Uzi).

I bought this pistol planning to make a badass SBR, but I have decided to be a bit more moderate in my gun plans (just had my first daughter). Making an SBR would be a piece of cake: after the stamp, just attach a choate PDW stock, and presto.

Please excuse the stock photos, the first shows the gun as-is, the second shows the potential for SBR-ing (again, I do not have a stock, but you can easily get one--NFA rules apply), and the third is from some TV show (stock, silencer, scope, and Chloe Sevigny not included). I can post some actual pictures soon, but there isn't really any difference in appearance."

Description	
------------------------------
The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol(.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel). The magazine is also Zytel with round count ports.

You'll get the gun, two right-handed holsters (IWB and modular), two magazines, a .40 brass brush, four interchangeable backstraps for sizing, the original HK gun case, two mags full of hollow points, and a bag of about 50 or so FMJ rounds. 

The trigger pull is the LEM edition, which means once you chamber a round, you will feel only ONE trigger pull from the first round to the last - a long, medium weight (not sure the weight) trigger pull. You carry it with one in the pipe - the long trigger pull makes this the preferred method of carry for this weapon.

This gun is fully ambidextrous - slide release and mag release on both sides. The only controls on this gun are the slide release, the mag release, and the trigger. No safety, no decocker needed. Again - carry it just like you would a DAO revolver - one in the pipe, ready to go. It has a lighter pull than a DAO, but still enough to be safe with one in the pipe - making this gun very much a ""ready for action"" fighting weapon.

This gun has been cleaned after every range day, and never exposed to rain, saltwater, dirt, etc. It has approximately 6,000 rounds on it, and feeds and operates flawlessly (I have never experienced a misfeed. I shoot Winchester, Blazer and Georgia Arms reloads, and occasional other brands). The mag springs / internal springs are very strong, and the gun needs no servicing to my knowlege.

I'm selling this with my right-handed draw CrossBreed Ohai modular velcro-backed holster, which is ideal for carry in a Maxpedition or 5.11 tactical concealed carry bag, or installation in a vehicle compartment. I carry every day in a 5.11 tactical bag, and the holster works great, with a very easy draw and good retention. I have cut down the leather on the holster to enable full thumb engagement around the backstrap without getting your thumb jammed up on the holster.

I'm also selling a leather IWB holster that works reasonably well. I mostly use this holster when I need to throw the gun in the glove compartment or similar situations, but it works OK for IWB carry every now and again. 

The mags are a 12 round and a 10 round mag. 

I will only sell this gun to you if you are a CWP holder, military member or retiree, DoD clearance-holder, police officer or person of similar verifiable reputation, or can bring such a person along when you buy to vouch for your lawful and responsible character."

Circa 1897-98.It has a dove tailed front sight. A Win. collector told me that there's one similar to it in 38-55 cal. in John Madis's Winchester book, 1st edition on page 319. It has 22 inch oct. Bar and steel Cres. Butt plate. This was said to be a special order. Another Win. Collector emailed me saying that this gun could have been modified and marketed by Browning Bros. Odgen, Utah. since the top of the barrel is marked Browning Bros Co. He had never seen one marked like this. I would guess that there are very few 86s out there marked like this and in pretty nice condition. Short barreled configuration and Browning marked, "" NOT MANY AROUND "". I'm almost talking myself into buying it. I'm selling this gun for a friend who has had it stored away for many moons and now because of age and health is letting some things go. I just googled Browning Arms Co. and got a little history. In 1852 Jonathan Browning established his gunsmith shop in Ogden, Utah. Jonathan died in 1872 at which time his oldest son, John Moses Browning took over and along with his brothers formed Browning Bros.Co. in Ogden. They had both a gunsmith shop and a retail store.Any guns that they sold or customized contained their mark or as they say in the west their brand. Google Browning Arms Co. and read the whole history."

Pre Owned. Excellent Condition.
 
From LWRC's Website:
 
""The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.
 
The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.
 
The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each R.E.P.R. rifle comes with one barreled upper, but extra uppers are available in light contour  16.1” and heavy contour 20” configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications.
 
New for 2012, we are offering the 16” R.E.P.R. with a spiral fluted barrel. The spiral fluting shaves weight while relieving longitudinal stresses that can cause ‘stringing’ in barrels with conventional linear fluting.""

The barrel is the lite weight hunter barrel, fluted with muzzle brake.  I also upgraded the BCG to the stainless model, the grip to a Panther Grip, and the gas block to a PRI Mounts Picatinney Railed mount to match the heightened upper receiver rail.

Gun also comes with a 20 round PMAG.

If you want to shoot 308 out of this all you have to do is swap the barrel.  The 338 federal uses the same BCG, mags, upper and lower.  Gun has awesome stopping power and is an amazing hog gun.  Lots of factory rounds available as well as easy to reload.

This antique Lefever Arms Co. Model H Grade has a 410 conversion kit professionally fitted in the 12 gauge barrels by the previous owner and Lefever collector. Conversion kit worth $200 + by itself. The conversion can easily be removed and restored to its original condition. The barrels are made of Damascus steel and all metal pieces show a nice patina. Features Damascus steel barrels, flat matted rib with doll’s head extension, smooth hardwood pistol-grip style stock and forearm, 28” barrels, steel receiver with break open action (breech loaded), double triggers, front brass bead sights, thumb breech lever & safety, and the original Lefever Arms Company butt-plate. Overall length of 44 ½”. There are patent markings of 1872, 85, 86, & 87 on the underside of the receiver. SN on trigger guard of 44XXX would indicate a DOM year of 1902. Lefever’s are difficult to grade, due to their age and scarcity, however this has been professionally graded at 90%, which is a high grade for a gun this old as the steel patina, and wood are in excellent, almost pristine, condition.

This is the original kit where you use a rubber mallet to gently tap the bullet components together. I know it sounds dangerous, but I've loaded hundreds of rounds this way and have yet to set off a pined. This is the original method of creating cartridges that had been used for a very long time, before modern presses were invented. Get on the old school wagon!

You can load .45 Colt for less than $12 per box of 50! I was and it was fantastic fun, but my kids are taking up so much time now I have no time to load!

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014.
