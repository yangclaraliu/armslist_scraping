Smaller and lighter than other holographic weapon sights, the EOTech XPS2-0 is an ideal compact option for your weapon platform. The XPS2-0 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.
Comes with original box and manual I would trade for aimpoint micro.

The XPS2-0 runs on a single 123 battery, making it small enough to leave plenty of rail space for rear iron sights, magnifiers, and other tools (the shortened base requires 2.75 inches of rail space maximum). EOTech also eliminated the battery cap and latch and replaced them with a simple O-ring tethered cap, helping the sight achieve better sealing. Note that the XPS2 is not night vision compatible.

This sight is smaller than the former N-cell battery sight and runs on a single 123 battery. It also has a longer battery life than the N-cell style sights. Smaller, lighter and always fast with three reticle options. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights or NV mount.- Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length - Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space compared to the 4 inch N battery sights - Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved - Battery compartment is now separated from the base to allow it to hover over the delta ring of the rifle - Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 500-600 hours, 3X battery life of N cell sights - Reticle: 65 MOA circle with 1 MOA aiming dot."

I’m the original owner, selling it to focus on other projects.

Listen, those of you who feel the need to sell common AR-15 food that is NOT green tip 5.56X45 for twice what you paid for it should be ashamed of yourselves. You're the biggest part of the problem! If this does become law that the green tip ammo will be banned, there's still plenty of AR-15 food out there that will be legal. Everyone knows how frustrating it is to find a box of .22lr and now you're making the problem even bigger by pulling this crap and adding yet another caliber to the ""I can't find it"" list.. We all have one thing in common; the love and passion for firearms and it's up to US to stick together and see to it that the second amendment is not trampled on. I'm not in favor of banning the common green tip round but it is what it is and in the meantime, standard AR-15 food is NOT BANNED and as long as people are buying up what they can and selling it for ridiculous prices, the problem will only get worse. Come on, people. Don't hoard AR-15 food, don't sell it for twice what you paid for it, and DON'T be a part of the problem. #2A"

It is characterized by its distinctive design and outstanding performance ratio. But Duralyt offers more: uncompromising ruggedness and accuracy in optics and mechanics - the essentials for successful aiming and safe shooting. 

The sleek and compact Duralyt 2-8x42 provides bright images in twilight and allows for accurate shooting even over distances exceeding 200 m. It is as short as the Duralyt 1.2-5x36 and offers the optimum medium magnification range. This is why the Duralyt 2-8x42 is preferred by experienced hunters when hunting in difficult terrain. The extremely fine, daylight-capable illuminated dot of the reticle 60 can be activated when needed and impresses with its high light intensity. It can be continuously dimmed, making it ideal for any hunting situation. Its positioning in the second image plane ensures minimal subtension - only 0.8 cm at 100 m with 12x magnification. The progressive design of the Duralyt features a unique dark gray, anodized surface with deep black rubber operating elements to ensure that the scope blends well into natural surroundings. 

The Conquest Duralyt scopes are also nitrogen filled to remain water and fog proof for years of hard use and enjoyment. The distinctive design, durability and outstanding value of the Conquest Duralyt 2-8x42 Riflescope sets it apart in the premium segment. The model features the mechanical precision that you expect from Zeiss, large fields of view and image quality that is absolutely outstanding for this class.

I've fired somewhere between 80-100 rounds through this gun since I put it together but there's other things on my list taking priority over this gun right now and it's got to go.

It shot extremely accurate (<1/2'' 5 shot groups) for me loading the Matrix VLDs to an OAL of 3.43'' and pushing them with H50BMG. I could run them up to 3180FPS with RL33 but the accuracy wasn't quite as good (only 3 shots instead of 5). Didn't bother me for hunting though. I also used MagPro but it wasn't as accurate as either of the other two powders for me.

All together, I put $1900+ into this rifle and it was a fun project to put together. I knew going into the build I wouldn't recoup my money if I decided to sell, but hopefully I can get some of it back.

Multicoat 4

Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold® engineers developed Multicoat 4®, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You’ll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold’s Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.

Quantum Optical System

Leupold optical engineers and scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers have developed the optical system for Leupold’s newest riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System is a new way of thinking about optical system design and is a significant leap forward in performance. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout—the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max® design software and evaluation using Leupold’s Zygo® Interferometer to minimize wave front error and increase resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt—from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity—all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.


2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing

While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.


Dual Use
Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold® optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4® Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association – men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more – rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes. See overview of each product for more detailed information on hunting, shooting, and competition applications.

It's an excellent 1911, but not really what I wanted. I don't need a laser but do need an ambi safety. It comes with three mags and original box.

The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge with less than 300 rounds fired. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.

The P-32 has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

Comes with the really nice Springfield hard case and everything that originally came in it (two 7-round mags, brush, holster, manual). Absolutely beautiful gun -- the pics below were taken with a cheap camera phone and don't do justice to the fit/finish. Hate to sell but need $$$ to fund a new project.

""The Loaded .45ACP Stainless Steel is built on a full-size frame and slide. The pistol is made from stainless steel, which has a polished finish on the flat surfaces and bead-blasted matte finish on the rounded areas. The 5 inch barrel is match grade and made from stainless steel. The slide features slanted serrations on the front and rear. The mainspring housing is flat and includes the Springfield Armory® I.L.S.™ The pistol has a Lightweight Delta™ hammer and a beavertail grip safety, which features a raised memory pad for positive engagement. The extended ambidextrous thumb safety and long aluminum match-grade trigger are upgraded features that are standard to the Loaded Series. The rear target sight is fully adjustable for windage and elevation. The ejection port is lowered and flared, and the pistol is fitted with a two piece full length guide rod. Every Loaded model comes with a beautiful pair of cross-cannon emblazoned cocobolo grips that are held in place with Torx™ grip screws.""

Less than 200 rounds shot through it, then kept in the safe. Love the gun, but I never shoot it, so figured maybe it needs to find a home with a loving owner who would take it out for a walk at the range periodically. This is the IDEAL training gun if you have a S&W 686 with 4"" barrel as the weight is nearly identical and the smooth trigger is very, very similar. (Obviously, recoil is a different matter....)

The 617 is one of the finest .22LR handguns on the planet, and it will eat every type and kind of .22LR ammunition. Extremely accurate (more accurate than I am) especially in SA mode.

The gun will come in the original serial # matching box, with all manuals and the lock (teehee).

These are fairly hard to come by so act quickly!

Price is $750 firm; I'm in Katy area, but willing to travel between here and The Woodlands.

ANY FMJ 5.56 will penetrate the exact same 3.45mm steel plate at 200 yards. The M855  will do it out to 640 yards, due to a steel nose cone in the tip.That is the only difference. ALL 5.56 will penetrate soft armor and NONE will penetrate hard armor. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
M193 or other FMJ are just as good. Even better is OTM in either 69 or 77 grn . They are tail heavy and tumble and yaw on contact with soft tissue  yet still penetrate hard targets. I have used all of it in combat(2 tours ,infantry) and the M855 just punches small holes straight through. so unless you hit several in the vitals or the head , they don't go down. OTM is MUCH more effective.  5.56 ammo should be about $350 per 1,000 rounds . some is less depending on who makes it. Wolfe is only $220 per 1,000 but brass is better. OTM is about $475 per 1,000

The front objective is fitted with a laser filter and Signature Reduction Device. The 10m-1200m ranging reticule is illuminated by a rotary switch (11 levels plus Off). The standard weaver with cross-slots rail mount (Picatinny) attaches quickly to any MIL-STD-1913 receiver or base in seconds with a single torque-limited knob and provides all windage and elevation zeroing corrections. The sight retains zero when removed and reattached to the weapon. Rear and front lens covers flip down for storage and transportation.

SpecterM145™ has proven its effectiveness on a variety of high-powered rifles and machine guns, permitting tracer rounds and fall of shot to be clearly seen at extended ranges.""

It was made in the 2300 range of the 6000 rifles FN made for Luxembourg. The bore is good, with good, but dark, rifling. It should be a pretty good shooter. The gas system looks very good after I cleaned it very well, though a few spots of buildup remain (though it doesn't pose any problem since it has a stainless steel gas system). The finish on the bottom of the magazine and trigger guard is worn, from being slung over the shoulder when issued. The stock might have been refinished by a previous owner, though it is stamped matching under the woodline (including the handguards). There is a very thin crack at the front of the front handguard, it is very small, and will not be an issue.

I’ve shot it and carried it.  It works well.  It will hold 2” groups at 25 yards if you do your part.  The trigger has smoothed out with use.  I installed a fresh recoil spring and a fresh mainspring last month, and I’ve also included a yellow (DAK) mainspring if you want a bit lighter trigger pull on the double action shot (I tried it and went back to the OEM weight -- personal preference).  It will come with the original box and paperwork.  There is some honest wear from carrying it.

The gun has Hogue Extreme G10 grips installed, with their Piranha texture.  I’ll also throw in a set of SIG E2 grips and the tool to install those.  The E2 grips have been stippled.

I replaced the stock night sights with a set of orange Trijicon HDs: http://www.amazon.com/Trijicon-SIG-P225-Night-Sight/dp/B004W5D9NO.  The sights were installed in December.  

In addition to the three 15rd mags that came with the gun, there are: one extra OEM 15rd mag, three extra 18rd mags (Mec-Gar), and two extra OEM 20rd mags.  

There is a sight adjustment tool included.  It cost me $120, and the only reason I bought it was because it was worth it not to me not to have to send the pistol to a gunsmith.  I priced it at $50 for purposes of this package deal, but I can take it out and re-sell it elsewhere if you don’t want it."

With me away from home for work quite frequently, she's worried about the house's safety. So, she asked me to come to Armslist and see what we could find her. Unfortunately we don't have much of a budget, so we're looking for something affordable.

She is very familiar with firing handguns, but I carry mine on the road with me, so she's left rather empty handed when I'm gone.

She says she'd be most comfortable with a 9mm or .40 based on her experience.

We aren't picky, just please don't expect a great response on a $900 pistol, we have a lot of expenses to look forward to with the baby on the way.

First the rifle is a Mosin Nagant 91/30 round receiver dated 1939. The bolt, stock and barrel all have matching numbers. The chamber and barrel have ZERO rust or pitting. It is in excellent condition. The bolt is also in great  condition and ready to fire. I've owned the rifle since August 2014 and haven't had a single issue. 
I purchased the Archangel stock in October 2014 and it is in practically brand new condition. It comes with three magazines, two 5 round and one 10 round. The cheek rest and butt are adjustable and the pistol grip has a battery compartment. 
Also the rifle has upgraded front and rear sight MOJO Peep Sights which are great and easily adjustable. 

The trigger group has been replaced with a TIMNEY TRIGGER which has an adjustable trigger pull that you can change to your liking. It also has a trigger safety switch which is very convenient.
Lastly the rifle includes a TEXAS PRECISION muzzle break or flash suppressor which is very well made and is the best muzzle device on the market for the Mosin. It is held on by two gold Allen screws and it wraps around the sight so it is very solid. It actually reminds me of a .50 caliber rifle muzzle break. If you fire the rifle as the sun is going down, you will see fire balls shoot out the holes of the muzzle break which is pretty awesome.

Included with the rifle:
      - over 500 7.62x54 rounds for the Mosin Nagant
      - Bipod with barrel adapter 
      -  Three Magazines
     - Original Stock with bolts, barrel bands, trigger housing, bayonet

The day i bought it from him , this ""older "" gentleman said "" I shot it once , I liked it , but it kicked like a mule so I never shot it again"". 
Hahaha ... Sorry, he was a very honest & genuine ""older"" man. 
It still has that "" new smell"" when you charge the bolt. Those who know this platform, know exactly what I mean. For those who don't , it means its brand new or BARELY fired. 
It's immaculate , it's older = made well, extremely low round count, and it's ( or has /comes with) 100% factory parts.  
I've put 1-200 +/- rounds through it and not a hic-up. She runs flawless and accurate. 
I have both the A2 stock and the M4 mill spec. Original buffer tubes, springs,& buffers for both. One set up is rifle - the other Carbine. All parts are100%  factory original Bushmaster  and from that time period ( New old stock)
I have put on a few minor modifications that in no way are permanent. ( Have every single factory part aside in containers. 
I know I'm stressing it being all factory but it's cool to see it that way. 
Is this a pre ban ?  NO. 
Is it a collector piece ? No ( not yet anyway)
Is it worth thousands ? No
But.. It is a well built/ made rifle with the original look & feel. 
I'm in the firearm industry ( over 20 yrs)  so it's nice to see these around instead of all tacticooled ar's  everyday.  Don't get me wrong , SHTF , My BCM is my tool of trust and choice , but you have to have at least 1 like this.
