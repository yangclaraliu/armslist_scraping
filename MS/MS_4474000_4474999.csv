It is specifically designed to adequately cover a low profile gas block on a carbine or mid-length gas system barrel.

The MFR 12.0 has been engineered to provide each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability.  Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube.  In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rails is accomplished with little effort. This allows you to have rails anywhere you need them and nowhere you don’t. 

The slim profile feature of the MFR 12.0 keeps the  shooter’s support hand close to the bore which aids in firearm manipulation, and the design and construction allow for the attachment of picatinny rail sections at standard 90 degree or offset angles."

Bought it two weeks ago from a guy and not a big fan of it. If you've ever heard of Miroku, you know they make quality firearms.

Gun was made in the early 60's, so it definitely has carry wear.

**Gun ONLY fires efficiently in single action. Previous owner neglected to tell me this when he swore it ""fires anything, anywhere with no problems"". I'm not going to sell a gun without warning the next owner about the issues it has. Took it to the range and it seems like someone lightened the trigger too much and the DA only fires every third or fourth pull, but single action fires every round without problems.

From what I'm told it just needs a spring made for it since the first one was modified (Can't buy them anywhere because of the hybrid design) and it should function fine.

Aside from the DA problems, the gun is smooth like butter and a very good shooter despite it's age.

Asking 150 obo for it, because honestly I have NO idea what this thing is worth with shotty double action, so I'm just trying to get back what I paid for it. Also open to trades, I like anything that goes boom. 

Not in a huge rush to sell it, it looks pretty in my safe so if nobody is interested I'll just let it sit.

Our Urban Go package includes (2) AR500 Armor® Level III patent pending Advanced Shooters Cut 10” x 12” body armor plates. We put our survivalist mentality to work and came up with the essentials required for scenarios that require quick rifle threat protection, creating an armor system that is ready to go at a moment's notice. The Urban Go Carrier Package is ideal for home protection and emergency situations where rifle threat protection may be necessary. The open side design with a quick release buckles unfastened allows the Urban Go Plate Carrier to be quickly tossed over a single shoulder and worn over any existing gear or body armor. Front access shoulder mounted quick release buckles allow rapid removal compared to plate carriers that utilize a cummerbund. Fast into action, fast out of action. Due to a cummerbund-less design the Urban Go Carrier is not intended to be used with side body armor plates.

Carbine folds up and locks folded if you want to remove the uppper foregrip picitanny rail I installed, other wise if you leave it, it will fold up as seen in pictures, just not lock closed (wasn't a big concern for me as I'd rather have the reflex sight than the ability for it to lock closed). I have 2 flush fitting glock mags for it (1- 15rd, 1- 10rd) as well as a 30rd extended magazine. Bipod/handgrip and fitted pelican case are not included in original listing, though they can be if the offer is right. It makes a nice bug out or traveling gun as the 16'' overall folded length easily fits in a backback, or under/behind a vehicle seat. I'm open to trades (pistols, rifles, carbines, reloading equipment, military gear, optics, etc.) though I'd really like to trade for a Trijicon Acog or Taurus Raging Judge; I'll consider all serious offers, though low ball and under value trades will be ignored. Depending on the trade I can add cash on my end. I'm not in any hurry or bind to sell. There is nothing wrong with the carbine, it shoots great, is light, compact, and easily concealable. I bought it because at the time I had a glock .40 pistol and the interchangable ammo and magazines was nice, but I have traded the pistol and now would like something different.

OK guys and girls, this is a excellent condition USFA, Rodeo in 45 Colt.

1. I have mentioned that I have been the only one to fire this gun.

3. I have said this is a desirable USFA because it is NOT a gun that was built with parts from Uberti. (It was built in Hartford CT, in 2003.)

On July 3rd all across America, from small towns to big cities, WE THE PEOPLE will gather to protest and march against all that is wrong and?unjust in America! We will stand united and earn the right to celebrate the 4th of July as patriots. 

We will let our ""representatives"" know that we will no longer stand for the corruption. We wont stand for our military men and women being used not for the betterment of America but rather for the betterment of corporations that our politicians are in the pocket of. We won't accept the militarization of the police or allow Jade Helm 15 or Robin Sage. 

We cant let our prisons be used for profit, then allow prison unions to ""lobby"" our politicians to push for more new laws and harsher punishment, not because its whats just but because its what will make them more money. We need to end the war on drugs, its been proven not to work. And we shouldn't allow Americans to be given low wages by billion dollar companies causing employees to go on food stamps, paid for by other equally hard working Americans. 

Our students should have better access to higher education. We cant allow citizens to have their land taken by fracking companies who often end up polluting the entire towns water. Our government should push forward with new energy and look to get America out of the oil industry. We need to end the federal reserve. We need to end corruption and we need to end it now!

American politics are connected to the whole world and the root of all evil has spread throughout our system and in turn plagued the world. We can't let America continue down the road it's on. We don't do it for us, we do it for the future of our kids and theirs. .. On July 3rd we all stand together to make our voice heard. We are upset about many things but we will stand united!"

From the internet: 
A micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."

We are now disposing of our dad's estate and have a couple of guns to sell.  

This is a really nice P224 in 9mm.  It's the two-tone, with a nickel slide and controls.  It is also a DAK trigger action.  In 2013, these were fairly easy to find.  Today....they are impossible to get new and nearly so used.  Especially if you carry IWB, the height of the P224 makes it very easy to conceal.  It also will accept all P229 9mm mags (old and new.)  

This gun went to the range one time and fired 13 rounds.  It was cleaned, stored, and hasn't moved since.  There isn't even the beginning of a Sig barrel smiley yet (if you follow Sigs, you know what that is.)  It is the same as new.  

Our dad had a total of 5 12-round mags and 3 15-round mags for the gun.  Only one of the 12-round mags has ever been in the gun.  My brother sold his P224 late last year and still has 3 15-round mags and 2 12-round mags, all unused, that didn't sell with his gun.  So, I am selling this with a total of 7 12-round mags and 6 15-round mags.  

The price is $950 firm for everything.  If you do the math, you're not really buying the gun as much as you are stealing it but I just want it sold and done.  This is essentially a NIB P224 with 13 new mags (the mags are selling retail at about $50 per right now.)  I'm not interested in ANY trades or offers.  $950, cash only, and I don't want to split it up; you buy any of it, you buy all of it.  There's a lot of automated scam responses to Armslist ads; mention the gun by name and include your location.  Age 21+ and Indiana DL.  I'll leave this local for a few days and then move it to GunBroker."

She is used but still virtually brand new. Comes in original box with all papers. I don't really feel the need to describe this rifle because if you searched for it you know what you're looking for and why; you want one of the most ergonomic, deadly and accurate battle rifles known to mankind. It's as simple as that.

This particular piece has precisely 30 rounds downrange which were used to click in the windage and elevation to a perfect 0-400 battle zero. So, it's coming to you doped in straight out of the box, and still virtually brand-new I wouldn't recommend messing with the sights unless you're specifically calibrating for a particular load, or doping in a bullseye zero for a particular range. Right now it is battle sighted for M80 NATO ball ammo and will punch out a quarter coin hole from the bench at a hundred yards with a good rest and favorable (no-wind) conditions.

Comes with two mags, 10 round Springfield Armory and 20 round Checkmate Industries.

Armslist can be quite seedy at times with the liars and scammers. ""Proof of product"" pics can be supplied to confirm legitimacy, and I encourage you requesting as much in order to protect yourself and your funds.

I do not ship to ban states, even the ones where this one might be 'acceptable'. It's simply too dangerous and migraine-inducing nowadays.

A Smith & Wesson 22a pistol and a Mossberg 500 shotgun. The pistol comes with 3 mags, and are both reliable and well cared for. 

Shotgun is the ideal home defense and skeet shooting/hunting combo. This Mossberg 20 gauge has most of the performance of a 12 gauge, without the recoil. This gun can actually be shot comfortably with the Hogue pistol grip, versus 12 gauge shotgun's which are no fun to shoot with pistol grips. This package comes with the following:

Mossberg 500 shotgun, 20 gauge (5+1)
18.5 inch home defense barrel (which I ordered from Mossberg, less than 20 rounds through it)
Hogue pistol grip
28 inch barrel for hunting/skeet shooting
Mossberg shotgun stock in green/black Tiger stripe (can be returned to black only easily)
220 rounds of ammo (slug, buckshot, high brass, birdshot).
Shotgun scabbard with sling, fits both pistol grip and regular grip.

Both guns shoot well, and has been fun at the range. I will drive a reasonable distance to sell. Asking $475 obo for the Mossberg , $225for the 22a, I WILL SELL BOTH FOR $650 obo, or consider a trade plus cash.

I’m the second owner, bought off a guy who was building a gun for competition, but life issues forced him to back out before he really got started. Originally he had it pretty tricked out with a custom mag-well, etc. What’s left on it now are a custom stippled frame (awesome feel), a fiber optic front sight, extended takedown tabs and a nice Zev Tech extended/larger mag release. Now, I’m adjusting my collection to cover some recent purchases and I really like this one, but I just don’t shoot it as much as I should to justify keeping it.

The gun is in excellent condition. He had been shooting out of a different barrel, so the factory barrel didn’t get much use; maybe 100 rounds through it. Less than 400 rounds on the gun itself. Everything runs really well and that front fiber optic sight really pops in your sight line.

As for the stippling, all I can say is that if you have any trouble with a typical Glock grip being too big and bulky, you need to hold this gun. It’s slimmer and really nicely contoured to the hand. It may look like a Glock, but it definitely doesn’t feel like one. It’s a pleasure to shoot. If you’re not certain about the stippling, let’s meet up and you can feel it for yourself. 

This would be a great gun for home defense, or as a competition gun - some of your work is already done.

What you get:
•	Glock 35 Gen 3 .40S&W Pistol with fiber optic front sight, Zev Tech mag release
•	(2) Glock 14-Round Magazines
•	(1) Hard case with back straps, paperwork
•	(1) Original Mag Release
•	(1) Original Takedown lever

***SOLD*** Price is $450 firm. I’m not looking for any trades, just cash. Price goes back up after the holiday weekend. 

OPTIONAL: I have a KKM Precision 9mm conversion barrel (match) available for this gun too (NOT included in the price of the pistol) that you can add if you like. It’s stock length and has less than 100 rounds through it. I’m going to list it separately for $125, but if you buy it with the gun, you can have it for $100 for saving me a second trip. All you need are some G17 mags to convert the gun to 9mm (sorry, I don’t have any spare G17 mags available) – no replacement recoil spring is necessary. Here is a link to the listing for the barrel, with photos: http://www.armslist.com/posts/4474929/portland-oregon-gun-parts-for-sale--kkm-precision-9mm-conversion-barrel-for-glock-35

I am the first and only owner of this pistol.  It has around 500 rounds through it, and has been cleaned after every trip to the range and has been 100% reliable with XTPs, gold dots, and sig factory HP ammo, as well as m882.  It is incredibly accurate and is my current bedside firearm.  

The only reason why I am putting it up for sale/trade is because my wife is not able to shoot the DA at all and I want her to be able to shoot what is loaded in the house.  Because of this I have been looking for something else I shoot well and found that in the VP9.  May also be interested in a CZ EVO 3, plus cash on my end.  Other trade offers may be heard.
