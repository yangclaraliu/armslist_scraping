Picked it up off a guy and put this REALLY nice Boyds Thumbhole stock on it (which cost me $100 alone), which makes it extremely comfortable. I really can't say enough good things about Boyds stocks, they're gorgeous and very well made.

The previous owner had the receiver and stock painted over the original finish. At first I thought it was awfully ugly, but with the green Boyds stock it actually doesn't look too bad.

Gun shoots straight, is dead accurate and the scope is pretty nice.

Rifle, Boyds Stock, factory stock, one 10 round mag, and the 3-9x32 scope all come with the rifle, as well as the factory rear sight blade if you want to take the scope off and use the irons. 

Asking 200 FIRM for this. You can't get a better deal than that on a nice accurate .22 rifle anywhere.
