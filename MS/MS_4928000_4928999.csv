The gun was created out of the need to fulfill handguns to our troops and we were unable to maintain fast enough production of the 1911.I would rate this gun at 85%.At the end of WWII many surpluses arms were nickeled plated for their return home.

The Ruger Precision MSR rifle stock incorporates an adjustable comb and length of pull that can be changed easily, but locks down tight for immobility during firing. The stock also has QD sling attachments and a Picatinny rail for monopod attachments. The rifle itself uses an AR-style buffer system, so AR rifle stocks can be used in the place of the Ruger stock.

Reposting because I don't think anyone was reading the ad, so if you ask a question that's already here, I probably won't reply. Probably makes me an ass, but if you don't read the ad you're probably not serious about making a deal anyways.

I am selling my wood-stocked Ruger 10/22 Carbine that I bought new a few years ago. It is in good shape, and has only minor modifications, including sling mounts and a orange-painted front sight that could be removed with acetone if desired. I installed the Weaver rail that came with it, but I kept the filler screws for the receiver if you want to take it off. It includes the standard 10-round magazine. 

Everything works as it should. I probably only have a few hundred rounds through it, but it has been accurate and reliable.

Imported by Century Arms. No magazines are supplied. The rifle has three problems. I have money and tools but no time to fix it. First problem - the front trunnion needs replacement. Second problem - the bolt needs replacement. Third problem - one of the bolt rails needs replacement. I am the second owner of this rifle. I suspect it was not headspaced properly at the factory causing the bolt to open prematurely during firing. The locking lug of the bolt and one locking lug on the front trunnion was sheared off. The receiver, fire control group, stocks and barrel are in fine shape. If you replace the necessary items and headspace it correctly using a headspace gauge set, you will have a working rifle. Please note that you will be required to show your NM Drivers license and sign a bill of sale. Thanks for your time."

I'll get this out of the way first: it's not a cheap holster and I won't entertain low-ballers. No rush to sell so I don't mind leaving it sit out there to find the right buyer. I have a brand new Reign Tactical IWB holster (""Bora's Reign"" model) for the Glock 43 along with a mag holder. It's ""Arctic White"" with Carbon Fiber overlay. You can wear this either at the appendix, your side, your back, or anywhere in between! Retention is adjustable. New this was over $150 for the set and if you take a look at the pics you can see why. The level of craftsmanship in this cannot be found anywhere else. It just looks sweet! Definitely a show-piece and something you can be proud to own. I'm moving a different direction with my concealed carry so I no longer have a use for it. I'd rather make some of my money back than have it sit in a drawer. The gun of course is not included. I'm asking $100 firm for it. That's 1/3 off the original price for a brand new holster and matching mag holder. Go check their website out to find out more about them. Probably the best kydex holsters available. No trades, please. Will ship for additional $10. Thanks!"

These are manufactured in ULM, Germany and Proofed in ULM, Germany. This PP is absolutely beautiful, museum quality, with no imperfections and an amazing high polish deep bluing that only the Germans are capable of. In fact, I was hesitant to take it out of the wrapping and take the pictures. This is it Collectors. Last chance.  Feel free to contact me with any questions.Does not qualify for C&R.

It was my grandfathers and I am not really sure where he came about it, could of been his fathers for all I know.  Its in moderately fair condition for its age however the finish is rather worn, the bore is in very good condition, it looks like maybe it was carried alot more than it was shot.  Its been sitting in a closet for as long as Ive been alive and I have just acquired it and could use the money more than the rifle, although it is very pretty just dont need it.  It functions flawlessly and cycles extremely smooth. It wasnt something my grandfather used so there isnt much sentimental value to me either, just seeing what I can get out of it, I would like to get somewhere around 650 or so but I understand this is an odd piece to price so just shoot me an offer.  You can call or shoot me a text if you want more pics 615--557--8320, thanks Nathan.  Also Im in the Mount Juliet area and can meet and if this add is here the rifle is still available."

It was my grandfathers and I am not really sure where he came about it, could of been his fathers for all I know. Its in moderately fair condition for its age however the finish is rather worn, the bore is in very good condition, it looks like maybe it was carried alot more than it was shot. Its been sitting in a closet for as long as Ive been alive and I have just acquired it and could use the money more than the rifle, although it is very pretty just dont need it. It functions flawlessly and cycles extremely smooth. It wasnt something my grandfather used so there isnt much sentimental value to me either, just seeing what I can get out of it, I would like to get somewhere around 650 or so but I understand this is an odd piece to price so just shoot me an offer. You can call or shoot me a text if you want more pics 615--557--8320, thanks Nathan. Also Im in the Mount Juliet area and can meet and if this add is here the rifle is still available."
