These have adjustable rifle sights, metal trigger housing, and no MIM parts.

The springs are also a little more stout and they are handmade in a different part of the plant by folks who only assemble LE guns.

Remington doesn't do a run of these very often; the last time was 5 years ago (supposedly). They make them specifically for motorcycle cops-

The model number is 25047 if you would like to research it yourself; I don't know everything about them and this data might be a little off. That being said it's still an awesome gun and I'm not going to part with it for cheap.

This is worlds away from the Marine Magnum you say at Gander Mountain; those are built on a regular express. This is NIB, unfired, and with everything it originally came with (including sling).

This is a 9mm (9x19, Luger, Parabellum), semiautomatic, striker fired pistol which holds 10 rounds in the magazine (10+1) and has standard 3 dot sights. The pistol comes with three Wilson Combat marked factory magazines.

This model has been out of production for a few years; however, Wilson Combat does still offer new magazines, replacement parts and service if needed (which this pistol has not). It is small enough to fit comfortably in the waistband, but is large enough to shoot well and hold 11 rounds of 9mm. It has not given me any problems with ball ammo or hollow points ranging from 115 to 147 grains.

TRADE: I'm in the market for an FNH FN 9c, S&W Shield 9 or a Masterpiece Arms MPA930T.  A strait trade for one of those would work for me.

I can meet around Tallahassee on the surrounding area for a FtF transaction. For a FtF sale I can provide my FL ID and CWP and I ask that you do the same.

Transferring to any dealer is no problem.

Cash, money order, cashier's check, and paypal all work for me for payment, but I'm open to any other secure option. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

	Hey all, 
I have available for trade/sale a new/unfired AR rifle. This is a 16 inch stainless 1:8 barrel chambered in 223 Wylde (223 or 5.56) with the standard birdcage flash hider. This is an anderson Lower with a Anderson LPK. This model has no Forward asset or Dust Cover, so it is a bit more sleek and lighter than others. This will also come with a red/green dot sight (with custom little reticles), collapsible stock, single point sling ambi-adapter, single point sling, 30rd Windowed Magazine, 4 used Metal Surplus Magazines, rail covers as pictured, Free float quad rail. This would be a sweet little entry level AR for someone needing a good starter gun that will perform great for them and would serve as a great starting point for many upgrades!
	I would also consider trades for various items. Possibly Marlin Lever guns in 44, 357, etc. PLR-16, CMR30, AK47 under-folder, 30 carbines, Black Powder Revolvers, Redhawks, etc. Some trades will need boot on your end, some on mine. No 40s or 22s unless heavily in my favor. Honestly, just shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on this one. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting,

I paid $950 for it, and it's the Stainless Ruger 77/17. As some of you may know, Ruger ships their ""stainless"" rifles not as true stainless steel, but in their ""Target Grey"" finish. It's a matte coating, and as one who wanted a true stainless rifle, I talked with a gunsmith about changing the finish, then personally hand-polished the Target Grey away to reveal the beautiful stainless steel underneath. Gets me a lot of compliments at the range, as it's a unique rifle. 

I have carefully broken-in the barrel, and have fired only 250 shots (5 boxes) through it. It has the heavy barrel, laminated stock, and a target crowned muzzle (view-able in the pictures). I'm also including the original box, a soft Ruger case, two sets of scope rings (30mm intermediate rings, plus 1 inch standard rings), plus a box of ammo. I'm also including two Tipton one-piece carbon fiber cleaning rods (bought one at the small length and needed the larger one, so now I have two), plus patch holder and brush (I really never use brushes but it's yours if you want it). 

It's only 6 months old, and I'm selling it because I upgraded to a .223 Browning X-bolt, and my fiancee only wants me to keep one of them. Want it to go to a good home. Having paid $950 for it and carefully breaking it in, I'd like to get $650 for it. I will listen to strong offers outside of $650, but serious inquiries only."

Rifle is in great shape, especially considering it is 70+ years old. Numerous markings and proof marks, serial #'s appear to match. Believe it is a BSA. Wood and metal have aged well and have nice patina. Bolt action is smooth, shoots well, iron sights are surprisingly accurate, functioning safety. Passed gunsmith safety check. Mag doesn't feed rounds well when completely full (new mag may fix issue), headspace is out 8 thousandths (really common as this was part of the part design to allow for mud and grime), bore shows it's age but still in good serviceable shape. Features: Both sling swivels attached and functional, 10 round mag, has lugs to attach bayonet (no bayonet included), flip up peephole sight with marked ranges from 100-1300 yards, brass butt has swing oiler door. Will include Allen padded rifle case and an almost full box (18 rounds) of Remington 180 gr.I have received a fair amount of interest on this rifle. It is an awesome piece of history and it still works well. I am in no hurry to sell it, and would in fact rather trade for one of the firearms listed. If you have something not listed that is interesting and by a quality manufacturer I am all ears."

A pristine mirror bore and wood and metal that says that this rifle somehow avoided the war. It has a full and deep impressed MUM and no import marks along with the cleaning rod and dust cover. It is not all numbers matching as the bolt is different, but the rest looks like it was put away soon after being made. Be sure to ask for all 25 photos I will send as there is NO WAY to describe this without at least 20 good pics. It has the ears on the front site, so not the earliest type and to be honest, I am not very knowledgeable about these models as I have owned all Type 99s until now. The rifle is not perfect like unissued, not like that, but it definitely did not see any active service and the few flaws are very minor. There are some small areas where the metal is not smooth but it is like very small and isolated spots of some type of pitting. Not rust and not corrosion, just that the metal is not glossy smooth. It looks like a defect in the steel casting surface more than corrosion. It is only some tiny areas behind the rear site that are under a square inch total. The rear site is a 2400 meter ladder and the bluing on the barrel is just as nice or nicer than the receiver. The wood is superb as well with none of the usual Arisaka roughness from use and war. Smooth surface with minor dings mostly near the buttplate as the handguard is like new. It is matching wood to the rest so it was not added later and the stock is almost the same with little to no handling marks. Just a few marks that look like they are from storage with the great majority of the wood same as new with just age..no dings or marks at all. Even the buttplate is among the finest I have seen. The markings under the MUM are TYPE 38 and it is a series 26 (before the serial number) which makes this a late 1930s production and thus the Kokura Arsenal formerly Tokyo (changed in 1936). These were the last series from this arsenal. Overall, other than some age related markings there is no real visible wear to the exterior. The wood at the very front where it meets the nosecap has a .25 inch chip but from the aging and coloration, I would seriously think this dates back to the 1930s as well. The metal parts on the bottom that are almost always patina or heavily worn and corroded are a nice dark original color and original finish. As the bore is so nice, it must have been fired very little as well. Ships ground for $32 and packed properly. If you are in the Southeast and it is significantly less, I will lower it to match. Paypal OK if discrete and must add 3% (sorry, not for me) If you like the finest examples for your collection but dont want to pay museum prices, this is for you. Not like the typical Arisakas at all, this is something special you do not see often."

Anyways, the Ruger 22 is a 50th anniversary addition with ITAC model (has picitany rails, adjustable stock, foldable stock, etc). I bought a Nikon pro staff for it and it's great. It's a really nice setup and I have the receipts and boxes manuals etc for both the gun and scope.

It is a David Tubbs brand kit. Designed by the world class shooter himself and by far the best quality and reliability upgrades you can do for the platform.  
The kit includes:
(1) Extractor Spring
(1) Ejector Spring
(1) Hammer Spring
(1) Trigger Spring
(1) Buffer Spring (Flat Wound Spring)
(2) 30rd Magazine Springs (also Flat Wound springs) ie. The best design. 

Traditional or Factory springs that come in all AR's come with cheap quality (music wire) spring steel springs. There were many problems with the extractor springs breaking and causing the entire system to STOP WORKING AND JAM!  So there have been the little rubber ""Spring Buffers"" that have tried to remedy the problem by claiming even if the spring breaks the buffer will give enough buffer action from the elasticity of the rubber/plastic to keep it cycling, but this is hardly ever true.  In fact all of the springs are only supposed to be used for 2,000 to 2,500 rounds before they are supposed to be changed out! Obviously they often last longer than that in many cases but statistically one of them fail around 2,000 rds. usually it is the extractor or the buffer springs but any of them fail and the system fails completely. So David Tubbs found that using Chrome Silicone Steel is far superior in every way possible and usually surpases 25,000 rounds before failure!  And they are smoother in their travel, lending to smoother function. If you don't believe me do your homework, I did. And it was the best kit I found. The only reason I am selling this kit is it was my spare kit for my AR which I sold. So this kit is brand new and still in the plastic packaging! Never used or even installed. If you were going to do only one upgrade to your AR or M-16 this kit is definitely what I would do. Especially for the cost, there is nothing you can do that will benifit your rifle more than good springs. After all that is what causes the system to function. If you worry about your friend or family member serving in the military this kit is what I would buy and send them as fast as I could. The military is known for being cheap and trying to squeeze every last cent out of everything they buy. Personally I wouldn't want to wait for the springs in my defense rifle to fail, possibly in the middle of a battle before I changed them out. Ask any serviceman that's been in a firefight if they would want to change out any springs while bullets are flying. I can guarantee you the answer is a big NO. I would hope you would do your own research and check out David tubbs on YouTube or his website and you will quickly learn that this guy is very intelligent and knows springs, especially high quality firearm springs.
Email me a reply if you're interested, I paid $80 which included shipping for this set and I have this set for $50.  If you want to see pictures of my springs you can go to my ad on:

Lastly, if you've ever had Glock knuckle you'll appreciate the undercut trigger guard.  Just like Hickock45 did with his personal 27! It is much more comfortableand gives you a very secure grip. I also slightly rounded the extended mag release to take off the sharp corners and make more comfortable for carry.

This rifle with handloads has shot a .440 at 100 and i didn't tune the load at all. It was a book load for practice. I have the target to prove it. I also recently took a course and shot this gun very well out to 700. It will do 1000 if you want, no problem. 

Rifle has had the barrel cut to 21"", crowned and threaded with an APA Little Bastard muzzle brake installed. It was also cerakoted black. All work was done by Tier1 Defense in Mountainside, NJ (http://www.tieronedefense.com). It has roughly 400 rounds thru it. I love this gun but am adding another and need the room more than another gun.

Remington 700 action in a Shilen sleeve with a Shilen target triger, set to around 8 ounces (I don't have a scale).
6MM Benchrest Norma (aka 6BR) Rifle with a 22 inch 1 in 14 twist fluted barrel (I believe it's a Hart barrel). Unfortunately I don't know the round count. I have not personally shot it, because it has a very tight chamber and it requied the brass be neck turned (about a $50 tool is needed to do that).
Comes with a red thumbhole (laminate wood) target action stock and recoil pad.
Will include Forster dies, approx 300 pieces of brass and about 500 projectiles in 65 grain
I bought it from an estate sale with the intention of getting into benchrest shooting, then I took a new job and don't have time.

This gun is beyond amazing, very nice, nice finish. This is the Israeli model, which is much more requested because it is an overall better build than the USA made Desert Eagles. Meaning, you won't have any issues with attaching Trijicon sights or anything like with the USA made models. Does have the rail on top as seen in the pics and I am also including 80 rounds of hollow-tip ammo. Comes with the case, manual, and 1 magazine, possibly  2 magazines. I have one on order that has not come in yet. Magazines are not cheap. I am mainly looking for another high-end handgun such as an FN-57 which is a little more practical to use. This gun cost over $1,700, and the ammo is $1.45 per round. Please check your favorite websites to verify. Not looking for any other handguns. I will require some cash with the FN-57 trade, and for yall who keep priocing these FN-57's at $1400, please check out gtdist.com and you will find the 5.7 for $1,042. They stock them frequently. I would also consider big bore .50 beowulf AR's or Socoms. Just please value your trade at $1600, thats all I'm asking. My gun is priced at $1700, and you can do the math on ammo and mags, which is more than $1600. I don't want some offer of some fantasy valued item, because of what someone ""thinks"" the value should be. Let's keep it on the books at retail. Radical Firearms has those big bore rifles for $900 or so, so if you have one, add cash and we can talk. If your FN-57 has some extras that add-up to my Desert Eagle, we can talk.If you have a nice AR in 5.56 with an ACOG, I'll consider as well. Just let me know. Thanks for considering. Thank you!"

Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier.  This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment.ALL NFA RULES APPLY.

Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier.  This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment.ALL NFA RULES APPLY.

The wood on this gun is absolutely unreal. Really; it's as good or better than some of the top-of the line DT10's that I've seen and the oil rubbed finish makes the grain really stand out. I always put a coat of oil on the gun before I store it, so the stock looks wet in the picture; I assure you it looks stunning in person.
The gun has been shot; there is wear on the barrel latch and on the gold inlays on the underside of the receiver. One can get this touched up, but I just never have. 
Great balanced gun. It has the coveted and hard to find 30"" barrels and the greystone (gunmetal grey) receiver finish. I think this is one of the best looking shotguns Beretta ever came out with and MUCH classier than the newer iterations of the laser engraved ""spacegun"" looking competition shotguns they currently sell.
Metal is in 95-98% condition otherwise. Wood is 100% perfect. 
I've never carried it in the field, just skeet and sporting clays over the years. 
Nothing wrong with it at all, just inheriting a Kreighoff, so I no longer need this one. 
I don't even want to add up what I've got into this shotgun, I'm certain its north of $3500. I'm looking to sell for $2000 cash. Please, no trades. 
I am willing to ship to your FFL, I only ask that you cover shipping. 

I'm happy to send better pictures to those interested and if you're willing to drive a bit, I have a private range you can test the gun out. 

If interested, please provide your phone number and I'll call you."

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers.ALL NFA RULES APPLY.

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers.ALL NFA RULES APPLY. CHECK YOUR LOCAL LAWS AND WITH THE ATF BEFORE ORDERING THIS BARREL."
