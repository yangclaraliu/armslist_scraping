Up for sale is my 9mm P226 Tacops. It has the standard Tacops TFO front site and SIGLITE rear sight with some life left in them. Also has the short reset trigger and magwell grip. I'm not sure of the round count as I am not the first owner of this handgun. I have personally put about 300-400 rounds down range, and it functions flawlessly. It will come with 2 factory 20 rnd magazines, 2 Mecgar 20 rd magazines, and a Blackhawk Serpa holster. The lower has been duracoated in flat dark earth and the slide duracoated in black. After about two years of shooting and handling, you can see that some of the paint has chipped off, however, it does not affect the function. This handgun is not a beauty/safe queen but is always ready for combat!

The powerful and versatile SureFire X300 Ultra WeaponLight features a high-performance LED that generates 500 lumens of stunning white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The virtually indestructible and highly efficient LED generates tactical-level light more than enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof. The X300 Ultra is also versatile and can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock® system permits rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its integral ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation. Optional DG grip switches are available for use with a pistol, and an XT07 tape switch permits the X300 Ultra to be activated when attached to a long gun without altering your grip on your weapon.

It seems to be unfired except for factory firing from 1977 and as you can see in the pictures, has a very deep blue finish to it and crisp wood grips. This Colt Agent is very clean and when we bought it, the owner stated new in the box but we will grade it as mint condition as the box flap has been taped back on after being turn off. Saying that, it will be hard to find a Colt Agent with Shroud in better condition.  You will be very proud to own this hard to find Colt Agent 38SP with shroud and it will be one of the show pieces of your collection.  Free shipping or $25 off firearm at time of purchase if you like DCF Facebook page at DCF FB Page"

The receiver was made in late November, 1943, and was re-barreled during an arsenal rebuild sometime in the summer of 1945. Perhaps it came ashore during the invasion of Europe in June of 1944, or was carried across Holland and into the forests of Belgium.. 

The rifle is as I obtained it from CMP, although I did highlight the windage sight markings. (Can be removed easily with bore cleaner).  The stock has a very faint EMcF cartouche which, although not the correct cartouche for this serial number, is a WWII era stock. It also exhibits a ""RA-P"" stamping (Raritan Arsenal rebuild proof) on the bottom of the stock grip - likely where the 1945 rebuild occurred. It has a D35382 6 curved side op rod, with relief cut. The barrel readings are a TE of 2+, and a ME of 1+, which are very good. I have shot two clips (16 rounds) through this rifle and it shoots extremely well. 

Rifle comes in CMP hard case, with certificate, enbloc and armorer's hang tag.

Includes three screws and three brass inserts. Allows you to install a trigger guard without using a punch and roll pin. Simply press the screws into the 5/32 drilled out holes on the trigger guard and screw the t-10 torx screws in. Never worry about possibly breaking the trigger guard tabs on a lower again!  Plus this looks great and no messy dings to your new lower!  For $3.50 the ""insurance"" on a new lower is well worth the price!  Very simple to install with basic tools, a 5/32 drill bit(to enlarge the holes on the trigger guard itself) and a T-10 torx bit.

Currently it does not run. It's probably just as simple of a fix as cleaning or replacing the carburetor.  About 3 years ago a tire slowly went low. At the time I didn't need it so I didn't worry about it and I let it sit. Then the battery died... so about 6 months ago I decided I was going to get it up and running again. I bought a new battery, changed the spark plug, and changed the oil (I think, can't remember if I changed its oil or my kids 4wheeler's oil). I drained the tank and replaced with fresh gas. It turns over but won't fire. I assume its carburetor needs rebuilding/cleaning or replacing. I'm no mechanic and really don't need the fourwheeler. I'm tired of mowing around it as I don't have room for it in my building. The seat has now started cracking as well. Its been well used. The racks are bent up, and it's got its share of scratches but it ran like a top before I let it sit. Asking price is 800 bucks. Bring a reasonable offer and it's yours.

To be honest it's my favorite pistol but I'm not a collector and all it does is sit in my drawer so unfortunately it's time to find a better home for it.  This gun was originally purchased for home protection and I've owned it for over 20 years but haven't fired it much. It has Packmayer grips, 6"" VR BBL, and factory installed 'Partridge' sights. I apologize in advance for the poor pictures.  They don't do it justice and due to the high gloss finish it's hard to photograph. Add to that I used my cell phone camera and it looks worn but I assure you the finish is in absolutely PERFECT condition and it LOOKS BRAND NEW. This is an awesome pistol and will make a fine addition to any collection. It will fire 357/38 rounds.

Thanks for taking the time to read my ad and let me know if you have any questions.

Up for sale or trade is my 3rd Gen Glock 20. This is a NON-SF model. Super hard to find. Factory Glock night sights. This is an early 3rd Gen when they still did the true Tenifer finish. Nice. Comes with 2 15rd mags and factory case. Ill also include some very awesome ammo. Youll get 20 rounds of Ted Nugent 180gr, 20 rounds of Underwood 220gr cast lead/gas check (safe for Glock barrels) this is what I carry daily in a 45acp :). Also 100 rounds of Underwood 135gr jhp...these babies move at 1600fps and will piss off everyone at the range. Underwood's 135gr for 10mm is what the 10mm was meant to be, sorry .40 S(low)&W(eak) fans, your gun is the neutered version of mine :) 

By the way, Armslist no longer has a 10mm option in the 'caliber' drop down list. I guess this is a non existent caliber now on this site. Odd, I know Glock isn't making 10's anymore but there are plenty of others who still are...granted they are $1000 guns and up LOL! NOTHING beats a Glock!

If you know a little about SKS history, you'll know they are a pretty rare, and a desirable milsurp rifle. 

PROS: SKS has a very sharp, bright, chrome lined bore. I wouldn't be surprised if it had less than 400 rounds through it.  Numbers are all matching. Original metal is very clean with no pitting or rust anywhere. The iron sights are completely solid and has held zero perfect. For an SKS, it seems to be very accurate, I can manage a 1.25"" group at 50 yards. All internals function amazingly, and by no surprise, is an extremely reliable gun with zero failures.

CONS: The stock is beautiful and clean, but has been redone sometime in the past. Has little dings around the muzzle, (but none that is in contact with the bore\inner crown), wont effect accuracy. 

I have the original wood handguard, a handful of stripper clips, and a gun sock to put the rifle in.

The good: Barrel was stripped, primed, and painted a matte black, stock was stripped, polyurethaned, painted a matte gray with gun stock wax on top. Looks pretty good, seems durable. Gun functions perfectly one shell at a time, and seems to shoot pretty accurately.

The bad: When the tube is loaded there is a spring issue going on, sometimes it works, sometimes the bolt doesn't cycle far enough back causing the trigger to not reset, a FTE, or sometimes the bolt closing and firing again. As far as I can tell, it needs a new hammer spring.  All parts are present and in good shape, other than the spring. Basically the same parts as the JC Higgins model 25, and the High Standard A10x models.

Picture shows it equipped with 10/22 Firesights, but I will be putting the stock sights back on (negotiable on this). Price is $75 or best offer (and I do mean that). Be a great parts gun or a decent shooter after fixing the issue. Must pickup in Henderson. Email me or text REDACTED."

I know this is in the wrong place but I'm in a tight spot and need help. I went to clean my Shield before we left for vacation and as I was removing the recoil assembly from my Shield 9mm the spring retainer let loose shooting springs, rods, etc everywhere. I called S&W and they agreed to send me a new assembly but  it can't be here in time before we leave for our vacation tomorrow!

So if anyone has a 9mm Shield and would be willing to part with your guide rod/ recoil spring assembly until Sunday I would be very grateful and glad to pay you for the service. I'm a CCW holder and will leave you my information or if necessary collateral in the form of firearms or cash. Even if it's a scam, a quick call to S&W for a new assembly and you're way ahead (mine was free, the guy I spoke with said that they had had a few reports of the same thing happening to others). I have a backup pistol but please don't make me carry my Taurus 24/7 all week. My Shield is so much more comfortable, reliable and not to mention my custom holsters I would hate to leave at home.

If you could provide this assembly (S&W 9mm Shield) please call or text me at REDACTED.
Thank you very much!"

Purchased just under two years ago brand new in WI (receipt in photos), spent majority of it's life in the safe. Pristine finish, zero carbon deposits, always well cleaned, oiled and stored properly. Would take out once every few months and run a couple magazines through it, well under 1,000 round count. Just a fun gun that sits idle, would prefer to turn it into cash  instead.

5 inch barrel, Pro series upgraded trigger, grips, and sights. Thing is a tack driver and crazy easy & fun to shoot.
Fiber optic front and blacked out rear Novak Steel sights.
Core factory stippled extra grippy backstraps make this girl fit snugly within any sized hand. Comes with large and medium core backstraps, as well as large and medium regular M&P backstraps.
Comes with three 17 round magazines.
Comes with a  variety of professionally manufactured Kydex holsters from Forest City Tactical, seriously nice stuff, check em out. That's 2 OTB holsters, one with forward cant and one straight. 3 magazine pouches. 1 OTB custom ""race"" holster with heavy cutaways for maximum draw speed. All holsters come with regular loops for attaching to your belt, or malice clips for attaching to molle or pals webbing on your warbelt or plate carrier. They are for a lefty so hopefully you're a southpaw as well, or into that whole cross draw thing. I won't judge.

Of course ALL original packaging is accounted for, S&W blue case with all paper work, documents, cable lock, first fired casing still sealed, original sales receipt, even the barrel plug are still there. Like I said, she's a safe queen.

There is easily nearly a grand into this setup, flawless finish, everything accounted for, low round count, I challenge you to find a cleaner example of this pistol, or an ad with photos as extensive as this, what you see really is what you get.

The scope is a Mueller APV 4.5-14 mounted with Burris Signature Zee rings.  I also have a mount installed on the swivel stud allowing a bipod to be mounted using either the stud or picatinny mount.

I also have over 1000 rounds of 22lr ammo.  Some CCI Standard Velocity, some Federal, and some Aguila Interceptor.  I would be willing to negotiate a separate price on it."

This pistol comes in it's original case with two factory 12 round magazines and cleaning rod, I'm throwing in the trigger lock too.

This pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Both edges have been sharpened to a hair shaving edge; one of the nice attributes of the knife is that both edges are completely encased in the handle when closed. I do not have the box.

Colonel Rex Applegate, with over 40 years of knife design experience, is legendary in the world of hand-to-hand combat. The Applegate-Fairbairn family of knives rank as lasting symbols of the Colonel's dedication, expertise, and sense of purpose, earning international status as best-of-class amongst folding tactical knives. Based on the classic Applegate-Fairbairn fixed knife, the Combat Folder functions comparably to a full-sized fixed blade knife, with the versatility of a folder. The Gerber Applegate-Fairbairn Combat Folder, like all of our military products, is built in Portland, Oregon, USA.

With a 4-1/2 inch double bevel partially serrated blade, the Combat Folder is an elegant close-quarter conflict knife. Dual thumb studs are present for easy one-hand opening of the blade. Featuring a sturdy grooved handle, and etched with the Applegate and Fairbairn signatures on the blade's face, the Applegate-Fairbairn Combat Folder looks and feels as impressively balanced and sturdy as its name suggests.

To many of us, this the most prized variant of the Taurus Judge, the 3 inch chambered bright polished stainless with 3 inch barrel. Manufacturer is Forjas Taurus S.A. of Porto Alegre, Brazil. Importer and warrantor is Taurus International of Miami. Type is traditional double and single action revolver. Construction is all steel metal, bright polished stainless finish with matching hard chrome trigger and hammer, and steel internal parts. Barrel is 3 inches, with a six groove right hand 1:16 rifled bore that deliberately has shallow rifling. Sights are dovetailed, black steel housed red fiber optic front, with fixed notch frame integral rear sight. It has a .400 semi-target serrated spur hammer, matching stainless .400 smooth faced combat trigger, and beveled low profile serrated thumb latch. Cylinder is 3 3/8 inches long, and the revolver measures 10 inches overall. The nominal caliber, of course, is .45 Colt, and the bore is indeed rifled as required by the NFA Act of 1933. The forte of this revolver comes with its ability to chamber both 2 1/2 and 3 inch .410 gauge shotshells. From our experience, the big three US Made shells work flawlessly, Remington, Federal, and Winchester; while there have been some problems with extracting Italian, Czech and Turkish made shells. This revolver is 5 round capacity; 29 ounces empty with center of gravity at the front trigger guard junction. It has highly absorbent and pliable factory ribbed rubber grips, fixed notch frame integral rear sight with high-visibility high visibility fiber optic front sight that is encased in steel and dovetailed into the barrel. Safety features consist in the firing mechanism working with flat faced hammer against a floating firing pin like its S&W Governor offspring, and with a transfer bar that requires full depression of the trigger before the firing pin can contact a cartridge primer. It also has Taurus’s innovative hammer lock inconspicuously seated and furnished with two keys. Grips are pliable, recoil absorbent Taurus Ribber® type. Taurus factory number is 2-441039MAG. Each Judge comes in its original factory box with its wrapper, instruction manual, two keys, grip removal wrench, and statement of factory warranty. Replacement pricing on 3 inch chambered Judges usually exceeds $600 per unit in our area, and they aren’t easy to find, even at that.

In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rail sections is accomplished with little effort. This allows the shooter to customize the rail set up.  The DDM4v7 URG is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach to the barrel assembly. Daniel Defense complete upper receiver groups come complete with bolt carrier group and charging handle.

Up for grabs this time I have a Sig P229 9mm.  I'm the original owner of this pistol and I have put roughly 1500 rounds through it.  The pistol has been meticulously maintained (no smileys on the barrel, very little use wear on the finish).  It comes with bright night sights (2014), 2 15 rd 229-1 mags, 1 13rd MecGar antifriction mag, and alien gear IWB holster.  This has been my EDC for the better part of the last year.  I'm looking to fund many other things so as much as I don't want to, I'm going to let this one go to another good home.

I'm asking $700 (OBRO), plus shipping charges if shipped from my FFL to your FFL of choice, for the entire package.  I am located in Manchester, NH so if you're local and would rather do a FTF transfer, please have a current NH ID and pistol/revolver license and be ready to sign a bill of sale.

Hit Buy It 3 times and you’re buying 9, and so on. Winning buyers may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Here are 10 shot factory Smith & Wesson Magazines to fit the service size 99 series pistols, both the SW99 and the Walther 99s. These are, of course, the same magazine for the currently marketed Magnum Research MR Eagle Fast Action 915 pistols as well. These magazines Will Not Fit a Smith & Wesson MP9; Will Not Fit a Walther 88; Will Not fit a Model 59; will not fit the handle of an Ames Plumb 1977 ditch bank joe blade. They will only fit SW99, Walther 99 / 990, 990L, and Magnum Research MR Eagle Fast Action 915 full size service pistols chambered in 9mm caliber. These will fit the compact variants of those models but will protrude from the grip frame. These magazines were manufactured by Mec Gar for Smith & Wesson very recently, until S&W and Walther began their separation in late 2012. All of these are new condition never loaded or fired; and they bear the Smith & Wesson factory logo on their left body sides, and the words Made In Italy on the front side. Construction is entirely bright blue steel body and steel spring, with white polymer cartridge followers and black polymer S&W logo marked floorplates. Each magazine holds 10 rounds of 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. That is 5 fewer rounds than the current production Magnum Research MAGFA915 magazines, which we frequently stock also, just not as cheap as these are.

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****  In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitor’s. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.VP9 pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.  We currently have this firearm  in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $639 each.

Here is the direct descendant of the Colt Scout, the Rough Rider. Manufacturer and warrantor is Heritage Arms of Rockledge, Florida. Caliber is .22 short, long, and long rifle interchangeably. Cylinder capacity is 6 rounds. Barrel, cylinder, internal parts, .265 Spur Hammer and matching smooth faced trigger, are all steel. Ejector shroud, grip frame, and main frame are all zinc alloy or zamak. Grips are new condition Sile Italian Walnut for the Colt Scout, old stock from the 1970s that we found in an old Southern Warehouse, and that we have fitted to the Rough Rider. Metal finish is blue steel, with gloss black anodized finish to the alloy grip frame. Rough Rider finish is almost never perfect; after all, this is not a Colt, but a copy of the Colt. Type is Single Action only Western Style Revolver with half cock position and manually operated frame safety, mounted to the left of the hammer, that keeps the hammer face away from the floating firing pin. Barrel is 4 3/4 inch, .223 bore diameter with 1:16 right hand six groove rifling. This revolver Can Not be fitted with a magnum cylinder, because magnum capable revolvers require .224 bore diameter; besides, a magnum capable revolver Can Not be accurate with .22 LR ammunition. From 50 years’ experience with these revolvers, accuracy is quite good. Sights are welded classic blade front sight and frame integral fixed notch rear. Weight empty is 32 ounces, with center of gravity at the cylinder face. Trigger pull on the photo specimen gauged at 5 pounds with negligible felt creep, not bad at all for such an economical handgun. Each Rough Rider comes in its factory box with hang tag, instruction manual, fired brass case, factory catalog, parts list, gun lock, and factory registration card. Note that the target grips are oversized from the box’s foam lining, and the target grips often leave a hint of backstrap exposed. Own one of the tried and true Rough Rider Small Bore .22s, the one in the photos or one of its identical mates, for only $ 169.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of Massachusetts. We will include a California Compliant Cable Lock for buyers in that state. Any ammunition or personnel in our photos are Not included. $15 lower 48; $40 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority, insured with Delivery Confirmation.

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitor’s. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.VP9 pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $585 each.SPECIFICATIONS:Mfg Item Num: M700009-A5Category: FIREARMS – PISTOLSAction :Browning type, modified linkless locking systemCaliber :9mmBarrel Length :4.09″Capacity :10 + 1 (COMES WITH 2 10-ROUND MAGAZINES)Trigger :Striker FiredSafety :firing pin block, trigger latch safetyLength :7.34″Weight : 1.6 lbsTrigger Pull: 5.4 PoundsTrigger Travel: .24 inReturn Travel: .13 inFinish :BlueSIGHTS: 3 Dot, Radioactive Luminous"
