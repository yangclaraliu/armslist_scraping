This rifle is chambered in 5.56 nato. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. 


The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy.

This new “free standing” backpack allows for hands free transportation to and from the range. Our new “Handgunner Backpack” was designed to allow the avid Handgun shooter a way to transport his Handguns, 12 Extra Magazines, Ammo, Shooting Glasses, Ear Protection, Targets, Stapler, Tape, Binos, Shooting mats, Cleaning Supplies all in a compact Backpack. By utilizing our Visual ID Storage System we have designed separate pockets that store your most frequently used items for added protection and easy retrieval. The most unique feature is the inside Storage Cradle that slides in and out of the lower compartment. This foam cradle was designed to hold 4 medium to small size handguns in a VERTICAL format. This Vertical format allows for ease of use at the range and added protection from 360 degrees. This Cradle is made of high density foam and is cut with a CNC machine to cradle each pistol by its trigger guard. Just slide out the cradle at the range and keep all 4 pistols organized. After shooting, remove the cradle with the handguns inside for cleaning and then for storage in your gun safe. No need to open and close pistol cases or rugs each time you intend to use. The “Handgunner” backpack also features a waterproof pull out cover to help keep the contents dry in case of a sudden downpour. - See more at: http://www.goutdoorsproducts.com/products/the-handgunner-backpack/#sthash.lRzqPqbi.dpuf"

I have sold quite a few of these and this is the last duplicate in my collection and last one I plan to sell.  Sorry, no trades. Please check my other listings.

The buyer gave me $500 cash and $350 of it was in counterfeit 50's. The bank confirmed this. The buyer's driver's license seemed to check out.  He had a strange name and his middle name is Cochise.  He was born in 1978 as I remember, making him around 37 years old. He is a fairly tall - (5-10 to 6ft?), heavy-set black man. I think he drove a pickup truck.  I think he knows the bills are fake (has not responded) and he very well may have bought other guns with the fake money.  He also had real 20s and 5 dollar bills with the counterfeit 50s. 

Be on the alert because other buyers probably have the fake notes as well. If you have encountered this man or someone like him please let me know.  You may have some helpful clues to help find the thief. The police are working on it. Thanks for your help.

Excellent mechanics.  Had a professional action job and with the internals stoned and polished.  Smoothest Winchester clone I've ever felt.  Crisp, light trigger.  Brass receiver has a pleasing mustard patina.  Wood and metal have some scattered dings and scratches, mostly from being bumped in the safe.  Not perfect, but still a nice looking gun.  Never run in Cowboy Action Shooting, but would make an excellent gun for such.  For CAS, it is better than a new gun, given the action job and the nice patina on the brass.  Looks the part  already.

Excellent – LIKE NEW condition, no scratches or dings of any kind, could EASILY pass for a BRAND NEW GUN!! Purchased just at the end of October – only about 150 to 200 round through. A great gun but I need to sell it to raise funds for something else I am upgrading to. Also comes with 3 exchangeable back straps, 5” a nice full size pistol, VERY smooth 4-4.5 # Omega trigger. The gun has a very cool and unique feature as it can be switched back and forth from decocker to regular safety.

MSRP on this gun is $530 + tax. Lowest Internet deals are about $80 less, but by the time you pay for shipping, CC charges FFL transfer fees, you are in it for well over $500.

This ammo retails for $22 per box. 

Barnes TAC-XPD ammunition is optimized for carry and home defense use. Loaded with the popular Barnes TAC-XP bullet it is designed to deliver top performance when it matters the most. The TAC-XP's all-copper construction and very large, deep hollow-point cavity expand, penetrate and perform more consistently than any personal defense product on the market. Performance through bare gel, light and heavy clothing, car doors, plywood and automotive windshield glass is unmatched by the competition. TAC-XP bullets are 100% copper, making them safe for the environment. These lighter all copper bullets also result in less felt recoil in comparison to lead core bullets allowing the shooter to recover quickly without sacrificing terminal performance. Barnes specially engineered each load using low flash powders to produce almost no muzzle flash, ideal for low-light situations. Distinctive Techni-Crom plated shells feed smoothly from the magazine for reliability shooters can depend on every time. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

The stock is the adjustable style seen in the stock photo. It has a shell holder on the right side of the stock (making it user-unfriendly with my left-handed wife). The for end is different from the photo; it has three mounting locations for flashlights, lasers, whatever you’d like to mount, and no hand strap on this model. There is a long Picatinny rail on the bottom and short rail on the left and right side.
This shotgun is the latest one from Mossberg. It has never been fired, and only out of the box twice. You will need to clean the factory grease before firing it.

I’m in St. Louis, South City. I prefer to do a FTF trade. I’m looking for a S&W model 60 with a 3” barrel and full or angled underlug. Might consider others…maybe."

Barrel Length: 23 2/3” Sights / Optics: Both barrels are equipped with an orange fiber optic beaded blade. The rear sights are “U” notched leaves with two fiber optic dots adjustable for elevation and windage, screwed to the barrel. Stock Configuration & Condition: The two piece pistol grip checkered walnut stocks feature a two piece forend and a fluted butt stock with a Monte Carlo comb. No marks are visible on the stocks. The LOP measures 14 ½” from the front of the trigger to the back of the solid rubber recoil pad which is in Excellent condition. The stocks are in Excellent condition. Type of Finish: Matte Blue Finish Originality: Factory Original Bore Condition: On one side of the rifle, the barrels have some surface rust spots. The other side looks ""out of the box."" Overall Condition: This rifle appears to have never been used. The only marks are the surface rust spots on one side. Overall, this rifle rates in about Excellent condition. Mechanics: Per my research, this is a muzzle loading rifle with two barrels which swivel around a central pivot. Each barrel has its own percussion cap nipple. After the first barrel is fired, the hammer is moved to half cock and the barrels are rotated 180 degrees, where the second barrel locks into position. The hammer locks securely into half cock and full cock and will not fall from half cock. As I stated, this rifle looks to be brand new and never been fired. As with all previously owned firearms, a thorough cleaning may be necessary to meet your maintenance standards. Box, Paperwork & Accessories: An alloy ram rod with a brass fouling jag is installed. Per my research: During the muzzle loading era, repeating arms were an elusive technological development. Until Colt’s Patterson Revolver in 1836 and Henry’s Repeating Rifle revolving barrel assemblies were the answer. The pepperbox pistols became common during the percussion era, but revolving barrels were used on rifles as well. This Pedersoli version of the Swivel Barrel percussion rifle is just plain neat. It is a .50 caliber cap and ball rifle with two 23 2/3” barrels. After the first barrel is fired, the hammer is put into half cock and the barrels rotated 180 degrees, locking the second barrel into position. This rifle is equipped with modern, adjustable fiber optic dot sights. The barrels rotate and lock securely into position. Made with Pedersoli quality, the Swivel Barrel .50 caliber percussion rifle is in Excellent condition. Cash. Local sale only."

-----------------------------------------------
It’s got a stainless finish, an 18.5″ barrel, and a synthetic stock. But anyone familiar with the standard 10/22 will quickly notice a few key features that set this rifle apart from the usual.

The first and most distinctive feature of this 10/22 is the rear sight/scope rail combo. Most 10/22 rifles have open sights with both the front and rear mounted to the barrel. They’re quick, but not very good for precision and only adjustable for elevation. “Target” versions of the 10/22 have no sights at all, but come with a rail for mounting optics. There are some nice aftermarket adjustable aperture sights that mount to the 10/22 receiver, but most of them take up the space where the scope rail goes, so they have to be removed in order to use optics. The contest winning 10/22 offers the best of both worlds by using a picatinny rail with an integrated fully adjustable rear aperture sight. It’s complimented by a military style front sight blade protected by ears on either side.

Another stand-out feature of the design contest 10/22 is the adjustable stock, which was borrowed from the Ruger American rimfire bolt action rifles. The rear of the stock can be used with different “stock modules”; essentially, pieces that change the length of pull and the comb height. The rifle comes with one short and one tall stock piece for use with iron sights and optics respectively. The importance of a good cheek weld is often underestimated, so it’s encouraging to see a company getting on board with helping customers get the most out of their rifles when using optics.

One aspect of the new 10/22 that might confuse some people is the flash hider. Why would you want a flash hider on a .22 rifle? It’s a valid question, but according to Gary, the key is not to think of it as a flash hider, but as a “mud guard”. Apparently it’s a common problem for rookie shooters in Appleseed clinics to accidentally dip their muzzles into the ground when practicing the prone position. This can lead to dangerous barrel obstructions, or even more tragic, unsightly scratches and dings on the muzzle. From Ruger’s perspective, the flash hider is a great addition because it’s an easy way to make sure that potential customers notice the barrel is threaded… potential customers like me who are going to immediately toss that flash hider aside and throw a suppressor on there.

NO NEED TO ASK....I do not have any other pictures at this time.

I am offering my like new COLT AR-15 (VERY LOW round count through it)
It is chambered in 5.56/.223 with a 1/9 twist
It is in immaculate condition and has a mere 350 rounds of JHP brass cased (mostly 5.56) ammo shot through it...that's it.
I am also including a like brand new, barely used VORTEX Strikefire II Red Dot sight with it, as well as a cheap MidwayUSA, soft zippered case for it.

Since this state sucks, for legal and honest firearm owners, I can only sell it with Maryland compliant TEN ROUND P-MAG magazines. I will include TWO of them. 

I have the original box, lock, and owner manual for the rifle, and I also have the box and owner manual for the red dot sight as well. Never seen damp weather, never been outside of the house unless it was in an enclosed case. Stored in humidity controlled safe.

With absolutely no exception whatsoever, I will only sell to a buyer who:

A. Provides a current Maryland Driver License that will be either copied via a printer, or photographed for my records, and...

B. Buyer who agrees to sign a Bill Of Sale that will also serve as an affidavit of your being 100% legal to own a firearm in this state.

Buyer will be given a copy of both items as well...as I said, there will be zero exception to those two stipulations. 

Any out of state buyer would have to prepay, and the rifle would ship from my FFL to your FFL...ZERO EXCEPTIONS to that.

I am in MIDDLE RIVER, MARYLAND (zip code 21220), and will meet buyer face to face, in this area...again, no exceptions, period. 

PRICE IS FIRM....I WILL ACCEPT CASH ONLY

$1,000 CASH ONLY for COLT AR, Vortex Red Dot, and 2 ten round PMAGS, or...

$850 CASH ONLY for COLT AR ONLY....

If that's too much, or you can get it cheaper, or whatever, then I kindly suggest you buying elsewhere. 

I will not accept ONE PENNY LESS than either pricing option, so please do not waste your or my time trying to haggle a lower price. The price is clear. The price is firm...And once again, I WILL ACCEPT CASH ONLY....No checks, No money orders, No PayPal, No trades....I bought it with cash, and am selling it for cash....

This is a great little ar pistol that is a blast to shoot! Literally, large fireballs! Like I said it only has 90 flawless rounds run through it. This cost me right around $1100.00 to build. 

$950 with red dot and mount 
$800 without red dot and mount 

Prefer chl and you MUST be 21 since this is a pistol!

The pistol has never been shot. With it, 2 Bravo Concealment OWB holsters, and a mag carrier from G-Code. One of the Bravo Concealment holsters is for the P30 with a TLR-1 HL weapon light. I have the light too for the right price. I'm asking $850 or best reasonable offer for all of it. Asking price gets you the TLR-1 HL 600 lumen weapon light and some ammo. Lower price I will concider keeping some of the extras if your not interested in them. I am not desperate but I am motivated so don't be afraid to throw me a number. Worst I can do is say no but will probably counter or just accept. Thanks for looking. Have a great day!"
