Kalashnikov AK made in Russia by Izhmash. The Saiga's are arguably the highest quality of the Kalashnikov models and are no longer being imported. You commonly find them in 12ga, 308, 7.62x39, the 2 rarest calibers are the 20ga and the .410. This is a good chance to round out your Saiga collection with the hard to find 410!
Great fun gun to shoot, accurate as hell (I shoot clay skeets with this 410) it'll throw rounds down range as fast as you can pull the trigger! 

There have been a few nice upgrades to this gun (all original take-off parts will also be included) 
* A Tri-Picatinny raised rail (see through to preserve iron bead sight use) top cover for optics, lights, laser, etc.
* A CNC Demon Doorbuster (or skull crusher depending on how you use it) Flash Hider / Muzzle Brake
* Tapco Intrafuse 6 position tactical adjustable stock with pistol grip
* 2x 4 round factory magazines
*1x 15 round stick magazine
*1x 30 round drum magazine
* Red fiber optic front bead sight
* Bunch of Russian 410 magnum rounds (not sure how many off the top of my head, but I think it's like 4-5 boxes), plus I'll throw in a few other buck / shot rounds mix

ALL Original take off parts will also be included:
*Original (non-pic rail) top
*Original Muzzle Brake
*Original Monte Carlo Stock

This is a very fun and reliable combat shotgun. Load it up with 000 Buck shot and you got 5 40cal balls rolling down range with every pull, load up that 30 round drum and that's a hell of a lot of lead flying down range in a hurry!

This is a smooth bore rifle so it will shoot all types of 410 shot rounds. bird and game shot, slugs, buckshot, it eats it all!
Low round count, gun is in great like new condition!
This Saiga has been upgraded but has not been converted so it can be easily brought back to it's original imported configuration or converted with the available kit.

Cash is king but will consider trades of equal or greater value, can add cash or ammo or possibly even other guns for right trade.

remington This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds. Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in our legendary Model 870 Wingmaster, but at a much more affordable price. Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and either a wood stock and fore-end or black synthetic stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America's favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun's superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870 has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years.

This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds. Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in our legendary Model 870 Wingmaster®, but at a much more affordable price.

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years"

The ""SKIMMER"" Enhanced Carry Trigger System gives your Glock the performance of a stock 1911. Manufactured using 100% OEM parts, all of the metal components are individually hand polished to a mirror finish for consistent, reliable action. The mated metal surfaces glide freely across each other, adding a smooth short transition into a predictable wall. The trigger break is crisp and clean, reducing muzzle movement. This is made possible by our unique pre-travel reduction modification, which is non-adjustable. Multiple inspection points are part of the production process. This system is completely drop-in with no fitting required.

Brand New!!

The Arthemis Supreme is suitable for ladies, youths or indeed most adult shooters as this particular model is of standard dimensions and not intended for smaller youths.

Construction is based upon a design typical of guns from the Brescia region of Italy, featuring two large hardened steel trunnions set into the receiver’s front inner side walls upon which the barrels hinge for opening and closing. A full-width locking bolt is set into the bottom of the standing breech face and this engages with a locking wedge recess machined into the monobloc breech below the bottom barrel; a conventional top lever operates the bolt. This arrangement is well established as being sound, efficient and reliable and Turkish maker Khan has adopted the system well.

Barrels are built using the monobloc method, the breech block sides nicely jewel-finished, and chambers bored for 3-inch cartridges. The two tubes are joined by ventilated side ribs for lighter weight, improved balance and heat dispersion; they have been polished before being well blacked. A brass front sight is also fitted.

It is a Kreiger 22"" heavy contour barrel custom chambered in Grendel to allow the 123 Amax to be mag length with properly head spaced bolt .  It has a JP adjustable gas block tuned to the amax load going 2580fps.  It has rifle length system and a free float handguard that is very solid.  Barrel just scoped after 450 rnds through and smith could see no wear - looked as new.  It comes complete with standard charging handle and colt and carrier.  This is a top end, cut rifled barrel with .932 gas block Note while the bolt and upper are set up for a forward assist, I did not install one but put an aftermarket plug in spot where it would go as no real need for it.  You can easily ad one if you want one.  Also do not have the dust cover installed but will be happy to ship that along as well.  Comes with one mag - either a 5 round or a 10 of your choice.  Extremely accurate (1/4 moa or better).  The upper does not include scope or mount at price listed but might be willing to add for additional $.  Great hunting upper that you can just pop onto your lower and roll.  Painted in alumahyde FDE.  A really good setup for a more than fair price considering how much better a barrel is on this than you will find on most complete uppers.  REDACTED  note armslist made me select a manufacturer this is a scratch build.  feel free to contact for additional pics/questions"

I paid $1100 + tax for this when it was new about a year ago. I probably put about 500 rounds through it with zero issue using cmc, kimber and some gi mags.

It's got a medium solid nighthawk trigger and is otherwise stock as it was new. It has been carried a little bit and shows some holster wear. It will come with everything that was included when I bought it in the spring of 2014

I'm thinking $925 OBO is a good place to start but, if you think that's not fair shoot me an offer, I won't be offended.

Brief rundown:
Rifle was built by a military friend and no expense was spared. Matched Anderson upper and lower. 16"" barrel (carbine length). Aluminum quad rail. 6 position a frame stock. Tuned muzzle break. Every part was polished and fit including the trigger. Snaps at about 9 lbs and is buttery smooth. Gun was then outfitted with all the goodies. 120 lumen torch with tail cap switch. Also have pressure switch. Full size fully adjustable GREEN laser ( can be seen at distance day or night). Have it sighted at 50 meters. Battery assist devise for releasing the bolt. 4x32 illuminated reticle (red blue green) scope with chevron reticle and bdc out to 600 meter. Zeroed at 100meters. Full magwell funnel. 45 degree flip up back up iron sights (aluminum) zeroed at 50 meters. Single point sling attachment. Three point sling swivels. Single double nylon sling with aluminum hardware. Forward grip pod with sleeve for pressure switch. Molded pistol grip handle. Switch for laser is protected and enclosed in sleeve. Extended charging handle. Easy to reach under scope. Can also put torch switch in sleeve. Ladder rails to cover exposed rail (no sharp edges). Intrafuse 30 round polymer mags with mag pulls. Every part has been fitted and tuned. Gun is dead on accurate. I can assure you, you would be hard pressed to find a more reliable, better built, more accurate rifle. Certainly not off an assembly line. Attached are pics. Also, forgot to mention, scope is on a 1/2"" raised rearward bridge to improve eye relief and shooting posture. Also has an extended charging handle. Gun will handle both 5.56 and .223. I have shot both and both are equally accurate in this gun. With that being said, the bdc (bullet drop compensation) is mapped for 55gr. .223 rounds. It does well with that load. It is slightly off,  approx 1/2 to 3/4 inch at 100 meters using the heavier and hotter 5.56 round. Just an FYI. Again, thanks for your consideration. 

Looking for any reasonable offer. Please don't lowball me. I know what I have in it and what it is capable of. Thanks for your time. I am in no hurry, nor do I have to sell. Just testing the water. Email is best, I'll reply ASAP. 

Note: only trade considered would be for 4X4 ATV or Side by side UTV. Again, thank you."

 If you are hunting for a lightweight bow, the Mini Max is your answer. The Mini Max is just a little over 3 lbs and equipped with the legendary S-2 Cam.

The ultra lightweight and short length of the Mini Max makes it ideal when using tree stands or ground blind hunting. This short sweet bow is accurate and consistent. Don't let the lightweight of the Mini Max fool you, it's a true force to be reckoned with.

 S-2 Cam - The High Performance S-2 Cam is a smooth drawing, highly efficient solo cam. The heart of the S-2 Cam is the flexible adjustment of the draw length and let-off. The adjustments are made with a simple turn of an allen wrench, with no bow press needed. Adjustable let-off 65-80%.

 Bow is 60-70 Pound Draw and 27-30 inch draw length.

I sold the VP40, so I no longer have a use for it. Asking $20.95. It's a George Holster, he (they?) makes good, functional, and affordable stuff. Other good and affordable mag carriers are out there, but they often space the magazines too far apart for anyone who is used to a traditional OWB mag carrier (like police officers use). Your muscle memory has a hard time unlearning that distance and spacing. Great work and selection and I'll be a returning customer (TP9SA/P99 is next, I assume PPQ M1, beretta 92, or cz 75 will do) Getting back to the item, this carrier works for both the VP9 and VP40 (magazines are the same size) as well as P30. As you can see, it holds two magazines. I would like to think two spares is adequate (though I would definitely carry 2 quickly accessible spares from experience), plus you have pockets (just takes longer, would NOT recommend that as you're primary spare carrier. Try to do a quick combat mag change that way. Oh, with someone shooting at you, adrenaline spiked, motor skills reduced...). Whether from me or another, I definitely recommend George Holster gear. Nothing fancy, but functional, durable, and affordable and great customer service, very personable. Support the enterprising new smaller businesses. Please make offers of what you are aiming to pay, rather than less than lowballs so I'll meet you where you are aiming for. If you take the whole setup-up, magazines (like new) normally $50 each and the carrier, that'd be $120, but I'll do it for $100.

All metal parts are matching.  Bore is strong and bright still.  Still has some straw colors showing and don't appear to be refinished.  I'd rate the finish in the 90% or slightly better range.  The only mismatched parts are the wood grip panels and the wood base repro magazine.

The 5.5 degree angle of view is ideal for short and mid-range engagements where maintaining situational awareness is essential to mission success.This configuration of the Digisight features a shuttered eyecup and low profile design, allowing an operator to maintain covert posture in hostile environments. For surveillance, terrain navigation, and general observation an external power supply can be used instead of batteries and an external remote control duplicates activation functions like IR illuminator and reticle inversion.

This riflescope uses a highly sensitive CCD array (with a range of operation illumination 0.00001 to 30000 lux) the image transmitted to the high resolution display OLED (640 x 480 pixels) is contrasting, crisp, and saturated. Thanks to the OLED display, this riflescope can be used within a wide temperature range from -4 to 122F (-20 to 50C) .The PL76312 Riflescope is a multifunctional device that features several essential options for modern hunting, which includes screen display information on operation status (running time, low battery indicator, active function etc.). The menu has additional functions for image settings: gradual brightness and contrast adjustment, and SumLight signal processing program. The SumLight program automatically increases CCD array sensitivity under low light conditions. The riflescope can be zeroed not only in the traditional manner but also using the new one shot zeroing method. This makes the zeroing procedure significantly faster and more convenient.This riflescope is equipped with a built-in laser / IR illuminator (780nm wavelength, safety class 1), which considerably increases viewing range. The weaver rail at the side of the body allows an auxiliary IR flashlight to be attached. The basic control functions (switching On / Off the riflescope and the IR illuminator, activation of digital zoom) can be performed with the help of the included wireless remote control. It also features a video output to conduct video recording to external devices without the use of additional adapters and camera or camcorders. If necessary, output video signal standard can be changed from PAL to NTSC.This riflescope has 1 pre-loaded reticle, but the user can also upload another optional reticle from a reticle base available on the PULSAR website (downloadable). The color of the reticle point can be switched from red to green. The riflescope is resistant to bright light exposure. It can be mounted on a wide range of hunting weapons including those of large calibers (shock resistance is guaranteed if cartridges with muzzle velocity not exceeding 6,000 J are used).This riflescope operates on 4 rechargeable batteries but can also be powered with an external power supply. External power supplies such as EPS3 or EPS5 (sold separately) prolong the operation time of the riflescope to up to 9 to 20 hours. The IR laser illuminator in this riflescope is fully compliant with US FDA Class 1 laser eye safety requirements.Specifications:- Generation: Digital - Magnification: From 4.5 to 6.75x - Objective Lens: 50mm, F/1.0 - Field of View: At 100 m Distance: 5 on 4.5x / 3.25 on 7x - Eye Relief: 67mm - Exit Pupil: 6mm - Detection Range: Maximum: 1968.5' (600 m) 1 - Diopter Adjustment Eyepiece: - 5 to + 3 D - Resolution: Pixel (H x V): 752 x 582 Lines/mm: 55 Display: 640 x 480 VGA - Characteristics: Type of CCD array: ICX659AL - Output Video Format: PAL / NTSC - Viewing Size: Diagonal: 0.31"" (7.88 mm) - Operating Voltage: 6 V (included 4 AA rechargeable batteries) - External Power Supply: 9 to 15 VDC / 3 W - Protection Class: IP code (IEC 60529): IP44 - Operation Time: 4 / 3.5 2 - Dimensions: 13.38 x 3.74 x 3.70"" (340.00 x 95.00 x 94.00 mm) - Weight: 2.20 lb (1 kg) Note: You may see, in certain circumstances, a slightly grainy, non-uniform pattern when the IR illuminator is activated.

Rifle has a pretty cool design. Barrel, receiver, and two mags fit inside of the stock, which is water proof and floats. It can be put together and be ready to fire in under 45 seconds.


Not a scratch on this gun, and it's actually pretty fun to shoot. I keep buying .22's and then remember that I really don't like .22's!

Sometime last night/early this morning (nov.7) my truck was broken into and someone stole some stuff, including a shotgun that I had taken to the range earlier this week and forgot to remove. This happened on the eastern side of Norman.

Its a Norinco 1897 trench gun (see pics)

I know, I know. That's what I get for leaving a gun in my vehicle. I typically don't.

Anyways, I've had some great interactions with people here on Armslist, and I'd like to ask anyone who sees this ad to please keep their eyes peeled for this gun at upcoming gun shows and the like. I've already filed a police report so it should be in NICS.

Serial number 00472, and there is a very noticeable crack in the stock right behind the receiver (see pics)

If you see it, please call the police and report it. I'll offer a cash reward if anyone does spot it (losing the money/gun isn't the worst part. I'd like to see who did this thrown in jail for a long time!)

Thank you for reading the ad, and happy shooting to everyone out there!"

FS/FT,"North, Houston, Texas","$ 1,850","Listed On: Saturday, November 7, 2015",Rifles,CZ USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Bolt Action,Pistol,"Here I have my fully customized CZ Scorpion. First of all let me say, i AM NOT IN A RUSH TO SELL OR TRADE. Please, please do not come at me with ridiculous cash offers or trades that get their value from some fantasy place and not the real world. Everything that I have and have added has real world value. I was going to turn this into an SBR but may go in a different direction if the price or trade is right. Now let me get into the details. First of course, is the CZ Scorpion. Highly sought after pistol. This comes with the original box, manual, bore snake, & sight adjustment tool. I have added two 30-round magazines, with the magazine coupler on them. If you know anything about the CZ Scorpion, you know that when you shoot it out the box, the safety lever digs into your trigger/index finger. Not mine. I have also added the upgraded ""Safety Delete"" on the right side, which elimates the tail of the factory safety so you will not have ANY issues while shooting with this add-on. I have also added a custom aftermarket blued compentsator to replace the original compensator. The difference is beyond noticable. This  is custom made for the Scorpion and threads directly on to the factory barrel and locks in place. No adapter or anything needed. I have a small subcompact iProtec q-series green laser. Very very bright, and it is sighted in to about 10 yards. Very accurate and holds zero. Wherever you put the green dot, at 10 yards, there is the hole. For the lighting, I have a Cree T6 LED 1,000 Lumen Tactical Flashlight. Very bright, very nice light.On the top rails I have an EOTech XPS2 holographic sight, with the CZ stock iron sights as well. The EOTech is also sighted in at about 10 yards and it speaks for itself. Small and compact enough for this Scorpion and compliments it very well. Now, serious inquires only. I have over $1,800 into this firearm. Not including the time put into some of the customizations that if you wanted to do yourself or have done would probably cost another $200 or so. I love this gun, I am in no rush to sell or take crazy offers. I am only testing the waters and the things I would consider would be Big Bore AR's such as a .458 Socom or Beowulf. Grendal, etc. Radical Firearms has those AR's for $799 - $1,019 Complete. So some cash would be expected. Please value your trade or offer for what I have. Please, I know my guns & accessories, please just save time with the nonsense. I would also consider a large caliber pistol, such as a Desert Eagle .50AE Mark XIX or an FN-57 plus a bit of cash. Also possibly multiple AR's, good quality. DPMS, Bushmaster, etc. A high-end AR with nice upgrades, such as a geissele trigger and etc. I am not interested in any AR Pistols. I will also throw in about 300 rounds of ammo as well. Please, serious inquiries only. Thanks!"

957,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4840957,For Sale:  Superb! 1886/89 Steyr Kropatschek Colonial Rifle + Bayonet --Finest Cond.,"Davie--Central, Broward, South Florida",$ 645,"Listed On: Saturday, November 7, 2015",Antique,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,38 S&W Special                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"Do not pass over this listing for the price, until you read below as you are bidding on a superb + extremely rare example. YOU MUST see pics, ask and I will send many. For the collector and shooter who appreciates the unusual models + the finest examples available, this is for you. This is NOT an average Kropatschek rifle and NOT in average condition. Easily one of the finest condition Krops I have seen and a variant not often seen. Not rare like everyone puts in every listing, but rare as in ""find another Colonial model at all, and if so, one in this condition with an original bayonet"". In fact, look at any other rifles listed + check the condition carefully, then add a bayonet. Most others are in a far lower condition and even the better looking ones may have worse hiding below as you can see corrosion at the wood/metal line on many. One other thing, the bore on this 130 year old rifle is superb! This is the most complete numbers matching Krop as well since every part except the bolt matches and no Krop I have ever seen has a matching bolt. The bolt itself is all original and matching as every part of the bolt is the same number which is very hard to find after more than a century of use, repairs, importing + resale. This is the finest Kropatschek I have owned (out of 5) and the ONLY Colonial rifle that I have seen in person. Ive only seen 3 or 4 others for sale in 30 years. The carbines are the rarest type with only 4000 made over 130 years ago but a true Colonial model seems to be rarer as I have seen more carbines. These are the four types of Kropatscheks described in Rifles of the World: The artilery carbine, the short rifle, the long rifle and the ""colonial"" (the long rifle with a hand guard added to aid in controlling convection currents of the hot barrel in the tropics!). I have a group photo of all types if anyone is interested. The last Colonial model I saw for sale was in the UK and sold for $1100 recently also with a bayonet. (I have the listing as it was last month) This version is a regular infantry rifle, that went through a modest factory conversion in 1889 for tropical climates where heat was a problem. Though all Krops were originally made for Portugal, there were some groups that were sent to other nations a few years later. This rifle has beautiful original bluing on the receiver, and it is complete + without blemishes or scratches. Considering many rifles this age no longer have actual bluing, but a patina or faded away blue, this is superb + definitely the best + finest receiver I have seen anywhere or in photos. The barrel is in similar condition, it has original bluing with all metal surfaces shiny-smooth with fading/mottling only in the last inch or so towards the muzzle (See photos). This is from 1000s of times they were standing at attention for inspection with their hands on the barrel ends and nose caps. A good part of the barrel was protected by the handguard of this model, so it remains superbly blued beneath. The rear sight is the other difference from most other Krops and it is a combination multi-sight that underwent a modification in the late 1880s when smokeless powder took over. Super cool engineering for the 1880s, as all Krop sights have several ""ranges"", one standard, one when you flip it forward like some Carcanos and then a sliding part for long distances (up to 2200 meters on this model!) While I have seen one shot well at 1000 yards, 2200 is just crazy, but back then, they still used volley fire, where lines of soldiers would face off + fire at each other, many times at long distances. The other rear sight I have seen on some rifles was graduated to 2000 meters and from what I can find, and not 100% verified, when smokeless powder became popular, many had different sights installed when returned to the armory as the ballistics were different and the range longer. The Colonials should all have the 2200 meter sight + the handguard. The wood has clear and nice cartouche stampings + there are all manner of proof marks and stamps and numbers in the metal as well as the wood. The wood has handling and use marks but FAR less than most others and the wood is pretty darn smooth and extra-fine along the sides and bottom with the buttstock having more dings. The original cartouches are clear on both sides as are the serial numbers. The serial numbers on every small part all match the receiver, stock and barrel with only the bolt being different as mentioned above. This bolt action is known as the slickest of all military surplus rifles, as Steyr used skilled craftsmen with a lot of hand labor to make these. The bolt slides on tight rails and the action and cartridge lifter works like new. If you have never racked a bolt on a KAR88, or of course, a Kropatschek, it is amazing for an age before technology and power tools as they are ALL that nice. Just a solid + slick feeling you can feel, not describe and similar to the difference between a Mossberg 30-06 (nice) and a 700BDL 30-06 from the 1960s...not even close. Theres a tube magazine beneath the barrel and unlike the Vetterlis that used an elevator moving up and down, these used a ""spoon"" that arced up and down from the rear. Same as the Mauser 1871/84 which added Mr. Kropatschek's tube magazine + lifter to the Mauser 1871 to create Germany's 1ST repeating rifle. Only working the bolt and feeling these rifles can you appreciate how well they were made. By the way, the bore is beyond excellent. Since these used black powder cartridges, that is amazing as my Vetterlis and others from the era are usually corroded. The Portugese used this model in service from the 1880s until 1964!! which means these were racked and handled and cleaned and inspected regularly for over 80 years and explains the wear from hands on certain areas and also, a good reason why the bores are so nice. Ammo is available as I found a place that loads both black powder and smokeless rounds in 8x60 Krop though it has been a while since I contacted them. Original ammo turns up and unlike French ammo which are duds and hangfires, I have seen every report say 100% firing. This Colonial model includes a bayonet and scabbard and the bayonet has NEVER BEEN SHARPENED! It has its issued edge. Of course the number does not match the rifle as there is no way they would remain together through 80 years of service, importing and over 50 years floating around the surplus market. Most Kropatscheks remain in Portugal and they are also collected heavily in Europe and I had many inquiries and bids from South Africa and Australia for my others I sold. Besides the receiver and barrel, the other metal parts that were handled regularly have more wear...the triggerguard and bottom part where a hand would be, have patina rather than bluing. The barrel bands are better and of course, all have proof marks. The nose-cap at the end of the rifle is faded more than the rest as this and the barrel end is where they were handled the most during training, inspection and every day they were in use. I imagine there were 1000s of times a soldiers hand was on the muzzle end. The original rod is present as it is a part of the system that holds the rifle together. I removed the handguard CAREFULLY (if you crack or break it, there is close to ZERO chance of replacing it) and the wear marks from the clamps are clearly original. This rifle has had the magazine tube cleaned and the spring and follower are pristine. This is important as many have been ruined trying to improperly remove the tube and you do NOT want to crimp, crush or break this part. (there is a youtube video on making a tool to remove) This one is ready to go. The lifter and action is in a closed metal box that is possible to disassemble, but difficult. As this one has deep and dark bluing with ZERO corrosion, and all looks beautiful including screw heads that appear to have never been touched, I left it alone. This rifle looks even better below the wood than above it and you usually find the opposite. The barrel under the wood is like new, with deep glossy bluing and the action housing looks like it was made recently it is so nice. Many old rifles hide all of the corrosion and damage under there, but this old girl looks even better undressed...try that on a lady over 100 years old. This one is not a wall hanger if you choose to shoot it, as it has a perfect bore and functions perfectly. These were built to last, at a time when Steyr craftsmen built rifles and not a CNC machine. The bolt is beautiful with all appropriate crown proofs and the stock is serial number matched to the rifle. This one has something I have not seen, a small brass tag attached to the front barrel band with the number 19 engraved. This may be a rack number, unit number or something only on Colonial models as I have never seen one. Not sure about that part and no references I can find. I have over 30 photos of every angle, and the metal under the wood as well as the other parts and the bayonet. If interested, I will send more. This is an antique and needs no FFL. It is a longer and heavier package with the bayonet (or short sword as it is an 18 inch blade)and will ship ground for $38 if not local. If you want a regular shooter, in decent shape but well worn, there are plain rifles for less, though not that much less, and a carbine or other colonial will be more. If you like the less common models and the finer examples in your collection, this is about as good as it gets. Even a so-so condition carbine is usually priced higher than this one, but for the collector who wants something special, do not pass this up, as you will NOT see another one like it again. PLUS A BAYONET!! MUST SEE PICS!! These are nothing"
