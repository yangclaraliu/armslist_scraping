Upper is an ESS with a Nickel Boron BCG and an M4 profile 1/7 twist 16"" barrel from SAA. It has the standard grip and birdcage flash hider. I have put exactly 180 rounds through it without any failures or issues.

I added the Carbine length aluminium quad rail and the detachable Carry handle with milspec sight and scope rail mount. I also added a rear end plate with sling point.

This AR trade package includes everything shown in the photos. The Rifle, 6 Mags, 340 Rounds total, Detachable Carry Handle Sight with scope rail mount, Flip up rear sight, 12 Rail Covers, Cheap Vertical Fore-grip, Universal Combo AR Wrench, Extra heavy duty ejector ring, Cabelas .223/5.56 cleaning kit.

6 mags, 3 are Pmag 3 are Metal GI  310 Rounds PMC Bronze .223 55gr FMJ BT, 30 Rounds Xtac Green Tip 5.56 62gr in the banded Pmag.

I am more interested in a trade than a sale and figure about $800 is the trade value number for the package. Cash works too I suppose.

Some people are AR people and some are AK people. I really tried to prefer the AR like a good American but I just cant do it.

I would like to trade this AR package for an equivilent AK package. I would prefer a folding stock model, Under folders are good. I would also like an equivilent amount of accessories and ammo but this can be negotiated.

An AK with folder package is what I am pretty much looking for here but other options would be considered. I could use a good semi-auto 30-06 like a Remington 740/742 Woodsmaster though they sell used for around 400-450 so we would need to work out the imbalance. Multi Gun trades are a possibility.

Not really looking for handguns at this time. 

Open to other Possibilities so feel free to toss an idea out there but please do not be offended if I am not interested in your firearm related item.

Not interested in trading for Ex-wives, Herb, 72 Pintos or non-firearm related materials. I will not Ship this Rifle. I will not accept a cashiers check for 5000 to cash and wire 4000 to Nigeria. Really just want to trade for firearm related items only."

Quality Ar15, Shadow Ops lower, hogue grip, strike industries muzzle brake. Magpul sights. Comes with quality knock-off eotech and 3x magnifier. Works well, just not up to same specs as a real one. Will throw in some mag repair kits or ammo with full price offer. Call or text Jesse at REDACTED for more info. Asking $1,000 ideally because that's a lot less than i paid, but am reasonable if you don't think it's worth that; but I think it's a fair asking price for this set up. I really just need the cash or wouldn't sell it and I need $1000, so I would be willing to add some more ammo or kits also if necessary. Just want a fair sale asap. Ammo I have is ZQI SS109 steel core. I've never even shot this rifle, previous owner and builder shot it but very little. Great condition except some marks on the front bottom of rail where I got a bravo company foregrip stuck and it marred it. (Hence why I have the folding foregrip instead)

Its distinctive opened-ended Ball Bearing Lock' exposes the knife's inner workings for easy cleaning and rates as one of Spyderco's highest strength locking mechanisms. Pulling back on the ball unlocks the blade ambidextrously from either side of the knife. The hand settles on the curved handle positioning the index finger into a choil that optimizes control and generates less fatigue and pressure on the hand during cutting. Made from VG-10, the blade has a hollow-ground edge with a weight reducing swedge-grind extending mid-spine to the tip. It is available PlainEdged.

FACTORY NEW. Daniel Defense M4V11 Milspec+ Cerakote The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.  This rifle is finished in Mil Spec+™ Cerakote™.MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

Although designed with the entry-level pistol shooter in mind, it is also ideal for training and can be adapted to the needs of experienced users. Its modular construction makes it easy to modify with a variety of options and accessories, while still being affordable both as a base pistol and as a fully-accessorized system.Cool, Futuristic DesignEven while designed a plinking pistol to be used for informal shooting, Beretta did not cut corners. The lines of the Neos bear the unmistakable flavor or renown Italian designer Giugiaro - the same mind behind several of their most attractive offerings. The result is a sleek and ergonomic rimfire pistol that feels as good in the hands as it pleases the eyes.Fully-Modular ConstructionThe Neos is constructed of five modular parts that may be easily disassembled and reassembled without any tools. The ergonomic grips are constructed of super-durable fiberglass-reinforced technopolymer with non-slip inserts for a comfortable and warm hold. The barrel is available either in the classic Beretta blue finish, or in stainless steel (Inox), to satisfy the tastes of every shooter. Most of these elements may be replaced with the rich assortment of accessories that is available for this fun .22 semiauto.High PerformanceReliable, durable, easy to maintain and remarkably accurate, the Neos features an integral rail that accepts Weaver-style scope mounts as well as a fully-adjustable target rear sight. The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack, 10-round stainless steel magazine features an easy-grip knob that allows you to compress the spring from outside, thereby making loading extremely quick and easy. The ambidextrous manual safety can be engaged with the firing pin cocked or uncocked. If you are in the market for a superbly-engineered plinking or practice pistol, give the Neos a close look - it won't fail to surpass your expectations.FeaturesAdjustable Target SightThis fun training and plinking pistol offers users of all experience levels the ability to adjust the sights quickly and easily.Weaver Accessory RailEasily accessorize this pistol thanks to the built-in Weaver accessory rail, which can accommodate sighting devices and much more.Ambidextrous SafetyTrain and shoot with both hands thanks to the ambidextrous safety on the Neos.Tool-Free Disassembly WheelTaking your Neos apart and keeping it clean is easy thanks to its tool-free disassembly design. Simply turn the disassembly wheel with your fingers, and the barrel unit becomes separated from the rest of the pistol.SpecificationsActionSingleBarrel Length (mm)152.4Barrel Length (inches)6.0Caliber.22LRMagazine10Overall Height (mm)132.1Overall Height (inches)5.2Overall Length (mm)261.62Overall Length (inches)10.3Overall Width (mm)38.1Overall Width (inches)1.5Sight Radius (inches)8.9Sight Radius (mm)226Weight Unloaded (g)1026Weight Unloaded (ounces)36.2"

The AUG A3 M1 Optics version has a more traditional AUG scope tube with exceptionally bright and clear optical elements, modernized with the addition of three Picatinny rail sections to accommodate accessories like a close-quarters holographic sight. With 16 numbered slots, the High-Rail version was designed to accommodate the widest range of optic choices, and the 11-slot Short-Rail version was designed for use with a reflex sight or a longer-eye relief optic. The rail and optics platforms on all three AUG A3 M1 versions are interchangeable via the three base screws that thread from the underside of the top of the receiver. - See more at: https://steyrarms.com/firearms/sporting-rifles/steyr-aug-a3-m1.html#sthash.M41tCojO.dpuf"

Thanks for looking and I am in Winfield, KS. I am not looking for trades at this time but I might entertain a XDS .45 Mod 2 3.3"" with bag and extra mags and essential kit. Feel free to email cash offers."

I took it to the range and shot it and it functioned flawlessly. The scope and mounts that are on it can't handle the recoil, and came loose, so I can't tell you what kind of groups it shoots, but they are known to be pretty good shooters. I have one box of brass and two partial boxes of ammo to go with it. The scope, rings, and mounts will not be included. Just the rifle and ammo. There are no iron sights on it, so it will need a scope mounted. There aren't too many of these for sale to know what an average price is, but I think with the ammo, $450 is a fair price. There are a few marks on the left side of the stock, as shown in the pictures. I really just want to sell it, but would consider the following trades: .204 Ruger .22-250 .22 WMR rifle Thompson Contender or Encore rifle with wooden stock (no shotgun or muzzle loader barrels) Browning Buckmark rifle Kel-Tec PMR 10mm pistol"

Better than Saiga.  Next to be banned?
From an online review:
	""The Molot Vepr 12 isn’t like previous AK platform blasters. It hasn’t been neutered. It isn’t bastardized. In my considered opinion, the Vepr is better than the best Saiga 12 or other AK platform shotguns.""
	""The Vepr 12 is very similar the standard Kalashnikov shotgun. It uses similar parts but works off of a stronger foundation. Built around an RPK receiver, these guns are more or less an AK on steroids. Beyond the thicker steel, these guns also sport other RPK inspirations–notable the handguard and rear sight; the rest is just classic AK design.""

From the Browning website: 

The Browning BL-22 is in a class by itself. Sure, there are other lever-action 22 rimfire rifles available, but no other has the features, reliability, quality and accuracy of the BL-22. Speaking of features, the highlight of the BL-22 is the short 33° lever throw that makes cycling faster for adults and easier for younger shooters. The easy to load tubular magazine holds any combination of 22 short, long and long rifle ammunition, all of which are on the menu for the BL-22. Unlike some 22's the BL-22 features quality that rivals other Browning firearms. From the machined steel receiver to the fit of the finely finished wood, these superb rifles are Browning's through and through. Bring one along the next time you head into the field on a varmint hunt or just to roll a few tin cans.

I'll include the original ambi switch and it's a simple 5 min job to swap it back if you prefer.

Comes with 2x 20rd mags, gun lock, CZ bore snake, and the ambi safety switch. All in the original box. I'd love to keep it, but if I did I'd end up SBR'ing it and spending a bunch on accessories. I have too many projects as it is! So, my loss is your gain.

Bought this back in August 15 since then there has been 130 rounds through it. In the picture you can see the receiver has some scuff marks on it, not that bad at all. The rear fiber optic sight had a screw in it which came loose and fell off the rifle while i was out shooting. I can still hit target with just the front sight. If you plan on putting a scope on it (which i recommend) there shouldn't be any bother with the rear sight missing. Comes with 15 rounds of Hornady, box with all the assessor's in it. Trade for a smith and Wesson 9mm subcompact or cash price all state laws apply. Meet a gators and i will help split transfer fee, thanks.
