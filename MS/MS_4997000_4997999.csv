Willing to trade for S&W M&P full size in 9mm (preferably in tan). Will consider just about anything. But I'm really after an M&P. Or a GEN 4 glock 17 or 34. GEN 4 only though. Also since this gun sells new for $550 to $650, and I'm including all this extra stuff, I'm expecting cash along with a trade. 

Lastly, I'll only sell to someone with a CCW license, but I'll trade without one. Must be willing to do a bill of sale. Also I have a meeting place I always use. 7/11 in Minneola on Washington. That's the only place I'm willing to meet.

Designed with versatility in mind, M-LOK slots at the two, six, and ten o’clock positions allow the attachment of optional 1913 Picatinny rail sections and other M-LOK accessories for the direct mounting of tactical lights, slings, grips, etc. Reinforced, heat-resistant polymer construction provides operational durability without the weight and expense of an aluminum rail hand guard. Front extensions and lower lip provides additional operator protection from hot front sight assembly.

The MOE Stock is designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation.  The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30″ thick rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

Designed specifically for the AR platform, the 1x Spitfire combines an impressive array of high-performance features into a rugged, ultra-compact package. When fast target acquisition in close- to medium-range shooting applications is a priority, the Spitfire excels. Laced with advanced features, the sophisticated prism-based design allows for a more compact optical system without sacrificing optical quality. The DRT (Dual Ring Tactical) reticle is etched directly on the prism to assure consistent point-of-aim at all times with selectable red/green illumination of five intensity levels to match specific conditions."

The SAM7K-03 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K-03 is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K-03 pistol is ideal for sport shooting, self-defense, and for pistol hunting. The SAM7K-03 adds a new chapter to the best pistol of its kind in the world. 

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K-03 pistol receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receivers are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each SAM7K-03 forged pistol receiver starts out as a blank and requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is very complex and time-intensive, but with our meticulous attention to detail, we deliver a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability.

Summary: SAM7K-03 - 7.62x39mm caliber Pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, Sig Sauer pistol stabilizing brace, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, peep rear sight, scope rail. Includes one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. 

FEATURES

Sig Sauer’s SB15 pistol stabilizing brace
100% new-production parts and components.
Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier and double-hook trigger
Cold hammer-forged barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology
Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber
Side rail for scope mount (does not fit KV- 04SP, KV-04, or SM-13)
Peep rear sight
Ambidextrous safety lever
Accepts any mil-spec magazine with 5, 10, 30, and 40-round capacity

The Sig Sauer’s SB15 pistol stabilizing brace is a veteran-designed aid that is made to improve the single-handed shooting performance of a pistol. By using the operator’s forearm, it provides a stable support to reduce felt recoil and minimize accuracy-robbing spin and shift. The stabilizing brace sits on the receiver extension, and the flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the brace to be custom fit to any user. The receiver extension has a water proof storage compartment with a sealing threaded cap. It is accessible when the brace is removed or pushed all the way forward."

This was my first deer hunting rifle I purchased used approximately 20 years ago.
These old rifles last forever and are ready to hunt at all times.  Great for the budget conscious hunter, or the youth hunter taking his first steps into the timber for hunting Missouri Whitetails at close range.  Has some faded blueing on the barrel and receiver, and normal wear and tear on the stock and fore end...which is expected from rifles of this age which are often used for everything from farm pest control to normal hunting.

Rifle has iron sights, but comes equipped with a Bushnell Sportview Scope sitting on top of Weaver See-Thru rings.

One review mentions jamming with defense rounds.  I’ve shot ball, SWC, JHP, etc and it ran well with it all.  Has less than 500 rounds through it and probably not over 300.  Shoots really well, but I found a nice used Champion Operator LW and it carries a lot better for me.  I have several full sized steel SA’s and just don’t shoot this one much so it’s gotta go."

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 60-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip."

Similar in concept to the MOE-K, the MOE-K2 is a drop in upgrade for AR15/M4's that offers a more vertical grip angle, but in a full-size grip design. The steeper vertical grip angle is optimized for use on PDW (Personal Defense Weapon) configurations and improves comfort and control on short LOP rifles that bring the primary hand in closer to the shooter's body. With an aggressive TSP texture for positive weapon control, compatibility with optional Storage Cores for gear stowage, and a unique backstrap design for proper trigger finger placement, the K2 brings modern styling and ergonomics to the AR platform. All mounting hardware and a basic grip cap included."

If your not familiar with the dak system it is a double action only, but it lacks the heavy stacking trigger pull of other Dao ( at least all I have shot). When you charge a round into the chamber of a sig with dak trigger the trigger sets and the trigger pull will be 6.5lb (according to sig never measured myself) for the first shot and all subsequent shots. The great thing about it though is the fact the pull feels the same all the way through until the shot breaks (no stacking.... pull doesnt get heavier) another interesting thing about the dak compared to other dao pistols I've shot it has duel reset points for follow up shots. As you release the trigger after firing a shot there is a click about 2/3 of the way out. This is the first shorter reset. As soon as it clicks there you can start the next trigger press. There is no need to let the trigger travel fully forward. If your interested 620 OBO"

This model has a three position adjustable gas block to let you run the rifle suppressed, normal or off (for ultimate stealth).  For more details on the rifle and the rail I have included some links below. I am only selling this rifle because the holidays drained my bank account and I need the funds.

This is Mossberg's top of the line pump shotgun.  This model is miles ahead of the Mossberg 500 model.  

This is a true tactical shotgun that is ideally suited for anything you can throw at it.  It has all Mil Spec features and has a truly devastating 9 round capacity.  This increases your round count by 50 percent over most tactical shotguns.  

This is a 2015 model that has only had 45 rounds shot through it.  It still has the factory grease on the gun.  The 590A1 has a heavy duty barrel that can handle all types of ammo.  Plus the added weight makes shooting slugs and buckshot seem like a breeze with minimal kick/recoil.  The shotgun will also come with the factory box that it was shipped from the factory in.

Salient arms BCG- Made with an integrated gas key, this full-auto rated BCG is built like a tank, ensuring it will last. It is made using a Mil-Spec Carpenter 158 bolt as the foundation, ensuring it can stand up to the stresses of regular use.

It also makes cleaning a snap, offering you the ability to simply wipe it off without using a dental pick our other tools, even if you fired hundreds of rounds.
