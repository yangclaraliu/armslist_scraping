No Thumb Safety model. This is a beautiful gun, but I ended up picking up a Glock 17 recently and I am while I like the looks of the M&P more I like the functionality and mag compatibility with some of my other guns of the Glock a bit more. I am in no rush to sell this, I am asking much less than I have into it for something that is essentially brand new. I will not sell for a penny less than my asking price, I will just hang onto it if I can't sell it for my asking price (which is over $100 less than I paid for everything)

Factory case, 3 backstraps and lock. 

Includes 5 magazines. 

Has Apex Forward Set Sear trigger kit installed. (Trigger has a very light and short pull and very short reset, like a well tuned 1911). All the original parts are included. I used the factory trigger return spring in the install, which gives the lightest trigger pull with this kit. There are two additional return springs included with the original parts which will each give a slightly heavier pull, in case you want to use this as a carry gun and want a slightly heavier trigger pull. 

I paid $480+tax for the gun, $90 for the three extra mags and $125 for the APEX FSS trigger kit. (Over $700 into this unfired pistol)

Asking $600 cash or $700 trade value"

This is a factory modified version of the Ithaca Mag-10 with a shorter 21” barrel, and used to be issued to police officers to stop vehicles in their tracks.

Weighs about 11 lbs.  Incorporates a “countercoil” system which substantially reduces what would otherwise be an extreme recoil.  This shotgun has the vent rib option which was available in 1984-85. 

Each shot fired represents the equivalent of two 12-gauge shells loaded with the same type of buckshot, with only a relatively small increase in recoil and muzzle jump.  Great for turkey hunting, duck or goose or just playing.

Core 15 has emerged in the past decade as one of the leading manufactuers of AR rifles and parts. The M4 Scout is a fine example of their workmanship and quality. The Scout's light weight and reliabily are ackowledged by most. It's a beautiful rifle and something to show off to you friends. It's dependablity and accuracy makes for a good time at the range; It's fire power is available to counter any threat. My Cousin, Ron Bob, used to be up on Ridge Road, gives the Core 15 M4 Scout two thumbs up, well his one thumb up, actually. Ron Bob had his other thumb bit off by a ticked off squirrel or a drunk at the Russian Club, can't remember the whole story.

Like new, no damage, only 700-800 rounds through barrel. This has LWRCI's legendary signature short stroke, gas piston system. You can literally shoot 500 rounds through this upper and the bolt, chamber, and insides will be almost completely clean. The internals only need the occasional wipe down. The bolt doesn't even heat up after rapid fire,... thus eliminating fouling and carbon build-up. This upper has a short barrel and is suitable for pistol ar15 builds OR short barreled rifle builds IF you have the necessary paperwork approved and tax stamp. Even though this has a short barrel, it is still easy to hit man sized targets at over 600 yards using a good optic. This upper comes with a surefire mb556k muzzle brake (non pinned), a bottle of clp, the LWRCI supplied skirmish back up iron sights, and the one piece bolt carrier upgrade. I paid $1800 for this, I'm asking $1350. Cash only and you must meet me in a public parking lot for the transfer. Txt me at REDACTED for more photos"

Otherwise I'll just buy her a different one and keep this gorgeous thing. We loaded HST carry rounds and she fired it before telling me she didn't like the color, because she likes to empty my wallet. It was only fired for function testing of carry rounds, you'll know it when you see it. Therefore i expect to lose money on it, but please ne reasonable. I have proof of it's purchase yesterday."

The rifle is also outfitted with a Primary Arms 1x6 scope in an extended mount to allow easier charging of the weapon.  The scope has a BDC reticle to allow for holdovers out to 800 yards.  The scope also has wind holds and an auto ranging feature to allow you to make shots at unknown distances.  The rifle comes with an extra magazine giving a total of two 20 round magazines.  The rifle has 400 rounds of brass cases M80 7.62 NATO ammunition through it.  The rifle has been very accurate and has shot 1-1.5"" groups at 100 yards thanks to the cold hammer forged 16.25"" barrel.  The PwS FSC30 muzzle brake really helps with recoil and makes the rifle easy to shoot even for kids or women.

I am selling the rifle only because I am in the market for a new home or I would keep it because it is a joy to shoot and has been one of my favorite rifles.  I am asking $3200 OBO which you could not build this package for but I am open to offers (not ridiculous ones lol). No trades at this time. I am willing to ship to an out state buyer at their expense which can be negotiated. I will sell to a PA resident using a bill of sale which save you a couple hundred on taxes compared to buying new.

I can be reached by email or via text message at 724seven146020.  Thanks for viewing."

The rifle is in great shape, almost new condition with less than 200 rounds through it. If you are not familiar with these rifles they are patterned off the Czech VZ58 rifle, and while similar in appearance it is not an AK clone.  Has a solid forged receiver but is very lightweight despite this and only weighs about 6 pounds unloaded.  Also very accurate and has a side folding stock.  Will come with three 30 round magazines, cleaning kit, and original leather sling.  I also have a little bit of ammo I can include but I will have to check to be sure exactly how much.

I hate to see it go but I just don't use rifles much.  Would be interested in trading for a quality handgun in 9mm, such as a Beretta 92, CZ75, XDm, or similar.  Would also consider a 1911 of some sort, or a 38 or 357 revolver with a 3-4 inch barrel.  Not interested in other shotguns, rifles, Tauruses or Kel Tecs. 
I also have a S&W M&P9 I could include for a higher value trade depending on what you have.

It is lightly used with only a couple hundred rounds through it.  This is the latest model with all the design revisions to handle the earlier reliability issues with the model and it has run Great (less than a month old).  Very soft shooting easy to shoot gun.  Will come with its box and two magazines and can include some Hornady HP's.

I miss having a revolver so I would like to trade it for a S&W J frame of some sort in 38 special, possibly a Ruger Lcr, but no Taurus or Charter please.  Might also consider other subcompact handguns in 9mm or maybe 40, like a Ruger SR9c or Lc9s or similar, again no Tauruses or Kel Tecs please.

Speaking of HDMI, this receiver has 7 HDMI 1.4a inputs (6 back, 1 front) which provide 3D pass-through for Blu-ray and Broadcast content, and also supports Audio Return Channel. There are also 3 Y/Pr/Pb component inputs (capable of up to 1080i), 1 D-Sub (15pin) VGA input, 4 S-Video inputs, 4 RCA composite inputs, 3 coaxial digital inputs, 2 optical digital inputs, and 8 analog stereo RCA inputs.

Handling all the video from the many analog and digital inputs is Furoudja DCDi Cinema video Processor. The Furoudja DCDi upconverts and deinterlaces all signals to a native 1080p (24fps or 60fps) resolution, but does not have ISF Certified Calibration Controls. The dual HDMI 1.4a outs are also a nice feature, especially for those alternating between both a flat screen and a projection setup.

With Windows 7 and DNLA 1.5 Certification, the DTR-40.2 is also ready to stream music from the internet and on your home's broadband network. Using the unit's Ethernet jack to connect to the internet, users can enjoy Pandora, vTuner, Napster, Mediafly, Rhapsody, and may others. This receiver is also HD Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio ready.

The Integra DTR-40.2 is a very capable mid-level entry into the world of THX certification and 7.2 channel surround sound. The DTR-40.2 is available online and in local retailers for around $1,000.00.

Designed and manufactured in the USA, the new U22 Neos is a single-action .22 LR caliber plinking semiauto pistol. Although designed with the entry-level pistol shooter in mind, it is also ideal for training and can be adapted to the needs of experienced users. Its modular construction makes it easy to modify with a variety of options and accessories, while still being affordable both as a base pistol and as a fully-accessorized system.
 
 
Cool, Futuristic Design
 
Even while designing a plinking pistol to be used for informal shooting, Beretta did not cut corners. The lines of the Neos bear the unmistakable flavor of renown Italian designer Giugiaro--the same mind behind several of our most attractive offerings. The result is a sleek and ergonomic rimfire pistol that feels as good in the hands as it pleases the eyes.
 
 
Fully-Modular Construction
 
The Neos is constructed of five modular parts that may be easily disassembled and reassembled without any tools. The ergonomic grips are constructed of super-durable fiberglass-reinforced technopolymer with non-slip inserts for a comfortable and warm hold. The barrel is available either in the classic Beretta blue finish, or in stainless steel (""Inox""), to satisfy the tastes of every shooter. Most of these elements may be replaced with the rich assortment of accessories that is available for this fun .22 semiauto.
 
 
High Performance
 
Reliable, durable, easy to maintain and remarkably accurate, the Neos features an integral rail that accepts Weaver-style scope mounts as well as a fully-adjustable target rear sight. The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack, 10-round stainless-steel magazine features an easy-grip knob that allows you to compress the spring from outside, thereby making loading extremely quick and easy. The ambidextrous manual safety can be engaged with the firing pin cocked or uncocked. If you are in the market for a superbly-engineered plinking or practice pistol, give the Neos a close look--it won't fail to surpass your expectations."

Unissued - Mosin Nagant M-44 Carbine Rifle with folding bayonet, 7.62 x 54 caliber (roughly the equivalent of a 30.06 round).  This particular rifle is in excellent shape, with excellent wood (very smooth) and metal (hex receiver).  It was manufactured at the Tula arsenal plant in 1944.  The rifle has a clean, crisp bolt action (straight bolt), 5 round internal magazine, chambered in 7.62x54 which is powerful, cheap, and plentiful.  The bore, bolt, and barrel are clean, shiny, and function flawlessly.  I have shot less than 100 rounds thru this rifle.  Some believe it shoots more accurately with the bayonet extended.  It is very easy to disassemble and clean.  All matching serial numbers on bolt, barrel, receiver, and butt plate.  The rifle measures 40"" inches from butt plate to muzzle.  The bayonet extended adds 12"" inches.

When I purchased the rifle 9 years ago I looked all over for one manufactured at the Tula arsenal.  They were only made there part of one year - 1944.  The rifle was unissued during WWII and was packed away.  I had to do a lot of cleaning of the cosmoline (heavy grease).  The rifle was disassembled and the wood was lightly sanded to remove the dark cosmoline staining.  It was then restained, oiled, and waxed, before being reassembled.  

(The Ammo)
Available at Aimsurplus.com - Fantastic Surplus Bulgarian 7.62x54R ammunition. Manufactured in the late 1970s-mid-1980s, Features a copper washed full steel jacketed 147grn light ball steel core bullet. Packaged 440rds to a sealed ""spam"" can and 880rds per wooden crate.  ($99.95 plus $17.50 flat rate shipping for 440 rds).

(The history - cut and pasted)
The initial production of the M44 Carbine began in mid-late 1943 at the Izhevsk Armaments Factory. There were 50,000* of these carbines produced in 1943 and they were quickly deemed a success in field testing. Final approval was given and full production began in January of 1944. Production was undertaken at both the Izhevsk and Tula factories during the war, although the production at Tula was on a limited scale. To locate a Tula made M44 Carbine is quite a find for the Mosin collector, as the Tula production was on such a small scale that many had questioned if Tula was even involved in M44 Carbine manufacture.  We now know that Tula production of the M44 carbine only lasted a portion of one year, 1944. The exact number of Tula manufactured M44's is unknown but it is very clear that Tula production was quite small. While more examples of these have showed up in recent years, Tula produced carbines still need to be viewed as at least uncommon finds.  (This rifle is a Tula rifle and a rare find because of the hex receiver, and only being produced for part of 1944 - no other years at Tula).  

(The price)
I'm asking $250/obo for this rifle which is a fair price given it's rarity and condition.  Again, this is not an Izhevsk arsenal M-44 which were very plentiful.  I'm selling to add something different to my collection.  The rifle comes with a basic cleaning kit and issued sling.  Sorry ...... armlist only allowed the one picture.  Although the 20 or so pictures I have don't do it justice.   $250/obo  Call or text Al at REDACTED."

Common Questions

How much are your holsters? Our holsters normally run $40 for an average size gun with flat basic colors. Our IWB holsters run $5 more due to a stronger material used.

How much are your mag holsters? Depending on the type, they begin at $34.95. More complicated holsters with various mag types are available.

Can you make a holster for an FNX .45? Yes

Do you make holster with custom light/laser attachments? We do not carry ""ALL"" the custom light/laser attachments and can work with you depending on the model. In most cases, it is easier if you show up with the gear for us to measure and assess the work needed.

What kind of materials do you have? We use Kydex, Holstex, and Bolatron in varying sizes from .60 (thin IWB), .80 (medium IWB and OWB), .93 (Thick OWB) to .125. (OWB and complex projects)

What types of holsters do you make? Inside the waistband (IWB) concealed carry is our specialty but we can make outside the waistband (OWB) as well. We have designed custom mag carriers for 3 Gun competitions to include mag holsters for a Kriss Vector.

What is your most popular holster? Our most notable is our patent pending ""switchblade"" made especially for concealed carry. Very easy to conceal, you can't even feel its there and is designed for faster extraction than traditional style mag holsters.

One of the screws came loose and I lost it, can you replace it? Yes, we offer lifetime warranties on the holsters and will mail you a replacement to keep you going. We only ask that in certain cases, you pay for shipping costs if required.

Do you make leather holsters? At this time we are not able to make leather holsters but may explore that option at a later date.

Custom IWB for Ruger LCR 38 (March 5th 2015): ""My holster arrived very quickly even though it was the first one they'd made for my particular revolver. It's very well made, and the follow up by them to make sure it's perfect has been fantastic.

Common Questions

How much are your holsters? Our holsters normally run $30 for an average size gun with flat basic colors. Our IWB holsters run $5 more due to a stronger material used.

How much are your mag holsters? Depending on the type, they begin at $24.95. More complicated holsters with various mag types are available.

Can you make a holster for an FNX .45? Yes, that is our specialty, making holsters for large, bulky or rare guns is always a challenge. We aren't happy until you are happy.

What about a Calico M950? Yes, that was one of our most challenging and difficult guns to date.

Do you make holster with custom light/laser attachments? We do not carry ""ALL"" the custom light/laser attachments and can work with you depending on the model. In most cases, it is easier if you show up with the gear for us to measure and assess the work needed.

What kind of materials do you have? We use Kydex, Holstex, and Bolatron in varying sizes from .60 (thin IWB), .80 (medium IWB and OWB), .93 (Thick OWB) to .125. (OWB and complex projects)

What types of holsters do you make? Inside the waistband (IWB) concealed carry is our specialty but we can make outside the waistband (OWB) as well. We have designed custom mag carriers for 3 Gun competitions to include mag holsters for a Kriss Vector.

What is your most popular holster? Our most notable is our patent pending ""switchblade"" made especially for concealed carry. Very easy to conceal, you can't even feel its there and is designed for faster extraction than traditional style mag holsters.

One of the screws came loose and I lost it, can you replace it? Yes, we offer lifetime warranties on the holsters and will mail you a replacement to keep you going. We only ask that in certain cases, you pay for shipping costs if required.

Do you make leather holsters? At this time we are not able to make leather holsters but may explore that option at a later date.
