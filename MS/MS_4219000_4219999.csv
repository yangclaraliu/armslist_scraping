MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

Most BP vest manufacturers suggest you change your Kevlar panels every 18 months to 2 years. Inspect the panels for discoloration. Your body sweat contains a lot of sodium (salt) & that will rot the Kevlar panel. If the Vendor won't let you inspect the panels - RUN. Buy a vest from a reputable dealer.

I know I could just buy a wood stick and switch them but I'm hoping I might get lucky and find someone with a newer model mini 14 in the wood stock that really wished they would have gotten the synthetic tactical.

New in box SCCY CPX-2 with a Flat Dark Earth frame and a black slide as shown in photos.  It has only 32 rounds fired to check function (flawless). I haven't owned it long enough to carry, so no wear marks or scratches.

I bought two brand new guns last month (03/15)...this one and a Glock 26.  I couldn’t decide which I liked better at the time so I bought both.  Deciding which one to keep was a tough decision, but I’ve finally decided to hang on to the Glock.  Consequently, this one is up for sale.

The CPX-2 has a small profile that makes it excellent for concealed carry.  This one comes in the original factory box (the black box so you know it’s the new model) with everything else from the factory: all paperwork, the two 10-round mags with pinkie extension baseplates installed plus two extra flat baseplates, and childproof lock w/two keys.

In addition to everything supplied by the factory, I am also including three extra factory mags (each w/pinkie and flat baseplates) for a total of 5 mags, plus a nicely matching flat dark earth/black Kydex IWB holster specifically designed for this gun.

The CPX-2 is an elegant but robust gun with a “no questions asked” lifetime warranty from SCCY which follows the gun, not just the original owner.  

This is one of the most accurate guns I’ve ever shot (in addition to looking pretty sexy too!).

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TN driver’s license or carry permit.  If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.  

Would trade for a Ruger SR22, Ruger 10/22 Takedown, or a side by side 20 Ga coach gun (w/cash up or down as appropriate).  I’m not looking for low-ball offers.  Thanks!"

Extended beavertail to protect shooter's strong hand.


The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. 
 Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat fi nish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the CZ 75 Compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry with checkering in key areas on the front and back straps combined with the redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decreases the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transitions.
 The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the fi eld of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

This is a 1940 German K98. 
Nazi markings are in perfect shape. 
42 manufacture code - made in Mauser Werke, Oberndorf

The best I can tell, it is not a Russian capture (no electro pencil, no ""x"" marking, still has capture screws)

Barrel and receiver match, but the other part numbers do not. 

It is import marked but it is faded and very hard to read at the end of the barrel. 

This rifle had been through war and shows it. It has pitting on the receiver, trigger guard and bolt handle.

There is a small crack developing in the stock at the very rear of the receiver. I have a picture and can send it to you.

Don't know a whole lot about guns.  This was my dad's when he was growing up from probably age 12 to 19.  Used mostly in rifle team for school, boy scouts, and shooting targets at home.  Has not been fired in probably 15 years.  Has been stored in case.  Will definitely need to be set up/sighted in, possibly cleaned.  

Cannot tell you much about this other than what I have found out doing research online based on information on the gun.  

As far as I can tell and understand this is a it was built in West Germany and either assembled or distributed through Westfiled, Massachusetts.  The number ""68"" is printed on the barrel and I'm guessing that's the year it was made.  

Savage-Anshutz

Included with the rifle is an old rifle squad jacket (fits adolescents/youth or small adults)

Also included is an old cleaning kit and supplies, plus a few leather and metal items that I am not familiar with, plus a set of old ROTC standard targets.

Pictures say more than I can! 









Please feel free to ask any questions you have.  Hoping this finds a home with someone that will appreciate it more than I can.  I think it's a beautiful gun the wood stock is great even with a few scratches and dings."

Up for sale is my beloved Tula Sniper Rifle, only because this winter was too harsh on my car and I need to make serious repairs - 650$ or best offer please. I could sell everything separately and probably make more- but I need to fix these things soon. Sad Compromise. 

In general - comes with everything and all packaging as seen above. Includes everything from original Mosin setup as well! ~300+ rounds left, really great case too (hard to find one to fit this beast with muzzle break on.

[103$] Custom Bent Bolt low profile with custom knob from mnritz23 eBay seller (AWESOME)
[100$] Witt Machine Mosin Muzzle Break - dramatically reduces recoil - excellent product

Overall: 1,221 $ 

On Average this Sniper was used between 100yds-300yds with really great results. 

I need to emphasize how beautiful this bore is, I doubt it saw a lot of service since 1927. Maybe is was hiding in someones office, the previous owner hand picked this out of a crate. Really wonderful mosin. Markings are great, a few 'concentric' stamps and really nice soviet emblem. Hammer& Sickle 27' marked under receiver as well. 

Any questions please feel free to ask. Please do not low ball me. I could recover more selling it in pieces all separately - but I would rather sell it all together. Just purchased the bolt and case recently as well. *Note - the unique pica tinny extension setup up is weird - I don't like it, but its been holding zero surprisingly well - My next purchase was going to be a JMECK mount, which I highly recommend!"

This has been my go-to dove gun and it does that job perfectly, but I've finished restoring a Remington 11, so the 1300 needs a new home. 

The gun is in good shape, functions perfectly and needs no work whatsoever. The finish is good, though not immaculate, as this gun was never a safe queen. I'm not the original owner (I bought it an estate auction three years ago), but it came to me in nice condition and I've done my best to keep it that way. There are a few minor, almost imperceptible dings in the stock, but absolutely no cracks or breaks and the original finish is in great shape. 

In the field, this gun is a dream: it's light and points right where you want it to. As I mentioned, I've used it for dove hunting, but I could also see its Improved Cylinder barrel being great for game closer in: rabbits, quail, woodcock, etc. The choke is open enough (and the barrel is in good enough shape) that you could probably shoot steel through it for waterfowl. 

I've also used it to teach people how to shoot, as the shorter barrel and lighter recoil make it a bit easier for beginners.

I've had this weapon system for approximately 2 years now, and in that time have only put exactly 440 rounds downrange. For anyone not familiar with the AK, 440 rounds isn't even considered a drop in the bucket. I think that YOU would be a great person to put this Russian beauty through the paces!
Below, I'll include an itemized list of all additions/modifications made to this weapon system, as well as the cost for each included.
Please note that this firearm does NOT have the necessary modification needed to accept standard AK magazines. This rifle will ONLY accept magazines designed specifically for Saiga rifles. If that doesn't sit well with you, I do know that the modification is extremely easy and cheap. Personally, I prefer the look and feel of the polymer mags over the standard, stamped mags. Maybe you will too!

No I will not take $500, or $300 and your Glock!!
The price is $2500 for a new pair of Colts that ARE the rarest Colt SA Set out there and you may never see a set in this box for sale again!  These are even more rare than I originally thought.

I'll call the guns 99% and the box is definitely 50 year old box. Some glued seems coming apart and bends ripped but taped.  The box alone could probably be sold for $400-$500.

Very rare! In fact Don Wilkerson's book on Colt SA Revolvers states that there was only about 100 sets in this cardboard box.  I can't imagine there are very many left in this box.

I emailed back & forth with a guy on the colt forum to ask his opinion of value and he gave me great information.  I am NOT desperate to sell nor do I want any trades except (except something listed below, or something uncommon or whats listed at the bottom.)Cash money, no checks, money orders, your AK plus $800, just $2500 Firm cash!!!!!

The paragraph below was posted by the Colt SA Scout gentleman on the Colt Forums.
This info can be found in Don Wilkerson's book.
""There was a ""Matched & Consecutive Serial # Pair"" of '62 Frontier Scouts both in .22 LR caliber which was sold in a special cardboard box. These guns in their special box are quite scarce. In his excellent book on Colt .22 single actions (""Colt Scouts, Peacemakers and New Frontiers in .22 Caliber"", 1993 Walsworth Publishing), Don Wilkerson estimated that only about 100 of these sets were shipped. A great many more K nickel sets were shipped than the '62 sets, but the numbers are not known.
 The most common set of Scout revolvers is one k nickel revolver in .22 LR and one in .22 Magnum. The other sets are less often seen.

With its lightweight 22 oz. polymer frame, thin profile, and ramped 3.2 inch barrel, the newly designed Millennium G2 is the ideal concealed carry handgun. The PT 111 Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment.

Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

And why hunters may be happier than those who never experience the woods waking on a winter morning. Of course hunting success is more than just being in the right place at the right time. It also requires putting the right shot in the right spot to efficiently do the job. For the express purpose, hunters consistently turn to Remington.
No matter what model you prefer, we remain unwavering on our dedication to producing firearms which embody the highest standards in quality and are instilled with the spirit of a legendary brand - Remington.The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park
