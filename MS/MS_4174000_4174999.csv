Doesn't have to be gun related. This scope is in excellent condition comes with original box and paperwork. Will ship PayPal acceptednas well as major credit cards. The ever increasing range of applications prompted us to develop the 3-20x50 PM II with the objective of offering the user the best possible flexibility. The variable magnification from 3 to 20x permits the scope to be used universally on a multitude of rifles with many different calibers. Due to its rather comprehensive total adjusting range of 260cm the scope may even be used at very large distances. Elevation and windage turrets are equipped with a locking function and a double turn including a second tactile level. This system will prevent the elevation and windage turrets from any inadvertent adjustment. The tactile double turn and the tactile clicks at every tenth click (MTC) are designed to reduce and prevent operating errors due to stress. On request the reticle may be included in the first or second focal plane. On top of that, the scope features parallax compensation from 25 m to infinity. Reticle illumination ranges from night-vision goggles via dusk to broad daylight."

Only fired 50 rounds total. Works great easy to use, easy to clean -- ex military, current government employee -- good sale
Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. 
The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! 

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver."

It's definitely a fantastic gun, but it's just too small for my hands to comfortably carry or shoot reliably. It's never been carried except in a padded range bag because I wasn't comfortable enough with being able to use it effectively and responsibly in a defensive capacity, having only put 50 rounds through it. Comes with everything it comes with new in the hard case. 2 mags, lock, paperwork, Glock hard case.  This pistol is great for pocket carry or inside a waistband or thigh holster, even smaller purses.  Recoil is very manageable since it is a .380, and the trigger breaks clean and crisp.

Very nice .22LR, far more accurate than bulk .22LR available now. While it isn't Match Grade ammo, it is Target Grade, and worth every penny.
Sold through Norma USA, a Swiss-owned company, this ammo is made in Germany by RWS, another manufacturer of high quality rimfire ammunition.Please read online reviews of this Norma TAC 22 ammo, it has been found to be quite accurate, more so than CCI Standard Velocity, and is providing groups previously only found with much higher priced Match Grade .22LR ammo.This ammo carries the RWS headstamp of an 'R' inside a shield, and it has the same RWS plastic trays, boxes, and slick bullet lube, so it is essentially RWS ammunition. Frankly, Norma and RWS are both considered upper-end ammunition manufacturers, so you have a Swiss company selling ammo under the prestigious Norma name, being made by RWS in Germany, another premium brand name... suffice it to say that this is QUALITY ammo. Nothing like Rem Thunderbolt or Federal Bulk Pack rimfire .22LR, this is not plinking ammo, even though it is priced at plinking ammo levels.SEVERAL BRICKS AVAILABLE!!"

This gun has been lightly used and cleaned after every use.  I still have original case and all original parts (sights, magazine disconnect, etc.). The magazine disconnect bushing is a aftermarket replacement part that let's the magazine fall freely from gun. Stock disconnects bind up the mag when released as well as make the disassembling process a pain. This replacement bushing fixes all that. The mags are also spring loaded for quicker. I paid 360 for the gun and have about 140 in the upgrades. Sights were $50, Magazine Bumpers $30, Disconnect Bushing $20, and the grips were each $20. This is a very accurate little pistol and it's a blast to shoot. Very clean! I am wanting $425 or best offer. I am looking for a 45 LC single action, so I am open to trades.

The pistol was stored in a leather holster and is pitted and the bluing is pretty much shot on the barrel. That's the way I bought it. The rest of the gun is in pretty nice condition. The trigger is one of the nicest single action triggers I've ever handled. So, the gun is cosmetically challenged, but is a real good piece of iron.
