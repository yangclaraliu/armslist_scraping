It has some holster wear but is in excellent mechanical condition. This particular sig (as compared to the p229 that I owned) has an excellent trigger. The 229 I owned had quite a bit of ""overtravel"" or ""trigger slap"" in the double action mode, which could cause some loss of fine accuracy. This one breaks right as the trigger reaches the frame and has no discernible overtravel to it. It is also smoother than my 229 was. It shoots to the sights and has all the pluses that come with the MK25 such as phosphate coated internals, hard chromed barrel etc. I have tried my best to capture the worst of the wear areas in the pictures.  I have upgraded it with an E2 grip kit which makes it feel much better in the hand in my opinion. There are some areas on the grip's checkering that have been flattened somewhat. The original grips are also included and the 3 original 15 round phosphate coated magazines. Buyer must be a Montana resident, and must be willing to show valid state issued ID and fill out a bill of sale at the time of purchase.

I've always had a soft spot for revolvers, but as I'm more interested in getting into rifles I'm looking to replace my Trooper with an AR-15.

I purchased this Trooper on consignment from my local gun store.  As I never met the previous owner, this is only speculation, but due to the holster wear (purely cosmetic, and in my opinion it gives this gun the flavor a gun of it's age deserves) the previous owner was a police officer.

Everything on this gun works perfectly, and I'm much more accurate with it than I am on any striker fired or 1911 style pistol.

The grips of the gun are in like with, and thus I assume to be, original grips.

The trigger though is what I feel is the best piece of this gun.  The Trooper is a single/double action pistol.  The double action isn't anything that makes me stop and say wow, however the single action makes me wish I could magically pull it out and use it in every other gun that I have ever shot.

If you have any questions at all about this firearm, don't hesitate to let me know.  I'm happy to clarify anything, and supply more detailed/specific pictures upon request."

The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.

Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.

The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date."

You must be able to legally own a firearm, as I will only sell through an FFL dealer. Email me or call me (four zero one 500-5349) with any questions! 

***I am also open to trades for a used (and legally owned!) .22 or 9mm handgun/rifle/shotgun, or 9mm ammo."

This RIFLE isn't an AAC pistol that is going to get you bitched at by the ATF. 16"" barrel from AAC, 1:7, carbine length gas block/tube (low profile) all by AAC. The upper is Aero Precision, with a PSA 15"" free float rail and NiBo Bolt Carrier. All of these things are brand new, never fired. Muzzle brake is from CustomMuzzleBrakes.com - helical .300 stainless model.

I've mounted it on an Adams Arms rifle lower, with Adams Arms lower parts kit with Winter trigger guard. The fire control group is a Rock River 2 Stage Match grade trigger (4.5 lbs), the furniture is B5 SOPMOD Stock and pistol grip. This trigger has zero creep - I have the same one in two other rifles. I swapped the standard selector for an Ambi with major axis of turn for righties... and minor for a lefty (or off hand operation). There is also an Ambi Troy QD Sling attachment buffer tube end plate for your sling. This lower has seen about 40-50 rounds of 556 on a piston upper that I traded off.

Pictures show it without a charging handle - which I'll put on shortly. And I'll even throw in a Sling with two QD ends for double or sling point use.
____________________________________________
This lower is the same lower Adams Arms sells for $449 - (and then I put an upgraded $100 trigger in it plus the Ambi safety). Then the Troy QD plate is another $50.
This barrel sells from AAC with the gas block/tube for $425.
Aero Precision will sell you this upper assembled for $100.
PSA can't sell you this rail because it isn't in stock. But the 11"" for $200 or the 13"" for $150 (I don't understand either).
PSA NiBo Bolt carriers are $120.

Paypal accepted.
As described by manufacturer:
Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for M4 carbines and M16A4 rifles flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights."

I only used this for a few weeks doing private security. No signs of wear. It says it's for Xds but I actually had a Taurus 24/7 G2 and I read it will fit other pistols as well. Do your research before you buy.

I paid $105 after tax for this so I believe $45 is a reasonable price. Thanks for looking.

This is an Unissued/Like New West German Sig Sauer P226 chambered in the beyond impressive and devastating 357 SIG caliber. It was only test fired at the Sig plant when it was manufactured in the 90's. Other than that, it has not been fired since. These German Sig's are highly sought after and many believe to be superior in reliability, materials, fit and finish than the Exeter produced ones. I have never seen one as clean as this one, as most have been pretty beat up and worn via Police and Military work.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

Description from First Spear website:

This lightweight plate carrier is cut to fit ESAPI/SPEAR cut ballistic plates, backed with an unpadded and non water absorbing nylon mesh. Designed to quickly shed water and aid in transition from over the beach to over the hills, this carrier can be configured with the CTFSS, BC Inserts, and soft armor ballistic inserts (to support in conjunction ballistic hard plates) as required. The Amphibian comes standard with a 2"" belly band and a standard cummerbund that will accept side plates and soft armor inserts. Both wings of the Amphibian Plate Carrier's front panel have pockets with adjustable tie downs that can hold radios similar to the size and shape of the AN/PRC-148 (MBITR) or AN/PRC-152 (MBHH) and can even be adjusted to fit the 60 Round Surefire M4 Magazine.. Utilizing the latest in FirstSpear™ technologies, including the 6/12™ pocket attachment system and TUBES™, this is a state of the art capability designed to support Maritime Assault Operations.

Also features 2 x adjustable/removable bungee tops for plate pockets on each side of the cummerbund (4 total). Use bungees to secure mags, radios, and other similar sized gear."

Imperial M1891 dragoon Mosin variant, excellent condition and superior quality for a Mosin.

Genuine factory colt upper. These are hard to find, I know alot of people say this about some guns but this is actually one that is not just floating around your everyday market. Comes in the Colt box, with everything it did new iincluding the factory Matech flip up sight. I put it on a pistol lower and ran 60 flawless rounds through it. I hate to get rid of it but I'm looking for a 16"" or 14.5"" upper and i need to trade or sell this to get it. It has been marked by the trijicon mount when i was mounting carelessly, just giving a full disclosure on it. $950. 

Would go pretty good on one of those Sig Braces.

Very fast red dot optic with large view and takes no batteries. I just bought brand new from H&H for $680+. It has a little mark on the adjusting screw where my flathead driver slipped but its no big deal, I just want to give a full disclosure. $450
