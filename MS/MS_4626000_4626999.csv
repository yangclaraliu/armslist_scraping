We also take trades.The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

I will not ship this ring.  The individuals that are interested in the ring will have to meet me in the West Columbia/Cayce area."

For semi-auto action, merely rotate the selector ring 1/4 turn, push the forend forward and release the selector, to switch back to pump action simply reverse the procedure by pulling back after the selector ring is rotated to lock the forend to the action bars. (Option two) To change between semi-auto and pump action simply rotate the selector ring at the front of the forend 1/4 turn then push forward to change from pump action to semi-auto or pull back to switch from semi-auto to pump action and then release the selector. The M3 Convertible comes in Army Green synthetic stocks, fully adjustable ghost-ring aperture rear sights and military style fixed-blade front sights.

 3 1/2"" Composite
With a sleek, low-luster black finish under a tough Dura-Touch® coating on a composite stock and forearm, the Super X2™ 3 1/2"" Magnum Composite is the original workhorse that started the SX2 revolution. Built to perform in the worst conditions, the reliable Super X2 3 1/2"" action is built to shoot factory field loads from 2 3/4"" (1 1/8 oz.) to heavy 3 1/2"" magnums, thanks to efficient, reliable gas operation. This model also has a back-bored, Invector-Plus™ ventilated rib barrel with a white bead front sight. Sling swivel studs are included.
3"" Composite
Never let bad weather ruin your hunt with the Super X2™ 3"" Composite. From the reliable gas operating system, to the rugged composite stock and forearm with Dura-Touch® Armor Coating, to the low luster finish on exposed metal surfaces, the 3"" Super X2 Composite is a tough, reliable shotgun. The simple gas-operated action allows you to shoot the heaviest factory 3"" magnums, 2 3/4"" (1 oz.) field loads and everything in between with reduced recoil and allows for unbelievably fast follow-up shots.

This Rifle is currently selling on Palmetto State Armory.com for $899.99 I will include the specs directly from Palmetto State Armory’s website.

This Rifle has never been fired. I bought it mainly because I wanted a rifle capable of shooting either .308 Win or Military grade 7.62X51. Basically, I have decided to go a different route.  One thing to note. The only flaw I have ever read about with this rifle was the Bolt Control Group. So, I opted to go with a Bolt Carrier from AIM Surplus. So this rifle, with the upgraded BCG should be an awesome shooter.  Again, Note, this rifle has never been shot. It’s Brand New in the Box. With one added Extra bonus.  It’s decked out with Magpul Gray Furniture.  With a B5 Systems Stock.  Also has KNS anti walking pins. and a Damage Industries ambi selector switch.  So an added $150.00 + in furniture makes it an even better deal.  Magpul  P MAG (20 Round) comes with the Rifle.

For sale is my Spike's Tactical Lower Receiver. It has sat in my humidity controlled safe ever since I originally purchased it. Once I started buying pre built AR's, I lost track of time on building my own.

Purchasers MUST be over the age of 18 AND be Florida resident with valid drivers license proving such. (Following the law here folks for private sales)

If you have a Florida Concealed weapons permit, fantastic.

I am the original owner. My brother is a gunsmith in Colorado so I had him do some work to it to make it better. First, he did a trigger job so the pull is 6lbs and feels very crisp. He also polished the feed ramp and chamber so it feeds much more smoothly. It has a small amount of grip tape on the front of the grip, but is easily removed. Lastly, some of the corners were very sharp from the factory and he smoothed them out. It is a great gun with the original box and papaers as well as 1-7 round Remington magazine and 1- 8 round act mag. Asking 600 obo."

Bought a new scope for another gun, this barrel will now include a 3-9x40 tasco world class scope for the same price!

Deer season is right around the corner!!!  This is the primo slug barrel for you 12 gauge 870 shooters. It's a 23"" fully rifled, cantilevered for a scope, and ready to make Bambi an orphan!  Made a 2.5"" group at 100yds with Core-Lokt sabot slugs the only time I shot it. It has the Remington express/ matte/ parkerized finish. The 3"" chamber will shoot 2-3/4"" or 3"" slugs. Will NOT shoot super magnum 3-1/2"" shells. Has only had about a dozen slugs through it, just enough to sight it in, haven't used it since. Never taken to the woods; no scratches or blemishes at all.  Has lived in my dehumidified safe ever since I bought it new. It should fit any 12 ga 870 (wingmaster, express, or otherwise) as long as it has the standard length magazine, not the extended one I've seen on a few models. It does not include the scope pictured, but does have a tasco world class 3-9x40 scope on it. You won't be disappointed!  Price is $250 OBO shipped to the lower 48. Thanks for looking!"

The XD® 3″ Sub-Compact has all the same features found in the standard XD® line, but in a smaller package. The barrel is 3” and the frame is a short, compact size that will let the pistol nearly disappear when you carry it. Like other XD® pistols, the XD® 3” Sub-Compact gives you great versatility when it’s used with X-Tension™ magazines. Enjoy 13+1 rounds of 9mm, (9+1 of .40SW) with standard flush-fitting magazines. Or throw in an X-Tension™ magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 16+1 rounds of 9mm (12+1 of .40SW.) You’ll find everything on the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD®.

If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for an XD® 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range.

Even though these are definitely used, they probably weren't pointed at U.S. soldiers. Finally, the Russian Army confiscated the pistols from the Nazis. That's when they sold it back to the US for resale. Quite the tale!

This particular example was made in 1945. That's really all I can tell from the proof marks.

This listing is for a Venezuelan contract FN49 made in Belgium. The caliber is 7x57 Mauser. This is a complete rifle with matching numbers and NO import markings. She functions flawlessly and is a great shooter capable of 2 MOA groups with open sights at 100 meters using PPU 139gr SP ammo. I may be interested in trades of other older military rifles. Must provide Idaho DL and not be a felon and legal to posess and own a firearm. Would also be more than willing to transfer to an FFL at the buyers expense. I have plenty more pictures available at your request.

This revolver was Manufactured early in the year 2000 on a very limited production. It followed a contract S&W had with the Brazilian government for this special order M19-8 in a .38 caliber. I purchased this as NIB which I believe it is, I am downgrading the finish to 98% due a few minor handling marks I have found while cleaning it. This revolver has been stripped of all petroleum finishes on the surface and I have applied 2 coats of Renaissance wax to bring out the few finish imperfections. The digital camera can be very critical  so what you see may be enhanced. Overall this revolver does qualify as NIB and comes with all the original accessories seen in my photo. I have MANY ADDITIONAL PHOTOS I would be happy to send you if you are interested, include your personal email. Thanks for looking.

I bought it brand new about 2 years ago and did more gazing at it's beauty than fired it. Less than 100 rounds were fired through this rifle. Included is the original box in good condition, and a rifle case in beautiful condition. The rifle itself is in EXCELLENT condition. I only used Remington Brand .22 rounds because they fired and ejected perfectly. Seems a little sensitive to other brands and some brands will get stuck. Rifle was cleaned after every use. Very very minor scratches only on the lever due to shooting it with a small ring on the finger at one time. I'm selling only because my daughter is in college and it's time to save up! Serious interest only and the price is practically set in stone. It's a beauty to just display if you want! But you will have lots of fun at shooting practice with this beautiful Henry Goldenboy Western .22 Rifle."
