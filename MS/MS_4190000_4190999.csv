This was a “bucket list” gun for a family friend that ordered it when he was diagnosed with a terminal illness.  Unfortunately he passed before he ever got to shoot it.  I purchased the gun then outfitted it with a Sadlak Industries Steel Front Rail with a GG&G XDS-2 Tactical bipod.  The gun retains the original National Match Iron Sights.  I added Sadlak industries Steel Airborne Model Scope rail (with view channel for iron sights), and mounted a Trijicon TR23-2 AccuPoint 5-20 50X Scope with MGM Switchview Cat-Tail mounted in GG&G Accucam QD Scope Mounting Base.  Added a Tac-Pro Kydex adjustable cheek rest to get the proper cheek posiiton for the scope.  No permanent alterations were performed (stock was not drilled and the stripper guide that was removed for the scope mount is included for easy reattachment is desired.  

Have fired exactly 30 rounds through the gun, cleaning the barrel every 10 rounds.  

Rifle is like new.  Scope has some small scratches on one adjustment knob ( from rubbing on another gun in my safe).  Will throw in the heavy weight ScopeCoat neoprene cover I had made for the scope to prevent future damage.

I took it out in the mountains last week as a test run, and while it excels in some areas such as chopping and batoning wood and hacking through brush, for my taste it's simply too big for my definition of practical. 
It's made of 1075 spring steel, it takes and holds a pretty good edge,  has a blade just a hair over 7' and very nice scale handles. It's a little roughly finished,  you can see a few grind marks and the scales aren't  perfectly lined up. And it has a few scratches from where I've used it. I paid 70$, I will take 50$. I will say that I do feel it's worth what I paid, just too big for my taste. It comes with a generic nylon camo sheath I picked up for it.  REDACTED.

When I got it it had a crappy tapco stock on it and an aftermarket receiver cover scope mount, I fit it into a Norinco stock that I refinished, with a standard receiver cover. It functions FLAWLESSLY, it's numbers matching except the magazine and stock(was most likely a refurb anyway, most of them were), barrel is chrome lined, and the Russian SKS is the best SKS that was made, ALL MILLED PARTS, no stamped, very smooth!

I am including all the ammo I have for it which is 280 rounds, 180 rounds is still in boxes, 100 is on 10 round stripper clips. I also am including 10 more empty stripper clips, I have a set of colored Tapco front sights for it, I'm running the cherry colored Tapco sight on it now, as well as the Tapco sight adjustment tool.

I'm looking to trade for a Quality 9mm pistol, looking mainly for a Taurus PT92 or PT917, would also consider a Rock Island 1911 in 9mm, or a Citadel 1911 in 9mm, Ruger 9mm. Would prefer a hammer fired 9mm. Feel free to offer a trade, but wanting a 9mm, NO HI POINTS, JIMINEZ, ETC. Also, I'm not gonna give the SKS away, so don't offer a pistol without ammo that isn't worth the cash price I'm asking, not putting a trade value on it, my value is off Cash Price. The SKS is worth $400 as it is, and I have at least $100 in ammo.

$450 is cash price with everything included, or trade.

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.
A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."

I am mainly looking to trade at this time; but I wouldn't be too terribly apposed to a reasonable cash offer.  With that being said, I am placing a $1,800 cash value or a $2,000 trade value on my rifle.  I am well aware that I am asking full trade value on my rifle (based off of Bud's Gun Shop prices); however I am willing to give you full trade value on your firearm as long as it is in LNIB condition.  Please make sure that your trade offer is worth at least $2,000 (not MSRP) or has the appropriate amount of boot; and is in LNIB condition to avoid both of us wasting our time for nothing.

I also have a 9mm drop in conversion barrel that allows you to shoot 9mm out of this gun as well. I've put nearly 350 rounds of 9mm downrange with it with zero issues. You will need 9mm glock mags for that.

The gun has been pretty flawless, but I want to move to a 1911. There is a tiny bit of holster wear on the front of the slide, it's very minimal and it will happen with any gun which is placed into and removed from a holster.

I have also added an american flag slide backplate on here, but still have the original glock one if you want a more sterile look. I also have an extra magazine release (that's never been installed), and an extended slide release lever that I used for a while. I also have the original interchangeable backstraps that can be added to the back of the grip to get a custom fit. All of these parts are very easy to swap out and can be done in a matter of minutes.

I also have a lasermax guide-rod laser for it, which I've only used once at the range. It's a pretty neat gizmo, and very easy to put in/take out. It replaces the factory recoil spring, with one which incorporates a laser module into it, providing you with a laser sight that goes nearly exactly where the point of impact will be. I have an extra set of batteries for that as well.

I'm asking $650, OR a reasonable trade for a decent 1911. Worst I can say is no, but please- no low balls. VT residents, 21+ and must be willing to sign a bill of sale."

This rifle was purchased directly from Osage County Guns a month ago. The first photos are taken directly from the gunbroker ad. The last photo is of the actual firearm. Before I had the chance to take it to the range, I was accepted for study overseas. Rather than having it mothballed for 4 years, I'm offering it at an unbeatable price. This is probably the cheapest factory new Mini-14 on planet earth right now. If you've ever wanted one, here's your chance. This particular model has a Ruger brand picatinny rail installed on the fore end for scout style optics. It comes with 2 magazines, and all original paperwork. The barrel is threaded to mil-spec AR-15s for attachment of compensators, brakes, and suppressors. This deal is as good as direct from a dealer - but there's no shipping, no hassles, and a price that is truly priced to sell. That being said, the price is more than fair and thus, non-negotiable. Feel free to email with any questions.

675,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4190675,For Sale/Trade:  Frederick The Great statue,"Westminster, Colorado, United States",$ 500,"Listed On: Saturday, April 11, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"letting go of some of my high end military artwork.

 Standing silver plated piece, Frederick the Great in uniform. This figure was presented in 1940 as a 40-year anniversary gift to an employee in the Dresden Finance Office by co-workers.  The figure is white metal with a silver plate. It measures 12 1/2"" tall and is in excellent, undamaged condition still complete with his walking stick and sword.  The base is hand-engraved in script. It reads: Zum 40 jährigen  Dienstjubiläum ~ Gewidmet v.d. Gefolgschaft b. Finanzamt Dresden-Annenstrasse ~ 19.4.1940

Frederick is often remembered as the father of Prussian militarism, but Prussia’s location as a border state between larger empires meant that frequent wars were hardly a new phenomenon. Still, Frederick’s long reign unified Enlightenment rationalism and military tradition, yielding a highly trained army and a militaristic system of public education.

Frederick’s greatest admirers tended to be those with large continental ambitions. Napoleon made a special visit to Frederick’s tomb in 1806 after defeating Prussia’s army, and Hitler hid the king’s body in a salt mine during the allied bombings of World War II.

This is one of the most compact 50 round magazines ever produced for the AR-15. The X-15 is engineered around our proven coil magazine technology which allows side by side staging of ammunition in a single stack. Because of our patent pending tension relief device, the X-15 can operate for an almost unlimited number of spring loads and can even perform in weapons with capabilities of up to 1100 rounds per minute. The streamlined design allows for zero separation of the ammunition during operation which prevents malfunctions and allows for an exceptionally compact profile. The X-15 is shorter than a standard 30 round magazine and three inches shorter than a quad stack magazine. The user friendly ergonomics and ability to use a sling make this magazine ideal for 3-gun competitors. Manufactured primarily from aluminum and steel, the magazine uses minimal plastic components in its operating assembly which gives it unparalleled reliability and strength. The critical components of the mechanism are coated in Cerakote for friction reduction and proven reliability without the need for lubrication.

Let me be clear, I haven't fired this thing in more than two years. The action is butter smooth however. The paint is disaster but there is no rust. Price is for the 22lr and the pellet gun is a freebie.

The 22lr is in fact a Henry rifle. First offer that can meet asap gets it. I've gotten a lot of response but it's people from out of town or who don't understand that this rifle has been collecting dust.

UPDATE: The  22lr rifle DOES fire but it has some issues loading the rounds. Could be dirty, could need polished I don't know.

UPDATE #2 I took the weapon apart and cleaned it up. It is now cycling properly and works just fine. I have raised the price from 100 to 120 since the weapon is now known to function properly."

I'm throwing in a brand new Blackhawk Serpa style paddle holster as well to the deal. I also have 450 rounds of .45 JHP and FMJ for sale separately. I have nearly $675 into this set up. I'll throw in the soft Ruger pistol case I have for it into the pot as well. 

I WANT $399 CASH for this pistol, two magazines, a zip up case and the Blackhawk holster. 

I will trade for other firearms, but ONLY at retail, which I would imagine would be what you want for yours. Let me know what you have. I would trade straight across for an entry level build or off the rack AR (such as a bone stock SAA), better AK (Pap, IO, Radom, etc. Not trading for a WASR unless it is NIB with good sights, no mag wobble and you will have to throw in some stuff on your end), other 9mm pistols, a 9mm carbine, .45 colt rifle, better .380s, etc. Don't need anymore .22 rifles. As said, let me know what you have."

Has close to 1000 rounds, all fed and fired flawlessly. Purchased back in October 2014. Has a decent amount of accessories, including a YHM Front Flip-up site gas block, Magpul MOE handguard, Magpul ACS stock, CAA handgrip (has 6 different configs), Milspec Front grip bipod (Not sure of the name as it's not installed on the gun) and 3 total mags. All equipment is in great condition. When I first got the gun I was going to an outdoor range doing drills so it has seen some use. Since getting the furniture and YHM site it's only seen indoor range time. I have all of the factory parts still. The only con is the A2 gas block sight got dinged up pretty good trying to drive those damn pins out. It is fully functional if you wanted to put it back on (I'll include pics on this). Overall this gun is damn good, very accurate for the price and damn reliable (I'm ashamed that I can't say the same for my Glock...). Cleaned with Hoppes and lubed with Remington oil. Did not have one jam, even after one hard 300rds+ session. Asking 800 dollars cash, paid that much for the gun new without all the accessories. Not interested in trades, local transaction only. Give me my asking price and I'll throw in an Allen tactical soft case, 5.11 vest (mag pouches, not a plate carrier), and 180rds of ammo. Email is the best way to reach me.

Per CMP, Correct grade means the rifle is in very good to excellent condition, and has all correct parts. Per the documents that came with the rifle from CMP, this rifle has a throat wear measurement of ""2"", and a muzzle wear measurement of ""1"".  This makes the rifle very close to new, with little to no wear.  The pictures tell the story of the condition of the rifle, wood and metal are in excellent condition, rifling is clear and sharp.  I have fired exactly eight rounds in the rifle (one clip), to verify function and accuracy.  It functioned  perfectly and accurately.  I will ship to an FFL.

Info below from L3 website:

L3 Eotech MPO (Multi Purpose Optic). The EOtech MPO provides a complete optical system that solves the need for medium range precision targeting and target identification, as well as rapid transition to close quarters battle (CQB) engagements where speed and peripheral vision are essential.
The EOTech MPO Holographic Sight is configured with ballistic matching reticle image for the M4 carbine. The reticle provides 4 aiming dots for target distances of 0-300m, 400m, 500m, and 600m. When viewed without magnification, the 65 MOA circle and fine center 1 MOA aiming dot are used, ensuring precision accuracy. Only through the unique optical properties of holography, the aiming dots remain 1MOA in size, regardless of magnification (yet your target has increased in size by nearly 4x)! Precise, medium range targeting (out to 600m) can now be achieved. Field of view is optimized by integrating high quality prisms that maintain the rectangular shaped sight picture of the EOTech HWS, and since the illuminated reticle image is imbedded within the HWS, there is no risk of losing zero when the magnifier element is taken off or re-attached. Additionally, the base of the EOTech 557 HWS has been modified to reduce the amount of rail space required to effectively mount the system, making this ideal for the M4/AR15 flat-top platform. For the infantryman, target ranges vary in ever-changing battlefield conditions.
L-3 EOTech MPO Weapon Sight provides a solution for engaging threats in CQB situations, then quickly transitioning to a 500m targeting or surveillance situation, and then quickly back to a 25m room clearing exercise. Instant transition is achieved through a quick Flip-to-Side (FTS) mount or optional fixed mount (FXD) that offers a simple, quick disconnect feature to remove the L-3 EOTech 4X magnifier. This EOTech durable, night vision compatible system offers wide field optical performance with superior light transmission for visibility in extreme low light conditions..
