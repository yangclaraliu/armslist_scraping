These rugged, durable revolvers also make a practical choice for backpacks and tackle boxes, especially where there are bears and other predators around. Extremely comfortable to fire and easy to control - the Tracker Series continues to grow in popularity thanks to its high level of accuracy, rock-solid performance and near-indestructible construction. The ported barrel cuts recoil and helps recovery from recoil.  The rubber grips are shock absorbing and help maintain control.  The revolver is seven shot and allows for a wide range of ammo from 38 to 38 +p to .357 to suit your self-defense needs.  These revolvers sell for $550 new and this gun is priced at $375 as it has had seventy rounds fired through it and has no box.   It is truly ""like new"", however.
I fired the seventy rounds and can tell you that it is very accurate and comfortable to shoot.  Buyers must have a permit to purchase or a concealed carry permit.

Also included with the sale are 5 - 30 round steel magazines, a Polish 4 slot magazine pouch that is correct for this rifle, a cleaning kit, cleaning rod, the correct Polish AK 47 sling, and an unissued Polish bayonet. I'm also including a set of flip up surplus AK 47 night sights, a standard muzzle nut (there is a slant cut muzzle brake on the rifle) and a head space / go-no go gauge. This rifle feeds and fires flawlessly and was hand picked from one of the first AKMS shipments. These are no longer imported and you'd be hard pressed to find a nicer and more complete Polish AK 47 kit.

No trades and no shipping. Face to face cash sale to Vermont residents with valid Vermont ID only. If this posting is still up, the gun is still available. Thanks for looking."

FOR SALE OR TRADE: LIKE-NEW PTR-91, heavily customized, accurized and built to be a compact battle rifle, modified to a ""Congo"" style, or Super-K configuration.

AMERICAN-MADE TO HK SPEC ON ORIGINAL HK MACHINERY

14.5"" barrel, properly pinned and welded to just over 16"". This is not an SBR per ATF's definition and is fully legal to own without extra paperwork, tax stamps, registration, etc.

Barrel re-threading and crowning was performed by Jayson Cotter at Investment Grade Firearms. He's a legend HK smith, Google him if you wish. His reputation speaks for itself.

Muzzle device is a CNC Warrior 8-port brake that drastically reduces the muzzle climb inherent to the .308 round.

Factory-welded picatinny rail for optics mounting.

Buttpad is an HK21-E machine gun wide rubber buttpad.

Inside the stock is an Enhanced Heavy DMR Buffer. Stock buffer will ship with the gun if wanted (spare parts are never a bad thing).

Trigger is a custom match trigger from Bill Springfield (another legend) doing work at 4 lbs, down from 11.5 in the stock military trigger. Makes for some very precise shots and very nice groups, also aids immensely in doling out double and triple-taps on man-sized targets.

Wraparound Hogue Grip has been installed over the Navy polymer pistol grip. It is much more comfortable against the palm. Grip has an added thumb swell to it. Really reduces the beating the hand can take when firing.

Wide German handguard, complete with light steel bipod. Legs fit flush to grooves.

Slimline battle rifle handguard.

Blue Force Gear Larry Vickers VCAS padded sling. This sling is brand new in a Kryptek Mandrake pattern. Still a little stiff in spots. The VCAS is currently standard-issue in the United States Marine Corps for a reason. It's impossible to destroy and comfy as hell. The quick-adjustable pull tab lets you looses up or tighten up in half a second. If you have experience with this sling, you already know. If not, trust me you will feel it the first time you drop it over you. Will ship installed on rifle unless specified otherwise by buyer.

Ships with eight (8) mags, manual and lock in original hardcase.

Fully, properly fluted chamber built to original HK spec on original HK tooling. Will eat ALL ammo you can feed it, steel or brass. Currently has a very low count of about 130 rounds down the pipe, from primo .308 ADI Outback hunting loads to bulk mil-spec 7.62 NATO. Have scored a hair under MOA with several loads inlcuding PPU 150 gr, MKE 7.62 NATO spec (the ZQ1 walmart stuff) and ADI Outback 168 BSPs.

I chose the HK system for this project because of its inherent reliability. It is virtually guaranteed to go bang, all you need is a round in the chamber. No pistons, no gas tubes. The fluting (when properly done as original HK barrels were) ensured cycling with even the worst battlefield pickup ammo. So, if you're looking for a fully tuned, match-grade, compact, hard-hitting, cover and barrier penetrating battle rifle, here it is.

Given the fact that it is used, albeit very slightly, I am open to an offer of 1700 cash.

I ship to FFL and FFL only. Non-negotiable. Please know your laws regarding weapons and mags where you live. No sales to ban states. I apologize for this it is just too difficult and dangerous at this time.

USPS money orders or (discreet) PayPal.

Thank you for your interest. Please do not hesitate to ask any questions or request further pics. Thank you.

Additional info: The Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS pictured in some photos is not included. Please note: I mounted it using low rings and as such removed the rear sight. It is a single philips screw, not complicated putting it back on, but it will have to be re-zeroed.

TRADE: I am also willing to trade for a Springfield M1A Scout Squad with sub-1000 round count, mags and accessories. Email me any time."

If I recall correctly it was produced in 1981 but I might be mistaken. Wood and blueing are beautiful aside from some wear on the receiver. I would say 'good' condition but I am not a professional. It is a beautiful gun with some honest wear.

In the package is 300 rounds of factory American made 150/170 grain SP ammo (Federal mostly, plus some Remington, maybe an odd box of something else). I am getting out of 30-30 as a caliber so the ammo is part of the deal. 

This is an awesome set up to own a great American rifle with plenty of ammo for a guy who likes to have some ammo set aside just in case, a bunch of range trips or a lifetime worth of hunting. 

Doing this to eliminate a caliber in which I only have one rifle and fund a new project."

The UAR is a precision machined upper with a special burnished bore that gives a compacted internal surface with a roughness average in micro inches of 16, as opposed to standard bored or milled uppers that are 32-63, or higher. 
This reduces bolt carrier friction and creates a much smoother operation.
Barrel nut threads, bore and barrel extension surfaces are all machined in one operation so that they are 
perfectly concentric and perpendicular to the barrel and fixing assembly.
The cam pin recess has been carefully designed with a smooth surface that flows into the main reciprocation channel.

Two further flats are machined at 90 degrees to the front face that assist in reducing internal wear to the cam channel.

Standing silver plated figure of Frederick the Great in uniform. This figure was presented in 1940 as a 40-year anniversary gift to an employee in the Dresden Finance Office by co-workers.  The figure is white metal with a silver plate. It measures 12 1/2"" tall and is in excellent, undamaged condition still complete with his walking stick and sword.  The base is hand-engraved in script. It reads: Zum 40 jÃ¤hrigen  DienstjubilÃ¤um ~ Gewidmet v.d. Gefolgschaft b. Finanzamt Dresden-Annenstrasse ~ 19.4.1940.

Fritz has got to be one of the most interesting fellows in history and his likeness is utilized to this day and he can be found just about everywhere, dating a piece to the Reich is difficult at best. Hitler is said to have traveled with two photo's, his mother Clara and Frederick the Great and when you look at him as an historical figure it is not too difficult to understand why. If you take the time to do some reading you will find that he is almost a model for everything Hitler tried to be, some of it successfully for a time but ultimately he fails to meet the bar historically. 

'this is not a reproduction !, very pleasing to look at , may display well in your german military collection. In your mancave ,display case or on your mantel lol. this piece is at least 75 years old!!!

Throwing thus up to see if there is any interest. IWhat I have for sale is a custom built rifle that I built around what I wanted. I built this from the ground up and used quality parts. Gun easily shoots sub MOA with decent ammo. I'm only looking to sell because there are other projects I want to work on and I suffer from gun ADD. Gun has only seen 100 rounds to test for function and accuracy. Paint job is rattle can so you can spray it down with brake cleaner and it'll come off. rice without scope and mount is $950 OBO. Not really looking for trades at this time but I dunno... if the right trade plus cash comes along I may consider it but if it's not a gun don't even ask....

** The control layout of these guns will be familiar to Benelli M2 fans, as it is identical. My understanding is that manufacture and assembly of the Franchi Affinity is done at the Benelli Urbino facility. The Franchi Affinity action differs from the Benelli recoil (inertia) action in one basic aspect: the mainspring is located under the forearm, as opposed to inside the buttstock.

If you are looking for a great gun or just a good investment, you have found it in this Colt Diamondback. These guns are out of production and they are made by Colt, a combination that will only cause these guns to increase in value. Simply economics, supply and demand.
