They built it for me, and I finally took delivery...just days after the flood that destroyed swaths of the city and damaged much more (my home included).  Given the situation, my wife coerced me - at great cost to our relationship - to try and sell the rifle so we can have additional funds for the repairs we need to make to our home.

If you're looking for a PTR 91, you already know what you're getting...virtually the best non-licensed HK91 ""clone"" there is; produced on a combination of original HK tooling and improved tooling designed by PTR Industries themselves.  You won't find a more solid, reliable rifle than this...guaranteed.  (Literally.  The buyer can take advantage of the transferable 2-year end-to-end warranty (with about 23 months left at this point), assuming you feel like paying a $20 transfer/registration fee to the company.  Of course that does not include the already-applicable lifetime warranty on any internal components manufactured by PTR Industries...which are most of them.)

Again, I knew when I received it that I would need to try and sell it, so I have not fired it.  In fact, I have not even removed it from the case other than to drool over it and wish life wasn't so unfair!  

These rifles fetch a premium, and they are worth it.  However, I know that there are some online stores that sell this model for MUCH less than other stores - hundreds less than you can buy them locally, or even used from Cabela's; a smidgen less, in fact, that I paid after a tough negotiation with PTR Industries; shipping; and the transfer fee.  So, given that it IS a new rifle, I am pricing it at exactly what I have in it (apart from 2 boxes of ammo, which you can have for free if you are local).  That may be a hair more than the lowest sale price you can find online, but it breaks even once you pay transfer fees...and it's a person-to-person sale (if you are local).  

If you disagree with my rationale for the pricing, feel free to try and convince me...but bear in mind that this is probably the cheapest PTR 91 you will EVER find...and I had to do the negotiation to make it so.

This listing is for ONE pistol; dealers, law enforcement, and collectors, however, may take any number of very similar model 457s we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no additional shipping charges. Here is the plain jane, Value Series version of the sought after Smith & Wesson 4513 and 4516 series pistols: the model 457. Smith & Wesson manufactured these from 1996 until 2006 only. Construction is Carbon Steel slide with matte blue finish; and black anodized alloy frame. Barrel is 3 3/4 inch satin stainless with the distinctive muzzle collar that has always produced the 4500 series accuracy. This Pistol is traditional double action; from a resting hammer with safety on fire position, first shot is a long smooth double action pull, and the pistol goes to short pull single action after the first shot because the hammer stands cocked until the shooter disengages by throwing the safety lever, which part also serves as a decocker. This pistol also has a firing pin safety to guard against accidental discharge if it is dropped; and a magazine safety so that it cannot fire unless the magazine is in battery. Magazine capacity is 7+1, total 8 shot capacity of .45 ACP caliber ammunition. Hammer is .260 smooth surface factory bobbed, and trigger is .305 smooth faced combat type. Weight empty is 29 ounces; slide thickness measures only .975 inch. Overall length is 7 inches from the muzzle to the end of the grip frame strut; and height is 5 3/8 inches from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the magazine floorplate. Grips are original factory issue black polymer. Surface detractions are moderate, principally edge whitening and light streaking, with contact scouring on the grips. We classify these pistols as Good, perhaps Very Good, 75 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our finish grading. These are well maintained pistols; Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. We estimate they have been fired no more than 1,000 rounds during their tours of duty, no rounds at all for a 4500 series Smith & Wesson. From their VDM to VYL serial number prefixes, these pistols were probably manufactured in 1997, and they served and protected with the Officers of the Syracuse NY Police Department, issued during Chief James T. Foody’s tenure, and serving until Chief Fowler oversaw the transition to the new M&P .40s from Smith & Wesson early in 2013. Replacement pricing on the latest produced variant of this series, the 4513TSW, approached $900 when it was still in production. We’re offering the model 457 in the photos, however, or one of its very similar mates for only $ 389.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California or the District of Colombia.

It has an 18 1/2"" barrel and holds 5rds, takes 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells. This is a Chinese(Norinco) copy of the 870, but costs much less.  For those of you familliar with Norinco, Mak-90, SKS, 1911's used as the base for competition guns etc., you know they are top notch.  Full top rail along with left and right side rails.  You can see the bead sight under the rail as well, in case you are not ready to add sights or an optic, you can still use it as is now.  The rail does add some weight, which will help with recoil, great for home defense, but wouldn't want to walk around with it all day.

Like I said it's a great gun, planned on it to be a deer rifle but I won a remmington 700 in a gun show and plan on using it. Selling this to provide money for a build I'm doing. You can text me at 4one2eight5three6seven3two. Oh yeah, the case comes with it as well, it's a extra bushmaster case I had that I kept it in. I no longer have the original box for this rifle."

 I bought the gun brand-new from Gander two years ago for 899.99.  With the research I've done I can see that they're selling for anywhere between $600 and $800.  I think that considering the condition this gun is in and the fact that I'm sending it with 350 rounds of 40 caliber and a paddle holster I think that 650$ is very fair.

The Tactical Tailor Fight Light line of tactical gear features the same combat tested designs as our regular gear but in a 30% lighter, FR lined package! The Fight Light gear line is contructed of lighter 500 denier Cordura, compared to the 1000 denier material of our regular gear, with strategic reinforcements and flame resistant lining so that it still holds up to whatever punishment you can dish out.

The Fight Light Plate Carrier is constructed from tough lightweight materials for maximum comfort and mobility and lined with FR material for flash flame protection. The inside features a unique molded foam design to channel airflow and improve impact protection. Also features air mesh shoulder strap and side lining for comfort. Vests are custom sized to fit different plate sizes to securely hold armor in place. Includes removable SAPI side plate pockets.

It is a Pre-Cross Bolt Safety rifle with a 22” barrel. Rifling in barrel is shiny and as new. Other than some handling marks on the stock, this rifle would have to be described as “Cherry”. The bluing on the receiver, barrel, and lever, are at least 96 to 98 percent. This rifle was used for two bear hunting seasons and stored in a Gun Safe. I only shot 3 rounds through this rifle to be sure it worked; it does. The Sling in any of the pictures is not included.

Can you buy a NEW “Marlin” for the asking price? Probably, but consider this......what is now known as “Remington Outdoors” owns what was the Marlin Firearms Company. A company consisting of BEAN COUNTERS named Cerebis-the Freedom Group, bought out Marlin, moved all their equipment to the Remington plant in NY State, closed the Marlin plant, and FIRED all the Marlin employees. These bean counters went to work onto cutting corners on what is known as “Remlins” and are putting out an inferior firearm. Former employees of Marlin have stated that after Cerebis took over, many quality control processes were eliminated, and heat treating the ammunition loading and ejection components of the rifle. Gun owners that have bought Remlins have reported that after firing about 200 rounds through their big bores, ammunition cannot be loaded and ejected. Non-heated treated components are probably to blame. Also-the fit and finish of these new Remlins have been inferior to real Marlin Rifles. See for yourself.

For sale, .357 Mag from Smith & Wesson's Performance Center. This is their 8 shot tactical revolver. This is the model with the fixed rail. As typical with Performance Center's pieces, the design, workmanship, fit and finish and stellar. I have owned both the fixed and removable rail version, and liked this one better, but I have to sell. Scandium alloy, with stainless internals, trigger and hammer. I've owned in 8 months and purchased this new. Fired approx 70 rounds of only qualify ammo, and is in perfect working order. This has been well cared for and maintained, and used lightly at the range occasionally. There is a small scratch near the end of the muzzle that you can see in the picture, but other than that blemish, the weapon is flawless. It did not come with the metal case I have seen that come with earlier purchases, but I do have the receipt for purchase, and original case and lock. The R8 is light for its size, feels awesome in the hand, deadly accurate, fun to shoot, kind of unique, and comes with the stuff listed below.

- Surefire X300 tactical light
- Hornady Ammo - Critical Defense, 4 boxes (these things are sick!)
- Armscor Ammo - Precision FMJ, 7 boxes
- Remmington Ammo - UMC, 1 box
- Hogue grips
- Extra batteries for the light (although, I have never had to replace them yet)
- Original safety key
- Balco holster (this was made for a .44, I had to cut it to fix, and never really used it because I was affraid of wearing the finish, but you can have it if you wish

The lower is an Aero Precision brand with Magpul Stock and Magpul Grip. The fire control group is powered by a JP trigger complete with reduced power spring kit. The fun doesn't end there! An short throw ambidextrous safety selector (The Gavel) is just one of many ""extras"" on this gun. Ares Armor provided the lower parts kit.  An oversized billet trigger guard allows for continuous firing even while wearing gloves. On top of that, the rear takedown pin is oversized and has a hole in it to accept a ring, paracord, or whatever else you might want to add in assisting removal for cleaning and maintenance. One last note on the lower.  Under the grip is a set screw with a nylon buffer on it.  By mounting the upper and then  screwing this down until it bumps the upper, you can then expect a tight lockup between receivers and better overall accuracy. Cool aye?  The upper half of this handsome devil is anchored by a Quentin Defense upper, a Nickel Boron BCG, and a BCM Gunfighter charging handle with a large latch for easy, one handed charging with a mounted scope. The barrel is fitted with a Kaw Valley Precision muzzle device and shrouded by a Seekins Precision free float quad rail handguard. The gun has seen less than 20 rounds and that's only because I only had time to test for reliability and a brief accuracy test. It is easily holding sub MOA at 100 yards. As the barrel is broken in I would expect it to stay that way and actually improve. This began as a project to use the extra parts I already had on hand  and blossomed into a very enjoyable build.  Selling to make space for more; and I want to build a pistol. Will sacrifice for 800 and I'm pretty solid on that number.  Im going to kick in 60 rounds of ammo as well to get you off on the right foot. Not particularly interested in trades at this time, but since your already reading this, and since 98% of the members of these groups are allergic to cash, you may as well make your trade offers visible and I'll consider them.

I have a Colt New Frontier in 22LR with the very handy 4 5/8"" barrel. Frame is case-hardened steel with a blued barrel and cylinder. 

This is NOT an aluminum or zinc frame.

It is not a collector's piece but more of a very well-kept shooter.  I think of it like this:  It's not pretty enough to be a safe queen, there is some blueing wear at the muzzle.  But, the rest of the blueing and case hardening is gorgeous so it is almost too pretty to shoot.   So I am making room for something I don't feel bad about shooting.

Serial number marks it born in 1974 according to Colt web site.

I can send more pictures if you would like.  The one picture I have here does not do the blue and case hardening justice.

You must be able to legally own a handgun in TX and can meet in the Austin (preferable SW) area.

Smith and Wesson model 5906 stainless steel in 9mm.  Ex-law enforcement pistol (I got this from the police officer who was allowed to buy this from his department when they upgraded).  It was carried much more than shot, with a couple shiny spots of holster wear and the grips a bit worn.  Includes night sights which are still visible, original magazine, 3 brand new in package after-market mags, and a holster with a spare mag pouch on it.

Pistol functions perfectly.  Cash price is firm.  The only trade I may consider is an AK-47 (may add cash if it's brand new or worth significantly more, but these pistols sell for quite a bit more than I'm asking so don't expect a wad of cash for a WASR or similar low-end gun).
