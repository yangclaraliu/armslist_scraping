The scope has served me well but I am going to upgrade to something with a Horus reticle.

It is a 3-12 and has the Nikoplex reticle. That is just your standard cross hair. 1/4 MOA adjustments. What I liked most about the scope is the fact that it has the side focus which allows you to focus on your target from 50 yards to infinity. The reticle focus is on the eyepiece.

With the purchase I will also include the Burris Signature Zee rings you see in the picture. Rifle not included.

$300.00 and it is yours. Or you can buy new for $400+ without the quality rings I am including. FTF only sorry."

We've been using the term ""rare"" a lot the past six months to refer to guns that were easily obtainable last Fall. Everything has gotten harder to find. This pistols was NEVER easy to find and it's completely impossible now. I stumbled across it late one night on a supplier's web site and picked up immediately. 
There are a handful of P99C ""AS"" models out there, but I haven't seen a ""QA"" (Quick Action) in a very long time. 
This variant has a Glock style trigger system with a pre-loaded internal striker. When the trigger is pulled, the striker is fully cocked and released, firing the pistol. The trigger travel is approximately 8 mm (0.3 in) with a trigger pull of approximately 38 N (8.5 lbf). The trigger pull is consistent in length and force from the first shot to the last. The P99QA was announced in 2000 and discontinued in 2011.

This is a very good barrel. I bought from AR15performance.com. This barrel is a .223 wylde barrel meaning it shoots both .223 Rem and 5.56. This is also melonite treated which is better that chrome lining it is easier to clean and it doesn't sacrifice loss of accuracy which chrome lining does. It has a 1 in 8 twist so you can shoot your lower gr. bullets to higher. A 1 in 7 twist stabilizes 62gr. and over well but sometimes not so well with 55gr which a 1 in 9 twist will do better, but a 1 in 9 twist doesn't stabilize 70gr. and over well so a 1 in 8 twist gives you best of both worlds. Finally it has a 5R polygonal pattern inside so the bullet shoots better down this barrel and sticks to the grooves better to make it shoot straighter. You can check out Ar15performance.com to see what I am talking about.

This set includes a wmd melonite mid lenght wmd gas tube and a carbine length BCM gas tube. Also a BCM barrel nut. 

I will only sell the set together I need to get rid of this and I don't want to sell the barrel only and be stuck with the other parts. I am selling them exactly what i bought them for and I have receipts also.

The inside coating of nickel boron makes it easier to clean and makes the BCG slide better inside. Along with the WMD receiver comes a BCM ejection port assembly kit and BCM forward assist. 

I will not sell separate sorry i don't want to sell a part and then be stuck with the others. Besides this is everything that's needed anyways to complete this stripped upper. I have receipts to prove parts are bcm also. Please text REDACTED or email. thanks.

For sale I have two pistols I picked up in a trade I have no use for. First is a great carry gun in a Kel-Tec PF-9. I was planning on keeping this for a carry piece as it discreetly fits into the pocket but it doesn't fit my hands well. Previous owner told me it was carried but hardly ever fired. Gun looks new and comes with everything as new including extra mag floor plate, trigger lock, dissassembly tools, and instruction manual. Price is $200 firm. Next is a very neat surplus pistol in a 9x18 MM Makorov I believe these pistols date to the Cold War era so this firearm is most likely from the 50s or 60s. Very nice condition with a beautifully blued slide. Included with the sale will be 122 rounds of 9x18 Makorov ammo. Price is $275.00 with ammo and $225 without as these little pistols are all dried up and very hard to find and are bringing $300 and over on gunbroker without ammo. Will sell both for $425.00. Will consider trades for a small carry pistol in 9mm. Pistols must be transferred and buyer will be responsible for all fees incurred.  E-mail, call, or text REDACTED."

Springfield Armory 40S&W Sub Compact XD, with 3"" Barrel, Black Finish, and XD gear system*. This sub-compact 3"" XD pistol is the ultimate in self defense firearms. The shortest carry polymer pistol in the world that features the only light rail in its class.

*The Springfield XD Gear System consists of: XD Gear Belt Holster, XD Gear Double Magazine Pouch, XD Gear Magazine Loader, Two Magazines, and Cable Lock (retail value of the XD Gear System is $79.95)

The Brass Stacker SLIDE PULL™ Patent Pending (Springfield Charging Handle) assists in the charging of pistols for individuals who have difficulty grasping factory slide serrations and for those in tactical or competitive situations utilizing pistol scopes, laser grips, or operation in wet, slippery conditions. In the event they have suffered injury, Law Enforcement and Military personnel may find it a useful addition to their back-up weapon. Racking the slide of a pistol with the Slide Pull™ allows you to maintain safe muzzle control while charging your weapon. With the ambidextrous Slide Pull™ you simply pull straight back, giving you much greater control when chambering a round. The Slide Pull™ features a comfortable, low profile, ergonomic design with sleek look and strong, large pull ring. It does not obscure your sight picture and is easily acquired, even in darkness. The Slide Pull™ will not snag on clothing and does not interfere with most holsters. It securely clamps to slide serrations. CNC machined from lightweight 6061 aluminum with a hard coat black anodized finish. 

The LG Laserguard® is designed to fit both lines in all sizes and calibers. Featuring instinctive activation, the laser sight immediately springs to life when held in a normal firing grip. Attaching firmly to the trigger guard and balanced against the accessory rail notch, the LG- can be zeroed by the user to their individual firearm (both windage and elevation) and has been rigorously tested to hold zero under the most demanding field conditions.

I also have Cross Breed Left handed SuperTuck® Deluxe & Ohai Modular Holster"

Posting a couple things for my father-in-law, Bob. He's put me to the task of handling this for him, but he's the guy who will be doing the transfer at the FFL with you. Just doing him a favor since I'm more familiar with the website.

Here is a Smith & Wesson model 22A in .22LR, with a 7"" barrel.

It was purchased new about a year ago. Fired casing dated 4/26/12. Gun is in like new condition, functions perfectly, and only has about 200 rounds through it with very minimal wear. Comes with two mags, original box and all paperwork - everything that was included when bought new.

Looking to sell for $250 OBO, or will trade (+ cash if necessary) for a Ruger .22LR semi-auto pistol. Trying to keep the trade as close as possible in value.

Willing to meet within a reasonable distance of King of Prussia/Conshohocken, with afternoons/evenings during the week preferred. Able to meet in the Morgantown/Reading area on weekends.

Will not ship, no PayPal or similar. Cash or trade in person only. Serious inquiries only, please.

Thanks,
