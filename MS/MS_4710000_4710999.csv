It does have a few minor handling marks and has been fired. Nothing serious. The wood is beautiful, really. I'm the second owner. I fired 2 rounds through it, cleaned it and put it back away. FIRM on price. Cheaper ones are at pawn shops, and look like it. This WILL make someone very happy."

In great condition and shoots as good as the day it was purchased. Today and lens are in great condition and it has been adult owned and maintained by a photography professional.

For those that don't know or are going to ask....Yes, this camera shoots HD video and has a ton of manual control. I have shot ALL of my hunting/outdoors/how-to videos using this camera. I have also used it for photographing events and it is still to this day one of my favorite Canon bodies. If you need more control then this camera offers, you can install Magic Lantern. 

Camera has been reset with the latest firmware and is charged and ready to go. I am only selling/trading because I purchased a 7D Mark II and I would rather pass this one along to someone instead of it collecting dust.

Comes with one Canon battery, lens caps, body cap, and charger. No box, manuals, or paperwork.

Location is 28374, please research before contacting me. I am willing to drive within 30-40 minutes to meet for right deal but would prefer a local meeting at a reasonable time and place. I am flexible.

Cash price is listed, I do have some wiggle room but would rather keep it then take a huge loss. Trade value is same as cash value.

NCDL and Purchase Permits in hand....Bill of sale expected on any firearm trades."

Honestly, this is a great gun, but I need to make some money for school. It feeds and ejects reliably. It's compact and SUPER lightweight. The only thing needed is the optic of your choice. It's great for hunting, or as a SHTF gun because .308 Winchester is a common round. You could even squeeze it into the scout rifle category. As above, it comes with a sling, a bipod, scope rings, an extra magazine, snap caps, and a soft carry case. It's easy to clean and has an adjustable trigger. The original user manual is included. Plus, you get 120 rounds of .308 to sight in your gun and get familiar with it. Email me if you have questions OR WANT TO MAKE AN OFFER . Thanks!!!"

This is NOT a Mosquito or a 1911 22. This is a full-fledged Sig 226 in 22LR. You can swap the slide off of 226 9mm or 40 S&W and put it on this beaver tail frame. The frame is no different than any other Sig. It's the slide that is different and is 22LR. Comes with everything that came with it new. Case, 2 magazines, etc. Gun has way less than 300 rounds through it.

Kinda' hard to find. Looking for a Sig 938 in 9mm or 22LR, or a like-new Kel-Tec PMR30 in case. Other offers ok but not any muzzle-loaders, Bows, single-shot anything. Don't really want gun plus cash offers but you can try. No XD's, Glocks, M&P's. Your trade needs to be $450 value. Long guns OK but no Ak's, SKS's or 22's. Location is Jeffersonville, IN. Thanks.

Also, Somebody asked me what kind of ammo the gun ""likes"". I've never shot anything out of it besides CCI minimags. So here's a video of the gun shooting 5 Fiocchi's and 5 Armscor's. I shot many more today and the gun operated as flawless as any Sig. Video link below.

If the video doesn't come up you MUST copy and paste this address into the URL window.....the ""www"" bar at the top of your browser window.

It comes with a long adjustable weight and  2 magazines 1 blued and 1 stainless which is heavier. The man I bought it from is a farmer who used it for small pests on his property. He kept it in a holster and it shows some ware on the barrel along with a small dent. Of course, this has nothing to do with it's accuracy! Super Accurate! The weight and magazines alone are worth $100. Pictures are provided! Will meet somewhere local as long as it's reasonable.

I bought this scope few days ago for my new coming rifle, but after I got my new Anschutz rifle yesterday I think 30mm tube ring that design for anschutz 11mm dovetail base is pretty not easy to match. The scope is extraordinary design from Vortex, but it is not fit for my German style rifle base.

The MSRP of this scope is $899 now offering $479 for local pick up or $489 for shipping inside of United States. The item was unused, never mounted on a rifle before. Also it comes with original receipt and vortex lifetime warranty. The return was not accepted at this time. 

Prefer certified check or chase quick pay, or paypal friend to friend money transfer. Prefer local pick up, or I will use USPS priority mail to ship it to you."

Asking $1,499. Located in Manchester NH. Rated one of the top ten Bullpups from Tactical-Life.com. A real head turner and pleasure to shoot. Low round count on this like new rifle.

All the benefits of a high powered SBR. Short form factor, better weight distribution to the rear and the accuracy and reach of a full length barrel, without the extra cost of a tax stamp or being on Big Brother's short list.

This is a multi use rifle just at home in a tactical situation as it is in your favorite hunting spot. 

The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. 

The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.
