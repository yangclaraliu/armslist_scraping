Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-set price and with no additional shipping charges. Photos show off white polymer, imitation ivory replacement grips to fit S&W models 469 and 669 pistols chambered in 9mm caliber. Smith & Wesson only produced the 469 and 669 compacts between 1983 and 1988, but they were immensely popular and without peer. These little guns are so durable, they will be in service as long as any of our readers shall live. These are replacement panels, virtually identical to most of the issue grips except without logo. Construction is hard off white or ivory color polymer with standard size reverse detent risers, and with checkered texture lower panels. Since a person has to disassemble the pistol and its grip frame to install them, we advise at least consulting howto com or a credible disassembly video. These grips will only fit Smith & Wesson Model 469 and 669 pistols. They will Not fit a Smith & Wesson model 3913, will Not fit a model 6906, will Not fit a model 59, will Not fit the nozzle of a 1966 Fleet’s brand saline bottle. They will only fit S&W 469 and 669 pistols chambered in 9mm, often known as the Mini. Grips for any discontinued Smith & Wesson pistol are not easy to find, and these are among the most difficult. From our poor memory, no one made imitation ivory grips for the Minis, even when they were in production by S&W.

And yeah- we all know thats +tax and such, BUT thats with a receipt guaranteeing warranty coverage and/or return to the dealer if necessary.

However-
I want to sell my pistol, but am unwilling to bargain and accept that the moment I sell it to you, the warranty will be (technically and legally, for all intents and purposes) VOID, as most manufactures are not obligated to honor their warranty for secondhand guns.
Also, unlike the dealership which I had to pay the taxes and fees at, I want to sell you this gun for retail cost with no guarantee whatsoever.

But I still want my money back, and I want it from YOU, even tho I'm not offering the same value.

And don't you DARE offer me a fair private sale price on my secondhand gun.


Can you blame anyone for just going to the dealer when the entire point of private sales in the first place is to try to save money by NOT paying the premiums and taxes?

Why would anyone in their right mind pay retail for a gun secondhand, even BNIB or LNIB, when in fact, the VALUE of the gun is less?"

The Russian ammo your AK was designed to use. Steel cases and part steel jacket or metal core as a magnet attracts it. Walmart sells it for $5.69 a box and Bass Pro is a bit more. They also add tax. This ammo is $4 a box cash in your hand but sold as a lot, so $100 gets you 500 rounds. If you are stockpiling some ammo, this is the best as they laquer seal the bullet and primer pocket for long term storage. Also, the steel cases are polymer coated for super easy feeding. I don't think there is anyplace selling this ammo this low and except for those stores mentioned above, all of the online sources have shipping charges that add up to a decent percent of the total.  Prefer a local FTF transaction, though I will ship if the buyer wants to pay for shipping. Its at least $12 and may be in the $14-$15 range though i am unsure of the exact amount now. $100 even gets you 500 rounds to shoot or store for when it will be needed"

LIVE BIRD GUN, TOM SMITH WOOD, GOLD INLAY

General Specs: Perazzi, Year 1999, 12 Gauge, 8lbs 10oz, Over Under
Serial Number: 86078

Here we have an as new, barely fired, high end Perazzi MX9 special order gun, which is the same gun as the MX8.  Set up as a fine sporting clays gun or live bird gun with fixed chokes and  8lb. 10oz. weight, balanced on the hinge pin.  Built in 1999 and cased in an Americase, the gun has seen little use. The previous owner had many fine guns and really never used this one.   The 99% metal finishes, drop out trigger group, flame figured exhibition American black walnut stocks with fancy Flor-de-lis checkering make this an attractive Perazzi over/under.  Tom Smith built this custom, rollover style Monte Carlo stock with a parallel comb to reduce felt recoil while shooting heavy pigeon loads.  Tom Smith is a highly touted custom stock maker and this creation is over $5500 in custom wood.  The bottom of the receiver is nicely engraved with a large raised gold pigeon inlay to dress it up.  This gun also has a tapered rib, flat main springs for the fastest lock times, and a 30 day shooting warranty.  With only a few light handling marks in the wood, the gun is near new.  Perazzi is the accepted leader in the target gun world, with incredible durability and more Olympic and International awards than any other gun maker.  The value of this gun will hold or increase, as the cost of new Perazzi guns continues to rise.  This is essentially a brand new gun!"

Unlike many QD systems, it is fully adjustable to fit Weaver and MIL-STD-1913 dovetails.The patent pending design allows you to adjust the tension to accommodate out of spec or worn dovetails. In tests, the Accucam Locking Lever System has shown to be repeatable to 1/2 MOA. The unique finger loop lever is easily operated, even with a gloved hand and the rounded design is ergonomic and virtually snag proof. The Accucam mechanism is manufactured from solid billet 4140 steel and manganese phosphated matte black per mil-spec.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GG&G AC-30 ACCUCAM MOUNTING BASE WITH INTEGRAL 30 MM SCOPE RINGS"

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comWe think the new Aimpoint Micro T-1 is a great tactical scope. It has a downside however, the scope design does not accommodate flip up lens covers; you cannot purchase any that fit. Yes it comes with the bikini lens covers, but most individuals will loose those in the first month, and they are not the easist lens covers to remove, keep in place or reinstall. GG&G has a very unique solution, so unique that it has a patent pending. An Accucam Quick Detach T-1 Mount that includes a built in provision that provides for the installation of a flip up lens cover for the ocular end. In addition to the ocular lens cover being included, the kit also includes a specially prepared flip up lens cover that fits the objective lens. The Aimpoint QD T-1 Mount easily and solidly installs onto the lightweight GG&G Accucam QD mount with four 3mm screws. The installation wrench is included in the kit. The ocular end of the T-1 scope fits perfectly into the small integral lens cover flange, and while providing the means to mount a flip up lens cover, it does not interfere with the field of view. The T-1 mount is manufactured from solid billet 6061 T6 aluminum and is Type III hard coat anodized matte black per mil-spec. The New GG&G Aimpoint T-1 QD Mount is manufactured to mount directly to the AR15/M16 integral rail.

The GG&G Accucam QD Locking Lever System provides you with a solid method to quickly install or remove the Aimpoint T-1 from the weapon. The scope can quickly be installed on a dovetail rail in seconds by rotating the Accucam Lever to the locked position. It can then be quickly removed by rotating the Accucam Cam Lever to the unlocked position. Unlike other QD lever systems, it is fully adjustable to fit Weaver and MIL-STD-1913 dovetails.

The integral rings on the Accucam Base for a bolt gun are spaced at 4.400 inches center to center. The height from the top of the dovetail to the centerline of the ring is 1.060 inches. Both QD Mounting bases are designed and manufactured to meet the rigors of combat and professional use. They are manufactured from solid billet 6061 T6 aluminum alloy and have a Type III hard coat anodized matte black mil-spec finish. All edges have been dehorned to protect the operator. The 30mm rings are an integral part of the base, not machined separately and stuck on the base. The ring caps are held solidly in place with four socket head cap screws. The Accucam QD Locking Lever System provides you with a solid method to quickly install or remove the mounting base from the weapon system. The base can be quickly installed on a dovetail rail in seconds by rotating the Accucam Cam Lever to the locked position. It can then be quickly removed by rotating the Accucam Cam Lever to the unlocked position. It is fully adjustable to fit Weaver and MIL-STD-1913 dovetails. The unique design allows you to adjust the tension to accommodate out of spec or worn dovetails. In tests, the Accucam Locking Lever System has shown to be repeatable to 1/2 MOA. The unique finger loop design is easily operated, even with a gloved hand and the rounded design is ergonomic and virtually snag proof. The Accucam mechanism is manufactured from solid billet 4140 steel and manganese phosphated matte black per mil-spec. Detachable scope mounts and dovetail mounts are manufactured in the USA at GG&G's Tucson Arizona factory. Our products are tested in the field and trusted by military and law enforcement personnel, so you can count on your QD mounting base to work as promised under critical conditions.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GG&G ACCUCAM QD INTEGRAL RING BASE FOR BOLT GUNS"

The original 357’s and the wildly popular 44 Specials have been highly prized for their smaller dimensions and great balance. Now, you can have this classic revolver in the most classic sixgun cartridge of them all, the 45 Colt.This is the first Ruger Flattop made in stainless steel with a 4 5/8″ barrel and is the first stainless steel Flattop chambered in 45 Colt. As of right now, this is the only Ruger 45 Colt stainless steel single action revolver with adjustable sights being produced. The regular stainless steel Blackhawk in 45 Colt was discontinued by Ruger several years ago.As a bonus, we spec’d out these guns to include an auxillary 45 ACP cylinder. This production run will also feature “gunfighter” style simulated ivory grips that Ruger has used on some of their special edition guns, such as the Joe Bowman commemorative. For those of you who don’t like the “cheesegrater” (as some people call them) black plastic grips that have been included on the Flattops, this will be a nicer feel. The front sights on these 45 Colt revolvers are taller than the sights on the 44 Specials revolvers so that there is plenty of elevation available for various bullet weights. On this stainless version, the front sight is pinned into the base so you can switch the front sight out for other heights or configurations that work best for you. All parts, including the gripframe and ejector rod housing are made out of a brushed finish stainless steel.We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $619.SPECIFICATIONS:MFG Model No:5243Family:Blackhawk SeriesModel:Blackhawk FlattopType:RevolverAction:Single ActionCaliber:45 ACP | 45 ColtCapacity:6Finish:StainlessFrame:Steel FrameGrip:Simulated IvorySights:AdjustableBarrel Length: 4 5/8″Case:PlasticAdditional Info:Mid-Size Flattop FrameAdditional Info:XR-3 Gripframe"

Having a primary optic with the capability to be quickly attached and detached from a weapon system, while still maintaining ""on target"" repeatability, provides a degree of tactical flexibility highly valued in urban combat. The rugged EOTech holographic sights are excellent choices for a ""red dot"" optic. However up until now, adding some type of quick detach mechanism meant mounting the sight on some other mounting platform that raised the EOTech at least another 1/2"" above the bore. Besides adversely affecting cheek weld, mounting the EOTech in this manner no longer allowed the shooter to co-witness the EOTech sight with the back up iron sights of the weapon system. Because the patented Accucam QD System replaces the existing mounting screw and thumbnut system of the EOTech, it does not add any height to the optic. The EOTech Accucam QD Mounting System from GG&G is the only QD Lever System available today that does not add height to the EOTech. This patented, unique and innovative quick detach system retrofits directly to the body of the EOTech. The GG&G EOTech Accucam QD Locking Lever System replaces the EOTech socket head screw or thumbnut attachment method. No other modifications are required. The Accucam system installs in approximately ten minutes. The only tools required are a 7/64"" allen wrench and a torx head wrench, which are both included in the kit. This system fits new and existing EOTech sights that have the protective shroud and only adds three ounces. It is fully adjustable to fit Weaver and MIL-STD-1913 dovetails, even those that are worn or out of spec. Once installed on the EOTech the sight can be quickly installed on a dovetail rail in seconds by rotating the Accucam Cam Lever to the locked position. It can then be quickly removed by rotating the Accucam Cam Lever to the unlocked position. In tests, the EOTech Accucam Locking Lever System has shown to be repeatable to less than 1/2 MOA. The unique finger loop design is easily operated, even with a gloved hand and the rounded design is ergonomic and virtually snag-proof. Manufactured from solid billet 4140 steel and manganese phosphated matte black to mil spec, the GG&G Accucam QD Locking Lever System provides a solid, rugged quick detach system for your EOTech. GG&G's EOTech Accucam QD Mount is a preferred upgrade for anyone with an EOTech 511, 512, 551 or 552 scope.

This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comMany shooters feel the standard AR15 removable front sights are cumbersome to use, too easily misplaced, and distracting when optical sights are deployed. The GG&G Flip Up Front Sight For Dovetailed Gas Blocks is easy to install, simple to deploy, weighs in at only 3.2 ounces and includes a mechanical locking detent system. It can easily be installed by the operator onto the AR-15 dovetailed gas block with only an allen wrench, which is included. Once installed, it can remain in place, as it can be raised or lowered instantly. Protective ears are provided for the sight with gripping serrations to more easily raise and lower the sight assembly in combat environments. With the mechanical locking detent, the front sight cannot be accidentally lowered. To lower the sight the operator only has to push a button. When in the upright position it provides the same command height as the original AR15 or M16 front sight and can be co-witnessed with red dot optics. To insure flexibility, we use standard military sight components in this combat ready sight. The GG&G Flip Up Front Sight For Dovetailed Gas Blocks is manufactured from solid 4140 billet chrome moly steel and is bead blasted and manganese phosphated to provide a non-reflective, corrosion resistant matte black finish meeting mil-spec requirements. All edges have been dehorned to protect the shooter, making this AR15 rail mount front sight one of the most popular among shooters in civilian, police, and military circles. An optional Trijicon tritium front sight post can also be added to enhance low light shooting capability.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GG&G FRONT FLIP UP SIGHT FOR DOVETAIL GAS BLOCKS"

This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comThe GG&G MAD (Multiple Aperture Device) BUIS (Back Up Iron Sight) was originally developed to fulfill a request from Naval Surface Warfare for a battle ready low profile back up iron sight that provided both a large and small aperture on the same plane and provide co-witness capability with the majority of red dot optics.The MAD has four apertures, two of each size (so that rotating the aperture disc in either direction will bring the next size into view). All apertures are on the same plane and are thus zeroed to the same point of impact. The aperture disc is knurled for easier manipulation in combat environments. The small aperture diameter is 0.073-inch and the large aperture is 0.199-inch in diameter. The standard military windage knob and windage screw are used. One click of the windage knob provides approximately 0.48 MOA change when mounted on the M16A2E4 rifle and about 0.65 MOA on the M4 carbine.The MAD mount body is CNC manufactured from billet 6061 T6 aluminum alloy and Type III hard coat anodized in a non-reflective black mil-spec finish to provide combat durability. The stem and aperture disc are made from solid billet 4140 steel and have hardened wear points for long service life. All steel components are black manganese phosphated per mil-spec. The MAD overhangs the rear of the receiver by 0.200-inch. This provides a lip so that the sight can be easily deployed even with a gloved hand. The sight stem locks in the up position with a positive mechanical detent system. Once placed in the up position, the sight cannot be folded down without depressing the spring assisted detent release button located on the left side of the sight base. This totally eliminates the possibility of accidentally lowering the sight.The MAD is the lowest profile BUIS with a locking detent and weighs in just over two ounces. It is now available with an option for Trijicon Tritium night sight inserts. The MAD is used by elite armed forces and law enforcement teams word wide. Don’t forget it is compatible with the AR10.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GG&G MULTIPLE APTERTURE DEVICE (MAD) FLIP-UP REAR BACKUP IRON SIGHT"

Solid squeeze rail attachment mechanism with solid crossbolt. The Ranging Multiple Aperture Device can be used as a co-witness iron sight with most red dot sighting systems.

When in the up position, the sight cannot be folded down without depressing the spring assisted detent release button located on the left side of the sight base, eliminating the possibility of accidentally lowering the sight. The Ranging Apertures are preset to the ranges indicated below using ballistic calculations for 55 grain through 62 grain ammunition when used in the AR-15/M16 16” rifle/carbine length weapon. The unique rotating multiple aperture disc has five apertures preset to specific distances, specifically, 0=25 & 200 yards, 3=300 yards, 4=400 yards, 5=500 yards, and 6=600 yards. The 25 and 200 yd apertures are .158” diameter, all others are .069” diameter. A range indicating window facing the shooter, provides a numerical cue for the shooter. The aperture disc is knurled for easier manipulation in combat environments. The Ranging MAD overhangs the rear of the receiver by 0.200-inch providing a lip, allowing the sight to be easily deployed even with a gloved hand. A tactile windage knob is used, with one click of the windage knob providing approximately 0.48 MOA change when mounted on the M16A2E4 rifle and about 0.65 MOA when mounted on the M4 carbine. The initial zero is set by adjusting the weapons front sight post. All hard edges have been deburred and softened for the shooters safety.

Here we have an as new, barely fired, high end Perazzi MX9 special order gun, which is the same gun as the MX8.  Set up as a fine sporting clays gun or live bird gun with fixed chokes and  8lb. 10oz. weight, balanced on the hinge pin.  Built in 1999 and cased in an Americase, the gun has seen little use. The previous owner had many fine guns and really never used this one.   The 99% metal finishes, drop out trigger group, flame figured exhibition American black walnut stocks with fancy Flor-de-lis checkering make this an attractive Perazzi over/under.  Tom Smith built this custom, rollover style Monte Carlo stock with a parallel comb to reduce felt recoil while shooting heavy pigeon loads.  Tom Smith is a highly touted custom stock maker and this creation is over $5500 in custom wood.  The bottom of the receiver is nicely engraved with a large raised gold pigeon inlay to dress it up.  This gun also has a tapered rib, flat main springs for the fastest lock times, and a 30 day shooting warranty.  With only a few light handling marks in the wood, the gun is near new.  Perazzi is the accepted leader in the target gun world, with incredible durability and more Olympic and International awards than any other gun maker.  The value of this gun will hold or increase, as the cost of new Perazzi guns continues to rise.  This is essentially a brand new gun!"

This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comThe GG&G MAD (Multiple Aperture Device) BUIS (Back Up Iron Sight) was originally developed to fulfill a request from Naval Surface Warfare for a battle ready low profile back up iron sight that provided both a large and small aperture on the same plane and provide co-witness capability with the majority of red dot optics.The MAD has four apertures, two of each size (so that rotating the aperture disc in either direction will bring the next size into view). All apertures are on the same plane and are thus zeroed to the same point of impact. The aperture disc is knurled for easier manipulation in combat environments. The small aperture diameter is 0.073-inch and the large aperture is 0.199-inch in diameter. The standard military windage knob and windage screw are used. One click of the windage knob provides approximately 0.48 MOA change when mounted on the M16A2E4 rifle and about 0.65 MOA on the M4 carbine.The MAD mount body is CNC manufactured from billet 6061 T6 aluminum alloy and Type III hard coat anodized in a non-reflective black mil-spec finish to provide combat durability. The stem and aperture disc are made from solid billet 4140 steel and have hardened wear points for long service life. All steel components are black manganese phosphated per mil-spec. The MAD overhangs the rear of the receiver by 0.200-inch. This provides a lip so that the sight can be easily deployed even with a gloved hand. The sight stem locks in the up position with a positive mechanical detent system. Once placed in the up position, the sight cannot be folded down without depressing the spring assisted detent release button located on the left side of the sight base. This totally eliminates the possibility of accidentally lowering the sight.The MAD is the lowest profile BUIS with a locking detent and weighs in just over two ounces. It is now available with an option for Trijicon Tritium night sight inserts. The MAD is used by elite armed forces and law enforcement teams word wide. Don’t forget it is compatible with the AR10. Large aperture has two tritium night sight dots.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GG&G MULTIPLE APTERTURE DEVICE (MAD) FLIP-UP REAR BACKUP IRON SIGHT WITH TRITIUM"

This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comThese GG&G optical mounting rails were designed to mount easily over the integral rails of the AR15/M16 flat top receiver and work in conjunction with any of our back up iron sights. As they raise the line of sight by 1/2 inch, they offer a proper cheek weld when optical devices are attached. In addition, they serve to protect the flat top receiver's integral rails from the damaging wear associated with lever type quick-release mounts, especially those without buffer pads. Overall length is 7 inches. The Scout length rail extends two inches beyond the handguards and clears the M4 forearm. It was developed to accommodate long-eye-relief scout-type scopes and also Aimpoint red dot sights with night vision monoculars mounted to their rear. They are manufactured from billet 6061 T6 aluminum alloy, black Type III hard-coat anodized per Mil-Spec, and meet MIL-STD-1913. These rails lock onto the flat top receiver by means of a full locking side bar and two round head socket head screws. This provides both a positive and perfectly aligned lock-up even on well-worn receiver rails. The socket head wrench required for installation is included.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GG&G SCOUT LENGTH PICATINNY SCOPE MOUNTING RAIL"

This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comThe New GG&G A2 Spring Actuated BUIS (Back Up Iron Sight) is the latest evolution in our BUIS product line. Many operators requested that we manufacture an A2 BUIS that would deploy with just a push of a button. We think we have successfully fulfilled that request. The unique and proprietary design of the mechanism allows the actuator spring and mechanical components to be captivated and therefore not be open to the environmental elements. The sight not only springs into an on target position with just the push of the actuator button, but it also locks solidly into the upright on target position. Another push of the button and the lock is released allowing you to set the sight into the locked down position. The sight cannot be folded down without depressing the actuator button located on the left side of the sight base. This totally eliminates the possibility of accidentally lowering the sight.The New GG&G A2 Spring Actuated BUIS provides the operator with an easy-to-install push button operated flip up rear sight. The Spring Actuated A2 BUIS can be used as a stand-alone sight or in conjunction with one of our interface rails. It can also be used as a co-witness iron sight with most red dot sighting systems. Weighing in at just over 2.4 ounces, this sight features the standard military A2-style double peep aperture which allows for end user known point of impact. The sight has full windage adjustment with standard military windage knob and windage screw. No need to retrain when using this sight. One click of the windage knob provides approximately 0.48 MOA change when mounted on the M16A2E4 rifle and about 0.65 MOA on the M4 carbine. Initial zero is set by adjusting the weapons front sight post. It is low profile so that when in the down position, it will clear most optics. The mount body and sight stem are manufactured from solid billet 6061 T6 aluminum alloy and Type III hard coat anodized in a non-reflective black mil-spec finish to provide combat durability. All steel components are black manganese phosphated per mil-spec.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GG&G SPRING ACTUATED A2 BACK UP IRON SIGHT (BUIS)"

All products are new and in original packaging unless otherwise indicated. We do not accept any trades. All listings are for SALE ONLY. All sales are online only and can not be picked up in person. This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comGRIFFIN ARMAMENT FAIL SAFE ANGLE SIGHTSAngle sights are meant as a secondary option to optical sights in the top rail sight plane. By adding a sighting system to an alternate plane you have additional insurance that your sights will be there when something is going wrong with your primary, be it loss of power, occlusion from fog, mud, dirt, snow, or even damage. An additional sight plane is like having an alternate route on a mission plan. Armed professionals don't start a mission without alternate routes and they shouldn't run their guns without back up sights. Why fixed sights? Fixed sights are always there. You don't have to worry about them being inadvertently folded down or forgetting to deploy them. Many veteran soldiers are obsessive pertaining to pre combat checks and inspections. Even missing a spare battery from their kit load out would require correction. This measure of attention to detail is a reality when your life is on the line every day. Fixed sights negate the need to have anxiety over whether you have deployed your sights and if they will be there when you need them. Griffin Fail Safe sights are fully adjustable from the rear housing with no tools. This does two things for the user. You don't have to scrape your elbows up in the prone to make front sight adjustments, and it keeps the billet front post perfectly in the center of the HK style loop for an extremely fast target acquisition. The flush mounted coin slot windage wont be inadvertently adjusted out of zero, and the elevation aperture is finger adjustable in 180 degree rotations for tool-less function and ease.The Fail Safe front sight has a lobed geometry to accommodate military lasers mounted in the 12 o'clock position. Combat apertures are typically too large to get a decent sight picture unless firing at an extremely close range. Likewise the common 300m apertures are too small and slow for mid range work where most of the engagements on the battlefield are taking place. Our aperture size is between a combat and 300 meter aperture making it extremely fast, yet accurate for close to mid range work. Transitions with pinpoint accuracy on targets from point blank out to 300 meters are instantaneous with the Fail Safe sight picture Features  Billet Machined 6061 T6 housings Type III Hardcoat Mil-Spec Anodizing 17-4 PH stainless steel internals parts Fully Adjustable Rear with no tools required Fully Shielded front sight post protects against damage from hard use. Machined front post in dead center of sight provides rapid acquisition every time. Same Cheek weld as standard sights in 12 o'clock plane for rapid transition. Coin Slot Flush windage will not get inadvertently moved out of zero. Rear Aperture perfectly sized for rapid yet accurate target acquisition. Lobed front sight to accommodate military IR lasers Picatinny / Weaver Compatible  Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GRIFFIN ARMAMENT FAIL SAFE ANGLE SIGHTS"

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comGRIFFIN ARMAMENT QD BLAST SHIELDThe QD Blast Shield was designed to offer significant concussion reduction for the end user and other team members operating in the immediate vicinity. Often team members in CQB environments experience concussion from muzzle blast that is not only deafeningly loud, but also can cause prolonged headaches that can last for days afterwards. Especially effective on short barrels, the unique design of the QD Blast Shield directs concussive force forward allowing an end user to rapidly reconfigure muzzle device function. Ultra strong 17-4PH stainless steel provides a robust material to withstand intense use and full auto fire without fear of failure. Fluted geometry in the triangular shield lightens the unit while providing internal front supports for the muzzle device. Melonite QPQ surface treatment provides an extremely hard, durable, and attractive finish.The QD mechanism is fast, positive, and free of wear prone geometry commonly found in ratcheting devices. The QD Blast Shield also comes with a shim set and overtravel stop to refit your A2 compensator for optimal use. The Griffin QD Blast Shield is compatible with our line of QD 5.56mm mounts, Including the Flash Comp, Muzzle Brake, Compensating Flash Hider, and Tactical Compensator. It is also compatible with A2 Compensators that fall within the NATO spec blueprinted dimensions. Although many companies manufacture A2 style compensators not all of them are dimensioned properly. Not Compatible with BCM, BCE or PWS muzzle devices. Griffin Armament has continued to pursue product development that will enhance hearing safety in tactical and shooting sport situations. The QD Blast Shield is a great product for those that would like to reduce the concussion of their muzzle devices.Features  17-4PH stainless steel material Melonite QPQ finish Compatible with Griffin QD silencer mounts and A2 Compensator Significantly reduces concussion Fluted to reduce weight Gas flow pockets allow for muzzle device performance Fast, positive, wear free QD mechanism Included shim set and over-travel stop washer to refit your A2 for optimal use 5.4 ounces   Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GRIFFIN ARMAMENT QD BLAST SHIELD"

It's Bavarian (Crown over ""L"" for Ludwig III) dated 1916 with a steel scabbard and working release button. The saw teeth are quite sharp, and there are no cracks in the grip panels, just some light rust on the scabbard and pommel. As can be seen in the photos above, the blade has some staining but no active rust. I've cleaned up the blade a little with Flitz and a cotton cloth, but I didn't want to do too much to it as I was told that it might be blood staining. I then applied a couple coats of Eezox as a preservative. The edge was sharpened at some point in the past.

I recently had it appraised by two bayonet collectors that I've known for a very long time, and they both appraised it between $425 and $450, so I'm making it available here for $400 shipped within the continental US via Priority Mail, or a little less for a FTF deal in Northeast Florida.

The 3X magnifier works with all HWS units, features a reticle with a 65-MOA circle containing two 1-MOA aiming points, and can be flipped over to the side when not needed.

It is the NRA Limited Edition. I got this from my local Friends of NRA banquet. The serial number on this particular one is NRA1101. It has never been shot.

It is a really great gun and would compliment just about everyone's collection.

Here is the description from Kel-Tec's website:

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

These are the EASIEST lowers to complete yourself! I did one on an old drill press the other day with NO VICE and it came out great. I even saw a guy finish one with a wood router and a bench vice (seriously?) but that turned out great too. 
What makes them so easy to complete is the awesome jigs, the quality tooling and the polymer material (which is strong but the quality tooling cuts right thru it). The jigs only allow you to cut in certain areas.

Kits come with...
*80% Polymer lower receiver (AR-15 multi-cal or DPMS AR-10 for use with .308 or 243)
*Jig that makes it easy.
*All bits and end mils to complete the job. Even a depth guide on the end mill to help you get the perfect depth.

Other 80% lowers cost about $50 to $80 just for the blank. Plus $100 or more for the jig and possibly more for tooling. Plus you will need a mill or a good drill press with an X, Y vice etc. $150? or $90 for a better product all parts included??

The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR10/SR25 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock especially designed for the longer charging handle throw of 7.62 NATO platforms. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock.

Overall I would say the rifle is in pretty good shape considering its age. I have fired the rifle and it is very soft shooting .30-06 and the gas system is adjustable for diffrent loads. The bore is in great shape with no rust and good rifling. It is all matching numbers rifle. The only issues it has is someone cut the ears off the front sight and replaced the original peep sight with an Egyptian one other then that the rifle is as it should be and is in excellent working order I am asking 1200OBO because of its rarity and that seems to be the going rate for these decent examples on gunbroker.

I had the frame Cerakoted black to match the slide. This pistol was carried daily for about two years as my carry gun. The Cerakote is worn in some spots, and there is a small scratch in the frame near the grip safety. I also removed the sharp corners from the front of the magazine well. I got tried of drawing blood during emergency reloads. The finish on the frame has some holster wear. While this gun was well used, it was never abused. I've priced this gun low because of the finish flaws. It is a great pistol, and shoots extremely well.

The U.S. Optics, Inc. SR-8S rifle scope is the most versatile and rugged short to medium range rifle optic ever designed. With the new 8:1 zoom ratio, this optic can be used like a red dot reflex sight at true 1X, but also allows threat identification and engagements at distances in excess of 800+ yards. 

Optical clarity is achieved through a precision engineered lens system; careful consideration is given to the use of lens coatings. A simple push of a button allows a SFP red dot to be turned on and used in complete daylight, while the FFP reticle allows for ranging and holds off points. 

The SR-8S has 100 MOA of total travel and 2/10 mil knobs, 8C-Mil reticles offer exact dimensional accuracy. 

U.S. Optics, Inc. scopes are constructed of 6061 T-6 aluminum, then type III hard anodized, making it extremely durable. By using the finest materials and advanced engineering, the SR-8c is a lightweight, affordable scope that surpasses the competition. Whether you are shooting a AR10, AR15, M14, or a bolt action rifle, this optic will meet or exceed the needs of most situations. The low profile sleek design of the New SR-8 makes for a snag free tool in all environments.
