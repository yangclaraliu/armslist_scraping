I am letting my sole 1911 go. It is an amazing pistol but I just have too many striker fired guns that it doesn't make sense for me to learn a whole new platform and the associated muscle memory. 

Like new Springfield TRP Operator. This is arguably the best bang for your buck 1911 on the market today. If you are reading this you probably know that. Has many features and attention to detail that only much more expensive 1911's offer. Bull barrel, hand fit slide etc. 

It has had exactly 120 rounds downrange and it has been 100% flawless with all of it. Range ammo and Speer GD JHP. It has been meticulously cleaned after my one range trip with it. The is NO idiot mark. In fact, there are ZERO marks on the gun and you'd be hard pressed to know that it has been fired outside of the factory. Truly a gorgeous pistol. I am sure I will regret it but I'd rather have the cash to use towards other firearms related endeavors.

I am firm on the price. No, I don't want your Glock nor any other trades at this time. I hate to be like that but there will always be someone. 594 and all state and federal laws apply.

From Springfield's site:

TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission. - See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/1911-trp-45-acp/#sthash.Gu0zzDxf.dpuf"

It comes with 2-15rd. mags, 1-30rd. mag and 250rds. of Sellier & Bellot ammo.  Overall it's in very nice condition, there are a few light marks on the stock and on the barrel, very minor, but want to be as accurate as possible on description.  I've seen these models selling from $600-$1,600, depending on condition and if the box and ppwk is included, so values are all over the place.  Unfortunately, I do not have the box and ppwk, but there is over $160 in the extra mags and ammo included and the rifle is in really nice condition.

$780 FIRM in cash or better in trade value.

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, so I'll be pretty picky on any trade offer.  If wanting a trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I have several firearms in the platforms and calibers listed below along with plenty of rounds for all, but will consder trades if it makes sense on my end, otherwise I will pass on trades and wait for cash. 

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped is fine as I would replace any Mil-Spec FCG in the lowers.  Other parts like BCG, rails etc.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 & 7.62x54.  

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP(HK, Beretta, XDM 5.25, maybe the 4.5"", maybe other makes and models) 1911(even Taurus models, depending on your value), but may consider other calibers and models, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars, maybe gold in grams

Maybe quality optics like Vortex(others?) 4-16x(mid level models) or greater power range, maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

This is a very very nice shotgun. Even cycles the Wal-Mart birdshot light loads.

Glock 21 magazine (Kriss has 25rd. + mags)Features: Super V Recoil system, Side folding and collapsing stock system.
The KRISS Vector[8] series is a family of weapons based upon the parent submachine gundesign developed by KRISS USA. They use an unconventional delayed blowback system combined with in-line to reduce perceived recoil and muzzle climb.
 
The Vector's action, the KRISS Super V System (KSVS), is an articulated mechanism which allows the bolt and an inertia block to move downward into a recess behind the magazine well.[9][not in citation given] The theory is that at the end of this travel, energy is transmitted downward rather than rearward. On return, however that downward force is negated by upward force. The Vector family of weapons is the first to use this action. .40 S&W and 9×19mm Parabellumvariants were mentioned when the gun was first released, but are not currently offered or projected by the company. The firearm was designed to accept standard Glock 21 pistol magazines. When fired, the barrel axis is in line with the shoulder as in the M16 rifle, but also in line with the shooter's hand. This is intended to reduce muzzle climb when combined with the off-axis bolt travel."

The Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR)[10] is a modular rifle made byFN Herstal (FNH) for the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) to satisfy the requirements of the SCAR competition.[11] This family of rifles consist of two main types. The SCAR-L, for ""light"", is chambered in the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and the SCAR-H, for ""heavy"", fires 7.62x51mm NATO. Both are available in Long Barrel and Close Quarters Combatvariants.
The FN SCAR systems completed low rate initial production testing in June 2007.[12] After some delays, the first rifles began being issued to operational units in April 2009, and a battalion of the US 75th Ranger Regiment was the first large unit deployed into combat with 600 of the rifles in 2009.[2] The US Special Operations Command has currently cancelled their purchase of the Mark 16 (or MK 16) SCAR-L and are planning to remove the rifle from their inventory by 2013. However, they will purchase the Mk 17 SCAR-H version, and also plan to purchase 5.56 mm conversion kits for the Mk 17, supplanting the loss of the Mk 16.[13] The SCAR was one of the competing weapons in the Individual Carbine competition which aimed to find a replacement for the M4 carbine.[14]
As of early 2015, the FN SCAR is now in service in over 20 countries around the world"

475,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4348475,For Sale:  Juggernaut Arms - Beretta ARX100,"Sparks, Reno, Nevada","$ 1,575","Listed On: Sunday, June 14, 2015",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Manufacturer: BerettaModel: ARX100Caliber: 5.56mmCapacity: 30rd. (Uses standard AR15 magazines)Additional information on Military/Law Enforcement version-
The ARX-160 is a modular assault rifle manufactured by Pietro Beretta S.p.A.. Developed for the Italian armed forces as part of the Soldato Futuro (""Future Soldier"" in English) program, the ARX-160 was launched in 2008 as a commercial weapon system independent from the Soldato Futuroensemble, complete with a companion single-shot 40mm NATO low-velocity grenade launcher, called GLX-160, which can be underslung to the rifle or used with an ad-hoc stock system as a stand-alone weapon.
 

The ARX-160 departs from the previously issued Beretta 70/90 weapon system on several points. The weapon is composed of upper and lower receiver, both manufactured mostly in polymer, and operates through a short-stroke piston system. Feeding is through STANAG magazines.
The weapon's unique features include ambidextrous safeties, magazine catches and charging handle, the ability to change which side spent casings are ejected, a quick-change barrel which can be removed and replaced in seconds without tools, picatinny rails, and a foldable telescopic stock.
The lightweight barrel is chrome lined and manufactured by the hammer forging process at the Beretta factory in Gardone Val Trompia, Lombardy. The standard length is 16 in (410 mm), with a 12 in (300 mm) barrel for special operators. A 16 in heavy barrel with match-grade rifling for marksmen and a 20 in (510 mm) barrel are being tested. The flash hider has 5 radial cuts and 4 smaller cuts to control muzzle climb in automatic firing. Barrels have a 1:7 twist to fire NATO standard ball and tracer rounds. The non-free-floated barrel is easily removed simply by pulling on slide levers and pulling it out. An bayonet lug, designed for Fulcrum Extrema Ratio bayonet is positioned on top of the barrel rather than underneath it.[2]
The ARX-160 operating system is unique in that the piston moves almost 2 in (50.8 mm), while other systems move fractions of an inch. The piston follows the bolt carrier almost all the way rearward, resulting in low gas pressure levels and a less sudden and more constant push on the carrier group.[2]
The rifle has the ability to eject shells out of either the left or right for ambidextrous operation. The bolt has seven lugs and an extractor on the left and right, with no ejector. The extractors are spring-loaded and which way cases are ejected is selected by pressing one through a small hole located past the port. It is small and optimized for the tip of a bullet to fit. The ejection port is open on both sides and directs shells at a 45 degree angle from the barrel. The cocking lever is on the bolt carrier and can be positioned on either side by pulling it out, swinging it through the ejection port, and pushing it in to secure it in place.[2]
Back-up iron sights are standard and made of the same polymer as the gun's receiver. The front sight post is adjustable for windage and elevation and the rear peep sight has six positions to fire in increments from 100–600 meters. The primary optical sight is the Aimpoint ACIES, a domestic version of the M2 close combat optic. Night vision systems, thermal sights, and other accessories will be available through the Soldato Futuro program.[2]
Different calibers are planned by changing out the barrel, bolt, lower receiver, and magazine. In addition to 5.56 NATO, 7.62×39mm and 6.8mm Remington SPC configurations are planned, as well as the possibility of 5.45×39mm. A prototype heavy version is chambered for the7.62×51mm NATO as a battle rifle.[2]"

(uses standard AR15 mags)Features: Bullpup design, flip up iron sights, 90 and 45 degree rails for optics.Additional information on the Military/Law enforcment version-
The TAR-21 (or simply Tavor) is an Israeli bullpup assault rifle chambered for 5.56×45mm NATOammunition with a selective fire system, selecting between semi-automatic mode and full automatic fire mode.
Built around a long-stroke piston system (as found in the M1 Garand and AK-47), the Tavor was designed to maximise reliability, durability, and ease-of-maintenance, particularly under adverse or battlefield conditions.[3]
In 2009, the MTAR-21 (X-95) was selected to become the standard issued weapon of the Israeli infantry by 2018.
 
 
Israel Military Industries (now Israel Weapon Industries) initiated the Tavor development team in 1995, under the direction of gun designer Zalmen Shebs.[4]
The objective of the project was to create an assault rifle that was more reliable, durable and easier to maintain than the M4A1 Carbine, while also being better suited to close-quarters combat and mechanized infantry roles. As a result, they hoped that the weapon would be officially adopted by the Israel Defense Forces.
Due to the military's close-quarters and mechanized infantry requirements, the project team selected a bullpup design, that would allow the weapon to be compact while keeping a long barrel able to achieve ballistically favorable high muzzle velocities.[4]
Trials in Israel[edit]
Between 2001 and 2002, the Tavor was given extensive military trials for functionality and reliability against the M4A1 Carbine. It was trialled in tests including Mean Rounds Between Failures (MRBF); reliability; ergonomics during long marches; and ease-of-maintenance. In these military tests, it prevailed over the M4A1 Carbine.[3]
As a result of these trials, the IDF adopted the Tavor as the future standard arm for all branches of the infantry, to gradually enter service, with the first weapons delivered to the infantry from 2006 onwards, and a full changeover expected by 2018.[4][5]
Design features and engineering[edit]
Long-stroke piston system[edit]
The rifle uses a non-lubricated long-stroke piston system, as found in the M1 Garand, IMI Galil and the AK 47.[6] The long-stroke piston mechanism contributes to the forcefulness of the Tavor's extraction and chambering.[5]
A long-stroke piston system may increase a weapon's reliability in extreme conditions (in comparison to the less reliable short-stroke piston systems), as has been found to be the case in both the M1 Garand and the AK 47.[7]
The Tavor's attachment of the piston to a heavy bolt carrier, and the extension of the mainspring into the hollow stem of the bolt carrier, bears a family resemblance to the internal mechanism of the AK 47.[6]"

Two hundred plus rounds of mollie coated ammunition included if a solid price is agreed on. No low ball offers. Cash only. This rifle is set up as a bench rifle but I've harvested deer and coyote at 400 plus yards with self loaded ammunition. It shoots 115 grain Berger for big game real well because of the 1-8 rifling. Most of my mollie ammunition moves at 4100 fps for those of you who understand ballistics and deflection. I used this rifle for competition both as a service member and a civilian. This rifle still drives nails exceptionally well. The right price offered can take this beauty home. This is a match grade custom rifle that needs more range time and hunting time than I can give it."

As I purchased it, the gun came with picatinny-ish (They aren't pic spec, but they worked fine with the rings I had laying around) rail sections which I imagine were drilled, tapped, and installed by Remington as a special package for gander mountain. I'm firm on the price, this is a basically new gun ready for optics that I paid over 100$ over my asking price for 2 years ago, I think my price is fair and I'd sooner keep it than loose more.

I bought this rifle 5 years ago for coyote hunting, and it's just been sitting in a climate controlled safe.
Scope and mounts were professionally installed and laser sighted in @ 50 yards.
It's adjustable between 7.5 yards out to 100 yards.
Flawless with perfect bluing.
Stainless receiver.
Sling mounts.
Native American Chief inlay on stock.
Metal screw-in lense covers (not cheap garbage).
Very nice indeed.
I'm parting with it for 2 reasons:
(1) I'm honestly never going to use it.
(2) I own 3 - .22lr including a pistol, and I do a lot of target plinking.
Therefore, I would prefer to trade for bulk .22lr or possibly .223/5.56, cash, or partial.
We can work out the inexpensive particulars on the transfer of ownership later on.
My apologies for the fuzzy pics, I will send clear individuals to serious inquiries.
Open to hearing all reasonable offers.
I'll be making a decision sooner rather than later.
