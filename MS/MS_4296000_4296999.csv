As the title states, I have a Sig P226R for sale or possible trade.

I bought this Sig less than a year ago. I put about 200 rounds through the pistol. It was cleaned, oiled and now sits in my safe and it has not been carried.

The Sig comes with the Sig Lite nights sights, enhanced grip (1 piece grip) and the SRT (short reset trigger, was purchased at the same time the Sig was purchased and was installed by a Sig Armorer).

It will come with 5 mags,the original box with all the paperwork, a Sig branded carry bag and a G-Code RTI holster.








As you can tell from the pics, The Sig looks like in new box condition. No dings, scratches or any other damage to this pistol.

I am looking to get $800 for the whole package. I will not split this package up, so please don't ask. I do not need to sell nor am I in no rush to sell the Sig, so lowball offers will be ignored.

The ONLY trade I would be willing to consider would be a quality 1911(Kimber, Springfield Armory, Colt, STI to name a few) [U][B]in 9mm with combat style sights (no target sights)[/B][/U], in the same condition as this Sig.

Buyer will cover transfer fee. If we work out a trade, than each person will cover their own transfer fee.

I am a dealer and as such there is a background check (on pistols) and transfer paperwork. This must be done at my place of business in Appleton. I can't meet you someplace else or deliver as that would be ILLEGAL. Wisconsin has a 48 hour ""waiting period"" for handguns, so you would need to come back after that time to pick up your purchase. The 48 hour wait does not apply to longguns. All AR-15 recievers may only be sold to those over the age 
of 21 as they are readily made into pistols (question 18 on ATF form 4473). No exceptions

TRADES: Please bring your item(s) in so we can give you a trade value. Unfortunately we cannot give you exact prices over the phone or email. Please keep in mind we will consider non firearm related items.

We've created this beauty to be exclusively chambered in Armscor's signature caliber, .22TCM - which happens to scream at over 2,800 fps. The 5 round mag can be interchanged with the 17 round .22 TCM pistol mag, turning this into a high-capacity rifle.

Featuring a new SoftCoil™delayed gas blow back technology, Walther Arms, Inc. has introduced its latest concealed carry firearm -the CCP.This semi-automatic pistol comes chambered in 9mm and is the ultimate concealed carry weapon.
Weighing only 22 ounces,the CCP’s SoftCoir™ delayed gas blow back system uses gas pressures from the ignited cartridge and feeds them through a small port in the barrel (in front of the chamber) to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined-after the bullet has left the barrel­ hence allowing the slide to end its rearward motion,opening the breech and ejecting the empty cartridge case. Two other benefits to this system as a result of SoftCoil™technology are that the slide is easily racked and because barrel rise is reduced, the shooter can acquire targets faster. Tests show that the barrel rise is a third less than similar models on the market allowing shooters to be more accurate on follow-up shots.
With an overall length of just 6.5 inches,Walther’s CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster. The CCP comes in stylish stainless or traditional black and provides all the features that have become signature of Walther’s line of pistols – smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull,interchangeable front sight;adjustable rear sight; and reversible magazine release for left or right handed operation.
This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety,the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual safety and one internally that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip Hi-Grip™surface. Other key attributes of the gun include an easy access slide stop;loaded chamber indicator for added safety; and front, rear and trigger guard serrations for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide.

These are EXTREMELY RARE so don’t hesitate to buy one today, and own a piece of American history!
From Manufacturer:
Whether you choose one chambered for .22 LR, .22 Magnum, or .17HMR, the Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design.
The Golden Boy rifle’s awesome 20-inch blued octagonal barrel, American walnut stock, brass buttplate and gleaming Brasslite receiver will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America’s Old West, when our company founder Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original Henry lever action rifle.
Small game hunters and plinkers will appreciate its substantial 6¾ pound heft. It balances well and makes for highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness lever-lovers long for. Get one in your hands and take aim. See what a natural pointer it really is.
Adding to the historic authenticity is the adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. The .22 Mag holds 12+1 rounds and will provide a whole lot of shooting pleasure before it’s time to reload their tubular magazines.
   We have 2 in stock, and have them priced to sell quickly for just $459 each.

The mid-size Ruger 5247 Blackhawk Flattop sixguns are some of the finest packing guns ever produced. The original 357’s and the wildly popular 44 Specials have been highly prized for their smaller dimensions and great balance. Now, you can have this classic revolver chambered in BOTH .357 Mag as well as 9mm!
This is the first Ruger Flattop made in stainless steel with a 5-1/2″ barrel and is the first stainless steel Flattop chambered in 45 Colt. As of right now, this is the only Ruger 45 Colt stainless steel single action revolver with adjustable sights being produced. The regular stainless steel Blackhawk in 45 Colt was discontinued by Ruger several years ago.

The name “Pug” may have derived from the Latin Pugnus, meaning Fist. With this in mind, the NAA Pug can be characterized as multum in parvo (“much in little”) in reference to the small and convenient size.
Squat and sturdy like its namesake dog, The NAA Pug is chambered in 22 Magnum and sports a 1″ heavy barrel. You can count on this stocky companion to deliver a bite even worse than his bark.

No single shots unless its really cheap 

Basically what I am looking for is something that you want to get rid of because you just don't want it anymore, its broke, its ugly, its just in your way... ect... I put $150 to fill in the blank, that does not mean its what your gun is worth haha You tell me what you have and what condition its in (to your best guess) and how much you want for it and I can let you know if its something I would be interested in .... feel free to ask, worst I can say is no... below will be a little redundant but I am trying to keep down a BUNCH of emails for retail sellers... 

**Update.,.. this is long but it should cut down on the amount of emails and texts I am getting...  please do not contact me for a gun at retail price, I do not mean this to come off rude but if I want retail prices I can buy plenty of them on here... probably hundreds.  If they are not in rough condition and you just want to sell it, I will buy it if its a great deal, meaning lower then I can just look on here and buy one for or I would have already bought it...  but other then that I am looking for guns I can refinish, reblue, dip, fix broke things on them... ect... its a hobby,,, I enjoy it... I am fair just tell me what you have, condition, and how much you want for it and I will see what I can do on it... no harm in asking, again.... worse I can say is no. 

*** ANOTHER update... please do not contact me asking if I have guns for sale, if I sell one I post it, I am looking to buy them not sell them. 

Extra reading... 

I will give an example... if you have a Hi point 40 (Hi point is most common called, emailed or texted about)  I will buy them I don't mind having them but I can get them brand new for $150 and I can send a link if you dispute it, with that in mind I will NOT pay retail for them other wise I would go buy a new one... 
A few more examples... ( and I can prove and send a link and phone number to every one of these) 
Taurus MILLENNIUM is $199.99 NEW 
Hi Point 9mm $145 NEW
Hi Point 380 $135 NEW
Hi point carbine rifle 9mm $260 45 cal $270
S&W M&P SHIELD, .40 S&W $380 NEW 

Those are all NEW prices I will not pay a new price for a USED gun... please just move on...

I could go on but my point of the examples are that I have people wanting me to pay retail or Higher and that is just silly... thanks for your patience if you read all this hahaha


I do have a carry permit...
256- 425- 4300 
this is a cell you can text, send pictures and/or call... sometimes texting is better because of work but if you don't like to text feel free to call... I will answer emails but I have found that most of the people that email are not too serious that is why so many people say ""no emails"" now... well.. that and Spam and scams..."

Marked Châtellerault. This rifle is dated 1916 and is marked with the ""N"" on the receiver. Stock, barrel, and trigger guard match. Lock-up is tight and I have personally fired this weapon at 100 yard range and determined it is just as the little carbine is known to be -- very sturdy and accurate! A real pleasure to shoot. The bore is good and I have found no rust or pitting. Rifling is strong. 

Here is a link to comments on my rifle. One estimate of value was 300 Euros ($315).

These guns are not too often found in America. 

Small cut located at bottom of stock is not someone's attempt at making a sporter, but is the site of a French-done wood repair that must have fallen out over the years. This is very common. Also, slot in bottom of stock is not missing sling swivel by accident, but was removed by the French for the Artillery carbine and just never sealed up. Overall, rifle has that nice battle-damaged appearance while still offering a completely strong and serviceable rifle. A piece of history straight from WWI! 

Comes with 4 original 5-shot Mannlicher clips and 48 rounds of black primer (best in my experience) 8mm Lebel (8x50r) ammo. 

$365 or best offer.

495,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4296495,For Sale/Trade:  WWI French Berthier m16 carbine WITH ammo and clips - now for sale,"Elizabeth, Parkersburg, West Virginia",$ 0,"Listed On: Friday, May 8, 2015",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Note: If in West Virginia and wanting to buy, this shooter and piece of WWI history is yours for $310 with ammo and clips. I'll be here until Monday, May 11. l am Based in South Carolina but have property in West Virginia.

Offered here is a French Berthier ""Mousqueton de Artillerie Modèle 1892 Modifié 1916"". Marked Châtellerault. This rifle is dated 1916 and is marked with the ""N"" on the receiver. Stock, barrel, and trigger guard match. Lock-up is tight and I have personally fired this weapon at 100 yard range and determined it is just as the little carbine is known to be -- very sturdy and accurate! A real pleasure to shoot. The bore is good and I have found no rust or pitting. Rifling is strong. 

Here is a link to comments on my rifle. One estimate of value was 300 Euros ($315).
http://forums.gunboards.com/showthread.php?389846-New-Addition-Berthier-M-16

These guns are not too often found in America. 

Small cut located at bottom of stock is not someone's attempt at making a sporter, but is the site of a French-done wood repair that must have fallen out over the years. This is very common. Also, slot in bottom of stock is not missing sling swivel by accident, but was removed by the French for the Artillery carbine and just never sealed up. Overall, rifle has that nice battle-damaged appearance while still offering a completely strong and serviceable rifle. A piece of history straight from WWI! 

Comes with 4 original 5-shot Mannlicher clips and 48 rounds of black primer (best in my experience) 8mm Lebel ammo. 

Thanks for your time and shoot me an email!

Common Questions

How much are your holsters? Our holsters normally run $30 for an average size gun with flat basic colors.  Our IWB holsters run $5 more due to a stronger material used.

How much are your mag holsters? Depending on the type, they begin at $24.95.  More complicated holsters with various mag types are available.

Can you make a holster for an FNX .45?  Yes, that is our specialty, making holsters for large, bulky or rare guns is always a challenge.  We aren't happy until you are happy.

What about a Calico M950? Yes, that was one of our most challenging and difficult guns to date.

Do you make holster with custom light/laser attachments? We do not carry ""ALL"" the custom light/laser attachments and can work with you depending on the model.  In most cases, it is easier if you show up with the gear for us to measure and assess the work needed.

What kind of materials do you have?  We use Kydex, Holstex, and Bolatron in varying sizes from .60 (thin IWB), .80 (medium IWB and OWB), .93 (Thick OWB) to .125. (OWB and complex projects)

What types of holsters do you make?  Inside the waistband (IWB) concealed carry is our specialty but we can make outside the waistband (OWB) as well.  We have designed custom mag carriers for 3 Gun competitions to include mag holsters for a Kriss Vector.

What is your most popular holster? Our most notable is our patent pending ""switchblade"" made especially for concealed carry.  Very easy to conceal, you can't even feel its there and is designed for faster extraction than traditional style mag holsters.

One of the screws came loose and I lost it, can you replace it? Yes, we offer lifetime warranties on the holsters and will mail you a replacement to keep you going.  We only ask that in certain cases, you pay for shipping costs if required.

Do you make leather holsters? At this time we are not able to make leather holsters but may explore that option at a later date.

Custom IWB for Ruger LCR 38 (March 5th 2015): ""My holster arrived very quickly even though it was the first one they'd made for my particular revolver. It's very well made, and the follow up by them to make sure it's perfect has been fantastic. It's the thinnest inside-the-waistband holster that I have, I'm sure it'll provide great service for years to come :)"""

	Hey all, 
I have an old but great revolver for sale. It is a Ruger Security Six 357 magnum. It is the 4 inch model with adjustable sights. This one was one of the first run produced in 1972 and is a  low 4 digit serial number. It has normal blue wear from holster and a drop mark/ding on the rear sight. Its not too big of a deal and could be replaced pretty easily and cheaply if you wanted. I just had this at the range a day or so ago and it shot fantastic with no issues. I would keep this, but i have a security Six in 6 inch already, so it would just be a duplicate! haha.
	This is in good shape overall and the gun shoots great. As far as trades are concerned, I have a few. I would consider trades for a PMR30, a marlin 357/38 lever action, “maybe” a SP101, Draco AK Pistol, PLR-16, SU-16etc. Honestly, just shoot me an offer. worst I can say is no! (Please no 22s, black powder, or shotguns). Rifle wise, aside from the lever 357/38, I am mainly looking for semi-auto, but would consider others if the deal is good. Best bet is to message me on here or shoot me a text at REDACTED. I can add ammo or cash on my end for certain trades, but prefer to trade even or trade with ammo/cash on your end if possible. Need to be able to meet up in Norman on this if possible. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

THIS IS THE HARD TO FIND BAYONET LUG STYLE STAINLESS STEEL MATTE VERSION

Locks on with a pin and a set screw
Fits M9 & M7 style Bayonet, (M7 Bayonet Included)

All-time favorite for Mini-14 shooters. This pin on muzzle brake reduces muzzle climb and allows you to attach a standard M7 (included) or M9 bayonet. Pin is placed through the front sight hole. 
Matte Stainless Finish

5 ½” Overall Length Flash Suppressor with Bayonet Lug 
Designed to replace the factory sight and add a flash suppressor and bayonet lug capable of attaching a bayonet. 
I'm not sure of the manufacturer. 
As you can tell from the pictures it's never been used or installed and very heavy built. 
Easy to install. 
Simply remove the roll pin from your existing front sight, replace it, re-insert the roll pin, and tighten the set screw. The roll pin is included.

I acquired this in a trade and still has the tag from the gunshow it was originaly purchased from. The tag says they were asking 149.95, and from how hard they are to locate I am betting this was what was paid for it.
Also included is a M7 bayonet that is unused. It was made in Korea but most M7’s that you find are made in Korea anymore. It shows no signs of use and still has the factory edge on it.

I prefer them to at least shoot but if not, it depends on the reason why it doesn't. The looks does not matter. I want to recondition it anyways. 

Pistols
Revolvers 
Rifles

No single shots unless its really cheap 

Basically what I am looking for is something that you want to get rid of because you just don't want it anymore, its broke, its ugly, its just in your way... ect... I put $150 to fill in the blank, that does not mean its what your gun is worth haha You tell me what you have and what condition its in (to your best guess) and how much you want for it and I can let you know if its something I would be interested in .... feel free to ask, worst I can say is no... below will be a little redundant but I am trying to keep down a BUNCH of emails for retail sellers... 

**Update.,.. this is long but it should cut down on the amount of emails and texts I am getting...  please do not contact me for a gun at retail price, I do not mean this to come off rude but if I want retail prices I can buy plenty of them on here... probably hundreds.  If they are not in rough condition and you just want to sell it, I will buy it if its a great deal, meaning lower then I can just look on here and buy one for or I would have already bought it...  but other then that I am looking for guns I can refinish, reblue, dip, fix broke things on them... ect... its a hobby,,, I enjoy it... I am fair just tell me what you have, condition, and how much you want for it and I will see what I can do on it... no harm in asking, again.... worse I can say is no. 

*** ANOTHER update... please do not contact me asking if I have guns for sale, if I sell one I post it, I am looking to buy them not sell them. 

Extra reading... haha

I will give an example... if you have a Hi point 40 (Hi point is most common called, emailed or texted about)  I will buy them I don't mind having them but I can get them brand new for $150 and I can send a link if you dispute it, with that in mind I will NOT pay retail for them other wise I would go buy a new one... 
A few more examples... ( and I can prove and send a link and phone number to every one of these) 
Taurus MILLENNIUM is $199.99 NEW 
Hi Point 9mm $145 NEW
Hi Point 380 $135 NEW
Hi point carbine rifle 9mm $260 45 cal $270
S&W M&P SHIELD, .40 S&W $380 NEW 

Those are all NEW prices I will not pay a new price for a USED gun... please just move on...

I could go on but my point of the examples are that I have people wanting me to pay retail or Higher and that is just silly... thanks for your patience if you read all this hahaha


I have a carry permit I can show at time of sale...
256- 425- 4300 
this is a cell you can text, send pictures and/or call... sometimes texting is better because of work but if you don't like to text feel free to call... I will answer emails but I have found that most of the people that email are not too serious that is why so many people say ""no emails"" now... well.. that and Spam and scams..."

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."
