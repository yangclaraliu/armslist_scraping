I am looking to sell my Gen 3 Glock 20 10mm pistol (as mentioned in the title).

The pistol was purchased new by me, and I fired only 54 rounds with it. 34 rounds of Underwood 165 grain and 20 rounds of Winchester. That left me with 16 rounds of Underwood for carry purposes.

I replaced the plastic guide rod with a NDZ Performace captivated recoild spring, ISMI 22#.  I also put a little Biohazard plug in the grip because I liked it.

I will also be throwing in a Serpa Blackhawk Sportster paddle holster to the deal, still new in the box.

There is nothing wrong with the pistol at all. It's just a bit too large for my little hands. I like to shoot 1-handed often and the heel of my hand barely gets around to the backstrap, let alone covering it like it should.

Oh yeah, I white lettered the slide and magazines, which I think looks great and really makes the round count pop on the mags. If you don't like it, it can be easily removed with some non-acetone fingernail polish remover.

it comes with the box and everything you see.  Shipping is a pain, so I would rather not, but I will drive a little distance to meet halfway if not too crazy.  If FTF I will throw in a 20 round box of Federal Hydrashoks.

Mostly looking for cash be will entertain interesting trades, like those listed."

The model 783 is one of the newest rifles in the Remington lineup. Custom-grade accuracy is now within reach of virtually every hunter. Using the expertise that's dominated bolt-action technology for more than 50 years, the engineering team started from scratch and combined their most advanced, accuracy-enhancing features to create an all-new platform. This sleek, hardworking tack-driver is even built differently.Crafted in our newest manufacturing facility using proprietary methods that create the tightest tolerances from rifle to rifle, by the most efficient means possible. Perhaps the first thing you'll notice are the striking lines of the new stock design. Inside, it's a true performance-enhancer, with a dual-pillar bedding platform that free-floats the barrel for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. The black synthetic stock contains a high nylon fiber content which gives the stock superior strength and rigidity. Also helping deliver those inherently tight groups is a precision button-rifled barrel. For shot control, it's equipped with the crisp new CrossFire™ trigger system that's user adjustable to suit your preferences. The 783 features a steel detachable magazine with a steel latch. Standard calibers have a four round capacity and magnum calibers hold three rounds. Like with all Remington bolt actions, expect a lifetime of rock-solid reliability. From the next generation in a legendary bloodline.KEY FEATURES:New CrossFire™ trigger system, factory set at 3 1/2 lbs. and user adjustable from 2 1/2 to 5 lbs.Carbon steel magnum contour button rifled barrel22"" standard chamberings and 24"" on magnumsPillar-bedded stock and free-floated barrelSuperCell™ Recoil PadModel 783 accepts two Model 700™ front basesCome check this rifle out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte.

Otherwise the P30L is essentially identical to the P30. Like the P30, the P30L was designed as a modern police and security pistol and combines optimal function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstraps inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. NOTE: THIS VARIATION DOES NOT INCLUDE THE REAR DECOCKER OR EXTERNAL SAFETY. INSTEAD, IT HAS THE LOW PROFILE HAMMER. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases, magazine release levers. A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator providing a reminder of a loaded chamber that can be subtly seen and felt. The standard P30L is a 9 mm “Variant 3 (V3)” with a conventional double-action/single action trigger mode. Extensively tested, P30L and P30LS models have been adopted by several international police and security agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30L naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions."

The M.O.A. Trigger helps the model 70 deliver the extreme accuracy benchmark 1"" group at 100 yards. It’s what you deserve.With the Triple Zero Advantage The Model 70’s new M.O.A. Trigger System is the most precise three-lever trigger system in the world. Operating on a simple pivoting lever principle, the trigger mechanism has been completely redesigned to exhibit zero take up, zero creep and zero overtravel. The pull weight ranges from 3 to 5 pounds and is factory-set at 3 3/4 pounds. Because of the enhanced ergonomics, wide smooth triggerpiece and 2:1 mechanical advantage created by the unique design geometry, it actually feels like half that weight. Don’t settle for a lesser trigger design with secondary triggerpiece levers, gimmicks or other novelties. Experience for yourself the M.O.A. accuracy, precision and control that come from the new Model 70 M.O.A. Trigger System.Zero Take Up Take up is the distance the triggerpiece travels prior to the sear moving toward release and the shooter feeling resistance. The new Model 70 M.O.A. TriggerSystem has no take up because the take up spring keeps the triggerpiece in constant contact with the actuator."

I am not going to attempt to offer  a horrible price such as cabelas or a pawn shop would.

Aluminum frame de-cocker model featuring an extended magazine release, low profile snag free sights, and a loaded chamber indicator. The PCR stands for ""Police Czech Republic"" and the pistol is a full 1/4 pound lighter than the CZ75 Compact. This pistol has a low profile that is perfect for concealment or home defense, I bought it brand new 2 months ago and already shot a few hundred rounds through it with zero problems. I am very impressed with its performance and have to sell it because I will be relocating from Wichita. The package includes the original box, pistol, 2-14 round double stack magazines, 2 cleaning rods, lock, manual and warranty. The barrel length is 3.8 in and it comes with rubber grips ideal for the perfect grip. Safety features: De-coking Lever, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Block Safety, Loaded Chamber Indicator. I never carried this pistol and properly cleaned/lubed it after every use at the indoor range. I suggest watching review videos online if you are unsure about the quality, reputation and reliability of CZ.

I also have 16- 50 round boxes of 9mm 115 grain brass FMJ practice ammunition that I will sell for $160.00 to interested pistol buyers.

658,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4357658,For Sale:  NIB: Vortex Strikefire LOWER PRICE,"Sterling, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 110,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 9, 2015",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for grabs a brand spankin' new Vortex Strikefire I for sale for the smoking deal of $110!

The Strikefire boasts a 4MOA red/greed dot--compare that to the 5-8 MOA red-only dots (green is often MUCH easier to see in bright light) on other sights that cost twice as much and give you half the features and none of the peace of mind!  

Speaking of peace of mind, this red dot--like all of Vortex's scopes--comes with a completely transferable NO QUESTIONS ASKED LIFETIME WARRANTY--you break it, your kid breaks it, your grandkid, or WHO EVER and they get a new one--doesn't matter who or when.  How many other red dots provide that warranty????  Also provides peace of mind if you later need to see the sight--any one buying it used gets that warranty too!

Why a Gen 1 instead of Gen2? 

1) Gen 1 has both red AND green dot options.
2) Gen 1 is night vision compatible
3) Gen 1 comes with a free 2x screw-in magnifier.  You can buy them separately for about $40 or get one FREE with this one!
4) Costs about $75-80 LESS than a Gen 2!

Aside from stripping away these awesome features in making the Gen 2, the main differences are a reconfiguring of the controls (including taking away night vision compatibility) and providing (on some models) a cantilever mount vice the straight mount offered by the Gen 1 (both provide for a lower 1/3 cowitness with standard BUIS).  Sometimes progress is only another word for lowering costs... 

Really want a cantilever mount? You can buy a Vortex model for $30 all day long on eBay or get one from a different vendor for less and you are STILL $50 ahead of the game!

I assembled the magnifier to the base and put it on a rifle to see if I liked the set up with an Aimpoint. Never taken to the range, never used aside from mounting it briefly as mentioned--it looked great and locks up solid, giving you a lower 1/3 co-witness. Glass is AMAZING and it has plenty of eye relief (much nicer than the Primary Arms extended eye relief magnifier). I ended up selling the Aimpoint to a friend and putting this back in the box where it's sat since. Like I said, I installed it to the mount--I also added the short riser it came with to get the 1/3 co-witness with the BUIS. I can UNINSTALL it if you like, or leave as is and save you the hassle. It doesn't fit perfectly in the box when it's assembled though, so totally your call. Of course, comes with Vortex's lifetime no questions asked warranty.

Details about the VMX-3T Magnifier:

Simple, fast, effective—the VMX-3T Magnifier will work with any of our red dots but it is not recommended for use with the prism scopes. The push-button design of the VMX-3T engages and disengages the flip-mount, allowing the magnifier to lock in place. The result, 3x magnified or unmagnified views at will. Optics are fully multi-coated for optimal light transmission. Lightweight and tough; hard-coat-anodized machined-aluminum construction ensures durability. Internally nitrogen purged for reliable waterproof/fogproof performance. Ultimate magnified versatility for virtually any AR-height red dot sight.

OPTICAL FEATURES
Fully Multi-Coated Lenses: Increase light transmission with multiple anti-reflective coatings on all air-to-glass surfaces.

CONSTRUCTION FEATURES
-- Waterproof: O-ring seals prevent moisture, dust, and debris from getting inside the tube for reliable performance in all environments.
--Fogproof: Barrels are filled with nitrogen gas to inhibit internal fogging.
--Matte Black Finish: Hard-coat anodized for durability.
--Magnification: 3 x
--Eye Relief: 3.25 inches
--Field of View: 38.2 feet/100 yards
