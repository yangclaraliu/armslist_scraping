Your cost for the same work would run $1200 ish, add in a Glock 31C and you're looking at $1700 total, which is what I paid. This thing is a sweet shooter. It's very accurate and draws a lot of attention at the range. I have put 150-200 rounds through it. I'll include 200 rounds of PPU 357Sig ammo and a Glock Tactical Light GTL 10 for free. I will take and send more pictures if you want them.  I promise you that this is a steal at $1000!"

All for only $600 OBO (THIS WEEKEND ONLY) for what has been called the Best Side arm in existence today, its the official Secret Service and Marshal Service Sidearm today...an awesome weapon that retails for over $1100 when you can even find them as they are in high demand these days. So anyone saying they have one ""NIB"" for less than a grand..I'd be extra cautious.

Bought less than 30 days ago off a Secret Service Agent and a DOD Agent who was training the Mexican Army across the border before he was reasigned to Columbia and was unable to take with him. Has less than 50 rounds through the piece. I'm going into Mexico for an extended trip deep into the interior and its 30 years in Mexican Prison if busted with a firearm, even for US military or police without a special pass which I don't have....so selling this now and will pick something up when I get back.

This is an ""L"" suffix Commercial DWM Luger in .30 caliber so the date should be 1922 - 1923 it appears to be all original and matching and for being nearly 100 years old  it is in Very Good + condition.
There is a small spot on the back strap that likes to have surface rust that I brush off with a stainless brush and oil beyond that the finish is very good and the pistoll shows little sign of use.

The Rossi Matched Pair has set the standard for 2-barrel guns. This combination long gun package is unequalled, having been recognized as the best 'youth-size' gun and a top notch 'full-size' backpack take-along. We start with one of our popular single shot rifles, then hand fit a shotgun barrel to create the Matched Pair. The result is a highly reliable rifle with adjustable sights and a button rifled barrel for enhanced accuracy, which quickly swaps barrels to become your favorite shotgun. This makes the Matched Pair the perfect gun for hunting or a fun day at the range. Available combinations are listed below. Change Barrels Faster Than You Can Change Your Mind To change barrels, make sure the firearm is unloaded. Loosen the front swivel and remove the forend and swivel. Open the action and insert the barrel, replace forend, tighten the swivel and you are done and ready to shoot. One screw, one minute, no tool, no kidding!

Made in the U.S.A. from soft hypoallergenic polymer, their ergonomic design makes them comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Their Patented EarLock retention rings utilize seven contact points to lock the earpieces in place and fit the same way every time. And because they fit snugly inside your outer ear and feature a low-profile design, you can use them while wearing a helmet, mask, or hat, or while using a phone or headset.The EP2 differs from the EP1 in that its adjustable stem extends further into the ear canal, offering a boost effect to received audio transmissions. And its single flange helps hold the stem in place without closing off the ear canal. This unique design permits a wearer to still hear outside sounds and communications, while the adjustable stem allows for crystal-clear hearing of incoming radio communications with lower radio volumes, which can help prevent hearing loss over the long term.Features:- Permit discrete and covert monitoring of radio communications- Open design does not block ear canal, permits virtually normal hearing of ambient sounds and conversation- Patented EarLock retention rings utilize seven contact points to lock earpieces in place and fit the same way every time- Made from soft hypo-allergenic medical-grade polymer- Sound stem extends slightly farther into ear canal compared to other open earpieces, producing a ""boost"" effect by delivering sound more efficiently- Enables clear hearing with lower radio volume setting reducing possibility of gradual hearing loss- Adjustable sound stem depth allows fine-tuning for increased comfort- Flange centers tube in ear canal for efficient sound transmission and improved earpiece retentionSpecifications:- Each individual earpiece is packaged in a convenient carry case.- Size: Large- Quantity: 2 Left Ear Only- Color: BlackCheck it out Here"

This one is for all the AR builders out there! I am looking to trade my Glock 30 for 2 or 3 stripped AR .223 lower receivers (qty depends on brand name and if new).  My Glock has a lone wolf threaded barrel (I was running a Liberty can, but now it's on my 1911). I have a factory magazine, along with Trijicon night sights.   I do also have the factory barrel and that is included as well.

SAR3 Romainian chambered in 5.56 and mfg in 2000.

It has one Bakelight magazine worth about $100 on it's own plus a Chinese bakelight grip also worth about $100.

The rivets are in excellent shape with no dimples or mushrooming. The barrel appears to be chrome lined and the rifling is perfect. There is no magazine wobble. There were a couple of small  places where I removed a slight spot of rust and treated with oil.

The bobber has fresh paint and new parts such as a new seat, drag bars, spedo, bar end mirrors, rejetted. Custom light gauges. Solo break light on the rear, and new tires. The bikes exhaust was chopped and 4in baffels installed with some exhaust wrap for that true bobber look. The motorcycle will come with a new rear fender for the tire that still needs to be installed. The bike may require a new battery next year as its starting to get old but it works fine as long as the motorcycle is started once a day. The bike is actually a pretty quick bike for a 83.

These are six shot revolvers that fire 45 ACP with a moon clip. These are made to fire without the moon clips but it's more of a hassle to eject the shells. Part of the crane is worn so it's possible to remove the cylinder while the retaining screw is still in. This doesn't affect how it fires. This is not the prettiest of these I've ever seen so the price reflects that. Cleaner copies of this revolver regularly sell for nearly twice what I'm asking so the price is firm. I am available to meet evenings and weekends. Please e-mail if interested. If the ad is still up it is still for sale.

Made in the U.S.A. from soft hypoallergenic polymer, their ergonomic design makes them comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Their Patented EarLock retention rings utilize seven contact points to lock the earpieces in place and fit the same way every time. And because they fit snugly inside your outer ear and feature a low-profile design, you can use them while wearing a helmet, mask, or hat, or while using a phone or headset.  The EP2 differs from the EP1 in that its adjustable stem extends further into the ear canal, offering a boost effect to received audio transmissions. And its single flange helps hold the stem in place without closing off the ear canal. This unique design permits a wearer to still hear outside sounds and communications, while the adjustable stem allows for crystal-clear hearing of incoming radio communications with lower radio volumes, which can help prevent hearing loss over the long term.   Features: - Permit discrete and covert monitoring of radio communications- Open design does not block ear canal, permits virtually normal hearing of ambient sounds and conversation- Patented EarLock retention rings utilize seven contact points to lock earpieces in place and fit the same way every time- Made from soft hypo-allergenic medical-grade polymer- Sound stem extends slightly farther into ear canal compared to other open earpieces, producing a ""boost"" effect by delivering sound more efficiently- Enables clear hearing with lower radio volume setting reducing possibility of gradual hearing loss- Adjustable sound stem depth allows fine-tuning for increased comfort- Flange centers tube in ear canal for efficient sound transmission and improved earpiece retentionSpecifications:- Each individual earpiece is packaged in a convenient carry case.- Size: Medium- Quantity: 2 Left Ear Only- Color: Black Check if out Here"

Nice clean low round count rifle / shotgun
Comes with see through tri-rail dust cover, 6 Position Tapco Stock, Fiber Optic front bead sight, 4x Red Dot Scope, 2x 4 rnd mags, 1x 15 rnd mag, 30rnd drum mag, CMC Demon Doorbuster Comp. Also includes all original take-off parts and 100rnds of ammo including some 3"" Steel Magnum rounds. I also have rail mounted flashlight w/ pressure switch I can add but you'll need the mounting ring for the pic rail (I might have one, but assume you'll need one in case I can't find it).

This is a very fun to shoot and very accurate AK, last time I used it I was poping skeets with ease
Might include the brand new case seen in pic if your trade or cash offer warrants it (it's a brand new $100 locking aluminum case)

Please no silly trade or lowball offers, in you are interested you should be aware of the value of this package, with everything included I have a little over a grand into this set-up. Which is easy to confirm by googling the parts listed.
These are very hard to come by in .410. 
This thing eats everything that it's fed, mags are for 3"" but you can get mags to use shorter rounds if desired.

The 410 000 Buck is one bad ass round sending 5 40cal lead balls down range as quickly as you can pull the trigger. Will also run all types of shot and slugs, use it for hunting with the 2 4rnd mags or rip away at the range with a 30rnd drum mag!

****Please don't write asking if it is still available, if it is up it is available
Serious inquiries only please, I have wasted a lot of time with dreamers lately, must be willing to pick up in Hillsboro, Newport, or Concord.

I will only respond to serious offers whether I'm interested or not I will respond and appreciate as much info as possible on your trade offer. Please  be  prepared to send pics if it's something I'm interested in that's the first thing I'll ask for (I know it doesn't allow you to send pics in the initial contact)
