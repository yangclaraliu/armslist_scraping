This is one of the more unique Predators that you'll see. The frame and all small parts are hardchrome, the slide is Balck Nitride (aka Melonite). 
I am the original owner and this was purchased directly from Nighthawk. The gun is unfired. 
The build quality on this Nighthawk is amazing and on par with my Wilson Supergrades. The slide to frame fit is tight (no play) and very smooth, the trigger is excellent and as good as any custom 1911 that I have, and the barrel lockup is absolutely perfect. 
I'm very picky when it comes to 1911s and I've sent several customs back to various makers as I'll find something wrong (usually cosmetic). When you pay this kind of money for a 1911, it should be perfect. 
This 1911 is absolutely perfect in every way. Please email me with any questions at all. The ONLY partial trade I'd be interested in would be a Sig 226 S4 or a Sig MK25 with a threaded barrel. 

$2750 shipped from my FFL to yours. Trade value will be higher than the purchase value. 
(Nighthawk's MSRP for a base Predator is $3,595. The hardchrome/black nitride finish was a $400 option putting the gun at $3,995.)"

These rifles are $1975 new from DSA.

I am the second owner, the first being a friend who shot less than 50 rounds through the rifle.  I have put ~100 through it myself.  After purchasing it from him, I decided I loved the compact package, but wanted it to be stylized a bit more like a Rhodesian Bush War rifle. 

Several cosmetic and functional changes have been made to the rifle:

- Extended/Checkered Magazine Release Installed (original not included)
- Rifle was given a set of actual Rhodesian NBC handguards (original BCs can be swapped in if preferred)
- Rifle was outfitted with Rhodesian grenade launcher sight gas plug (original DSA can be swapped in if preferred).
- Rifle was weathered and painted with proper Rhodesian paint scheme.
- Front sling swivel was unmounted.

Class is limited to 16 students; cost is $55/student.

In order to obtain your concealed handgun license (CHL) in Texas, you must take a class consisting of 4-6 hours of classroom instruction, a multiple choice exam, and a live fire demonstration. If the thought of sitting in a classroom for 4-6 hours of state mandated training reminds you of everything that’s wrong with defensive driving classes, you’ve come to the right place. Texas CHL classes from Hooten Armory are fun. The instructor is passionate about firearms, safety and proficiency. Our training philosophy is that if you are enjoying yourself, you will absorb more information, you’ll retain it longer, and you’ll be more willing to continue your education. As the saying goes, time really does fly when you are having fun.

The course begins in the classroom and covers four topics: Handgun Use, Safe and Proper Storage of Handguns and Ammunition, Non-Violent Dispute Resolution, and the legal Use of Force. This is followed by a 25 question multiple choice exam. We will then break for lunch and meet at the range for the firearms proficiency demonstration. 

Class will start at 8:00 AM and we should wrap up around 2:30 PM.

You may never find one of these for sale, mint in the box ever again!
This is a rare Daisy Softair Model 12 airsoft gun. This was the beginning of the airsoft craze. These were manufactured in 1980's and only made about 1 year before they were pulled from the shelves for being almost identical looking of the guns they were made to resemble. It uses actual shells to hold the softair bb’s, which, when fired eject from the gun just like a real firearm. It does use the standard airsoft bb’s of today, so if you still want to use it there is no shortage of ammo. Resembles the Tec-9.

if someone is interested in just buying the console without a trade I'm down for that also. I figured $320 would be a fair price. You would pay around that for just the console at gamestop or wherever. Except your getting a decent used one with everything included.

I have shot it out to 400 yards with no change in grouping. The .300 BLK barrels are designed to perform with both subsonic (220 and 208 gr) and supersonic loads. The gas port has been tuned to lock the bolt open on the last round when using subsonic ammunition with a sound suppressor or supersonic ammo without a suppressor. The bolt may not lock back when using subsonic ammunition WITHOUT a sound suppressor installed.

It will come with the picatinny scope base that is on it. $600.  Scope and rings and bipod not included.

The scope is a Bushnell elite 2-7x32.  I love this scope, for the money I have gotten a ton of use from it.  Its small but excellent and has held up very well to some unintentional abuse.  The rings are TPS brand aluminum rings and are really nice.  IF you want the scope and rings with the rifle I will let it all go for $750.  This would be a ready to hunt package!  Bipod not included, only used for pictures.

I bought this about a month ago and have put just under 100 rounds through it. It’s a beautiful pistol, shoots really well and the sights appear dead on from the factory. Unfortunately for me, it just doesn't sit well in my hand, so I’m letting it go.

Gun is in excellent condition and comes with all the goodies from the factory. It came equipped with the SigLite Night Sights, which, of course are bright as new. (2) 15-round factory mags are included with the pistol. I also purchased (3) Mec-Gar 20-round magazines from Midway just after I picked up the pistol. One has been loaded and used once; the other two are still new, unopened.

The specific model number of this pistol is: E26R-9-BSS if you want to check it out online.

What you get:
•	Sig Sauer P226 E26R-9-BSS Black Nitron Finish, SigLite Night Sights, 4.4” barrel
•	(2) Sig 15-round Factory magazines
•	(3) Mec-Gar 20-round magazines, 2 unopened 
•	(1) Sig Case with all the regular goodies that come with the pistol

***Sold***

Price is $800, Firm. Trade value is $825  I paid $890 plus transfer/BGC for everything, so I think it’s a fair price. I’m looking primarily for cash, but I have a limited list of trades available below. I want at least $300 cash out of this, so any trade I’d consider needs to leave me with at least that much.

The only trades I’ll consider at this time:
•	M&P 9 or 40, full size
•	Glock 19 or 17, gen 4 preferred

I am going to address the practices of people on our site.
I am an old man and computer illiterate. I can't post photos. I have bought and sold may guns here and have loved the site. I now am very ill and attempting to sell of my firearms at the request of my dear wife. I provide as detailed a description of any fire arm I sell and never ""puff"" it up. If it's less that my description I'm wasting my and your time.
I continue to get folks who want photos and it generally take several days to get my photos set to your phone only. If I'm selling  A S&W MP15, rifle /w/ 20"" barrel in A2 configuration, A2 sites, stock etc. and send the photos to a prospective buyer and he ask me back if I have a S&W MP15,  ARC? I'm would have listed it as such if it was.
When I list (2) Dan Wesson revolvers in pristine condition, (1) 4"" (1) 6"" barrel and send photos and have clearly listed the prices. I get a request ""what's the prices? Does any one read these adds!
When I list in the ad ""Illness requires sale of my fire arms"" and I'm recovering from cancer and give my phone number in the ad and then NOT one person calls, but just emails. If your bored and need a hobby please don't make it being a nuisance on Armslist and causing people grief. My wife ask one thing of me, I am on Hospice, ""Please don't leave me with all this stuff"", meaning my fire arms and all the associated gear. 
So Google a fire arm if you don't know what it is and just are a ""Looky Lue"". 
Thank You for being considerate to  the other of use that are just trying to sell a gun!"

The NYPD used these for duty guns for many years. The story I got from the dealer is that this was a cops duty pistol and back then you could keep your pistol when you retire. Over 40 years later he sold it and I bought it. Doesn't look like it had much use. I had it professionally reblued and put about 50 rounds thru it. I confirmed with S&W that this gun was made and left the factory in 1960. It's in great shape with the original grips. A great example of an antique S&W revolver. Comes with a nylon zipper case. Will ship to FFL. Will accept PAYPAL. Buyer pays all transfer & shipping fees.

I'm selling a new, unused, in-the-box Pietta 1858 stainless steel, .44 blackpowder, 8-inch barrel with lots of extras.  Just the gun alone is worth more than the price, but you will also get the following:

a custom walnut case, blue felt lining, mortised lock and key (like the original revolver cases from the 1800s had) made by Gerrod Hampel,

Triple K belt, possibles bag, dual spare cylinder pouch and flap holster.  The belt I modified with a 2-piece 1858 Eagle belt buckle.  I'll include the original brass tang buckle if you'd like to change it back.  Not really historically accurate for Civil War re-enactors to have an Eagle buckle with a CS holster, but I just liked the rich, reddish-brown look of Triple K walnut oil leather.  The belt fits virtually any waist size; to modify the belt for the Eagle buckle, I just bought a larger belt size (46"") and doubled some of the length through the buckle.  Fits me, and I'm a 34"" waist,

extra set of checkered white grips from NC Ordnance.  Solid plastic with a great ivory look.  Feels great in the hand and really looks good on this gun! 

The price also includes insured USPS shipping to any continental U.S. location (because it's a blackpowder gun, I can ship it directly to you).  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks again!"

PRICE: 1350.00 

For sale only is  a custom built AR15 in 300 Blackout. The lower is a DPMS and the upper consists of a custom built stainless barrel and muzzle brake with a Yankee hill free float hand guard with a small quad rail at the end. The whole gun has been cerakoted OD Green, with the exception the controls which are armor black and the barrel and muzzle brake which are stainless steel.  The stock is a magpul CTR and the pistol grip is a magpul MOE both are OD Green. The BCG is all nickel boron and the trigger is a 2 stage match trigger that breaks at about 4lbs. There is a small (less than 1/2 inch) crack in the lower that happened during the oven curing process of cerakoting but it does not hinder the functionality of the rifle in any way, shape or form. It is hardly noticed by the eye. On top of the rifle I have a black 3x9x40mm Leupold Rifleman scope sitting in Nikon P-223 scope rings. The gun is extremely accurate. Using a lead sled It shoots 1/2 groups at 100 yards with both supersonics and subsonics. At 200 yards I have no problem shooting 2 to 2.5 inch groups with both subs and supers and at 400 yards I am consistently hitting an 8 inch Shoot N See target with factory loaded supersonics. At the moment, the rifle is zero'd in at 200 yards with 168 grain Hornady Amaxs. For the right deal I will include 4 pmags that vary between OD, black, Desert tan and Foliage green,  a mix of about 100 rounds of hornady 168 grain A-Maxs and 200 rounds of 190 grain nosler custom competition rounds, as well as a few 120 grain supersonics. That's over 400 dollars in extras.. Text 2five2-4five8-seven0four9 for pictures or email.  Thanks for looking.

I have fired over 600 rounds flawlessly without any failures. Never used any steel case ammo but I do not see why it would not be able to fire it with no trouble. The main components of this platform are made with parts from the best in the business. Had plans to get a better lower but put that on hold when I felt no real performance difference from my friends noveske lower and this one. Cleaned after every range visit.

Looking for 1100 Cash. Hell of a deal considering everything included. Each mag is loaded so with what is in the ammo case there should be about 440 rounds of free ammo! 

This is a range ready package. Take it for a spin the day you buy it I promise you will not be disappointed. I also kept the magpul packaging to show the afg and back up sight are not airsoft versions."

Columbus/ Harris County, Columbus, GA, Georgia",$ 650,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 11, 2015",Rifles,Ruger                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Selling my nearly new Ruger Mini-14 Ranch Rifle. This is the stainless steel version, with the black synthetic stock,and is the newer 581-series with the outstanding new sights, and the thicker barrel that has greatly improved the infamous accuracy issues of some of the early models.
I'm the original owner of the rifle, bought it 4-5 years ago, and it's only been fired 3 or 4 times, for a total round count under 300 rounds. I've run several types of ammo through it, from Lake City 5.56 to Russian steel cased .223, and it has been 100% reliable ( this is a great rifle, I have no problem with a test fire if you have someplace safe and convenient to shoot).
Included are the original box and owners manual, the factory scope rings, and several magazines. I have 5 Ruger-factory steel 20-round mags, one of them still new in the packaging (these are widely considered the very best mags for the mini). Also included is a factory 5-rounder (ideal for hunting or bench shooting), and 2 after-market 30-rounders, that I've never even fired through.
It also has a green canvas sling wrapped in black paracord made by a freind of mine, and a spare magazine pouch on the stock, that also has a raised pad that improves cheek-weld.
The rifle is in nearly perfect condition, but for some abrasions on the front sight post where I tried to mount a slip-on flash suppressor that I never could get as secure as I'd like, and gave up on.
I'm really just needing the cash, so it's unlikely I'm interested in any trades (but maybe an AR).
All the usual legal stuff applies: buyer must be legal Georgia resident, over age 18, and able to legally own a firearm. I have my Ga. carrry permit, so I got all my ducks in a row.
If the ad is still up, then it's still for sale, I won't respond to e-mails asking, ""is the item still for sale"", or vague e-mails that just ask for my phone number. Please, say SOMETHING so I know it's not just another scammer that we get plagued with on this site.
Price is firm.
Thanks for looking........

edit: I just found another Ruger 5-round steel magazine for it !!"

I would be hard pressed to say this pistol has seen anywhere near 1,000 rounds through it based on the lack of polishing on the barrel. Come have a look or contact us with any questions.
