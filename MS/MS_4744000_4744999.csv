SR-15 E3 Mod 2  in 5.56x45

Mint Condition.  210 Rounds fired through this rifle, all factory new 5.56x45 ammunition.  You're probably aware, this is the very best AR-15 style rifle on the market.  

I purchased this firearm new in 2015.  It has been a safe queen since purchased, taken out only for use at the firing range, then cleaned and placed back in the safe.  I have replaced the grip and buttstock to Bravo Company Gunfighter models, with the grip being the Bravo Gunfighter sold by Wilson Combat.  In addition, I added the BCM Gunfighter KAG forward grip stock.  All of these upgrades will be included with the rifle.  It will also come with the factory case and manual.  The excellent KAC back-up iron sights are included as well.  Shown sling, mags, optic, and mount are not included.

The manufacturer's description:

The Knight's Armament SR-15 IWS E3 Mod 2 Carbine may be based on the Eugene Stoner designed operating system but the similarities nearly end there.

Features include a 16 inch chrome lined, 5.56mm NATO barrel that is manufactured to military specifications.  Attached to the muzzle is the with Knight's Armament 3 prong flash hider.  New on the Mod 2 is a proprietary mid-length gas system that increases reliability and durability while also reducing felt recoil.  The gas block no longer uses taper pins or set screws but is held on by a castle nut which allows for an air tight seal.  Keeping with the air tight theme, the unique gas tube uses a compression fitting where it meets the gas block.  This is very similar to what is used in automotive hydraulic brake lines.  With these two features you won't have to worry about gas system leakage which can cause malfunctions, especially with lower powered ammo.  

On the opposite end of the barrel is Knight's Armament's proven E3 round-lug bolt which both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. The bolt is desigend to outlive the barrel.  The E3 bolt rides in a full auto carrier.  

Surrounding the barrel is Knight's new URX keymod handguard, 14.5 inches in length.  The extended length handguard allows for a forward grip which makes moving from target to target much faster.  The keymod handguard will accept all standard keymod accessories such as hand stops, rail covers, light mounts or picatinny rail sections.  One 5 slot picatinny keymod rail section is supplied with the rifle.  The URX 4 handguard design increases cooling characteristics and reduces weight and bulk compared with standard 1913 rail attachment methods.

An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offer left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternative methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. Included parts and features, such as the two-sided receiver end plate QD sling swivel mounting point, collapsible six-position SOPMOD stock, hybrid ambidextrous selector lever, and folding 200-600 meter sights, round out the package to deliver a cutting-edge carbine right out of the case.

MSRP is over $2,300.  With the upgrades, over $2400.  Price is firm."

This pistol was made in 1918. This would have originally been what is referred to as a ""Black Army"". When I purchased it it had suffered the indignity of a poor cold blue. I removed the cold blue and was going to have it parked but I have other projects that are more pressing at the time. Pistol is complete and appears fully functional. All markings are clear, would look really good reparked. The slide is more of a dull gray and the frame a little more reddish brown. Still has a slight cold blue smell. Once again, fine for a shooter or would be fine reparked. Im not sure who made the barrel, the symbol in the pictures in the only mark I see. Bore is fair-good, shootable but dark and a little fuzzy from corrosive ammo use. Comes with one 1980's contract magazine.

Aimpoint CompM4 sights are the finest sights that Aimpoint has ever produced. The improved energy efficiency provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery! Aimpoint CompM4 sights incorporate an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of firearms. They can also be used by hunters and sport shooters that need night vision compatibility. CompM4 sights are available in two versions. The two versions are identical except that the CompM4 offers a high battery compartment, while the CompM4S offers a low battery compartment. The Aimpoint CompM4 is now the latest version of the US Army's M68 CCO (Close-Combat Optic), continuing a legacy that Aimpoint has maintained since 1997. The performance of the CompM4 sights is optimized for use with all generations of Night Vision Devices (NVDs), but is especially suited for 3rd generation night vision technology. Aimpoint's unique band-pass coating on the front lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness with the smallest amount of energy while transmitting nearly 100% of light in the Infrared and near-infrared part of the spectrum to provide the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation NVD. With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 Daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 and CompM4S are ready for use around the clock."

Pistol is in great shape with under a hundred rounds fired through it. I upgraded to a .40 a few years ago and really have no need of this little handgun. 

I don't like selling guns. My MO has always been to hoard the little buggars whether I use them or not. That said, I'm trying to get my car fixed this week. (operative term..THIS WEEK)

This gun will be for sale for the next 2-3 days max. Price is 425 or best offer. If you want it, email me and give me a reasonable offer. If nobody wants it, that's cool too..I'll just bum rides til I get paid next Friday and put it back in my safe.

Photos are generic, but buyer will receive a virtually identical rifle from the 20 some odd specimens we got on this deal. Dealers, agencies, and collectors may take any virtually identical rifles we have on hand at the same per-gun price, and with no extra shipping charges. Here is the best looking AR-15 .22 on the market, Mossberg’s 715T. Manufacturer is CBC of Ribeirão Pires, Brazil, the company that brought us the excellent Nylon 66 clones back in the 1980s.  Importer and warrantor is Mossberg International of New Haven, CT, and Eagle Pass, Texas. Type is blowback action rimfire semi automatic. Chambering is .22 Long Rifle caliber, high velocity ammunition. Construction is steel one piece barrel, bolt, trigger, hammer, and internal parts built into a lightweight alloy main receiver, and all encased in a polymer AR15 style platform. Barrel is 18 inch medium .635 outside diameter, 1:16 six groove right hand bore. Sights are fixed post front, with windage and A2 style elevation adjustable single blade aperture rear, both shielded in cosmetic polymer. Scope base is a factory issue Tapco polymer detachable 12 slot Picatinny. Forend assembly is a 24 slot Picatinny Quad-rail type, to hold any number of optical or light devices. Upper and lower rails are forend integral, but laterals are 3 screw detachable. Forward sling swivel is 1 1/4 inch barrel mounted, with a steel QD stud in the buttstock. Bolt operating handle is extended serrated face with lock position; the upper shroud integral rear handle is cosmetic. Trigger is .230 smooth faced steel two stage, pulls at 5 pound vicinity with moderate felt movement and overtravel. Safety is push button type, forward of the trigger for a right handed shooter, non reversable. Magazine release is ambidextrous, with an appearance similar to a selector lever. Magazine furnished is a 702 series 10 rounder, and that is how we got it. Buttstock is factory issue ATI M4 / CAR type 6 position, with a length of pull from 10 3/4 to 14 3/4 inches. Buttstock laterals have 3 1/2 inch spaced twin female screw anchor recesses for add ons. Finish is matte blued and black metal and black polymers.  Overall length ranges from 34 to 38 1/4 inches. Weight empty is 5 pounds 2 ounces, with center of gravity at the breech face. This 715T and its mates come to us from Mossberg’s distribution system, likely from showgirl duty with their sales force. The factory recessed its upper cover beside its serial number and stamped their letter U. Apart from that, surface detractions are minimal to negligible, only faint operation buffing on the bolt surfaces. We rate each rifle as Excellent in Box, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading. Each 715T comes in a relabeled Mossberg factory box with lock, protective papers, safety flyers, and instruction manual that contains Mossberg’s warranty statement. Its manual package and magazine were factory sealed when we got it. Chamber, bore, and mechanism are all bright and clean. If this rifle has been fired at all, we estimate it was fewer than 100 rounds. Replacement pricing on similar rifles from competitors Colt, Ruger, and Smith & Wesson approach $500 apiece.

It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.Type: PistolAction: Double ActionCaliber: 380 Automatic Colt Pistol (ACP)Barrel Length: 2.75""Capacity: 6+1Safety: Hammer BlockGrips: PolymerSights: NoneWeight: 7.2 oz"

When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.  Transfer BarThe transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.  Fiber Optic SightLight gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer"

It is Colt branded/designed but made by Umarex but to confuse you even more from my understanding the design was by walther. So Colt branded, Walther designed, and Umarex is manyfacturer. I have put many rounds down this model and had no issues whatsoever. A couple no fires but it was due to the various different older rounds I was putting through it since I had a stockpile of .22 until recently. Asking $325 and will include a 500 round box of remington ammo. 

Firm on price. - sorry. I paid a good bit more new but they have come down in price since. Also have had enough texts about it to feel its a decent price point. If you want one for $300 and want to beat me up on price about it go buy one of the plastic mossbergs new for $300. Or if you have an AR lower I have seen the Chippawa (I misspelled that) .22 AR conversion uppers for about $200.

Photos are generic, but buyers will receive a virtually identical rifle from the same shipment that the photo specimen came to us with. Dealers, agencies, and collectors may take any virtually identical rifles we have on hand at the same per-gun price, and with no extra shipping charges. Here is the best looking AR-15 .22 on the market, Mossberg’s 715T. Manufacturer is CBC of Ribeirão Pires, Brazil, the company that brought us the excellent Nylon 66 clones back in the 1980s.  Importer and warrantor is Mossberg International of New Haven, CT, and Eagle Pass, Texas. Type is blowback action rimfire semi automatic. Chambering is .22 Long Rifle caliber, high velocity ammunition.

Muzzle is threaded, then, and the brake installed with a crush washer system. Sight system base is a 23 slot vertical picatinny rail over the barrel, with 16 slot Picatinny over the receiver. Detachable front sight is A3 type elevation adjustable post, alloy and steel construction, with detachable alloy and steel dual aperture rear that is windage and elevation adjustable. Forend assembly’s quad rail system is completed by 17 slot lateral and lower Picatinny rails, 3 screw detachable laterals and forend integral lower, to hold any number of optical or light devices. Forward sling swivel is 1 1/4 inch barrel mounted, with a steel QD stud in the buttstock.

Buttstock laterals have 3 1/2 inch spaced twin female screw anchor recesses for add ons. Finish is matte blued and black metal and black polymers.  Overall length ranges from 34 to 38 1/4 inches. Weight empty is 4 pounds 13 ounces, with center of gravity at the breech face. This rifle and its mates come to us from Mossberg’s distribution system, likely from showgirl duty with their sales force. The factory recessed its upper cover beside its serial number and stamped their letter U. Apart from that, surface detractions are minimal, only barrel surface streaks and faint operation buffing on the bolt surfaces. Each comes in a relabeled Mossberg factory box with lock, protective papers, safety flyers, and instruction manual that contains Mossberg’s warranty statement. Its manual package and magazine were factory sealed when we got it. Chamber, bore, and mechanism are all bright and clean. We rate them as Excellent in Box, 90 percent vicinity by our estimate, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading.

And they have zero wear or marks on them. 

First one is a gen 3 that came from the factory with a threaded barrel and suppressor sights, glock ran them for a short time time but they did come that way. Price is 550$ on that one

Second one is a gen 4, it's just a nice brand new gun, the gen 4 have the interchangeable back straps and better recoil spring. Price is 525$ 

Trade value for both is 1075$ cash price for both only if you buy them both is 1000$, would like to sell at least one of them.

I am open to trades I like revolvers Smith and Wesson performance center or pro series really. Not the only thing I'm looking for but it'd be nice to have another. Models 686, 327, 627, 66 are ones I like most. No rugers or Taurus please. Revolvers must be in 357. 

The only caliber guns I'm looking for are 9mm, 357,  .45, 5.56 and .308. Other then those restrictions I'll listen to offers."

This Stainless Taurus 905 was my entry into revolvers since 9mm ammo are both plentiful and inexpensive. I've since taken the plunge into reloading and now make .38/.357 rounds affordably. Because I'm shooting 9mm less and less, it may be time to let it go to someone else who is invested in 9mm as I was. Still really love this revolver but can use the funds for more reloading components!

I am the original owner and this revolver has given me no trouble whatsoever. It is as solid, reliable, and straightforward as any S&W revolver I own. It comes with box, paperwork, and all original accessories unusued. In addition 10 extra durable moonclips from Ranch Products will be included.

9mm revolvers are really becoming popular with both Ruger and Charter Arms making their versions. The Taurus is still the most affordable and its all metal frame handles 9mm's recoild far better than the polymer Ruger LCR. Charter Arms Pitbull tried to solve the rimless cartridge challenge with a complex extractor star design that makes it both harder to load and unload than using moon-clips. In a stressful reload situation, moon-clips are time-proven to be far superior.

Priced to sell but taking Best Offers -not to haggle. You will not find the same revolver cheaper anywhere with all the necessary extras included. If you offer more, you will jump to the head of the line.

Including both magazines. The body of each magazine is nickel and the foot and follower are gold finished. This Colt is new and un-fired. The mainspring housing on this gun WAS plastic from the factory. Before being polished and 2X plated in 24 karat gold, we replaced the plastic housing (backstrap) with a steel housing. Also, in place of the standard plain black factory aluminum trigger, we installed a mil spec steel trigger with three precision holes drilled as an additional custom feature. We have taken every precaution and all the steps necessary to be sure this gun is worthy of a place in any top shelf collection. This new gun was disassembled, then all parts were individually worked and hand polished. Every large and small part, pin, and screw was given attention. Once each part was hand polished to a bright mirror finish, every part of this Colt was bright nickel plated. The small parts were then 2X plated in 24 karat gold that was applied in a process ensuring even color and distribution. The end result is a fine Colt .38 super that has been worked into a thing of rare beauty! We installed a hand picked pair of white pearlite grips with matching large Colt gold icons. You could look a long time and not find a .38 super Colt with high polish nickel and gold finish."

and the AR's well those have so many ridiculous add-on extras that a $600 weapon pimped out so comically and needlessly of course will cost at least $1200. Cuz it has a cool trigger job done on it. Er body knows them factory triggers ain't capable of causing a weapon to actually fire.

Some of the game and animal control agencies in these infested locations limit the projectile distance capability to 1.5 miles, so use the ELP 22lr Silver BulletÔ product family; yet the 22 WMR is the preferred long range cartridge as shown in the attached photo. Those locations where Vampire Bats are prevalent, and Bats in caves, large caliber handgun cartridges with the ELP Mercury Filled Capsules are preferred and are shot from some distance into these infested caves.

Photos are generic, but buyer will receive a virtually identical rifle from the dozen odd specimens we got on this deal. Dealers, agencies, and collectors may take any virtually identical rifles we have on hand at the same per-gun price, and with no extra shipping charges. Here is Mossberg’s 715T series Flex-22 Rifle. Manufacturer is CBC of Ribeirão Pires, Brazil, the company that brought us the excellent Nylon 66 clones back in the 1980s.  Importer and warrantor is Mossberg International of New Haven, CT, and Eagle Pass, Texas. Type is blowback action rimfire semi automatic. Chambering is .22 Long Rifle caliber, high velocity ammunition. Construction is steel one piece barrel, bolt, trigger, hammer, and internal parts built into a lightweight alloy main receiver. Barrel is 16 inch medium .635 outside diameter, 1:16 six groove right hand bore. Muzzle is threaded with an A2 type cage muzzle brake attached with crush washer, and brings the barrel length out to 17 1/2 inches. Sighting system is threefold: front sight is hood protected screw on, with red fiber optic insert. Rear sight is screw on windage and elevation adjustable with green fiber optic inserts. Receiver is 3/8 inch grooved, with a factory issue 3 screw 9 slot Picatinny rail atop. Bolt operating handle is extended serrated face with lock position. Trigger is .230 smooth faced steel two stage, pulls at 5 pound vicinity with moderate felt movement and overtravel. Safety is push button type, forward of the trigger for a right handed shooter, non reversable. Magazine release is in front of the trigger guard, 715T type. Magazine furnished is a steel 10 rounder, but this 702 variant will accept both 702 and 715 Magazines. Stock is factory issue three piece quick detach Flex ® series, made by UDC for Mossberg. Pistol grip is thin black polymer serrated side; main stock is M4 type 6 position retractable with alloy main tube. Length of pull ranges from 11 1/4 to 14 1/2 inches, from the .215 smooth trigger face to the end of the 1 inch butt pad. Rear swivel is AR type permanent, with QD front swivel studs. Note the stippled surfaces and Mossberg M logo on the laterals. Finish is matte blued and black anodized and black polymers.  Overall length is  33 1/2 to 37 1/4 inches. Weight empty is 5 pounds 2 ounces, with center of gravity at the magazine release. This 702 and its mates come to us from Mossberg’s distribution system, likely from showgirl duty with their sales force. The factory stamped their letter U beside its serial number. Apart from that, surface detractions are minimal to negligible, only faint operation buffing on the bolt surfaces. We rate each rifle as Excellent in Box, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading. Each 702 Flex comes in a relabeled Mossberg factory box with lock, protective papers, safety flyers, and instruction manual that contains Mossberg’s warranty statement. Its manual package and magazine were factory sealed when we got it. Chamber, bore, and mechanism are all bright and clean. If this rifle has been fired at all, we estimate it was fewer than 100 rounds. Replacement pricing on similar rifles from competitors Remington, Ruger, and Marlin approach $400 apiece.

50 rounds through each.  New the Trifecta MAAD mount costs $310.  The flash hider costs $89.  Im selling both for $290.

The Saker supressor has interchangable mounting systems for use with different manufacturers muzzle devices.  With these parts you can mount your Saker supressor utilizing your existing mounts or you can swap and use the new Trifecta flash hider. The trifecta flash hider has variable length prongs to eliminate harmonics and makes shooting it even quieter. The MAAD system in my opinion is the best of both worlds between a quick attach system and a direct thread system.  The trifecta MAAD mount press fits onto the muzzle device and then locks in place.  Unlike most quick attach mounts the MAAD mount maintains precision accuracy because it mounts so securely and becomes integral with the barrel.

History: The PT92 is seen by many as a ‘clone’ of the highly regarded Beretta Model 92F, but when Taurus made the first PT-92 in 1980, they didn’t copy or reverse-engineer the Beretta Model 92F as is sometimes believed. Instead, they bought Beretta’s entire Brazilian factory with its machinery, parts and plans and even kept Beretta’s trained workers at their stations. The early Taurus PT92 are, in some aspects, actually preferred by many enthusiasts over the considerably more expensive Beretta due to improvements made when Taurus took over production.( specifically replacing plastic parts with stainless steel )
Testimonial: Chris Dumm writing for thetruthaboutguns.com after 
an extensive side by side comparison of the Taurus PT92 and the Beretta Model 92F had this opinion:
“A damned fine pistol and a great value. After comparing and shooting the Taurus and Beretta side-by-side, I would choose the Taurus first”…………

Here is your chance to own an excellent and highly regarded firearm at a bargain price.   This is an early 1980’s production Taurus PT92AF full-size semiautomatic pistol originally intended for police and military use.
History: The PT92 is seen by many as a ‘clone’ of the highly regarded Beretta Model 92F, but when Taurus made the first PT-92 in 1980, they didn’t copy or reverse-engineer the Beretta Model 92F as is sometimes believed. Instead, they bought Beretta’s entire Brazilian factory with its machinery, parts and plans and even kept Beretta’s trained workers at their stations. The early Taurus PT92 are, in some aspects, actually preferred by many enthusiasts over the considerably more expensive Beretta due to improvements made when Taurus took over production.( specifically replacing plastic parts with stainless steel )
Testimonial: Chris Dumm writing for thetruthaboutguns.com after an extensive side by side comparison of the Taurus PT92 and the Beretta Model 92F had this opinion:

“A damned fine pistol and a great value. After comparing and shooting the Taurus and Beretta side-by-side, I would choose the Taurus first”…………

If you look on Midway or any other online retailer of reloading equipment, it's very highly rated, unfortunately, I just don't have the time to reload anymore and this is the last piece of equipment I have left.  

The trimmer requires case holders for each individual cartridge, I shot 5.56 and 7.62 so I've included case holders for each.  The 7.62 includes a holder for both new and fired cases.  I've also included the small & large primer pocket reamer that removes military crimps from 5.56 cases.  Lastly, it also includes the L.E. Wilson Case Trimmer Power Adapter which allows you to attach the cutter to a power drill and spend a fractional amount of time trimming.   

This is all less than 2 months old and includes the boxes for all accessories.  New is $250+, I'm asking for $125.  Thanks for looking."

The MGPTS Type III incorporates all of the features and benefits of the standard tent system with a patented internal arch for support and clear, unobstructed interior space. This proprietary arch system creates a structure which distributes wind, rain and snow loads away from the fabric and directly to the arch (or support system), making a stronger, more durable fielded structure. The MGPTS is designed for superior use in various climate and weather conditions ranging from sweltering heat to severe cold. More versatile and more habitable than its predecessor, the former General Purpose tents, the MGPTS can be used for medical facilities, troop billeting, command and control, field service support, emergency / disaster relief, maintenance functions and storage.
