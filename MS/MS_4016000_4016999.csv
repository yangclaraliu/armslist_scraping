We all end up with a box full of unused holsters. What doesn't work for one may be the ideal solution for another, so why not try a few new ones? New-condition holsters at a fantastic discount--even more if you want all 3. These holsters may fit other pocket pistols, but I know they work with and have tried them on my Sig Sauer P238.

The first is a leather tuckable IWB holster from High Noon - their Hidden Ally, J clip and a banded mouth. See details at this link, pics below:
http://www.highnoonholsters.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Store_Code=01&Screen=PROD&Product_Code=HA

The second holster is the Desantis Nemesis pocket holster. The tag says it's the P6 model; again, fits the P238 perfectly.
Details at the link, followed by pics:

http://www.desantisholster.com/THE-NEMESIS

The third holster is the NRA Smart Carry, which works under any pants, without a belt, including gym shorts or sweats. Pic after the link:
http://www.nrastore.com/nrastore/ProductDetail.aspx?c=2817&p=SA+486&ct=e

These are great holsters, but I've switched the P238 to be a backup gun only and now carry it on my ankle. 

The High Noon tuckable leather holster retails for $39.95, asking $20.
The Nemesis retails at $24.99, asking $10.
The NRA Smart Carry retails at $49.95, asking $20.

This is plenty fast ammo, not like the slower exotic brands. This functions the Pardini SP22, M41s and  Hammerlis very well. I only get one misfire in every 50 boxes.  Also excellent in target grade revolvers. Not suitable for common 22 auto rifles like Ruger. I don't have a Marvel , Ceiner or Nelson top half for the 1911, soni don't know how they perform, if at all. Meet at public landmark. Will trade toward Sig P240, Les Baer Wadcutter or S&W M52."

ARX160: A .22 Tactical Rifle with Full-Size Performance

Finally, a .22 LR tactical training rifle that looks, feels and handles like its full-size counterpart. The ARX160 is a rimfire version of the ARX100, Beretta’s celebrated .223 Rem tactical rifle. But aside from the caliber, this .22 LR rifle is virtually identical to the centerfire version as far as operations, controls, accessorization and customization options. A training rifle that will never let you down, the ARX160 is an extra-durable piece of gear that will satisfy even the most demanding tactical shooter.

Ambidextrous Controls

A serious training rifle should always mirror the “real thing” in the way its controls work. This is why the ARX160 features ambidextrous two-position safety, magazine release and cocking handle. With this rifle, you can easily train and shoot with either hand dominant and improve your skills without breaking the bank.

Limitless Accessorization, Customization Options

This training rifle is a great base for building the tactical system of your dreams. It comes out of the box with four Picatinny rails: on top, a full rail enables you to easily attach your favorite sighting or optics system, while on either side and on the bottom of the fore-end additional rails let you add other accessories such as tactical lighting. Other customization options include the telescopic folding stock: you can adjust the length of pull at the touch of a button, while the stock can be folded partially or all the way to accommodate most firing situations.



Durable, Easy to Shoot and Maintain

The ARX160 is built to be durable and super-tough, being constructed of superior steel and technopolymer. Its flip-up sights are just like those on the full-caliber rifle—super-light but rugged, and featuring a rear diopter for quick and accurate target acquisition. Maintenance is easy thanks to the simple way in which it comes apart and is reassembled without any tools. Whether you use it on its own as a rimfire tactical rifle, or as a training tool to improve your handling of the full-power counterpart, the ARX160 will always turn heads at the range and will never let you down."

I got the chance to buy this matched set two years ago.  I've carried the one with the whitetail deer antler grips every day since, and the other went into the safe, never having been taken out of the factory bag.   It is new and unfired.   At the time, I thought I had to have a spare.   Two years and 7,000+ rounds later and I know I won't ever need a spare.   I can't leave a beautiful pistol like this to spend it's life as a safe queen.

This is the all steel carry version with the 4.25"" barrel.  Check their website for more info at http://www.edbrown.com/sfcarry.htm.  I bought the Ed Brown cocobolo slim grips which are on the gun.  I have the original thicker cocobolo grips, bushings, and screws as well.

If you liked my indestructible whitetail deer antler slim grips, there is good news.  I made a set to go with my spare pistol as well (pictured). Lastly, I made a finger groove set of grips out of osage orange.  They were on my carry pistol for a year when I accidentally scratched one (thus the new antler grips).  I will include those as well.  Naturally, the pistol comes with everything from the factory including two Ed Brown high quality 7 round magazines. I goofed when I took the picture.  I picked up a Kim-Pro mag rather than the Ed Brown.

If you look around, you'll see these pistols are more scarce than hen's teeth.  I'd prefer a local FTF transfer, but would consider shipping if the buyer covered the additional transfer costs (shipping and FFL transfer fees)."

There may be a few more items, as all of it has been boxed up in my garage since purchased.I bought the kit first and then bought the rest over time. I took a reloading class and wanted to make sure I had absolutely everything I could possibly need (and then some) to reload 9mm.  Got as far as bolting the press and powder measure to my work bench and that was it. Work has kept me way too busy, and though it hurts to part with all this, its just way too much money just sitting around collecting dust until the day I'd finally get around to using it. That being said, I'm really only interested in selling everyrhing together. If someone were to offer the right amount for, say, all the bullets, powder, and primers, I may be willing to part that out, but it'd have to be a really good offer so please, no low ball offers. The pictures may not be that great, but I can email close-ups of anything to interested parties. 

If you are a beginner looking to get into this wonderful hobby, then look no further! Nowhere else will you find a more complete, everything-you-need kit! Thanks for looking!"

The CZ 75 Kadet conversion kit is a separate accessory for the CZ 75/85 pistol series allowing the firing of .22 LR caliber cartridges.

The CZ 75 fitted with the Kadet .22LR conversion is the perfect training or plinking pistol with the slide weighted and balanced just like the CZ 75. The Kadet adapter features all-steel construction and an adjustable rear sight.

Included are 2 10-round magazines that fit flush with grips of the full size CZ 75 and SP-01 models.  The Kadet conversion kit will work on the CZ 75 full-size and compact models including the 75, 85, SP-01, 75 Compact, P-01, P-06,  and PCR, but note that the full-size magazines will extend out of the bottom of the shorter grips on these models. The Kadet conversion will not work on the 97, 75 TS, 2075 RAMI, SP-01 Phantom, P-07 or P-09 models.

When used on an aluminum-framed compact model (PCR, P-01 and P-06) as well as the steel-framed Compact .40, a PCR slide stop should be used for proper last-round hold-open. On 85 models, the 85 slide stop must be used but will not enable last-round hold-open.

Approximately 100 rds. fired through this conversion.  Selling because I simply don't have the eyesight to use open sights anymore.
One tiny, tiny, mar near rear sight where I tried to remove sight for red-dot installation.
Other than that, as new condition.
No FFl required for transfer, can ship directly to buyer.
Add $10 for shipping.  Thank you."

It has nice checkering and an adjustable back sight. This gun is as close to perfect as you could want. Included are all original paperwork, the original Winchester box, and the hammer extension for using a scope. This gun is located in Spring Hill and is $750.00. This is not a shooter grade gun, so if you plan on shooting it, you can get cheaper previously fired guns on Gunbroker. This gun would fit into a nice Winchester collection.

 The Millennium action is striker-fired 
 and operates in double-action-only (DAO) mode,
 meaning that it fires only by a consistent
 and repeatable long pull on the trigger. 
 And, much to my applause, 
 the Millennium action requires no pre-loading
 of the firing mechanism. In other words, 
 the Millennium pistol does not require any 
 rearward movement of the slide to pre-set 
 the striker springs or sear. Thus the PT145
 has repeat-strike capability, allowing a second trigger pull
 against any misfire without having to manually 
 cycle the slide to reset the trigger action."

This new “Heavy” 44 SPL load is designed for use in all 44 SPL handguns and rifles, except Charter Arms Bull Dog. Likewise, it is safe for use in all 44 magnum chambered firearms. This Barnes X type bullet will expand on flesh and bone and penetrate more deeply than most expanding lead core bullets of the same weight. Expect roughly 16 to 18 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone.

We’ve utilized a flash retardant powder so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire should he need to “drop the hammer” in low light. Since nearly 95% of all civilian shootings in the US occur in low light, when the criminal element is active, low flash powders can give an enormous tactical advantage to the user.

As always, Buffalo Bore uses real, over-the-counter firearms to determine our published, real-world velocities. We prefer not to follow the industry wide, duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory test barrels to generate exaggerated velocities that the ammo user will seldom, if ever see. With Buffalo Bore you will know what velocity your ammunition is generating in the real world, where it matters.
