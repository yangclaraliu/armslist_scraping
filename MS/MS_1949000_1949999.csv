The stupidity is over and if you were dumb enough to pay 5k for a 650$ at that's your fuck up. Get real on your prices oh and adding a 30$ mag pull stock and other mag pull stuff doesn't increase the value of the rifle by hundreds. Get real on your prices.

Governments always, ALWAYS historically track & disarm their people before robbing, mass murdering and/or enslaving them. When U follow along with this criminality you are an ACCOMPLICE in their crimes. Read all our original States' Bills of Rights and you'll know absolutely you are on the wrong side and not with God, His Law or the Founders themselves. Law is this simple, summed up in one word ""Love"" in this statement ""You shall love your neighbor as yourself"". Many of us need to grow up tremendously!!! We are the problem ourselves due to our own ignorance & fear!!! You are not loving your neighbor when you're helping to accomplish a goal of total abject domination. Can anyone say NSA buckwheat?"

Up for sale is my RRA Varmint Build. The upper was originally an RRA A4 Varmint 18"" Stainless Bull Barrel with a 1/8 twist and comes with a chromed BCG. It is chambered in .223 Wylde, which is a hybrid chamber designed for accuracy between both the .223 and 5.56 cartridge.
I replaced the original handguard and gasblock with a YHM Free Float Rifle Length handguard and DPMS lo-pro gas block.
I was not gentle with installation of the new gas block and evidence of that is shown on the barrel [see the picture for reference]. Any blemishes could be buffed out if desired.

I painted the A2 stock because it was fading to a light grey color. The paint has not chipped and shows no signs of wear.

It started of as a traditional SKS and modified heavily. I First took the clip off of it and modified it to accept extended magazines, I put in a new recoil spring (the old one was fine but I wanted to make sure it had a new one) . I decided to replace the receiver cover with a Texas Dog rail system and lighten the trigger. I also put on a short pin muzzle brake to reduce recoil...and because it makes it look bad ass when it shoots flames out the end. I then proceeded to put it in an Ati tactical stock with collapsible butt and added Knight's Armament Company rails to the front of the stock to ""beefin"" up the area in which I held the stock. I really liked the way it felt, very smooth shooter but when I seen the Cbrps Bullpup Stock I fell in love. I ordered it, put it on and shot it. I liked it but wanted the shell deflector taken off so I could leave the dog rail system on as a cheek rest. I love the way it came out and it has always been a range favorite but its time to focus on getting my arsenal to just a few calibers and it is time to part with it. I have all of the original pieces as well just in case you feel like tweaking it in some way.   (The picture of the gun is the actual gun, the carry handle on top is detachable. the Ati stock pictured is exact one I have just a picture of the internet)      I will include with the Trade 2 30rd steel sks mags and 40rds of ammo to get you started.

HK made ONLY 500 of these in OD Green so they are near impossible to find. I have it priced at lower than the norm if you can find one (the last one to go on Gunbroker went for 1,300). I have carried it some so it does have a little holster wear but it is in good condition. Wonderful gun but like I said I need to fund another project. The box, gun and two mags with finger plate will be included. Mine is the V1 configuration (DA/SA with decocker & safety) In 40c. It has standard sights as well. In addition I will include a kydex OWB holster (Fobus). Buyer will need a CCH or permit.

I really need the cash on this one so I would prefer not to trade. However, I will consider partial trades plus cash or maybe multiple trades. Thanks for looking $1,100 cash or $1,150 trade.

This rifle also comes with an original bayonet and sling as seen in the picture of the rifle. It also has a custom welded turn down bolt handle which is similar to the original PU sniper bolts.

This rifle comes with 3 spam cans of ammo plus some loose rounds, two of the cans are the 440 rd silver tipped Bulgarian surplus ammo and the other spam can is Russian target ammo along with a couple loose boxes and rounds of the Russian target ammo. See attached pictures. I also have an original spam can opener which makes opening the spam cans easy.

This rifle is in excellent shape, with a very nice bore, I'm asking 600 dollars for this rifle which comes with the bayonet, sling and 1500rds of surplus ammo, most of which is still sealed in the spam cans and are in the original wooden crates. Call me at REDACTED if interested."

The gun has less than a 1000 rounds thru it, was well kept and has no nicks or damage of any kind.  I only shot it at the skeet/trap range, so no field damage.   The gun comes with stock full, improved cylinder, and modified chokes.  I also have upgraded with 2x Briley skeet chokes.  I had a weight added to the buttstock to help reduce recoil for skeet and to better balance the gun, but that could be easily removed if desired.  

The gun has performed flawlessly and has been an excellent value.  I am only selling to down-size for a move.

It started of as a traditional SKS and modified heavily. I First took the clip off of it and modified it to accept extended magazines, I put in a new recoil spring (the old one was fine but I wanted to make sure it had a new one) . I decided to replace the receiver cover with a Texas Dog rail system and lighten the trigger. I also put on a short pin muzzle brake to reduce recoil...and because it makes it look bad ass when it shoots flames out the end. I then proceeded to put it in an Ati tactical stock with collapsible butt and added Knight's Armament Company rails to the front of the stock to ""beefin"" up the area in which I held the stock. I really liked the way it felt, very smooth shooter but when I seen the Cbrps Bullpup Stock I fell in love. I ordered it, put it on and shot it. I liked it but wanted the shell deflector taken off so I could leave the dog rail system on as a cheek rest. I love the way it came out and it has always been a range favorite but its time to focus on getting my arsenal to just a few calibers and it is time to part with it. I have all of the original pieces as well just in case you feel like tweaking it in some way. (The picture of the gun is the actual gun, the carry handle on top is detachable. the Ati stock pictured is exact one I have just a picture of the internet) I will include with the Trade 2 30rd steel sks mags and 40rds of ammo to get you started.

From the combined effort of Legion Ltd, the custom shop of the legendary Izhmash Factory in Russia, and Arsenal, Inc. of Las Vegas, Nevada comes a new SGL21 (Saiga) rifle in 7.62x39 caliber. Initially manufactured by Legion Ltd in Russia and remanufactured by Arsenal, Inc. in the United States, the new SGL21 rifle has everything that collectors and shooter have been looking for. Hand-select premium components, custom-shop-like attention to details by Legion Ltd, and Arsenal, Inc.’s highest standards of workmanship, give this rifle its superior quality. Arsenal, Inc. remanufactures the SGL21 rifles in the United States with 922r compliant parts and fills them with features not seen on any other factory Saiga rifles. Performing the most difficult modifications to achieve, Arsenal, Inc. has done a substantial work for the customer. The end result is the highest quality SGL21 rifle with the most desired features which have not been available before.

 I'm not asking for what I paid, trying to make money, ect. I just would like a fair offer if you are interested. If I had a little less honesty I would just put the rifle back in the box and sell it as brand-new because that is exactly how it looks. You cannot find a single thing wrong with this rifle I promise. It looks like it just got pulled out of the box. 

I value the rifle, scope, caps, and rings at $450 obo and with the ammo I would let it all go for $650. I would prefer not to split it up but I value the ammo separately around $300 obo due to the match grade ammo and matching lot number. Tis is a very nice set-up and will make a hunter very happy. The Ruger American is a phenomenal base model rifle and if I weren't trying to consolidate and downsize I would keep it in its spot in the safe.  

This rifle has been fired 35 times all told and documented with a armorers gun book that I will transfer with it. It is a very nice rifle but I am looking to downsize my collection a little due to me getting out of the military and ammo is heavy.. 

I also have a Heritage Rough Rider .22 Single Action and 500 +/-rounds of  .22 shorts this revolver shoots short, long, and long rifle as well as .22 mag if you buy the cylinder with it. I do not have a box for this.

Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty.  The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached."

Company Info: Truglo, Inc

MSRP: $149.99 
This is what the unopened factory sealed TFO clam pack looks like. This is basically the same packaging that has been used since 2004. You cannot tell how old the sights are just by looking at the front of the packaging. You will notice in the full sized version of the picture that there are plastic weld marks on the side of the package. If these weld marks are broken the package has been opened.

Various views of the TFO rear sight, click on each for an up close view. The rear sight also has engraving. On one side you will see the same engraving that the front sight has “TG-H3”.  The TG stands for Truglo and the H3 is the symbol for the radioactive material Tritium. One the opposite side of the first engravings you will see the model number of what pistol the rear sight fits . In the examples above “XT” is engraved and denotes the sight will fit the Springfield Armory XD. 
 “TG-H3”. These engravings stand for Truglo and H3 is the symbol for the radioactive material Tritium.   If you look at the underside of the sights, you will see the engraved model number The TFO`s are only sold as a pair. 
Synopsis: Truglo TFO`s are night sights that incorporate fiber optic light pipes. When I describe these sights to my customers, I let them now they are the brightest sights available for use at night or during the day. These sights are truly a 24 hour lighting system. When there is any ambient light available, the fiber optic light pipes gather that light and channel it to the rear where your eyes pick it up. The sights also have built in vials of tritium like any other night sights.  These are always emitting a glow. What makes the TFO`s so special is that those tritium vials are buried in front of the fiber optics. When there is not enough outside light available for the fiber optics to pick up, the glow from the tritium is then channeled to the users eyes. These sights use multiple technologies to gather enough light, day or night to be one of the most useful sets of sights available on the market.

This first generation model used the AK-47 gas system and the recoil spring is located within the upper barrel gas system as compared to the AR-15/M-16, where the recoil spring is located within the butt stock. 

Originally marketed for police and the military, Bushmaster later changed its unique hybrid version AR-15/M-16 to the standard Colt/Armalite design. It was a rifle built by the early Bushmaster company using M16 parts which I hear is illegal to do now. It has a gas piston rotating bolt system, and utilizes an M16 bolt. It is chambered in 5.56mm and has a standard 20"" M16 barrel as well as lower parts kit. It accepts standard M16/AR-15 magazines and for the right deal, will include as many as you want. This was originally a full auto rifle designed for the military but was never picked up. 

It still has the 3-way switch, but of course does not engage full auto. These guys are extremely hard to find especially in the folding stock paratrooper lower. This would be a great personal defense/field weapon or a great addition to the discerning Bushmaster collector. In case you're wondering, I took this rifle to the range and shot it. It shoots great and can hold a pattern at 100 yards. $1,000 Firm."

Firstly, we would like to thank you all of you for the support we've gotten the last few months during the national gun scare. It’s thanks to all you that we've grown to almost 1000 gun store in just 3 short years. For this we would like to thank you by paying sales tax on all Pistol and Rifle purchases on Friday August 2nd and Saturday August 3rd. That’s right we will pay your sales tax on any gun in the store. Do to the little money we are going to making off each gun we will not be allowing trade ins on a tax free purchase. If you do decide to trade in a gun you have to pay tax on the difference. Tax free weekend will only be on gun purchases and not ammo or accessories. We will also not be taking special orders for tax free weekend. So it’s only tax free on the guns in the store. Once again I would like to thank you for your support, and I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and hope to see you tomorrow morning at 10am."
