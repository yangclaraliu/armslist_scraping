LaRue  machined billet upper & lower receiver with flared mag well, Walther Lothar stainless steel barrel 1/8 twist with black manganese phosphate finish, polished hard chrome bolt carrier group, two point selector gas block that optimizes either suppressed or unsuppressed fire, two stage Geissele SSA trigger, LaRue six position stock with  RISR cheek pad. The rifle is nasty accurate, capable of firing groups that far exceed my aging hands and eyes. The fit & finish are the standard that most other manufacturers aspire to. I was on the wait list at the factory for 14 months to get this rifle and I understand the current wait list is even longer and there’s not a lot of 556/223 used OBR’s for sale, mainly because it’s a LaRue, pretty much the “gold standard” of AR15’s….. I’ll ship to any verifiable FFL in the lower 48 states via UPS surface for $45. It’s the buyers responsibility to follow firearms laws and to ascertain if this rifle is legal in your state, county and city."

It's about a year old, it might have a few hundred rounds though it.  I bought it to shoot indoor bullseye with my 1911, I just don't have the time to mess with it.  The slide is excellent; it functions flawlessly and is extremely accurate.  Nelson's customer service is second to none.  Every time I've emailed them, including to inquire about purchasing the unit initially, Larry Nelson has personally called me back.  A real class act.

This model has the Weaver style scope rail, but it can be changed out to standard or adjustable iron sights, available from Nelson Custom Guns.  It is a Bob Marvel design, as credited on the side of the slide, but it lacks the Marvel price tag.  It can be dry-fired, and unlike the Kimber units (last I'd seen, anyway) the slide locks open after the last round is ejected and the unit can cycle fine with standard velocity ammunition.

The advertised price is only for the slide kit, three magazines, extra springs, case and accessories.  If you are interested in the Bushnell TR25 optic shown in the pics, the price out the door is $400, will ship anywhere in the CONUS at no extra charge."

This is similar to the Pistol Roni Kit and The Kpos Kit   
It accepts any full sized railed pistols giving you full rail on the top and basically a quad rail around the front end for lights ,lasers , etc.   it has a hand stop that detached from the front and qd sling mount in the back.  It has a non reciprocating charging handle on the side some what like a Mac 10-11. And can be put together within a minute or so.  I have all of the extra parts for different sized back straps.  The original instructional sig dvd and everything it came with. It is stored in a hard briefcase style case. If going for a SBR there is a folding Stock that hooks into the back with qd mounts so SBR friendly platform !  I've used it successfully so far on glocks and sig pistols and have some friends who have run it on full size railed 1911.  The front opening is large enough to accommodate a suppressor or compensator    If you have any questions feel free to send them my way thanks for looking.    NOTE!!! Smoke grenades do not come with SIG Kit lol"

I purchased this to modify with Wilson combat parts. When I received it I found that it was the SB variant, which is rare. Also it was a very nice looking gun, with an excellent finish. An overall classic looking Beretta pistol. A little research shows that this was produced between 1981 and 1991. ISBN: REDACTED if you're interested This is not really the pistol I want to be replacing parts on and modifying. 

That said, I do want a carry pistol. Under ideal circumstances this would be an S&W 4513 or an LDA Para Carry or Companion. I am open to handgun offers though, just know that I am primarily looking for a thin, metal frame pistol that is as light as possible, double action trigger, preferably in .45 ACP.

I have looked at comparable models online and can say that this pistol is at least as good as any other I have seen for sale. I have one 13 round and two fifteen round magazines to go with it. No box or manual.

Make an offer, the worst that can happen is we won't be able to meet on a trade or price. REDACTED"
