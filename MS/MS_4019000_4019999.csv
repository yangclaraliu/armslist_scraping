There are no Mauser markings on this one nor any Chinese markings but the pistol was brought into the USA from China (no import marks). Fully functional and all matching serial numbers.

Competition pistol built by Glock, same basic size as a 1911.  Basically a Glock 17 with a 5 inch barrel.  There are factory lightening cuts in the slide so it will take a compensated barrel.  Includes 5 mags, box and docs, blackhawk serpa holster, 1000 rnds of range ammo and some assorted defense ammo in the mags.

Trade Value 1000+

Also have an ATI Omni lower NIB with lifetime warranty paperwork.  Trade Value 175.

This is a great deal for someone who wants to start competition shooting or just wants a serious pistol and the ammo to get real good with it!

Looking for a high end handgun, a 1911 in 45ACP, or a nice 357 revolver, maybe a 44.  I'm real fond of tactical 12 gauges.  Will take combo trades and consider any reasonable offer, worst I can say is no.

Great CHL complete set up!!!

 Have a very nice shape 45c XDM for sale/possible trade. I am the original owner and the gun has seen round 400/500 rounds fired. Clean and well kept, only signs of use are a couple paper thin wear marks around some of the front slide serrations. With purchase or trade, your getting all the original Xd equipment and case. Also an extra compact 9 round mag( total of three mags. two 9rd and one 13 rd with extension). Crimson trace lg448 laser and even have an extra set of batteries. Alien Gear IWB holster designed to fit with installed laser, And have a 20 count box of short barrel gold dots I'm throwing in as well.

 Value round $725 to $750. Believe I also have an extra set of the grey rubber PRP grips around I can throw in.

 Mostly looking to sell, if I trade it would be down with cash on your end. Only trades id probably be looking for would be DA/SA 9mm.

This pack is the latest issue by the USMC, replacing the ILBE Gen II pack in 2012. They are used in good serviceable condition but may have minor flaws or stains due to use. All zippers and latches are working. 

Includes: Main Pack, 1606AC Airborne Assault frame, Shoulder Harness Assembly and Hip Belt

The FILBE (Family of Individual Load Bearing Equipment) is the latest generation of improved load bearing pack design.  It offers major advances from the USMC ILBE Gen II in terms of load carrying capabilities (120 lbs), modularity and comfort.  The optimization of the external frame, hip belt and shoulder harness system maximizes the ability to carry heavy loads efficiently, while minimizing the burden of weight.  The end result is improved overall system compatibility and increased comfort for the user.  This new pack design offers greater carrying capacity than the Gen Ilbe II with the main pack accommodating 5000 Cubic inches of gear.  
Main Bag 5000 cu in / 81L
-Top lid incorporated into the main pack
- Main pack is separated by a shelf into: 
- 3400 cu in / 55L main compartment
- 1600 cu in / 26L. lower compartment
- 120lb load capacity
- External zipper for easy access to lower compartment

There’s a standard radio harness on the rear of the interior with a cleverly placed zipper that allows the operator to access the interior of the pack without having to undo the lid. The pack can be separated into two compartments, the lower for a sleeping system with its own external access zipper. There is enough room for additional kit to be placed in the lower compartment due to its large size. The attached lid has a single mesh pouch that is accessible from the exterior or interior."

Like new Remington Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical, literally just took it out of the box and ran 16 rounds through it (have owned it for 3-4 months, just didn't have time to take it to the range).

Took it out for the first time last week - It runs flawlessly and handles incredibly well. I flat out love it. So, why am I wanting to sell/trade it? Great question; the wife and I are spending more time at the range, and even though I love this thing.. she does not. She's small framed and it's just too long/heavy for her to manage. So, I plan on sorting out a sale/trade for the firearm she doesn't prefer, for ones that she does.

This weapon is by far the most amazing beretta I've owned, and a great piece to carry. If you enjoy the full-size Beretta, you should definitely take a look at this compact. The weapon includes two magazines with aluminum pinky shelf extensions, as well as brand-new houge G 10 Extreme series grips. The weapon is brand-new in box, and has never been fired. I have had the trigger tuned, a brand-new steel guide rod installed, as well as the improved spring package from Wilson combat installed. There is over $150 of work in parts alone. This is the Beretta model M9A1 compact, and because of that it features the integrated accessory rail.

I am in no hurry to move this weapon, and will disregard any lowball offers. I have a few things in mind that I am looking for, and will not respond to offers that are not fair and even. I have ran into some very rude people on arms list lately, so if you feel as though you're going to be rude please do not respond to this thread.

The weapon is new in box and is unfired, in factory new condition. These weapons are not as easy to find as the 92 FS, and I paid $650 for the pistol before I did any modifications. All modifications were done by a local gunsmith who is trusted in his craft.

All factory components, original grips, as well as a holster and perhaps some ammunition will be included in the trade. I may be able to add extras if balance is needed."

Selling this semi-auto tack driver. Reason for selling is that it's one of the nicest guns in my collection, but I rarely do much long range shooting - so it's mainly a safe queen. Wanting to find a good new home for it, where it'll be able to stretch its wings more often. It shoots sub MOA with match ammo, and only has about 150-200 rounds through it. It's in like new condition, but has a custom beautiful tungsten/black cerakote 'battleworn' paint job on the entire rifle, 2 mags, scope, and scope mount. This rifle shoots as good as it looks, and it looks really, really good.

Recoil is minimal on this beast, thanks much to the large 3 port Rainier RAC brake. I upgraded/swapped a few parts from the stock configuration - namely it currently has a Geissele single stage trigger, Ergo F93 stock, and Magpul MIAD grip. Added to the rifle is a Vortex Viper PST 4-16x MRAD scope, mounted with a Nightforce Ultralight Unimount. This rifle is the envy of everyone at the range, whenever I take it out.

Selling it with literally everything you'll need to get going (Atlas bipod NOT included), already zero'd and it even includes a Rainier Arms hardshell case. (The barrel is currently black, it was silver in the older photos) Note this is not a 5.56/.223 AR-15, this is a .308 (7.62x51 NATO).

ABOUT THE RIFLE:
Description:
Introducing Rainier Arms RA308 Rifle

Our focus was to develop a .308 platform that integrated a lightweight design while using the highest quality components.

The RA308 weighs in at 8 lbs and 0.6 oz. It features our new Rainier Arms Switch Rail 14"". The Switch Rail has a brand new mechanism that allows a tool-less removal of the rail for easy access to the barrel nut and gas block. We also redesigned our new Rainier Arms Compensator 308(RAC) which offers enhanced recoil management and almost fully eliminates muzzle rise. We wanted to build our rifle by using Rainier Arms Ultramatch 16"" Stainless Steel Barrel. These barrels are the finest blank (Shilen Blank) contoured to our specifications for reliability and accuracy shooting.

As always, we designed the rifle to be ambidextrous to accommodate our shooters. Every rifle comes with our ambidextrous charging handle, the Raptor, the built in ambidextrous bolt release, and ambidextrous 45 degrees safety selector.

All materials used are of industry-leading standards, each weapon carefully and meticulously assembled with a limited lifetime warranty.

I just purchased a new upper with a keymod handguard so I no longer have any need for some of these accessories, and have replaced others over time.

#1 ($15)  M4 Mil-Spec 6 position collapsible stock. Has a small Smith & Wesson logo because it came on my M&P 15.    

#2 ($10) M4 carbine length handguard, direct drop in for any M4 carbine rifle.

#3 (SOLD!) UTG PRO carbine length drop in quad rail. Made in the US. Four-sided, mil-spec picatinny railed handguard. Hard anodized aluminum construction for superior wear resistance. Four rails with 14 slots per rail. 

#4 (SOLD!) Leapers UTG PRO AR-15 4/15 Superslim Drop In 15"" Handguard for M4 Carbine rifles. Single Rail Two Piece Drop-in Handguard with Cut Out for Easy Installation without Removing A2 Front Sight Post. Top Rail Extends to Upper Receiver for Continuous Mounting Platform, and Includes removable two 2-Slot and two 4-Slot rail sections for 3, 6 and 9 O'clock positions. I've only had this for 2 months, so it is in perfect condition. Paid $120 on Amazon and it works perfectly and looks awesome. Great for those of you who can't or don't want to remove the A2 fixed front sight, but want the ability to grip your firearm farther down the barrel, or just to protect you and your surroundings from barrel heat.

#5 ($20) Mission First Tactical REACT Vertical Grip. Compact textured vertical grip designed to minimize material and dimension while maximizing functionality, designed to provide a positive grip surface with wet or gloved hands. Also has a water tight battery/part storage compartment with a battery sled to reduce rattle when in use.

#6 (SOLD!) Magpul Angled Foregrip (AFG2) with removable middle finger separator. I love the feel of this grip for fast offhand shooting, and I think they look mean too. Only reason I'm selling is because I'm moving to a keymod angled grip.

For the lower: It has KNS precision anti rotation pins, a Geissele SD-3G trigger, an exile machine hammerhead grip and a magpul moe rifle stock. If you were to buy this rifle, all you would need to do is install a non-flash suppressing muzzle device to be considered featureless and not have that annoying bullet button anymore. Also, use a magazine of any capacity if you happen to legally own some. 
I can throw on a regular pistol grip per your request.
Id prefer to do the transfer at Four Seasons outfitters, as it is very close to me and I am not currently mobile. If your just interested in the upper, we can arrange a pickup. 

Also, I can take more pictures, please feel free to contact me for more.
If you plan to purchase the entire rifle, can pick me up and take us to four seasons and pay the transfer fees(35$ for PPT) I will knock the price down a bit to compensate. Let's discuss it."

But many SIG shooters have asked for a P220 with a longer slide, one that would compete head-to-head with other five inch barreled 45's. The result? The first P220 Match prototype went to our testing range where it shot an eight-round group measuring 0.64” at 20 yards. Our engineers after extensive review concluded that this was a good starting point.

The P220 Match Elite adds the most sought after features to the P220 Match - beavertail stainless frame, front strap checkering, adjustable target sights, SIG's innovative Short Reset Trigger (a DA/SA trigger system with a 60% reduction in trigger reset).
The P220 Match Elite defines the new standard in .45ACP performance.

I have a S&W 3914 in very good condition. Works perfectly and might be the most reliable compact carry pistol I've ever owned. It's a great gun, but I am looking to trade it for something larger.

I'd like something else in 9mm, but with a longer barrel. I'd really like something not so compact. I'd also be willing to think about a .357 magnum or possibly .45 acp.

No reasonable offer refused. Pistol comes with two magazines as pictured.

The trigger also received attention and was smoothed up quite substantially from its original condition. The bolt was hand fitted, trued, and stone lapped to insure the smoothest operation,The SKB rifle case pictured below is included with the auction and is what the rifle will come packed in, In the right hands this rifle is capable of less than 1 m.o.a. accuracy at 100 yards with match grade ammo. It is a phenomenally gorgeous rifle and a blast to shoot and I regret needing to sell it. I will be the first to say that this rifle is not for everyone, though! It is obviously not a genuine 1903A4 and that is precisely why I started with a 1903A3 so as to not ruin a rare piece of history that is every genuine 1903A4. You might be wondering why this rifle is priced as much/or more than an original then. The answer is simple: you get what you pay for. If you love the original look of the historic 1903A4 but also want a tack driver, then this is the rifle for you."

        Apologies on the different sets of specs, I pulled them from different sources of data. All bullets are new, never been opened. Sold in 'bricks' of 100; email me anytime for details, questions, or to schedule a time to meet. I opted for the highest quality rounds at the best reasonable price, so all these rounds are a nice balance between 'a bullet costs HOW much?!' and 'half my poor-quality rounds jam!' pricing. I will consider trades and bulk deals, but the prices are largely firm.

So here goes:

Up for sale is my custom built matching set of AR's in 300 AAC Blackout. These are brand new and never fired and are completely set up and ready to go. These are not your typical basic AR's or anything that any of your buddies will have when you pull them out at the range and I'd be willing to bet that you won't see another custom pair like this again either! These are also sequentially numbered serial numbers on the lowers.

To start off, both of these are sitting on customized Daytona Defense and Tactical skeletonized ""Reaper"" lowers with matching DDT trigger guards. They're 7075 T-6 aluminum with Mil-spec Type III hard coat and anodized black. For customization, these lowers have no roll pins in them at all. The Bolt Catch pins have been drilled and tapped and fitted with screw-in type pins from Windham Weaponry like most AR10's. The trigger guards have been set screwed. There is a set screw under each trigger to adjust the up take or ""creep"" of them. The spring and detent for the rear take-down pins have been set screwed and are now captive. Both lowers are sporting Rock River Arms 2 stage National Match trigger groups, they're both very smooth triggers with crisp, clean sharp breaks. 

The uppers are both FN's produced for them under contract by the Brass Aluminum Forging Enterprises foundry. They're also 7075 T-6 aluminum with Type III hard coat anodize. The uppers have been shimmed and Accu-wedged and sit nice and tight to the lowers like they were machined and matched together. They are both M4 flat top uppers with the M4 feed ramps and T marks and forward assists. They're both running MPI and HP tested AR15 semi-auto bolt carrier groups.

Both of these have matching flip-up poly sights, ambi sling loop receiver end plates and single point adjustable bungie type slings.

The carbine is a 16"" heavy barrel in Phosphate with a 1/8 twist. It has a micro gas block and a Melonited gas tube under its 10"" free float quad rail with end cap. It has a Mil-spec 6 position adjustable stock with a USGI rubber butt pad. It also comes with a 30 round Lancer smoked translucent L5-AWM hybrid battle mag.

The matching pistol is a 7.5"" heavy barrel also in Phosphate with a 1/8 twist. It also has a micro gas block with a stainless steel gas tube sitting under its matching 7"" free floating quad rail with end cap. The pistol however does come with a brand new but oh-so controversial new style Sig Sauer SBX arm brace. This pistol also includes a 20 round Lancer smoked translucent L5-AWM hybrid battle mag.

These custom builds feature ALL American, USA made quality parts! No crappy, inferior Chinese parts here! These are some of the coolest custom builds that you'll find out there and I guarantee that none of your buddies will have these and they will be drooling over them too when they see them!!

For this matched set of sequentially serial numbered AR's, carbine and pistol together with all the customization and accessories I am asking $3400.00 or best reasonable offer.  I do not want to split up this set. I do not want trades, trades won't help me get the wife a house!

I would prefer to sell these as transferred through an FFL with the buyer to pick up the transfer fees, but if the buyer is a NH resident, these can be sold face to face with a bill of sale and your valid NH driver's license. Any out of state buyer, please be prepared to cover the shipping and FFL transfer fees to your local dealer.

Thank you for viewing my listing and for any questions, please feel free to ask away.

Oh and by the way, if you're looking for something a little more traditional in the AR platform, and for a little bit less money, I also have a matching sequentially numbered set of these in .223 Wylde. As some may not know, the Wylde set ups will fire both 5.56 NATO and .223 Remington and are actually more accurate with both rounds than the standard 5.56 or .223 barrels. If interested, please feel free to ask me about them."
