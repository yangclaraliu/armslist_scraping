Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5″ long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.

When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that’s coated with Teflon™ for complete protection against corrosion. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

The receiver is also coated with Teflon™ for superior weatherproofing and waterproof protection, even in harsh saltwater environments. The updated receiver is grooved, making it easy to top off with your favorite optics.
This Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in Black and is equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight.

I've been asked by the family of a deceased gun store owner to sell off all of the ammunition he had laying around. I'll have a table at this weekend's West Bend Gun Show (Fri-Sun 10/30-11/01) to dump all of this stuff. Pricing will be 20% off of the cheapest *comparable* Ammo Seek prices BEFORE shipping.  (I'm not pricing Norma like Wolf, but I won't price Wolf like Norma either.)

Most of this is hunting stuff.  The .308 is probably the most popular, and it's all lead-tip hunting ammo-- not Wolf or blaster stuff.

The show is at the West Bend Fairgrounds at 3000 Hwy PV, West Bend, WI.

I AM NOT AN AMMO DEALER. I'm just helping to close out an estate. While I shoot, you're going to know more about this stuff than I will.

Trades considered:

About the only wants I can think of right now is a Sig P938.  I've seen a couple models that sell new in the low $500's, so one of those would be perfect with some cash.  Also, could use a nice AR-10, something like the DPMS Recon G2 would work, I see them new for around $1,200, so I can add cash or something else.  May even trade for the base $700 DPMS .308 model AR-10.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice trigger groups etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

Trades considered:

About the only wants I can think of right now is a Sig P938.  I've seen a couple models that sell new in the low $500's, so one of those would be perfect.  A Ruger GP100 6"" .357 mag., mabye a 4"" or the SP101 4"" model.  Also, could use a nice AR-10, something like the DPMS Recon G2 would work, I see them new for around $1,200, so I can add cash or something else.  May even trade for the base $700 DPMS .308 model AR-10.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice trigger groups etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

Weight was always a consideration, as carrying a pistol 10 hours a day changes your perspective. Reliability was solid, maintenance minimal and operation simple. We parted company when it came to fit, trigger feel and accuracy. Early triggers were gritty, with significant stacking, and there was that annoying trigger safety. My large hands just did not like the square fit.Sig Sauer P320C Review. Once a personal gun could be carried, a 1911 was in my holster most of the time. Another choice was a P220 or P226, but de-cockers have always been a no-go for me. What I needed was a solid striker-fired pistol with a normal grip, standard grip angle and a metal trigger with nothing attached to it. That finally came to be with the introduction of the Sig Sauer P320 pistol.While a few polymer striker-fired pistols addressed most of my issues, the P320 was the first to address them all. The metal trigger has no safety on it unless you want it. Take-up is minimal with a feel closer to a single-action pistol.Accuracy is astounding given the price, and it is boringly reliable. Using a grip angle comparable to a 1911 in a contoured grip and steel dovetailed sights, it was about perfect for me. Testing the full-sized P320, it was flawless over thousands of rounds. Its only downside was size. The design allows you to switch lowers and slides, but I wanted a dedicated carry version, and Sig Sauer came through with the P320C."

	Hey Everyone, 
I have available for trade/sale a great little AR pistol chambered in 223 wylde. This is based on an Anderson Lower and Anderson Kit with stainless trigger assembly/hammer. This has the standard pistol buffer kit. This model has no Forward asset or Dust Cover, so it is a bit more sleek and lighter. This has a 7.5 inch barrel and a free float quad rail on it. This also comes with a Magpul 30rd Windowed Pmag, single point sling ambi-mount, single point sling, Rail covers as pictured, a little laser, and the polymer flip up sights. This is new/unfired. This would be a sweet little entry level AR for someone needing a good starter gun that will perform great for them and would serve as a great starting point for many upgrades!
	I would also consider trades for various items. Possibly Marlin Lever guns in 44, 357, etc. PLR-16, CMR30, XDM with threaded barrel, AK47 folder, 30 carbines, etc. Some trades will need boot on your end, some on mine. No 40s, Blackpowder, or 22s unless if is heavily in my favor. Honestly, just shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on this one. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting,

SUPER SEMI-AUTOMATIC ENHANCED (SSA-E) TRIGGER
Built on the chassis of the Geissele SSA, the Super Semi-Automatic Enhanced (SSA-E) provides enhanced trigger control and weapon accuracy while maintaining the robustness and reliability of our combat-proven two-stage trigger. The SSA-E’s reduced first and second stage pull weights result in a trigger with a smooth, light first stage take-up and a crisp, candy cane-like second stage break. The SSA-E is ideal for use in precision Squad Designated Marksman type rifles where weapon accuracy and reliability are critical and a non-adjustable drop in trigger is desired.

I've personally put around 200rds thru it over the years & it has less than 500rds thru it total, best of my knowledge. has a lot of life left in it. I'm considering replacing this with a .338LM & that is the only reason it is up for sale.
I would take this gun over many custom rifles I've handled & am rather reluctant to let it go but I'm putting it out there to see what happens.
Asking $1,200obo Sling & Bipod are NOT included, just didn't want to take them off for the pics.
Will sell just the rifle with weaver bases & ammo for $650. This is not your run of the mill Model 70."

This gun has ran approx. 2000 rounds in its lifetime and has been cleaned after each use and stored in a humidity controlled safe. This is a VERY solid gun and ive never had any malfunctions or issues with it, also oly arms had military contracts during the time I bought this so it is built like a tank and performs like one too. The barrel is Freefloat with full quad rails and  also stainless that was blued at the factory to match the rest of the gun, also is NON-chrome lined so you can put tons of ammo through it without any worries of replacing the barrel. Twist rate is 1/9. Gun has been maintained with slip 2000 cleaner and oil that is also top of the line product. I absolutely love this rifle but need to make some room in my gunsafe for future toys. There is one small scratch on the tip of the barrel from clamping on tight to remove and install the breacher/flash hider. This gun sells new from Olympic arms for $1250 and from the list of mods you can see I have WAYYY more invested. I am looking to sell for cash locally and do not need any trades. Please email me with any questions. I have done the math and this is $2400 not including tax and install time. If you want a great deal on a solid rifle this is your chance

So ensuring the magazine is out and chamber cleared is your safety.  When I bought the gun that was not explained to me.  That's one reason I'm selling.  There is a long trigger pull, but that's all personal preference.  It's an awesome gun and I love the constant feature but it's not for me.

Hand guard Type: PSA SQR 9"" (slim quad rail) free float    Bolt Carrier Profile: Full auto  Lower receiver: Tennessee Arm polymer. 
Only reason I'm selling it cheap is because the threads length on the buffer tube I got from PSA is shorter then the threads on a standard buffer tube and since the lower is polymer the ear peace the tube screws into is a little thicker then a metal lower. So the tube doesn't engage the plunger.  The only thing the plunger does is keep the buffer and spring from popping out when you break down the pistol.  So you can shoot it without the plunger and not hurt anything.  You can buy a new pistol tube with standard tube lenght if you like. Seen them for 30.00
I'll post a pic later tonight.

This thing was brand new up until last month when I took it out on a range day and put 90 rounds through it.  Cleaned and oiled it up and put it away.  Sights are right on the mark.  This is one solidly built, heavy duty AK.
I replaced the huge ugly stock with a brand new Ace stock and folding mechanism. I got the middle length 8.5"" stock.  
The rear block, stock and folding mechanism all together shipped to me was $252+shipping. This is the real deal folder made from Billet Aluminum and the receiver block and folding mechanism are made from steel. Not Tapco garbage. The mounting hardware was loctited so the mount is very solid.
