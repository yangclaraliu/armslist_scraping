In response to a few emails:
Yes you can look up guns on lots of auction sites and see redhawks ( not often Beasley's) for around $700.   Then you WILL pay to have the gun overnighted ($70) and you WILL pay to have an ffl receive your gun ($25-$35) and you WILL pay to have a background check done($10).  So by the time you get the gun in your hand you will be $100 over the original price.   Here is my math on my  gun:
$700 because its a Beasley and has had less than 100 rounds through it.
$70 holster
$20 speedloader
$25 boyt bag
$200 in 44mag ammo

So I am starting out asking $800

This pistol also comes with a sealed brick of 600 rounds of Prvi Partizan Ammunition 32 ACP 71 Grain FMJ brass cased, Non Corrosive, boxer primed re-loadable ammo and a full box of Speer Gold Dot defensive ammo.  Also included is a right handed holster with a built in spare magazine holder.  I'm looking for $675 cash or $42 in pre 65 US silver coins or 34 oz of Sliver bars & rounds. I'd also be interested in 308 & 5.56 (brass, boxer primed, non-corrosive) ammo as well as BX-25 mags, Eotech's, Acog's, reloading components (primers (SP, LP, SR, LR and Shotgun, no magnum)) powder and bullets in 308, 5.56, 45 ACP & 9mm).  Oh and a Slidefire.  That's about all I'm looking for at this time, but feel free to ask, the worst I can say is no. :)  If you have something worth more then my trade then I can add in additional items and or cash.  Available for face to face transfer to NH residences with a NH DL and CCW or LEO.  Please call REDACTED (yes I know it's a MA #, but I'm a NH residence with a NH DL & CCW)."

The reason for its popularity is because it shoots great, looks great and is remarkably affordable - about half the price of the competition's rifles.

The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself.
The Henry Lever Action also features side ejection, an adjustable rear sight, a hooded front sight and a grooved receiver for mounting a scope. The blued steel barrel is machined with state of the art multiple groove rifling. The result is a highly accurate shooter.

ATX-Juggernaut 1LB Advanced Exploding Target
 CODE: ATX-JUG 

ATX-Juggernaut targets are 1 pound ground shakers. 

They are louder and more powerful than a 4lb high velocity style target.

Advanced Targets 
The Advanced Formula Kick-Ass Exploding Targets ™ are the best on the market today!

Our advanced exploding target kits are smaller, lighter and FOUR TIMES more powerful by weight than the older generation targets. While the old-style targets need a high velocity rifle round to detonate them, our advanced targets can be detonated with a .22 or larger round.

Kick Ass Exploding Targets™ products are made in the USA with only high quality, pyrotechnic grade materials. You won’t find dangerous substandard, surplus chemicals or fertilizers here! Quality materials are essential to ensuring that the targets work consistently and safely.

About the rifle, it's bushmaster xm-15e2s with a 16"" HBAR (heavy barrel) and 1/9 twist rate. It features a flash hider, bayonet lug and flat top receiver for mounting a scope or holographic target sight. There's a back up iron sight attached to the top rail instead of a carry handle. Since bushmaster doesn't make a mil-spec collapsible stock its got an A2 type fixed stock which can easily be swapped for a collapsible from Colt, LMT, BCM, or any other manufacturer you'd prefer. The rifle is in really nice shape with relatively little use, maybe 600 rounds total. Included in the sale will be a cardboard box and a 20 round magazine.

Im sure you've heard that on October 1st these will be unable to be transferred in Maryland but still legal to possess for those who bought them prior to the law going into effect. I've come to realize that now is the time to sell before it's too late to buy a few other guns I want more. I've had the bushmaster for quite some time but never got around to shooting much myself so hopefully you will enjoy it more than I. Since this is an HBAR rifle, it's able to be transferred person to person without using a dealer. All I'd ask from you is a copy of your ID and to sign a bill of sale.

Let me know if you'd like to one. Asking $1,200, Interesting gun related trades considered..."

During the Russian Revolution and subsequent civil war, revolutionaries, various irregular forces and common criminals cut down the Mosin Nagant rifles to pistol size for easy concealment. Most of these rifle-cailber pistols did not have sights, being crudely made. After the Revolution, the numbers of Obrez bolt action pistols decreased as the Bolsheviks took over the imperial arsenals and gained access to stocks of Model 1895 Nagant revolvers. This unofficial Mosin variant is perhaps the rarest Mosin of them all. Obrez pistols are highly prized by collectors."" Wikipedia. This weapon is a class III SBR and is on a F3 in VA.

The styling is elegant and trim. What’s more, PPQ M2 has been updated for 2013 with a new traditional reversible mag release button. The leading edge just took another step forward.

I bought this more as a curiosity, but now it's time to put the money towards something more practical. The Lightweight differs from the standard Baby with an aluminum frame, gold-plated trigger, and Pearl-look grips. This gun is roughly 80% with some finish wear on the frame and trigger as seen in the pics. This gives you a chance to get one that you're not afraid of messing up for about the price of a steel-framed Baby, or you can send it off to PSA and take advantage of their refinishing service.

Perfect combination of a close quarters dot sight and magnification for those longer range engagements.  Both the scope and the mount are as new with boxes. The combo has only been mounted to my AR for about 5 minutes and has definitely never seen live fire. I really like and appreciate this set up, but I'm just more of an Aimpoint kind of fella. The combo retails for a little over $600.00 ($400.00 for the Leupold and $210.00 for the Larue) taxes and shipping not included. 

Larue mount will come with the designated Larue wrench and the scope will come with a new set of Butler Creek caps. Gotta protect the investment! LOL! 

I would like to trade this setup for a like new Aimpoint T1 or H1.  Sorry but I have no interest in Pros. If I can't find a nice trade; I'd like to get $550.00 for the combo. I would be willing to split these up. $375.00 for the scope and $180.00 for the Larue mount. This is a hell of a deal.

Everyone always recognizes the infamous Desert Eagle. The big, beautiful hand-canon that it is. This is the newest model on the Desert Eagle line in brushed chrome. It has the continuous 1913 top rail to allow a variety of optics. I bought the 44 mag over the 50AE due to the high price and lack of distributors of the 50AE. I have had this gun for almost a year and have only been able to take it out to shoot once. I put 2 mags through it and it did not have any problems. You definitely have to be ready for it though. It has a lot of power. It comes in its factory case with papers, first spent brass casing, lock, 2 factory 8 round mags, and 120 rounds of ammo.

The Nyclad bullet has a story all its own, google it and see for yourself, herters is attempting to load something similar in an aluminum non reloadable case.  
these are reloads with cci and Winchester primers, and 1x fired brass.  the nyclad do not foul the barrel, nor does it wear off in the barrel.  I have shot hundreds of them out of my xdm, xd, Taurus 92 and beretta 92. 
The frangible rounds are an excellent home defense/limited penetration round made of compressed copper material.  it does not just go ""poof"" when it hits, it will penetrate 1x4 and 2x4 without fragmentating.  Quality home defense with the fmj feeding reliability.

The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots."
