 BT-99. The ideal competition shotgun for trapshooters of all ages. When your chosen sport is American singles and trap, the revered Browning BT-99 wins the hearts and minds of many. There is not a finer example of simplicity, quality and clay-busting performance than the classic BT-99. When it was introduced in 1969, it immediately gained a loyal following among both beginner and veteran shooters alike. They appreciated the consistent, reliable performance and great value the BT-99 offered.

242,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4436242,"For Sale:  LIBERTY MYSTIC X SUPPRESSOR ""SWISS ARMY KNIFE OF SILENCERS""","Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 699,"Listed On: Saturday, August 8, 2015",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"DETAILSThe Mystic X was born from a need: the need for a “Swiss army knife” of silencers, so to speak, for first time suppressor buyers. The first time buyer is literally overwhelmed with the amount of intel that is currently available. Due to this problem, we feel that the first time buyer needs a choice that will allow them to “dip” their toe into NFA and be able to have the most versatile suppressor available at the same time. Armed with this idea, we took one of our most popular suppressors, one that has already been adopted by many first time buyers, and improved on it. The Mystic X is the ultimate first time owner’s silencer!Made entirely from Titanium and Stainless Steel and coated with type “C” high temp Cerakote™ this suppressor weighs in at a paltry 10.5 ounces and only 13.9 ounces with a recoil booster installed in it. This suppressor can be “dipped”, ultrasonically cleaned, sand blasted, or soaked in harsh solvents without fear of damage to the unit.Did I mention that it is also full auto rated? Well it is!!! It is rated for seven different calibers in full auto and 53 calibers in semi auto giving the T/C guys as well as hunters and target shooters a large host of options.We have developed a series of mounting solutions for the Mystic X to include several booster options as well as many variations in fixed barrel mounting solutions as well. All of the mounts are available in black now as well.Designed with Dual Arc Baffle technology, the Mystic X is incredibly quiet for a centerfire monolithic core suppressor. Although the real treat is the Mystic X performs really well on so many centerfire rifle and handgun calibers. The 7.62 x 39 and the 300 BLK are prime examples of this. Not only in subsonic, but many rifle calibers are also rated for supersonic speeds as well. 38 Special, 357 Magnum, 357 Maximum or 9×25 Dillon? No problem! The Mystic X loves all these rounds and many more! Being takedown in design, this suppressor is a favorite of people using cast lead bullets. It is well known that lead buildup in the 9mm and 22LR suppressors is a reality and the Mystic X is perfectly suited for this application.Tube Retaining Ring – Alloy steelFinish: Type C High Temp Cerakote™ In Graphite BlackMounting via: Thread mount specific to each platform.Aprox. Sound Reduction: 33 to 38dB across several platforms.Provided with a Battlecloth pouch and a core removal toolAdaptable to a large variety of firearms with our mounting solutions. Please call with special applications and we can discuss a solution that would work for you."

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:  ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****  Please note: This is the VP9 LE model, and comes with THREE 15-round mags and Tritium 3-dot night sights.In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitor’s. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.VP9 pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.   We have 2 in stock, and have them priced to sell quickly for just $669 each.

Chambered for the 7.65mm Longue cartridge, the 1935A was used by the French military and police. Initial production began in 1937, and the pistol began delivery to the French Army in late 1939, with a total of about 10,700 pistols built before German forces occupied the SACM factory in the summer of 1940.  The French again produced it after the war.
The 7.65 x 20mm (or French long) cartridge is out of production and hard to find.  My research suggested that old ammo from WWII, if it even works, might be dangerous as some loads were sabotaged."

364,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4436364,For Sale:  THUNDERBEAST ARMS 30CB9 SUPPRESSOR,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma","$ 1,029","Listed On: Saturday, August 8, 2015",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"DescriptionCompact Brake-attach .30 caliber suppressorThe model 30CB9 is the new ""Compact Brake""-attach version of our flagship long-range precision rifle suppressor. This model replaces the 30BA. It shares the same competition-proven baffle stack as the 30BA and 30P-1 (with a few new optimizations), but we've designed a new brake that is smaller and more efficient than the old one.When used alone, the new ""CB"" brake is approx 30-40% more effective at recoil reduction than the old 30BA brake. The new brake is proportioned correctly for .223 and .30 caliber rifles, but it provides a suppressor mounting surface just as solid as the old 30BA series.The way to interpret the model number for the 30CB9 is: .30caliber, COMPACT BRAKE, 9-inch long (full size)The 30CBx series replaces the 30BA/BAS series as of May 2014. We will continue to sell 30BA series brakes and suppressors to existing ""BA""-series customers if requested.The 30CB9 offers best-in-class sound suppression levels in a very light weight format, and is built with accuracy as its first priority. The 30CB9 is designed to mount over our new compact muzzle brake. It is particularly suited to applications where the rifle will be shot suppressed and unsuppressed, and a brake is desired when shooting without the suppressor.The ""CB"" series suppressors was designed to mount over our new compact brake and provide the same repeatability as our direct thread attach suppressors, like the 30P-1. The 30CB9 features a conical shoulder for rock solid POI repeatability and to make sure it never comes loose.The 30CB9 was designed around .308 for maximum flexibility and is rated up to .300 Winchester Magnum, but it's the ideal suppressor for the most competitive mid-sized cartridges for long-range shooting such as .243 Winchester .260 Remington, 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.5x47 Lapua, 6.5-284 Norma, and 7mm Remington Magnum & WSM.The 30CB9 uses the baffle stack of the 30P-1, which has racked up impressive results at long-range field shooting events in the Rocky Mountain region, including the Blue Steel Ranch Steel Safari and the NRA Whittington Center Sporting Rifle Match. Many long-range shooters prefer shooting suppressed because the muzzle blast and concussion is eliminated, while the recoil impulse is reduced and smoothed out over time. The net result is that the rifle is easier to shoot and it's easier to make hits. Communication with your spotter is easier because the need for hearing protection is reduced.The 30CB9 is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded baffle core. This material and construction provides a great strength to weight ratio. It can take whatever your precision rifle can dish out.The 30CB9 is ideal for: long-range practical competition shooters; varminters; predator hunters; precision tactical shooters. SPECIAL FEATURESNew Compact Brake for .223 up to .30 caliber riflesIonbond DLC coating on CB muzzle devicesBrake-in-suppressor designConical shoulder surface100% titanium construction360-degree fully-welded baffle coreHelical Baffle TechnologyMagnum ratedRock-Solid POI Repeatability APPLICATION NOTESThis suppressor is strength-rated for 6.5-284, 7mm Rem Mag, 7mm WSM, .300 Win Mag.

2 30 round magpul mags.
I have over $1200 invested in this rifle. Asking $1000
I also have ammo for sale with the gun. I had 1000 lake city brass converted to 300 blackout and loaded 400 nosler 110 grain varmageddon and 600 hornady 110 grain v-max. I have 224 pieces of brass that I fired and tried to keep all them in a brass catcher but if I missed some I'll say 250 so that leaves 750 loaded bullets. At least 300 nosler and the rest hornady. The ones that have been fired are once fired since the conversion. Asking .50 cents a piece. So $375 for the ammo. The fired brass also comes with the bullets. If your a reloader I also have different powder and dies I will be selling.
Must have permit to purchase or carry.
If you any questions just ask. Thanks"

Kit is mostly 'correct' for a FN produced German contract rifle with the exceptions of the lever style gas plug, a Steyr gas piston (can be substituted for a US made piston), the short gas tube, the Imbel bolt, and the Belgian non trapdoor stock. No serial numbers match but bolt is unnumbered.  Kit features excellent handguards and bipods that are largely free of dings and have good screws and hardware, unground flashider with a NOS spring for a super tight and wiggle free fit, new DSA gas plug, soldered in short gas tube, new carry handle plastic, excellent ding free topcover, 1958 dated barrel with a good bore and a throat erosion of less than 0 on a brownells gauge, 1957 dated charging handle in excellent shape, new old stock steyr pistol grip, and fabulous non trapdoor cut Belgian type C walnut stock with great original buttplate.  Also has had a trigger job, and comes with three different weight hammer springs for the individual to experiment with.  The stock is the real prize, though.  Uncracked, very proud around the buttplate and ferrule, sharp contours.  Minor dings but no real damage at all, and would make a beautiful restoration project.  The gas tube is the soldered in short type, and it is not original to the barrel or gas block.  I opted to use that tube instead of the original longer non soldered type.  This tube is quite pitted on the outside but fine on the inside, however in hindsight I regret using it.  If you'd like I can remove it and clean the gas block up to use the original long tube, which I will of course include.  

I will ship this kit anywhere in the US, and shipping is included in the sale price.  I also build FAL rifles and do parkerizing (I put this kit together), so if you would like to have it built and finished out into a complete rifle we can talk about that.  Also, if you are not that fond of the wood stock, a plastic Steyr stock can be substituted for $100 less.

This is the new, striker-fired, LC9s model.  It has an improved trigger which is much lighter and with a shorter pull than the trigger on the older, hammer-fired LC9 model (the “s” in this gun’s model name stands for “striker”). 

I bought this gun about a week ago, but I’ve decided that I’d like something better suited to my hand.  You’ll like the LC9s trigger...it’s a sweet shooter and VERY accurate as a result of the exceptionally nice trigger (4.5-5 lb. short pull).

It has a slim profile that makes it ideal for concealed carry. It comes with everything from the factory: the original box with all paperwork, 7-round mag with the factory pinkie extension baseplate installed and a flat factory baseplate, dummy training mag, and lock w/two keys.

I’m also including three extra factory 7-round magazines for a total of four operational mags.  All four are the higher grade magazines Ruger manufactures in Italy (all stamped “Made in Italy”).  These mags are in the original packaging, all with pinkie extensions and flat baseplates.

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping. Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TN driver’s license or permit.  If the ad is still up, the gun is still available. 

Cash is preferred. I’m not looking for low-ball offers. Thanks!"

Manufactured in 2001.

I recently acquired this in a trade and haven't really convinced myself that I want to let it go but thought I would post this ad to see if anyone wanted it.

She is scope ready with a 2-piece Leupold scope mounts with Burris 1"" Redfield style rings attached. 

Rings have 4 screws per cap per ring rather than 2.
Has the classic iron sights with the hooded front sight that can be utilized with quick- release scope rings for close in shots.

It appears to have what I would consider a few, very minor handling marks on it versus marks from being in the field. 

Has a new Limb Saver ' advanced design - reduced recoil ' recoil pad  and white spacer just installed.

Has had trigger job as well, pull feels around 3 to 4 lbs. max. 

The 338 Ultra Mags are known for being long range shooters and a power house. 
Probably more than needed for North America but with Bigfoot out there and all :)
And, they are still a favored round in Alaska.

And yes the ammo is pricy which would make it ideal for the reloader.
This gun is in nice shape and would make a great addition to anyone's collection.

Asking $1,350.. 

Will ship continental U.S., Hawaii and Alaska only, to your FFL for an additional $75.00.
Let me know, David..

P.S. The only thing I would consider trading towards would be a decent AR10 in 308 otherwise, would not be interested, thanks..

  It's a nice little pocket pistol with a low round count, less than 50. I'm breaking even without the included rounds, so $250 is about my lowest. Interested in any firearms related trade aside from .22 rifles, and I don't have any cash I can add to offers at the moment. Prefer to sell to finance my first AR purchase, so cash offers will take precedence. Indiana ID or Carry Permit with a bill of sale is a must. Thanks for looking.

The 6.8 SPC (6.8x43mm) was initially developed by MSG Steve Holland and Chris Murray a United States Army Marksmanship Unit gunsmith to offer superior downrange lethality over the 5.56 NATO/.223 Remington in an AR pattern service rifle with minimal loss of magazine capacity and a negligible increase in recoil. When built to the level of quality and precision Wilson Combat has achieved the 6.8 SPC is also capable of outstanding accuracy and reliability. In our match-grade, Spec II chambered 16” barrels, The 6.8 SPC is capable of pushing a .277 caliber, 85gr bullet to over 2900 FPS. 110gr bullets easily achieve 2500 FPS with factory loaded ammunition. Appropriate hand loading can achieve even higher velocities and enable the use of heavier projectiles up to 130 grains, which dramatically improves terminal ballistics over a 5.56 Nato/.223 Remington at long range. This added ballistic performance makes the 6.8 SPC perfect for home protection and SRT/SWAT teams. The 6.8 is a truly ideal hunting round for medium to heavy game and turns the AR into a serious hunting rifle. Features: Wilson Combat forged 7075 flat top upper receiver, marked 6.8 SPC II Wilson Combat forged 7075 lower receiver Stainless lightweight match grade barrel with 4 groove / 1-11 twist, SPC II chamber, M4 feedramps, 16” Mid-length gas system, with lo profile gas block LMT enhanced bolt and carrier with NP3 coating Wilson Combat quadrail Wilson Combat Accu-Tac flash hider, 5/8”-24 Wilson Combat single stage TTU (tactical trigger unit) approx 4# pull MAGPUL CTR butt stock and MOE pistol grip with tactical trigger guard Armor Tuff polymer finish in black One Precision Reflex 30 round magazine Wilson Combat nylon assault case Caliber	6.8mm SPC Capacity	21-29 Barrel Length	16 inches Action Type	Semi-Auto Stock Material	Polymer Stock	Adjustable Weight (unloaded)	7 lbs Sights	No Scope Rails	Yes Optics Included	No Finish	Best Designed For: Hunting Target Tactical Price:	$2,450.00
