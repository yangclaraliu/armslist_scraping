Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.
Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

Here is a very rare virtually new PAWS ( Police Automatic Weapon Systems) model ZX8 carbine chambered in .45 ACP. This is a pre-ban carbine and they were discontinued when ""Klinton"" installed the assault weapon ban in 1994. This is the semi-auto version. . This is very close to the famous Sten gun as far as design.  The P.A.W.S. will accept readily available M3 grease gun mags (feeder lips must be ground down approximately 1/8"" to clear bolt. ) It is in absolutely like new condition. Bore is factory new. I purchased this last year at an estate auction, it was new never fired, I've only run one magazine threw it. It is not ammo sensitive and likes to eat any 230 gr. ball that you would like to feed it. This fires from a closed bolt. Feel free to ask any questions or for more pictures if needed.

These cartridges are loose, in a box and some of the lacquer has worn off. It also appears that they have been exposed to moisture as there is rust on most of the steel casings. I have tested the powder and primers in 10 rounds and it was functional in those rounds. These can be dissembled by someone who would like to use the bullets for reloading. They are priced accordingly.

Do not fire these rounds. Firing damaged casings can be dangerous and cause catastrophic damage to a weapon, serious injury or death. Cartridges should be dissembled by someone who has the proper equipment and skills to do so. If you are not experienced at pulling bullets you should not attempt to do so. Unfired primers must be properly disposed of. Do not attempt to de-cap (pull the primers) on unfired casings. Do not reuse the casings. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DISASSEMBLE THESE CARTRIDGES UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PROPER EQUIPMENT AND SKILLS. FAILING TO USE THE PROPER EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUES COULD RESULT IN PROPERTY DAMAGE, SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH."

Optimized for the M-4 platform and used by special forces. It has the 6.5 moa amber dot that never goes out. (tritium) It needs no batteries and the sensor in the front of the sight senses the lighting conditions and adjust the amber dot accordingly. It is an amazing sight. I have used it on a Beretta CX-4 Storm 9mm carbine and had one ragged hole in the middle of the target at 40 yards. It will do the same at 75 yards and greater if it is sighted in correctly. It is amazingly easy to use and sight in & comes with original box, rubber dust cover and manual. This particular sight hasn't been used very much (as you can see by the pictures). Once sighted in, I shot with it, maybe 7 or 8 times. The amber dot is visible even in bright sunlight and excels in low light conditions. It comes with the ARD (anti-reflection device) already installed. I havent ever taken it off. It helps soften sunlight during the day and virtually eliminates muzzle flash at night. These (if you look them up on the net) sell for around 500 or more on average, retail is 583.00. I am asking 400.00, which is very reasonable for this sight and the ARD device. thanks for looking!"

The M48 Mauser is a post World War IIYugoslavian version of the Belgian Fabrique Nationale designed Mauser model 1924 short rifle. After World War II, the Yugoslavs took this design and incorporated modifications based upon Germany's MauserKarabiner 98k. Although similar in general appearance to that of the German rifle, many of the parts of these two rifles are not interchangeable, especially the bolt and related action parts. The main difference between the M48 and the K98k is that the M48 uses an intermediate-length receiver. They are usually easily identified by the top handguard, which extends behind the rear sight and ends just in front of the receiver ring, although this feature exists on other models as well."

The vz. 24 rifle[3] is a bolt-action carbine designed and produced in Czechoslovakia from 1924 to 1942. It was developed from the Mauser Gewehr 98 line, and features a very similar bolt design. The rifle was designed in Czechoslovakia shortly after World War I, featuring a 600 mm (23.6"") barrel which was shorter and considered more handy than the 150 mm (5.9"") -longer Gewehr 98. The carbine followed a similar trend in weapon design at the time, that a short rifle gave away little in ballistic efficiency at combat ranges, but was easier to handle on account of its shorter length.

During World War II, the vz. 24 was produced for the German armed forces during its occupation. The rifle was also produced in nearby Slovakia, a German ally and puppet state during the war.

The vz. 24 rifle was widely exported and enjoyed usage during and after World War 2, noticeably by Romania, the Imperial State of Persia, Guatemala, China and others. Many of the contract rifles made for South American countries were chambered in 7mm Mauser or 7.65×53mm Argentine."

""The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols."""
