I think it's had less that 150 rounds put through it in its life over three trips to the range [I always switch to a bigger gun :)]. I figure there's not much sense in keeping it when I'm not going to use it. 

It's a fairly small (6.5"" long x 4.75"" tall) handgun that fires .22LR ammo. It still fires perfectly, and there's not a scratch on it. Even though it wasn't getting use, I was cleaning it regularly. The whole spread comes with a soft carrying case, the SR22 (duh), padlock/key, two magazines, two extended magazine caps, a wide hand grip, and a slim hand grip.

Heavily customized with several hundreds of dollars of upgrades in parts alone.  It‚Äôs a little too heavy for me to be comfortable with it or to be quick handling it, but it‚Äôs an awesome shotgun.  Fairly soft recoil, I‚Äôm pretty sure the original owner installed a recoil buffer in it.  

I‚Äôve put about 40 rds through it, all high brass shells:  Number 6 shot, 00 buckshot, and slugs.  All cycle flawlessly on the same gas regulator setting.  I didn‚Äôt try the gun with bird shot, but supposedly it‚Äôll cycle birdshot once you find the right regulator setting.  (More about the gas regulator below.)

Here are the upgrades that I know about (and I‚Äôm guessing there are a few more):

--Polished internals.
--Tapco trigger‚Äînot sure of the model‚Äîbut it‚Äôs the best trigger I‚Äôve ever used.
--FAB Defense UAS-1 folding stock with adjustable cheek rest
--Chaos extended quad rail
--Chaos HK style sight set
--Gas Plug Regulator‚Äînot sure of model, but best guess is TAC47
--DPH Arms 10-slot flash hider
--Tapco SAW style pistol grip 3E207
--Magazine guide, not sure of the manufacturer
--Sling mount 

Four SBM magazines (two 10-rd, two 12-rd) included.

Must be at least 21 yrs old.  (I know 18 is the age limit to buy a shotgun in PA, but I‚Äôll sell this only to someone who‚Äôs 21 or older.)  Must show PA driver‚Äôs license.

What do you have to trade?  I'm interested in 1911s, rollguns in .22, .38/.357, or .44.  Also interested in lever guns in those calibers.  Pre lock S&W or Ruger rollguns are always nice.  Not interested in Taurus, Rossi, or the like.  AR15 or AR10 uppers are good trade fodder.  Don't need lowers, mags, or ammo, just uppers."

It has ambi safeties AND mag releases, which is nice as I shoot lefty, and you never know when you will be forced to use your weak side. Unlike a 1911, there is no grip safety. Some people don't want the grip safety, but if you are used to the 1911 that is one thing to keep in mind, especially when you unload it. The mags hold 12 rounds. I have 2.

Basically this gun was the budget version of the Cobra D-Frame snubby revolver made in the early 80s -- making it one of the last of the old-school Colt revolvers with hand fitted internal lockwork -- in-fact, it has the same amazing Colt lockworks and guts as a Cobra, but with a cheaper parkerized finish. It also has an alloy frame for much reduced weight -- somepeople think that the alloy framed Agent is the best CC revolver Colt ever made. 

Basic Specs:
Marque -- Colt
Model -- Agent
Caliber -- .38 Special (factory rated for +p ammunition)
Weight -- 15oz
Capacity -- 6 rounds

This gun shows minor holster wear, with low round count.  Very smooth DA and SA trigger, locks up ""bank vault"" tight, just like a Colt should. The timing is dead on, and it shoots just like it should. 

Comes with original triangular walnut stocks w/ bronze medallions (in excellent condition), a set of modified Detective Special stocks, and a set of Hogue Monogrips (currently mounted).  A couple speed loaders are also available for the right deal.

I'm only selling because I tricked out my S&W 442 with a fancy trigger job and CT laser grips, and just don't cary it enough anymore to justify keeping it.

Asking $500, OBRO.  FTF in Portland.  OR DL required, CHL preferred."

It's in good shape but could use a thorough cleaning.
Included is a slug barrel, vented rib barrel, and 3 choke tubes (does not include case)
I took it in on trade and don't really need it.
Personally I have only shot it 3 times (with slug barrel) and all 3 holes were touching at 65 yards, so I would trust it hunting. I didn't put the other barrel on yet.
I've heard they only made 5000 of these gun but are basically the same as a 1200/1300 but simplified for government use. I am looking to get $350 out of it.  Would be great to only need one gun for most of your hunting needs. I'm not really looking for any trades but would consider an sr9 / glock 9mm/ m&p / or maybe even an SKS ( I know these may be worth more, but again, not really looking to trade)

Also have a full size stock that i can throw in. I have a mag tube flashlight mount that i can add but torch light is not included. The gun is used but very reliable and have never had a single malfunction. Can throw in any number of shells if ya want just let me know. Also have shotgun shell belt if interested. 

For just the shotgun with pistol grip i would like 200 and 210 if i sell with full size stock.

If i sell the shotgun, both stocks, Mil-Tech carrying case, light mount, 100 rounds of Federal shells, shotshell belt, then i would like to get 310.

The performance of this glove caught the eye of the U.S. military, which had Oakley upgrade the original invention by adding a full-grain leather palm with micro venting. The all-weather design combines optimal shielding with the comfort of breathable mesh and the airflow of rubber exhaust ports. Airprene on the joints improves breathability and flexibility while four-way stretch panels ensure a precise fit. The mid-height cuff won‚Äôt restrict movement, and it utilizes Airprene to help eliminate sweat buildup. Shielded with carbon fiber knuckle plating, this aggressive design is durable enough for the military or the mountain.

Enables attachment of FA762K suppressor to Armalite AR-10, Bushmaster BAR-10, DPMS LR308, and to other 7.62mm (.308 cal.) semi-auto or bolt-action rifles with 5/8-24 muzzle threads. This adapter functions alone as a flash hider when the suppressor is removed. Machined from heat-treated stainless steel, finished in a tough, corrosion-resistant coating. 

NOTE: SureFire muzzle brakes and flash hiders also serve as adapter mounts for Surefire's Fast-Attach¬Æ sound suppressors. If you do not plan to attach a SureFire sound suppressor to your firearm, we recommend choosing a shorter-length muzzle brake or flash hider. SureFire muzzle brakes and flash hiders that mate with Surefire's overlap suppressor models are longer in order to extend rearward over the barrel, a feature that is unnecessary unless mounting an overlap suppressor.

This is the cr√®me of the crop when it comes to a long range precision rifle. And its CA legal!! Complete specs are as follows: Model 98B in action Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. This revolutionary precision rifle offers sub MOA long-range performance that others can only dream about. Its straight-line design allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots that can tame the beast when hunting large game. Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it's not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting. Its straight-line design, running from the highly efficient muzzle brake to the shooter's shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip and allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a new round into the chamber as the bolt glides through a polymer guide. The Model 98B rifle's aluminum upper receiver boasts a full length M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. This impressive long-range rifle system is equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod. From its shooter-adaptable design to its unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action.

This trigger system has a smooth, consistent pull with about an 8 pound break with every shot from the first to the last. This gun is 100% German made which can be evidenced by the ""eagle over N"" markings on the frame, slide and barrel. I am the first and only owner of this gun and I have kept it in pristine condition since it was purchased new in 2006. It was never carried, and spent its life in the padded case that it came in except for a few trips to the range. If I had to guess I would say this gun has less than 1000 rounds through it which is why I decided it was time to sell it, it is just too nice of a gun to sit unused. The sale will include the gun, 3 magazines (two 10 round mags, and one 12 round), the other 2 interchangeable back straps besides the one on the gun, 2 extra magazine floor plates for the 10 round mags, 4 interchangeable front sights including the allen key and the set screw to secure the front sight, all of the original paperwork, manuals, the spent casing from the factory, and the original box it came in to store it all in. I also have some accessories that I don't need anymore that I didn't buy for this gun, but do fit this gun. They are a Bianchi Carrylok holster which is actually for a Springfield XD but fits this gun perfectly, A Crossbreed Supertuck Deluxe IWB holster, and a Blackhawk double-stack kydex mag holster. These accessories would be an extra cost but we could work out a deal if you wanted any of these in addition to the gun purchase, contact me for pictures of these if you would like. Again, this gun is in fantastic shape, and there are not a ton of these floating around for sale in this condition, so serious inquiries only please. 

Since I can only upload 3 pictures here, contact me if you would like more pictures and I would be happy to send them to you. Thank you for looking."

MAGPUL ACS/Adaptable Carbine Storage Stock Mil-Spec Model - Black

The patent-pending Magpul ACS (Adaptable Carbine/Storage) ‚Äì Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement butt-stock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. A streamlined, anti-snag profile shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation and the extra-power lock mechanism uses a premium chrome-silicon spring to avert auto-collapse failure by resisting spring relaxation. Similar to the Magpul CTR‚Ñ¢, the ACS also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes wobble* for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy. Dual, rear accessible, water-resistant battery storage tubes and an integral storage compartment in the butt of the stock provides multiple storage options. The ACS comes standard with a 0.30"" thick rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear. 

Features:

 ‚Ä¢ Two water-resistant battery storage tubes located on the left and     right sides of the stock   

 ‚Ä¢ Each tube will store up to three CR123 lithium or two AA batteries
 ‚Ä¢ Tubes are accessible from the rear via a tethered, hand-removable rubber plug
 ‚Ä¢ Storage compartment in tail of stock with positive latching access     door on right hand side   

 ‚Ä¢ LOP is adjustable from 11.1 inches to 14.4 inches   
  ‚Ä¢ Includes the QD Swivel Sling Mount that fits up to 1.5"" push-button swivels

The Magpul MOE Stock ‚Äì Commercial-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement butt-stock for AR15/M16 carbines using commercial-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The extra-power lock mechanism uses a premium chrome-silicon spring to avert auto-collapse failure and maintains strength by resisting spring relaxation. The Commercial-Spec Model includes an extended 0.55"" rubber butt-pad to provide positive shoulder purchase and accommodates the longer, slanted back common to most commercial-spec tubes.

This gun is still very tight and very accurate. The factory fiber optic in the front sight fell out and was lost while shooting. It was replaced with a solid brass rod. That is the only problem I've ever had with this gun.

.308 High Cap Drum Magazine: Serious firepower in a small package. The X-25 is a .308 caliber 50 round single stack compact drum designed for AR styled .308 rifles. The magazine easily loads and unloads by operating the front hand wheel. Designed to operate in automatic and semi-automatic applications, it employs a larger hand-wheel and double spring for increased reliability. Unique to this magazine's design is a patent pending feed device that allows the magazine to run massive spring pressures without effecting the firearm's bolt operation. The durable body is constructed entirely of aluminum, and finished in a friction reducing ceramic coating. All internal and operating assemblies are made of black oxide steel and aluminum. Comes with a lifetime warranty and includes an instruction manual. US sales only. PLEASE do not attempt to purchase if you live in one of the ""Constitutional Free-Zones"" such as NY, NJ, HI, CA, Chicago, etc.... or similar areas that have had their 2nd amendment rights stripped, as I cannot ship to you if you exist in those locales.

Condition is excellent and all serial numbered parts are properly matching, including the original diamond checkered stocks. The original blue finish rates about 98% with a cylinder turn line and a tiny bit of handling wear. There are no scratches or dings; no rust or pitting. The stocks are in excellent condition as well, free of cracks, chips or gouges. Vivid case colors remain on hammer and trigger. The mechanics are in perfect working order with good timing and solid lock-up. The bore is likewise excellent with bright/sharp rifling. This fine revolver appears little more than test fired! It comes in the original 2-piece gold & blue picture box that is numbered to the gun. The revolver specifications on the end of the box were factory modified by overstamping the ""Square"" (Butt) and adding ""Round"". A round butt, long barreled post-war K-frame is a scarce bird.."
