This is a very nice, smooth shooting rifle and is one of the recent rifles created to advance the modern sporting rifle. This is a piston driven rifle with a swiss style folding stock, features a full length picatinny rail with great back up iron sites, and ambidextrous charging handle, safety and mag release. This rifle has a MSRP of $1466-$1599. The rifle will come with one magazine. I do not have the original box or manual, but this can be downloaded from Sig's website. The rifle cycles perfectly and has been fired very little. I have never experienced a failure to feed or eject, I am just looking for something in 30 cal instead. 

I would consider a trade for a CMMG Mutant rifle, Sig 716, CMMG MK3 308, other semi auto .308 and 7.62x39 rifles considered. 

I am willing to sell the Sig 556xi for $975. I am located in Grand Forks North Dakota and will do a face to face sale with a North Dakota resident, and would sell the rifle through an FFL transfer to residents of other states (where allowed by law). 

More details on this rifle can be found on Sig Sauer's webite.

A folding stock combined with ambidextrous magazine release, bolt release, safety selector and charging handle. Accepts any MIL-SPEC AR-15/M4/M16 or most AK-style magazines depending upon lower.

Nice older (68) 700 BDL in 30-06. The bluing is close to 100%. The stock is solid without any cracks or chips. There are handling marks on the stock. It has been carried a lot more than it was shot.  The scope is the better (older style) Leupold VX-II in 3-9X. The serial number was checked through Remington & is NOT part of the defective trigger recall. I am just thinning the collection & not hard up for a sale so do not bother with the typical low ball offers. I will ship it myself for $35 or from a dealer for $45. If it is listed it is available. I generally spend a day or two at my camp working so I could be delayed on a reply. I will sell it without the scope for $500. Trade it for a short action caliber- prefer 308 or 7mm-08 but would consider others.

Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy.

While at the auction yesterday waiting for the runners to bring me all the guns I won, I was talking to a deputy who was checking the guns against people's lists. He picked up this Astra so we started talking about it. He commented that he and many of his law enforcement friends actually carry these kinds of handguns when they are off duty! I carry a 1944 Czech Duo myself (.25 acp) and asked him why since the .25 acp is such an anemic round.He told me that for close range, these little guys are effective enough to slow down a criminal so you can get to your car to get your main gun (yes this is a 100% true story)!

The strange thing is that the rifle has a bayonet lug, threaded barrel, cleaning rod, and slant brake. The rifle does not look like it's been messed with in any way, and I have owned it for a long time. Maybe it made it in right before the ban ? I really don't know but it's in fantastic condition with one magazine included. I am guessing this could be a rare rifle."

If I decide to part it out I will renew the ad with updated list of remaining parts. Thanks!!
I have a custom, high end, FDE 5.56 AR15 For Sale.  This Rifle was custom built with the best  precision made parts that money can buy. This was the most expensive AR that in my 20 plus years of building Custom AR's, I have ever had the pleasure of building. The Trigger, Muzzle Break, Charging Handle, & Stock alone were nearly $1000, not to metion the $600 for the Matching Upper & Lower Receivers and the FDE Cerekote. Again this Rifle is complete precision, in case you haven't heard of San Tan or Tac Con Triggers, San Tan Makes the BEST AMBI BILLET UPPER AND LOWER ON THE MARKET IN MY OPINION, and the TAC CON IS A 3 MODE DROP IN PRECISION TRIGGER THAT IS BATFE LEGAL SO NO STAMP NEEDED TO OWN. IT USES A POSITIVE RESET TRIGGER SETUP THAT WHEN USED PROPERLY IS AS CLOSE TO FULL AUTO AS YOU CAN LEGALLY GET WITHOUT A STAMP. HAS SAFE/TWO STAGE MATCH TRIGGER/ AND 3RD MODE IS THE POSITIVE RESET OR AS I CALL IT HELL FIRE MODE. LOL  . I am asking less than half of cost, (Can provide copy of receipts for each part on it if buyer requests.) because it was a partial down payment no show order that I ended up completing out of my pocket and am just wanting to recoupe my losses. So this is the deal of the century for one lucky local armslist buyer. I don't ship and don't have PayPal so don't ask or waste either of our times trying to get me too. This has had exactly 50 Rounds fired on it to sight it in and try the trigger. So it is new condition.  Anyway I'll run down the majority of the list of parts on it.

I am asking $1600.00 or mostly cash and partial trade for other Firearms (Prefer handguns at present but will listen to Rifle offers also.) $1600 is honestly right about 50% of total cost of parts alone for this build and again have and upon request will provide every receipt for every single piece used to build this AR (I am meticulous about my paperwork, lol)  
 I am Sure there is a lot that I am not thinking of because I am Kinda Tired now but i will update If I think of anything else if you are interested in buying and need I can text or email serious buyers more pics upon request. Cell is (517) 626-489five you can text or call me if no answer leave messege and I'll return your call but if you text I usually will respond immediately.

The barrel is shortened to 18 inches – something you’ll appreciate on those longer hikes over the mountain and through the alders. The forward position scope mount brings you the added versatility of extended eye-relief optics. The Scout Squad also features a specially designed muzzle brake to help tame the recoil.

 NP3® – THE ADVANTAGES

•Increases reliability
•It requires little to no oil for lubrication, although we recommend using some oil during break in.
•Very accurate and even coatings on all activated surfaces.
•Cleaning is minimal
•Permits firing for longer periods of time between cleaning, as dirt and powder residue has no wet or oily surface to cling to.
•NP3 has a micro hardness of 48-51 Rockwell as plated (nickel matrix).
•NP3® is very corrosion resistant, a 1 mil (.001) coating exceeding a 250 hour salt spray test.
•NP3® has a high lubricity and low friction co-efficient; therefore, the life expectancy of a firearm will be greatly increased due to reduced friction wear.
•The coating is strippable with no effect on the base metal, allowing other coatings to be applied or a new coating of NP3® to be applied, if necessary.
•NP3® plated onto stainless steel guns will prevent galling, a problem common with stainless steel.
•NP3® is a satin gray, non-reflective color ideal for all firearms.
•NP3® can be plated to all internal parts giving a smoothness to the action not found with any other coating.
•In cases where the NP3® has been perforated, the corrosion shows no tendency to spread or migrate under the coating.
•NP3® is guaranteed against corrosion, peeling or flaking for the lifetime of the firearm.

I have for sale a lovingly used 870 Wingmaster with 2¾” chamber customized 22¾” vent rib barrel along with 4 choke tubes and tube case.  This shotgun does show signs of typical hunting wear, but not abuse!  Stock and forend are nicely figured wood with fancy scrolled checkering and white spacers along with sling swivel studs.  There is no rust or pitting on/in the barrel, nor action.  A Remington Super Cell recoil pad has been added for the heavy recoil of turkey loads.  This barrel is a true 45 yard “Turkey Toppler” with the ported turkey choke and the Federal Premium loads listed in the photo.  This is also a light weight fast handling quail and dove gun.  The 4 choke tubes that are for this shotgun are from Trulock, 3 of which are extended tubes – Ported TRY .665”, FULL .700”, MOD .710” and a flush fit S-FULL .685”.  There is over $150 in choke tubes with this shotgun!  This shotgun is in perfect working order and would make a nice first upland bird hunter gun for a young hunter, woman or even the seasoned veteran.  Any additional information/pictures needed, please ask.

**This barrel ONLY excepts the Original Trulock Choke Tubes – no REMCHOKE.**
