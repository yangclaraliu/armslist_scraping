The barrel is octagon, the serial number range is 85000 so 1904 was the year of manufacture. There is a squib ring in barrel approx 4 inches from the muzzle, this will not prevent it from working, or being somewhat accurate. It is there, so I have to say, the bore is bright, but does have a ring. No cracks in the stock, a missing sliver in the forend from the loading gate being where it is.  i reserve the right to end this auction early if i have a sale here."

This rifle was manufactured between 1913-1934. The serial number is 753##. This beautiful piece came out of a 78 year old lady's gunsafe after numerous years of storage. It has a 22 1/2"" barrel with a shiney bore and strong rifling. Most rifles of this age have a brown patina, but this rifle has great bluing on the receiver and barrel. There are minor scratches and marks from use on the metal and the wood. Please note, there is no rust, no heavy gouges or major scrapes. The action is crisp and the rifle locks up tight. It has not been fired since I purchased it. The button to release the slide is a bit stiff. This is all original and has a 10 shot capacity. This piece is too good to be just a shooter. A rifle this nice belongs in your collection. I am just a collector and not a gun shop, but try my best to acurately describe each item I sell"

Construction is entirely matte blue steel, and capacity is 75 rounds of 7.62x39 ammunition. This ia a new in box magazine and comes packaged with instructions.

This magazine will not fit an SKS 59/66 type rifle, or a Ruger Mini 30, will not fit a Saiga Rifle, or the engine manifold of a 1952 Chevrolet.

If you are comparing battle rifles, the AK could not hit a plate from this distance and the AR would not scratch it.  

This rifle is the same design as the G3, HK-91, PTR-91 and CETME.  Parts are interchangable and readily available.  You can get extra mags for as low as $2.

This rifle is the New model offered by Century for 2015 and is built from Original parts  coupled with a new US made receiver and  a new US made barrel with  5/8th x 24 threads & compensator . The C308 also features an Optic Rail that is welded on top of the receiver allowing the easy mounting of your favorite optic . Previous modes used a claw mounted rail that scratched the receiver and easily lost zero.  This is way better.  The C308 will accept readily available G3 20 round mags. Rifle comes with 2 -20 round mags and 1 -5 round mag

This is a Czechoslovakian designed rifle. In short Czechoslovakia did not want to follow in suite with the Russians and came up with their own AK. In fact they even had their own cartridge early on with their VZ 52 (their version of an SKS), 7.62x45, but later on adopted the Russian 7.62x39.

This a short piston, striker fire operated rifle. As opposed to the Russian long piston, hammer operated AK. A unique feature to this gun is that it has a last round bolt hold open mechanism, which the AK does not. Also an AK tends to shoot the brass more to the 3 o'clock position, whereas the VZ tends to shoot them straight up. People have said that due to the shorter travel of the bolt in the VZ the recoil is a lessened. Not quite sure how valid that is, as both seem to be about the same to me. 

This specific rifle has been fired approximately 600 times, as in 600 rounds, not 600 individual trips (in case there is any confusion). After each range trip, it has been sprayed down with copious amounts of CLP and wiped down for a general cleaning. Not to military white glove standard, if you are picky about those things. 

Included with this rifle are:
Magazines (x3)
Ammo (if so desired)(must increase trade or money value of course)

Anyways on to the ""asking"" price. I am in no hurry to sell this gun, but I do enjoy my AK47 much more. I just want to test the waters and see what I can get. 

Not sure why I am only allowed to upload one picture, but please do contact me for more."

It looks like it did when I first got it... the finish is in great shape with just the slightest bit of wear (if you could even call it that) from carrying it in the included pocket holster. It also comes with  2 pristine magazines with the ""Seecamp"" logo on them, box (with ALL paperwork) 14 rounds of .32 acp Speer Gold Dot 60 grain bullets (which is pretty much what it is designed to shoot...60 grain bullets). I havent tried any other brand but it is flawless with the Speer. I have shot this little pistol about 20 times, It is hardly even broken in. It makes a great 2nd gun (pocket pistol) in addition to your main ""everyday carry"". These Seecamp's are totally hand built and assembled. They are among the very finest small pocket pistols that money can buy. There is currently about a 2 year wait to even get one! If you are a serious collector or just want an ultra-reliable backup pistol with a great pocket holster then THIS is your gun. Has manual and all the paperwork that originally came with it.

** Very Hard to Find**

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.

$500 OBO.  I don't really need to sell it.  I've simply had it for months now and have never taken it out to shoot.  That seems like a good enough reason to post it.

I also have a little .22 Mag ammo that I'd be willing to sell to the buyer."

I have one Glock 9mm drum. Its new in the box and is Asian Military (NOT factory Glock). It should fit all Gen 3 or earlier 9mm pistols (I think they will also fit Gen 4 because it has the dual mag release notches, but I don't have a Gen 4 to test them with). Don't e-mail asking my lowest price or if I still have it.

Whether you're wanting to limit your reloads on the range, in a home invasion, or the zombie apocalypse, one of these will keep you firing long after others have run out of all their magazines.

I've seen this exact drum selling for as high as $120-130 each from stores and Gunbroker online, but I'm only asking $55 cash. PRICE IS FIRM.

Like New Used Glock 23 - have put one box of 50 rounds through it, and still have 9 in a magazine, for a total of 41 down the pipe. It's used for home defense and the 41 I put through it were sighting the laser in. 

The Flashlight is ridiculously bright, and the batteries have really long life--I have a box of the Streamlight batteries that will come with the gun--12 remain in it. The pictures tell the story, this is an excellent buy for home defense or law enforcement. You get everything I purchased for this weapon, the Streamlight TLR-2, the relocated momentary that puts the switch into your shooting grip as well as the stock TLR-2 battery door (look under trigger guard to view the momentary), and the Zombie Response Team slide cap seen in the pictures. 

Gun is kept CLEAN at all times. Its a nice weapon, I just want a Gen4. I will sell the whole package for $575, or the Gun only for $400. Serious offers will also be considered. Please contact me with any other questions!

A true blowback design this little pistol shoots every time without flaw (except sub sonic). Includes 1 8 round magazine. 

The extra magazines are available for $60 each. These mags are no longer manufactured as FEG is out of business. If you are familiar with this model you know the magazines are now very hard to find and command top dollar. Current price on what I can find is $75 each plus $3 shipping.

The finish is excellent with just a bit of holster wear on the muzzle. The bluing is bright and shiny. Most flaws that appear in the pics are nothing more than glare from the finish.

I do have a bit of 22LR ammo I could sell with purchase of the pistol for 9 cents per round.

Price was $250 including a nice pocket holster. Now reduced to $225.  Feel free to contact me with any questions. This is a cash only deal. No trades. No shipping. It must be picked up in person and you must be eligible to legally purchase a handgun. Texas residents only. CHL preferred. A bill of sale must be signed at purchase.

In total this is worth 800 dollars minimum with purchase I will also throw in a 350 round box of ammo. That's right 350 rounds of .22 ammo. Very hard to get ahold of right now I am asking 625 for everything which is a great price. When you buy a colt you pay for the name. Honest to god I have never had this gun jam on me.Thank you for looking. If you have any question please don't hesitate to ask. I have no problem answering any questions. Only selling because I am saving up for a bigger project.for more pictures please txt me at REDACTED. I wasn't allowed to post more pictures on here for some reason."

You will notice it has a stainless barrel on it which was just put on by Lairs Custom Guns in Cosmopolis Washington. It was blue printed and had an over sized lug put on and muzzle brake. Everything to include bolt face barrel and threads were true to a thousandth of an inch. I am the original owner of the gun and it's ten years old. The pic of the brass is all the rounds I fired with the old barrel minus a few after I got the new barrel on it. It's a much better shooter now with the new barrel. The brass and 2 magazines come with the gun. The brass count is unknown but weighs around five pounds. I'm looking at getting a smaller caliber gun with less recoil even tho this rifle has put plenty of meat in my freezer and has been my go to favorite rifle for a decade. I may get rid of leupold scope and leupold mount with rifle. However those two items are also new and were put on by Lairs Custom Guns when I had the new barrel put on In February.

I purchased new in January of 2013 and have put roughly 100-125 rounds through it, I am estimating on the very high end to be certain I am not misrepresenting anything!! (I would be surprised if I have broke the 100 rounds area)It is a great rifle that has been used for one hunting season, just this past November and it got the job done and stocked my freezer. Originally paid $750.00 for the rifle, selling because I have two and that is not necessary. Every thing seen in picture is available as a package.
Bushnell 4-16x42 Yardage Pro w/ Integrated Laser Range Finder which was also purchased new in 2013 but was not always used. When not used it was stored in the box with battery pulled, for this reason it is in extremely good condition. It is a good scope and the rangefinder is quite handy especially when zeroing without benefit of a measured gun range. Bought this new for $680.00. I did paint it with non reflective camouflage pattern/color paint.
Hawke Sidewinder 30 Side Focus 4-16x50 Scope
Got this scope on a rifle I picked up a few months ago. I have used it on the rifle for a little while and have quite pleased but alas, I don't need two so ones gotta go. I am finding these in the $400 to $450 range so here is the breakdown of what I am asking, I am selling as a complete package so I prefer not to break items up at this time.

Rifle--------$600
Bushnell----$400
Hawke-------$250
Total asking price $1250.00, I am motivated to sell but not forced so I would accept reasonable offers but that would be about it. Feel free to ask me questions or throw an offer out. Not too keen on trades as I need the cash but motivated to sell!!!"

I have a Glock 22C (with compensator on the barrel and slide) with aftermarket night sights

My Glock will come with a 10 round mag and a 15 round mag as well as its box it came in. The gun is practically brand new as I just got it back from the Glock factory for a cleaning and they sent it back with newly replaced parts, which I have the receipt for from Glock. The night sights are already installed on the gun and I have the original sights as well.

If you do decide to trade with me, I'll require a bill of sale that I will provide for both of us to fill out and get basic contact information.

This gun appears to have been shot very little. The 422 is unique in design from the barrel being low in the frame just above the trigger guard. The barrel lowered allows the shooter to get back on target quickly because of very little muzzle jump making it a great target competition pistol. Reading the forums on this gun it's said by many to be the finest 22 target pistol in it's class with the best quality. Unfortunately building quality costs money and S&W discontinued the 422 because of the cost to produce it. They were made from 1987-1997. These are nice shooting guns that are economical and fun to shoot. Compare on Gunbroker.com for $399-$450. PP or cpl required
