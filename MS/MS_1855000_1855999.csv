Took this in on trade,and didn't fully inspect it.
It's in okay shape,and shoots great but does need a new safety detent ball.
and some cleaning though as there is some light surface rust and a spot where it appears the previous owner tightend the barrel to much (used pilers)
The gun functions flawless though,would make an excellent hunting gun or home defense weapon.
I personally don't use the safety on my 500's so didn't really bother me not to fix it,but I've got 6 others so don't need this one.
Feel free to call or text me REDACTED if i don't answer leave a message and i'll return your call asap."

Up for sale is a Browning Double Automatic Twelvette Model. Blond wood. Barrel is 27 1/2"" with modified choke and ventilated rib. LOP is 14 1/4"" from front of trigger to middle of original buttplate. Stock is uncut with no recoil pad. Total weight unloaded is 7lbs 4 5/8 ozs.

Condition is very good to excellent and has been fired very little. You can tell how often one of these guns has been fired by the wear on the gold plated trigger and the wear on the side of the receiver where you chamber the shells. The loading port will eventually wear through the anodization and show as silver around the edges when the gun has been loaded (and shot) a lot. This gun still has the full gold trigger plating and very little wear around the loading port. Black anodization is still fully intact which indicates usage (loading) on the low to very low side.

No major scratches on the metal or dents on the wood anywhere - just usual handling and wear marks, but in remarkable overall condition. No splits or cracks in the stock or forearm anywhere. I purchased the gun about 6 years ago and fired it only once to make sure. I purchased it because of its quality condition. I have another DA I shoot and no longer desire this one.

For those of you who may not be familiar, this gun was designed by John Browning's son Val Browning as an option to double guns. People often wonder ""why a 2-shot automatic?"" The reason was to have a gun as fast or faster than a S by S or O/U with less weight.  These guns are often misunderstood. It seems shooters either ""get them"" or they don't. If you ""get it,"" you tend to love them and regret parting with them. 

These guns are extremely reliable and I have never experienced a single jam or misfire except for reloads when the brass was not properly resized. 

The Browning Double Auto’s are a fast loading lightweight and fast shooting gun at home in the field or with clays. Personally, I love these guns as I am a southpaw and I can load the gun very quickly while holding it inches from my shoulder. Safety is located on the back of the trigger guard so the gun is truly ambidextrous. They tend to kick a little due to recoil operation and light weight.

Asking $1,000 or best reasonable offer. Also may be willing to accept trades.

Thanks for looking and contact me for questions or more pics.

Velocities well in excess of 100 fps over the best published handloads and even larger gains over factory ammunition!

The 90-Two represents the continuing evolution of a legendary pistol. It introduces new improvements to form, fit and function, while maintaining the integrity and reputation of its predecessor, the world famous 92FS. Although the 90-Two offers more individualized performance, the operating controls are identical to those of the 92FS/M9/M9A1, making it completely familiar to those already trained in the use of the older pistols. Many of the internal components, as well as the magazines, are completely interchangeable with those of the previous generation 92 series.

 Here are the new features: 

A. Slide Serrations: Increased surface area for better grip during slide retraction.

B. Updated Styling: Beretta once again partnered with the world-famous Giugiaro Design industrial design firm to enhance the appeal and ergonomics of the 90-Two.

C. Weight Reduction: The skeletonizedframe of the 90-Two grip design has resulted in a lighter pistol.

D. Removable Front Sight: Allows user toreplace existing sights with accessory sight systems or replace damaged sight.

E. Internal Recoil Buffer: Increases servicelife by reducing stress on the receiver createdby the more powerful .40 S&W ammunition.

F. Individual Size Grips: Single-piece, wraparound,technopolymer grip is user replaceable with an optional smaller grip. Allowsuser to select most comfortable size, while reducing the part count by thirteen.

G. Magazine Capacity: Increased to holdup to 17 rounds in 9mm and 12 rounds in.40 S&W. Magazines from standard 92 series models are completely interchangeable withthose of the 90-Two

H. Caliber Availability: The 90-Two is available in both the 9mm and the .40 S&W.

I. Accessory Rail: The frame of the 90-Two has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aimingdevices. Includes removable rail cover."

this listing is for a Nickel finish Jimenez Arms 380 ACP pistol with only 25 rounds down the pipe. I got this in trade new from a guy and only took it out once to make sure she shot fine. I would keep it, but i already have a PF9 that I have for a conceal so I have no use for this. This will come with everything it did from the factory, (trigger lock, key, two clips, paperwork, original box), plus 25 rounds of 380 FMJ ammo. I fired the 25 rounds with no major issues. I had one FTE but I am nearly positive that was because I really limp wristed it (was my second shot) and it fired flawlessly for the remaining 23 shots. I shot two clips at slow aiming speed, then two clips at rapid fire speeds just to see if it was fine. Also, since i just got back home from my trip for the holiday weekend. the gun has not been gone through and cleaned by myself. Depending how soon this sells it may or may not be cleaned before you ought it. (not trying to just not clean it, but i am extremely busy for the next few days and have 6 other guns i need to clean as well). It will come with the warranty paperwork as well that Ive never filled out or sent in so even if it does have issues you have the JA lifetime warranty. This is sold as is for obvious reasons, but i assure you it was shooting just fine on July 4th when we took our guns out. I am looking for best offer here or possible trade for a bunch of 22LR or 9MM ammunition or possibly another 9mm pistol and maybe a 22 pistol (i like to keep the same caliber so ammo is easy to have on hand). Id also consider a partial trade as well. I can shoot pictures via cell. Just shoot any questions or offers to REDACTED and we can try and make a deal. Also, we would need to meet locally and in daytime only. Id rather not be a ""dateline special"" haha.  PLEASE TEXT ONLY. I work full time and also have school full time so I almost never can ""talk"" on the phone, but texting is almost always possible for me to respond. If you must call then feel free to do so and leave a voicemail if I cannot answer. Thank you for looking and have a great day!"

In Chicago he set about buying a horse, wagon, supplies and provision to travel west.  One of his purchases is the 1903 Colt DA 38 presented in this advertisement.  Embarking Chicago in his wagon he traveled to Elk City South Dakota where he met and married my grandmother, also a Norwegian immigrant.  Together they set out across the Sioux Nation lands deep into the heart of the Dakotas with that Colt DA 38 strapped to his hip to purchase land, start a ranch and raise a total of 15 children.  

A bit about the revolver specifics.  It features a counter-clockwise rotating cylinder, which can be opened for loading and ejection by simply pulling back on a catch mounted on the left side of the frame behind the recoil shield. It is easily manipulated by the thumb of the right hand, and upon release the cylinder can be poked out sideways with the shooter's forefinger. Empty cases are removed by simply pushing back on an ejector rod to activate a star extractor. The six-shooter could then be quickly reloaded and the cylinder clicked back into place.

One interesting thing about this particular revolver is the inspector’s mark on the left top of the frame: ""J.T.T."" for John Taliaferro Thompson, designer and father of the famous submachine gun that bears his name. He was a U.S. Government arms inspector before becoming famous for his sub-machine gun.  This revolver also bears the engraving R.A.C. which is US Gov't Inspector's mark of Rinaldo A. Carr on the frame and the smooth walnut grips.

This revolver was designed to shoot 38 Long Colt and 38 Short Colt ammunition.

Second is that I just bought a compound bow and I need the money to pay for it before my wife finds out.

Deep concealment and amazing affordability combine in Galco’s new Tuck-N-Go, which builds on the success of the enduring USA/UDC tuckable holsters and the huge popularity of the Stow-N-Go IWB. The Tuck-N-Go's open top allows a fast draw once the concealing garment is swept up and away, while the reinforced mouth allows a smooth and easy return to the holster. For the utmost in concealability, the holster features Galco's patented Generation III tuckable J-Hook. The Gen III J-Hook’s streamlined design hooks over the pants and behind the belt, hooking upward and only showing a small piece at the bottom. A tucked-in shirt will completely conceal your firearm. The Tuck-N-Go carries the handgun in a vertical orientation, with no cant or angle. Constructed of comfortable premium Center Cut Steerhide, the Tuck-N-Go fits belts up to 1 1/2"". Made for semiautomatic pistols and double-action revolvers, the Tuck-N-Go is available in right and left hand designs in natural finish."

I think the model is also 22, caliber .22LR. 
Of course this also means you can shoot shorts, longs, and CBs out of it if you want. 
It comes with 6"", 4"", and 2.5"" barrel assemblies.
The 2.5"" assembly has a green EWK fiber optic front sight on it, the 4"" assembly has a red matte front sight on it, and the 6"" has black one. Each is interchangeable with an allen wrench. 
The thing also comes with the toolkit to change the barrel assemblies -- there is a pilot wrench and a feeler gauge, along with the correct size allen wrench for the grip screw and front sight.
I can send you a PDF manual as well (I don't think they're in print). The large wood grip is what came with it -- the Hogue fits dandy, and the smaller brown one is kind of a ""close enough."" Bluing on the 4"" and 2.5"" assemblies is pretty near perfect. The frame assembly and 6"" barrel have been transported a bit, but not beaten up. I'd say maybe 90-95% on those."

Cool little pocket gun I bought new & have owned for 30 years.
I only shot it two times 30 years ago to know I could hit with it in that ""up close and have to"" situation. Remarkably accurate just run your finger between the over and under barrels and point, it hits! I only have 9 hollow point rounds for it.
Perfect fit Bianchi leather clip on holster comes with it.
I also have a Cobra 9mm derringer for sale, it won't fit in the Bianchi holster that fits the .38 Special, but it is new with the original box & paperwork. I have more pocket guns than I have pockets, these two will partially fund a bigger (Sig 938) pocket gun.

It will come with original case, paperwork, lock, the two extra back straps and three 15rd glock factory mags. Also trigger guard has been professionally undercut to allow you to get a higher grip purchase. I am only looking to trade for a few things that I will list below all other offers will be ignored and I'm not interested in cash. The only reason I want to trade is that I carry this regularly and now that it is summer the gen4 grip is rubbing me the wrong way literally. The gen 4 is about $100 to $150 more that the gen 3 and its worth it for the reduced recoil due to the double recoil spring so I think anyone who trades with me will be getting a good deal.
