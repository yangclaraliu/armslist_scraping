Bought new April 2014, approx. 600 rounds.
Cleaned after every trip to the range, functions like new.
I am willing to meet at the NRA range if anyone wants to test fire it for themselves (bring your own ammo).

Price includes two magazines (these guns are usually sold only with one) as well as a BladeTech holster that can be configured as either a paddle or belt holster. The BladeTech will also fit the M&P 9 or 40 as well. The extra magazine cost me $30 and the holster was another $50.

Good gun for beginning shooter or as a trainer for any centerfire strike-fired pistol.
Grip is slim and fits most hands, trigger light and crisp and aluminum slide is easy to rack.
Easy to clean, no tools required to disassemble.

Mag release is ambidextrous (currently set for right handed shooters) and barrel is threaded for a suppressor. Tools for both are included.

Please contact me if you would like to see more pictures or if you have any questions.
Please bring your VA Driver's License and VA CHP with you. Thank you!

If you live in another state I am happy to ship to your local FFL but please note that the 12 round magazines and threaded barrel make this gun illegal to ship to states such as California.

Edit: I have received several questions from people asking why a CHP (Concealed Handgun Permit) is necessary. We live in a litigious society and I do not want to sell to a potential felon, whack job or ATF agent. Therefore I kindly request that you bring your CHP, or military/LEO ID to verify that you are not a prohibited person.

If you don't have anything like that, simply drop by your local police station and ask them for a printout of your criminal record. I've done this myself and it takes only a couple of minutes (I'll throw in a couple of boxes of ammo for your time).

I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but let's remember there are people out there who work tirelessly to take away your right to self defense who would just love to use Armslist sales as an excuse for pushing universal background checks and gun registration. Let's not give them any ammo."

In addition this combo brings a full set of factory SKB chokes and some aftermarket competition chokes totaling 11 chokes combined. The shotgun also features an adjustable cheek piece and an adjustable GraCoil recoil pad. It comes with accessories and tools (pictured) including a custom SKB hard case, a multi-choke wrench/tool, and a set of multiple HIVIZ sights in a neat holder. Needless to say this is a serious competition gun with everything you need to get started in the sport of trap, skeet, or bird hunting. 
The condition of this firearm is excellent to say the least. The wood finish is pristine, with only a few very very minor blemishes. The metal on both barrels and the receiver is in great condition (easily over 95%). It has only had one owner and looks like new!
This shotgun is rare and hard to get these days since it is no longer made and most people hang on to theirs because of its high quality. SKB is well known for its great costumer service and quality products; my grandfather has always talked this gun up, you're getting a great premium package here!"

I recently acquired a new scope and no longer have need for this great Vortex Optic. The scope has been mounted and only fired twice and it is in mint condition.

I don't have to sell it and don't need the money. I am sure if I don't sell it I will mount it on one of my other rifles.

Just look around the site if you don't believe me.

This is a beautiful and barely used high quality rifle. The barrel is chrome lined, and the furniture is plum. This rifle has a stamped receiver, but it's 1.6mm thick and it feels like it is milled when you first put hands on. 

These are rock solid, and very well made in Houston, TX by Armory. This is right under Arsenal in terms of quality, accuracy, and durability. The trigger is smooth, and the stock houses a cleaning kit that attaches to the cleaning rod. Very neat and compact package here.

This rifle comes with six 30-round steel magazines and one 10-round steel magazine. And because I am a cool guy, I will throw in the Type 63 chest rig AND 60 or so steel cased bullets to get you started. 

I bought this as a secondary set up for home defense, and decided to get a shotgun and optics instead. So here I am selling it first come first serve for a VERY fair and attractive price. 

If you don't believe my price is fair, look around and see if you can find a better deal on here. If you can, I'll look into it and match it. Otherwise, Price is FIRM.

Do not try to trade your busted and bastardized Mosin Nagant with ""custom stock"", either. You people know who you are, and I will ignore such trifling morons.

There have only been ~320-400 rounds through it, and there is NO rust or damage. Feel free to ask any other questions, and I look forward to doing business with someone that can appreciate a quality firearm as I do. 

Special Note:

I've got 1000 rounds (unopened in a case) of Wolf steel cased ammo. My asking price? $200. That's .20 cents a round, and I will only sell it at that price if you also buy the AK-47 described above. This is a lot of stuff for the money, especially with the ammo bundled in.

Thanks for looking!"

The Lone Eagle features a rotary breechblock similar to those found in artillery. This design provided enormous strong lockup.
Overall length is seventeen inches. Barrel is heavily ported. This hand canon fires a 7.62x51 or 308 round. It is a single shot action. Once the round is in the breech, the firearm is cocked using the cocking lever on the front of the grip. It also has a locking safety button. The grip is very comfortable. 
The scope is a Leupold M-8 x 4 with extended eye relief. Mounted on rail, that can be moved to suit the individuals preference. 
These firearms were indeed ridiculously overbuilt. With the strong lockup and heavy barrel these very well known for their extreme accuracy. With a five shot group at 75 yards, even I was able to shoot a half dollar size group.
It was indeed fun to see  five-foot muzzle flames, and a deafening concussion that may require double hearing protection. Others at the range were indeed impressed every time I fired the firearm. 
If you desire at any time in the future you wish to change barrels they can be found."

It comes with one 15 round magazine and one 18 round magazine, a Walther pistol case, small, medium, and large backstraps (which are NOT marked RFID), and the owner’s manual.  I am not the original owner, so I do not know the round count.  I have only put one 50 rd box of Winchester White Box through it. When I bought the gun, it only came with the pistol, the two magazines, and the medium backstrap.  It wasn’t until I got home that I realized that the roll pin that holds the backstrap in place was also missing.   I screwed up and paid the guy too much for the gun.  So, after ordering the replacement backstraps, the roll pin, owner’s manual, and pistol case, I have $570 into this.  I know I can’t get that much for it, but I am asking $525 cash price.  For trades, I am interested in mainly Sig’s, specifically the P226 , SP2022, or P320, but I am open to other offers.  Let me know what you have.   I am located in Hampton.

Buyers must be willing to sign a bill of sale and present two forms of government issued ID to include a Virginia driver’s license and CCW permit or Voter Registration to show you are not a felon.  For military, I will need to see your military ID along with your PCS orders showing you are stationed in Virginia if you are not a Virginia resident.

P.S. The trigger is phenomenal on this gun.  If I wasn’t already so heavily invested on my other carry setup, I would probably keep it."

I have shot this a bunch, such an accurate rifle. Takes 5-round stripper clips, two of them, to deposit 10 rounds into the magazine. The stock is not in amazing condition, it is a military surplus rifle. The top piece of wood (near the rear sight), is cracked and missing a piece. The main stock is rough, but could be refinished if you so choose. There is a dent above the left side near the trigger. The rifle still has the unit markings on the butt, pretty neat. The bore is great, I have kept it oiled and have not shot corrosive ammo through it.

The gun will come with 4 boxes of surplus ammo (15 rounds per box). This, I believe, is corrosive ammo. I think the ammo is Turkish, it has cyrillic writing on it. 

Located in Dover, work in Rochester, sometimes travel to Alton/Wolfeboro for work, could bring it along one day at your choosing.

This has been Cerakoted in Armor Black by MAD custom coatings in the Kingston area. This used to be the black stainless color scheme, but the factory coating literally flaked off from holster use.

The Loaded Target model came with the following features from the factory:
-Extended beaver tail safety
-Match trigger
-Match barrel
-Full length guide rod
-Trijicon high-rise ""target"" night sights (Still have some good glow!)
-Fully checkered backstrap
-Premium grips

I also installed the Hogue front strap grips.

This comes with three different holsters, two of them pretty high end. They are by Tucker Gun Leather out of Texas(?). The IWB is their flagship ""Answer"" holster that easily conceals this full size pistol. The black leather is their HF1 holster that also conceals this pistol but in an OWB setup - These two holsters alone cost over $350. 
The other is just a kydex OWB holster.

This also comes with six magazines - two factory seven rounders, one old Colt seven rounder, two Chip McCormick eight rounders and one Wilson Combat ten rounder.

Asking $800 - Buyer pays for transfer.

Reasonable offers considered.

In addition this combo brings a full set of factory SKB chokes and some aftermarket competition chokes totaling 11 chokes combined. The shotgun also features an adjustable cheek piece and an adjustable GraCoil recoil pad. It comes with accessories and tools (pictured) including a custom SKB hard case, a multi-choke wrench/tool, and a set of multiple HIVIZ sights in a neat holder. Needless to say this is a serious competition gun with everything you need to get started in the sport of trap, skeet, or bird hunting. 
The condition of this firearm is excellent to say the least. The wood finish is pristine, with only a few very very minor blemishes. The metal on both barrels and the receiver is in great condition (easily over 95%). It has only had one owner and looks like new!

This rifle falls into the ""Fair to Good"" category, the rifling is true and there are no cracks in the stock.  Right now it's about 95% clean and oiled, but could still use a good detail stripping.

These rifles were readily available a number of years ago but got bought up really quick due to the popularity of the round and style of the weapon. MAKE NO MISTAKE this is NOT one of the crappy Armscor pieces of junk that are almost entirely made out of plastic. This rifle is built to the same dimensions as a real Romanian AK47 and uses many of the same parts including: All of the furniture, front sight/gas block, gas tube, hand guard retaining plate, rear sight block, receiver, trigger guard, selector stop, selector lever, fire control group (except for hammer spring for obvious reasons), and the rear trunnion. This rifle is built like a tank and functions like a sweetheart so long as you put some high velocity round nose rounds through her. I got this rifle for my wife hoping I could coax her into coming shooting (no such luck). Therefore the pink furniture is available with the rifle instead of the wood if the buyer wants if for a special lady or effeminate man.

I installed the tapco furniture myself, and do not have the original wood with me currently. If this is a deal breaker, maybe we can negotiate a settlement. I think it is much more functional and comfortable in the current setup. 

The rifle comes with 600 rounds of ammunition, 2 factory steel mags, and 3 tapco magazines. I have not had any issues with any of the magazines.

I used it as my EDC. The holster is a Flashbang-Ava holster (this holster works for men too). It's a great carry piece, and is fun to shoot.

The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.

The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.

Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement."

Please text your offers to me by 5;00pm tomorrow, thanks.
Trying to get rid of some of my collection, sadly I have never shot this particular gun or any of Ruger's 9E. I've shot the SR9 but the 9E is a little different it has an improved striker and a few other little mechanical upgrades compared to the older SR9

I paid $404 for the 9E after sales tax and the 2 extra magazines I purchased. I'm only asking for $255 for this gun, it will sell fast so please let me know asap if you are interested. Text or call me at REDACTED. My email is REDACTED but I don't check it too often, your best best is to text.
Let me know if you need pictures but the gun is literally brand new. Here's a link to Ruger with pics and info on the 9E:

I don't shoot this near enough to keep it. I'd rather this go to someone who will use it. I have fired probably 250-300 rounds out of this without a single hiccup. 

This is a great example of a WASR 10. There is no real mag wobble which is I guess an issue with some of these. Also the sights are spot on, no cant to speak of.

Along with the rifle You'll also get 3 preban 30 rnd magazines, a soft case(not pictured), and roughly 600-700 rounds of ammo.

Will comply with all laws. Purchaser must have a valid Class A LTC and EFA-10 will be filed at time of purchase or can meet at your preferred FFL within reason but you pay the fee."

She locks up tight, with no slop, and the bore is in excellent condition, with about 200 rounds through it.

For sale is a like new Stag Arms Model 3GL AR-15 3 Gun Model, Left Hand, with an 18"" stainless steel fluted barrel.  It shoots either 5.56 NATO or .223 Remington ammo.  It features a Samson Evo Rail Handguard, A Magpul ACS stock, and a Gisselle 3-Gun trigger single- stage trigger.  These are impossible to find in stock locally.  I am the original owner and it has only fired approximately 60 rounds.  It is completely stock.  It comes with the original hard case, 30 round magazine, carboard box, and manual.  The attached photos show the actual rifle for sale and were taken on August 22, 2015.

The rifle is available for face-to-face cash purchase and pickup in Kennewick, WA.  I will not respond to late night text messages or ""lowball"" offers, and I am not interested in any trades.  Sorry!

The background check that is now required in Washington by Initiative 594 and subsequent transfer of the gun to the buyer can be performed at the Hole in the Wall gun shop in Kennewick, WA.  The fee is $25.00, payable by the buyer.  There is no sales tax on the private sale, even though the actual transfer occurs at a gun store.  I originally paid $1,500, including tax, so for $1,150 you are getting a nearly new rifle and savings $350!!!

Give me a call at the number listed below if you have any questions or would like to see the rifle and purchase it.

Fantastic pocket pistol, this gun has had 250 rounds of ball ammo through it for break-in and 50 rounds of Hornady critical defense.  I purchased this gun for my wife in December of 2013 (at the height of the gun craze for $800).  Since she purse carries, the extremely small size isn't as important an issue for her.  She now prefers to carry a slightly larger CCW.  I have a P380 that I pocket carry, primarily use with shorts and a t-shirt in the summer time.  Absolutely love it, so small, so compact.  But, I don't need two.  Here are the stats:

- Locked breach browning type action
- 4.9"" overall legnth
- 3.9"" height
- .75"" wide
- 2.53"" premium Match Grade polygonal rifled Lothar-Walther barrel.
- Forged Stainless steel slide.
- Polymer frame with integral stainless steel rails
- About 11 ounces in weight
- Dovetail Trijicon front & rear night sights
- Manual slide lock
- Striker fired
- Pachmayr slip-on grip sleeve
- (2) 6 round magazines

If you don't know the difference from the P380 and the CW380 let me inform you.  The P series of Kahr pistols is their ""premium"" line and the CW series is the budget line.  Some of the differences are:

- P380 has a match grade barrel, CW380 has a NON MATCH conventionally rifled barrel (I can tell you that this pistol is ridiculously accurate, way more accurate than I can be.  Not that is means much, in a life/death situation, but I can easily put rounds on a steel silhouette target from 100 yards)
- The P380 has laser cut markings vs. the roll marks of the CW380
- The P380 has more refined contours compared to the more basic Slide machining contours of the CW380
- The P380 comes with premium front/rear trijicon night sights compared to the basic sights of the CW380
- The slide release, takedown lever, etc are Forged parts on the P380 compared to (MIM) metal injected mold parts on the CW380

It also has a five shot allen shell holder on the stock and im sure i can find a chamber flag and a bore snack for it. I also have an old cleaning kit that can go with it.

Now for the ammo that also comes with it; remmington 15 round value pack of 2 3/4 00 buck shot, remmington five shell box of high velocity 2 3/4 rifle slugs, two boxes of remmington 3 inch magnum rifled slugs five rounds per box, two boxes of winchester super X rifled slug hollow points 2 3/4 each box has 15 shells, one box of royal 2 3/4 00 buck shot that has 20 shells left in it.

Youll pretty much be set for a couple years of target practice and deer and hog hunting.
