Most times they are full of carbon, you wont get that from one test fired cartrage. More than likely they are illegally selling guns at a personal profit even though they didn't peruse a federal lisence to do so. The ATF does not recognize ignorance as an excuse to break the law.

In the late 1970's the US Army adopted a new 7.62mm medium duty machine gun into their ranks: the M240. It was first used as a coaxial machine gun in tanks but slowly made its way to other mounted uses by the late 1980's, the updated model referred to as the M240C. Due to a surplus of M240C's the Army passed some on to the USMC. When the Marines got their hands on the M240C they installed an ""infantry modification kit"", thus spawning the M240G, the first infantry model of the M240. Having seen the success of the M240G and its effectiveness as a ground mounted 7.62mm machine gun, the US Army decided to test and eventually adopt the M240B, the slightly updated factory production variant of the M240G, into its ranks to replace their outdated M60E4's. Throughout its years of service the M240 has proven itself, in all its variations, to be an effective, reliable medium duty combat machine gun.

They are cheap, reliable, and tons of ammo is readily available. But don't pay $150 and more for a run of the mill round receiver with restruck numbers. There's plenty still out there in cosmoline at the gun store for that price. Don't let these guys take advantage of you because they bought one and can't handle the recoil. They bought it, shot it, and now it's used. And more than likely didn't know how to clean it properly. A simple swab with hoppes won't get the job done with surplus ammo. Do your research. Most of these guys think it's okay to screw you over because they just dropped money on a gun they didn't know how to take care of it, and think it's all good to take advantage of the new guy because you didn't educate yourself.

I have for sale my Barnett Buck Commander Crossbow, this thing is a hunters dream, shoots fast, quiet, smooth and it is very very accurate.

I really want to thank you all individually but there are a few wolves in sheep's clothing out there. Maybe I'll disclose those I've found later but for now I would like to ask you one simple favor. Just flag one ad. One ad that's overpriced, or if it falls into another catagory just flag it spam because it will be noticed by administration more seriously. I'm just getting started but surely I'll be blocked before too long so please. Show the guys who left and those about to throw in the towel that the shooting community isn't all about a buck. If I can get one shooter that's here for the love of shooting to flag off one ad for every mag of ammo I gave away to bring another person into our sport, then I've done well and gave back again. That's all I want. Run the greed out and show the country we aren't all motivated by sin. If you really want to step it up, flag a goug before you take a new shooter to the range.

If you are looking at this gun, you know how good this brand of gun is. Trusted by the most demanding special operatives in the world as their side arm, the H&K USP is the ultimate performer. 

The USP Compact’s machined steel slide features drift adjustable front and rear sights, aggressive grasping grooves and a prominent set of metal sights (both three dot and night sights are available). The generously sized ejection port and a large claw extractor ensure positive extraction and ejection of spent cases while the extractor does double duty as a loaded chamber indicator.

The barrel features polygonal rifling for enhanced accuracy, easier cleaning and longer barrel life. The external hammer has been bobbed so it won’t hang up on clothing or gear—further enhancing conceal-ability.

With the reduction in length of the slide and barrel, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large-frame USPs was replaced by a flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Despite the part’s smaller size, service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

The slide reciprocates on four steel inserts that are integral to the fiber-reinforced polymer frame. To make it southpaw-friendly, the pistol’s magazine release paddle is located at the base of the trigger guard where it can be activated by either hand. The slide release is well shaped and positioned for easy manipulation and the control lever (a.k.a. safety/de-cocker lever) can be mounted on either side, although moving it to the starboard does require additional components.

The design of the pistol’s lockwork allows it to be carried in either “cocked and locked” mode or with the hammer down on a loaded chamber. For the former, you chamber a round and then push the control lever up to make the pistol “safe.” Pushing the lever down allows you to fire the pistol with a short, single-action trigger stoke.

For the latter, you chamber a round and then exert additional pressure on the control lever, pushing it past the “fire” position where it safely de-cocks the pistol. You can then fire the first round with a double-action trigger pull and subsequent shots in single-action.
The breech is locked by the barrel hood moving up into and bearing on the front edge of the ejection port. When you fire the pistol, the slide/barrel unit reciprocates to the rear locked together. After a short distance the barrel is cammed down, which allows the slide to continue rearward extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge case. The recoil spring then pulls the slide forward, stripping the next round from the magazine and chambering it. As the slide goes into battery the barrel is cammed up, locking it and the slide together again.

Glock 19 Gen 4. Gun is like New condition. I bought it (used from private party) last week thinking I wanted this to replace a Sig P250 I was using. Shoots perfectly. Brought it home, cleaned and frog lubed it and decided I liked the Sig better. My old hands can't disengage the slide very easily and I found I held the Sig more comfortably when shooting and easier to disassemble. As you can see in the picks, gun is like brand new with the box and paperwork. There is one thing missing and I didn't think at the time to ask the gentleman I bought from last week: it is missing the other sets of backstraps. The grip feels like medium, but I do not know for sure. Cash only please,.... no trades unless you have a Sig P250 .45acp conversion kit + cash

Purchased with an idea in mind and never made it around to finish the project. Never shot a single round from it, actually, never even loaded it. 

The lower was custom built by Anderson Manufacturing. Overall barrel length is 10.5 inches. Comes with a factory installed aluminum key-mod free float handguard w/ picatinny rails. The pistol is fully functional (with BCG and CH included). I have added a upgraded Full Auto Black Nitride Bolt Carrier Group. Nitiride is much slicker and harder than chrome or even Nickel Boron. It allows that Bolt Carrier Group to operate much longer without lubrication than standard chrome or parkerized finish. It is also much much easier to clean.

Also comes with a 30 round MagPul PMag magazine and single point bungee style sling for easier carrying. This is pistol, no different than a handgun. NO tax stamp is needed to own, use, or carry (yes, it can be carried as a CCW pistol if you wish).

Price is $750. FTF only, no shipping. Must be 21 with a VALID OH ID. CCW (like myself) preferred. Thanks for looking.

NOTE: I also have a 7.5"" complete upper available. The 2 uppers are the exact same, other then the length. Buyer can choose 10.5"" or 7.5"".

As reliable and accurate as every Ruger 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America’s favorite rimfire rifle by your side. The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly. Despite the ease of assembly and reassembly, the lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero – even when receiver mounted optics are used. The Ruger 10/22 Takedown Marine TALO Edition Rifle is shipped in a lockable Flambeau hard plastic case with rubber gasket. The 4.67 pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37” long when assembled; each half is less than 20-1/4” when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action, and provided with one 25-round magazine, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a new compact and portable package.

Like this gun, but I've been putting a lot into ARs and could use a little coin. This gun is used and has about 1500 rounds through it. I would rate it at 90-95% condition, but it is used and has some scratches on the finish from being holstered so much. I was the original owner."

of cowboy life on the trail.  The Henry Big Boy .44 Magnum Wildlife Edition
emulates the pulse quickening thrill of a trophy buck leaping into view.
Each genuine American walnut buttstock and forearm are engraved using
techniques which combine todays engraving technologies with hand
craftsmanship passed from  generations past. After engraving, artisans
individually hand paint the buttstock and forearm using multiple acrylic
colors. The original artwork is visually used as a guide, but subtle
detailing makes each unit truly one of a kind.

OK, my sad little parable aside, this is a great 3"" 1911, if that's your thing. Or want to make it your thing. This could be your carry gun, it could be your truck gun, or your nightstand gun. For me, it was just my range gun. And I just can't shoot a 3"" 1911 at 25 yards the same way I can with a 5"" 1911. And if I can't shoot a gun the way I want, then I won't shoot it at all.

It's a Savage 110 with Accutrigger. Second owner, and I've put about 25 rounds through it, mostly at hoofed rodents. Currently dialed in at 100yds with 170gr bullets - have ballistics results for 150 and 220 as well. Gun comes with factory weaver rails on it. Has 5 round internal magazine. 

It has a 1"" Redfield Revenge 4x12 adjustable scope on top. I really like the scope, so if you let me keep it and the mount, I'll knock a hundred bucks. It has been tapped and drilled for irons, though I have not bought/installed any on it. Nor do I have any to add, I'm afraid. The screws are there for them though. 

Sling comes with, though I'll buy it back for $5. If you can meet me locally, I'm happy to add in a box of (factory) 30-06 soft points as well. 

EDIT: Almost forgot - there is a slight crack at the tang. Came with the gun to me. I've since glued it, and it has not grown appreciably. Truth in advertising, though."

Up for trade is an awesome arsenal sgl21. It's in good shape (I would rate 90%). There are a few marks but over all very very clean. For the enthusiast/collector my rifle has an earlier legion stamped rifle. For most this won't mean anything but from a collector stand point this is more sought after.  Has seen around 500rds. Super smooth trigger. A very nice rifle. Being these are rapidly gaining popularity because these Russian aks are longer being imported, I figured I would see if I can turn it into something else I have been looking for. I'm looking for around $1200 in value out of it. If you look for these rifles for sale gunbroker is about the only place around to find them and they are asking much much more than that for them.

Description: 
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Hey all, 
I recently decided to sell off my 10mm kit from my 21sf . Some 21SF pistols only need the mag and barrel swapped to run 10mm perfectly, some need more. I was in the latter category and mine would run flawlessly about 95% of the time, but i decided that i would prefer a dedicated 10mm pistol. So, I am selling off the barrel in favor of that. So, not really looking for trades, but might consider trades for pistols or rifles depending what they are. Need to meet up in Norman on these if possible. Here is what I have:
-Lone Wolf Stock Length G20 1 in 16” twist Stainless Steel (needs a good deep cleaning)- $100

To grab some shoot me a message at REDACTED or a message on here.

950,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4185950,For Sale:  5kW (6.6+kW) Diesel Power Plant MEP-002A Onan Generator,"Downtown Appleton, Appleton, Wisconsin","$ 2,000","Listed On: Saturday, March 28, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Lose power? Want to be ready for the next outage with clean, reliable, backup power that can support your home for weeks? 

I've lived in the Fox Valley for several years, it seems on average we lose power at least once each year. 

This is an Libby Corporation MEP-002A Military Diesel Generator. It's a baby with only 92 hours of use, stored indoors almost it's entire life and, very well taken care of by the WI Army National Guard. 

92 hours of use, I wanted to repeat that. These machines are renowned for lasting tens of thousands of hours. 

For decades, Libby Corp has ruggedized (militarized) dependable Onan Diesel Generators for use around the world under the extreme conditions demanded by the US military. This machine is incredibly overbuilt and designed for continuous use in temperatures from -20*F to +120*F. In comparison most commercial generators today are designed for temporary use, and need to be shut down repeatedly to avoid damage and overheating. This machine will run continuously for tens of thousands of hours if fueled, and only needs to be shut down for servicing oil and filters. 

The machine is a 6.6kW Onan Twin Cylinder Cast Iron Diesel Generator mounted on an Aluminum Skid with dual heavy duty batteries, a 6.75 gallon fuel tank, and a 24v control system. 

Military Spec Fuel System: 
This machine has a total of three fuel pumps, four fuel screens, two fuel filters, and a fuel strainer. Two redundant fuel filters in addition to a fuel strainer, are mounted on the frame for easy servicing. Two redundant fuel pumps with a third auxiliary fuel pump are mounted under the control box for use with an external fuel source. Each fuel pump also has a serviceable fuel screen built into it's base, and in addition there is a screen in the fuel tank's opening. The in-line fuel pumps are designed so that if one fails the other continues to pump through its carcass keeping the generator operational in extreme conditions. The fuel system is designed to operate using JP-8 or Diesel, and it is specifically designed to be able to run in unfortunate circumstances with contaminated fuel, hence the filtration system. The auxiliary fuel pump is designed to pull fuel from an external source like a fuel can, I use an external 30 gallon diesel tank. The generator has a bong adapter for fuel drums which is included. Fuel consumption for this machine is .30 gallons of diesel per hour at half load and just under .5 gal/hr at full load. 

24v Electrical System:
The generator itself operates off two on board heavy duty 12v batteries mounted in a corrosion resistant stainless steel cage on the side of the skid. The generator operates off a 24v system with a slave receptacle under the control box for easy jumping from any other 24v source. The control panel has two 24v lights which illuminate the gauges and switches for night time use. The generator has its own 24v charging system on board which maintains the batteries while the generator is in use. 

6.6kW of continuous power:
Unlike it's commercial counterparts this generator is designed for use in several configurations without the need to rewire it's control box. The generator has a master switch which changes the output from 120v/1ph(55A) to 240v/1ph(27.5A) to 208v/3ph(31A). Yes this machine is switchable between 120v/240v/208v with the turn of a knob, no need to rewire it's internals. It is perfect for powering industrial machinery requiring three phase 208v power, or simply for providing residential backup at 240v. The Military underrates their MEP equipment so that it can be used in all climates and at all altitudes. The data label on this unit reads 5kW, and it is capable of outputting 5kW continuously all around the world. The % load gauge on the control panel reads between 0% and 133% and the unit is fully capable of exceeding 6.6kW of output in this Wisconsin climate. For example when I load test this machine with a 4,500 watt inductive load at 15*F, just above sea level here in Appleton WI, the % load gauge reads at a mere 60%. 

Onan Diesel Engine:
These things run forever. At 1800 rpm Onan diesels like this operate at half the speed of most commercial diesel generators, doubling their life expectancy and reducing noise output. This machine has a very heavy duty twin cylinder air cooled 1147cc engine. By being air cooled you don't have to worry about maintaining engine coolant or worrying about gasket leaks. The engine has a mechanical oil pressure gauge, a low oil pressure shut off safety feature, and an industrial oil cooler designed into it's air cooling system. The engine has its own electric start with a cold weather valve on the air intake system to aid the glow plugs in heating intake air during cold weather operation. The air cooling system on this engine has a temperature controlled shroud which opens louvers near the exhaust at a variable rate to ensure stable and consistent temperature control of the engine. 

This Generator is in extremely good condition. I have recently completely serviced the engine, replaced all filters, changed the oil, and completed an annual flush of the fuel system. The batteries are in great shape as I keep them maintained with a battery tender. 

This is a perfect machine for providing reliable off-grid power. I have another that I use to provide 55 Amp service to our cabin up north which doesn't have electricity. 

If you are interested I can schedule a demonstration and you can experience a load test of this awesome machine.

92 hours on the meter, almost brand new."
