Pretty much brand new (purchased ~2 weeks ago), has built in cleaning rod. Perfect wood furniture, sights/gas block not canted from what I can see. 

Exactly 30 rounds shot. Will come with 470 rounds of Brown Bear 7.62 polymer ammo.

Shot the 30 rounds and sighted it a bit, ran out of time. Decided to consolidate ammo types (I have 5 types at home....) and just stick with the AR after realizing the AK is probably not for me. It's an AK so obviously no issues in those 30 rounds fired. Cleaned all the cosmoline/metal shaving and lubed it with Slip2000 before firing.

I can paint any color that you desire and can even do multiple colors depending on what you want.  I think that $20 for a handgun would be fair, unless there is something about the weapon really hinky that may require more labor.

FAQ:
1. It will accept whatever magazines are designed for the lower you have.
2. If you have a standard AR lower, you will have to insert a 9mm magwell block.
3. It is compatible with standard AR lowers.
4. This is meant for a pistol, so unless you have a registered SBR, you will need to place this on a pistol lower in order to remain legal."

Now for the bad, there is a lot of surface rust on the bottom side of the receiver/trigger guard area.  See the photos.  It can be cleaned up if someone wants to take the time and have a beautiful shotgun at a good price.  I am pricing this accordingly for the effort that will have to be put forth on the buyers end.

Nice gun in great shape.   1 Mag, no box or papers.  I do not know a ton about AKs but this is a clean gun with not fired or fired very little.  The bore is clean, and the Wood is scratch free.  The only marks I see are the on the receiver where the safety operates.

I rate the gun’s condition at approx. 99.9%, this gun retails for approx. $599.00 + TAX.  I would like to sell this gun and I am asking $560.00.   I am 99% firm on the price.  I am open to trades, and I am interested in S&W revolvers, short barrel. Webley revolvers, will add cash for a unshaved .455 Webley.  

Cash only and a FTF meeting only. Ohio DL required, and CC permit preferred. I will do a bill of sale if desired, (please let me know in advance if you want a BOS). In my opinion this is a good gun, and to the best of my knowledge 100% functional and as described above.  I am offering No warranty or guarantee, this is an AS-IS sale. I am willing to meet within about 25 miles of Parma Ohio. I will answer all messages first-come-first-served.

I reserve the right not to sell this gun.  All most all of my ARMSLIST encounters have been great, but one guy weirded me out, I ended up not selling to him.  Apologies if this seems harsh, but I will not sell if my substantial gut tells me not to.

Cash only and a FTF meeting only. Ohio DL required, and CC permit preferred. I will do a bill of sale if desired, (please let me know in advance if you want a BOS). In my opinion this is a good gun, and to the best of my knowledge 100% functional and as described above.  I am offering No warranty or guarantee, this is an AS-IS sale. I am willing to meet within about 25 miles of Parma Ohio. I will answer all messages first-come-first-served.
I reserve the right not to sell this gun.  All most all of my ARMSLIST encounters have been great, but one guy weirded me out, I ended up not selling to him.  Apologies if this seems harsh, but I will not sell if my substantial gut tells me not to.

Standardized by the DEA, ATF, and FBI SWAT team, the Model 552 holographic weapon sight is the sight of choice for such military units as the Stryker Brigade, 10th Mountain, and 3rd Infantry. The Model 552 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.
The Model 552 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. The battle-proven design can withstand the abuse that any harsh environment, high-powered weapon platform, or military mission can dish out. Other features include a 65 MOA ring reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 30 brightness settings. The Model 552 is compatible with Gen I-IV night vision systems and mounts on 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails.

Features a M700 stainless steel barreled action with a 24 inch R5 mil-spec barrel, the same barrel used in the M-24 sniper rifles. Varmint barrel with 11.25 inch twist rate with five lands and grooves and eleven degree target crown. Stock has aluminum bedding in block in standard VS configuration.

The 5-R Rifling barrel features five lands with a right hand twist which allows for less bearing surface on the bullet for slightly increased velocity.

As a result of less bullet drag, copper fouling in the bore is reduced ensuring long-term accuracy and consistency. The barrel is offered with a 110 target-style crown and a 1 in 11.25-inch twist.

The rock-solid barreled action is full-length, aluminum bedded into a well-designed H-S Precision stock for enhanced stability and shot-to-shot consistency. Add Remington's X-Mark Pro® externally adjustable trigger, designed to ""break-like-glass"" and set at 3.5 pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical-like accuracy.

The 17 fireball is a hot round 4000 Fps at 20 grain bullet and is capable of taking down predator size game.  I took this on trade and I spent time out in the range. Off of bags and the right technique you can get .5 or less at 100 and just bit less the an inch at 200.    This virtually has no recoil and is a center fire   Extremely accurate and a great gun for kids.   The trigger had been redone and is right at 2lb pull and breaks like glass.   Only blemishes is the cheap synthetic coating on stock. Certain cleaners will rub it off.    

The only issue is this is a hard round since Remington quit making this caliber  few years back. But in there 2015 catalog. There bringing it back.    Rds can be bought online.  Cases for reloading you can use 221 fireball and neck it down.  If you google this 17 fireball you'll see it's very accurate and deadly round.

This comes with a bunch of extras, including the magpul forend and stock, enlarged safety, gold front bead, and a Mesa tactical 6 round side saddle. The Mesa tactical isn't some plastic/elastic side saddle, but solid milled aluminum. That thing will take just as much of a beating as the shotgun will, and being a 590A1, it can take a lot. Also, is a custom made grip texturing on the forend, made from talon grip material. This really improves the grip and makes sure your hand won't go anywhere as you work the pump.

I bought this gun and it's just sat in the case. I took it to the range ONE time and put maybe a box and a half of target ammo threw it and one magazine of self-defense ammo. 

The gun is stainless but as you can see from the pictures the frame is Cerakoted Black. This gun CAME this way from Colt, this wasn't some custom work I had done after the fact although I had considered sending it out and having the slide Cerakoted to match but I never did.

If you notice the trigger and beaver tail, no wear to the finish. This thing has hardly been touched.

Comes in the original case, in the original plastic bag just as you see it in the picture.

I would like to get $950.00 dollars cash. I orignally posted this for $1050.00 so I'm down $100.00 dollars. That or I have some trades I'm open to. See my list of trades below.



LOCATED IN THE GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN AREA. I would like to keep this semi-local if possible but I'm open to shipping out of state if you cover the costs."
