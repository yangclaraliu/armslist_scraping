(they do need to be sanded and painted or varnished) Here's the scoop, I just bought this last fall for fishing smaller lakes and over the winter decided to get something bigger. So I bought it last fall and never used it. Last fall I put new seals, bearings, races, amsoil water resistant grease, bearing buddies, and took the 480x12 B tires off and replaced with new tires and wheels upgraded to 530x12 C tires, used one of the old tires for spare and added the spare tire mount and tongue jack. So this boat is ready for the water. The Spartan trailer is in good shape, some spots of surface rust that can be cleaned up. The package pulls like a dream, when I pulled it home I didn't know I was pulling it with my small car. 1,450.00 cash only. George

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs. This particular armor is made to military spec and it is designed to withstand higher caliber rounds.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc. Thank you for viewing!"

It has the proper cylinder length and sized  throats so all of the problems with early Smith .45`s are corrected . These are noted to be exceptionally good shooters. 
This one is in perfect condition."

Perfect for AR-15 type platforms this optic has a daylight visible red dot with 8 brightness settings and automatic shutoff, Leopold's SPR reticle which is perfect for quick ranging out to 800m, and .1MRAD adjustments for wind and elevation.

Scope is in great condition and has only been used a few times.  I sold the rifle this was on so I have no more use for it but it is perfect for any AR-15 type rifle or even smallbore guns for field work.  With a 1.25-4x, you can use it similar to a red dot for closer range shooting and then crank up the zoom to 4x for shots out to distance.  The Trijicon ACOG is typically a 4x so the zoom range of 4x is more than adequate for shots out to past 500m.

The scope is mounted on a pair of A.R.M.S. #22 High Rings.  These are a throw lever quick detach which will mount to any standard M1913 Picatinny rail.  The high clearance allows the scope to clear any rail mounted accessories such as sling mounts or back up iron sights and gives you perfect cheek weld with the AR.

The scope also has a set of Butler Creek Scope Caps.  Asking $650 for all."

The stock and rifle are honest, with some small dings in the wood and some places where the blue has let go on the rifle.  I would say overall it is 80% but it runs 100% (I can link a video to the gun being fired if you would like).  Bore is clean with good rifling.

It looks like the previous owner had some kind of recoil pad or shell holder on the stock, as there is some kind of glue residue on it (it is not sticky, just didn't want to risk ruining the finish taking cleaner to it).

Has anyone else noticed that the best prices for green tips and SKS rifles is at dealer shops?  In all honesty, and paper trail concerns aside, who wants to pay someone over 500 for an SKS that a dealer will sell for less than 400 plus tax?  Some people (just some) are listing brush guns at safe queen prices.

Also, when did all mosins start at 200 bucks?  I can see 200 for a nicer example, but I don't want to pay a premium for Ho Chi Minh's back up drop piece.  

Lastly, I don't shoot 223, but I did I'd take all my green tips and trade them for a substantially greater quantity of plain jane FMJ.  There is no such thing as a magic bullet, and if you really think things are going to get that bad, then you should stack deep any ammo that will reliably run in your weapon (cheapest price gets you the most rounds).

Advice:

The premium one might pay for a ""soon to be [maybe] banned"" type of ammunition could instead be spent on spare magazines, range time, replacement parts for weapons (springs, extractors, etc) or other items for gun maintenance.  I know people are stocking ammo, but who's stocking cleaning supplies, mag springs, gas tubes and the like?  If there is concern over certain guns being banned, isn't what's in your parts bin as important as what's in your gun safe?

There has been some discussion on ""paper trails"" with purchasing from Midway or other places using your credit card.  What do you think using Armslist creates?  Does anyone email you asking if you ""still have it"" and then you never hear from them again?  That could be someone seeing who you are.  Do you use an anon email address? Your IP address doesn't lie.  If I were truly concerned about the paper trail, I'd list that I had an unspecified amount, take emails from serious buyers, and talk on the telephone (or better yet meet in person somewhere). That is the way to avoid a paper trail as a buyer or seller and you are legally taking steps to maintain your privacy.  Better yet, put on your tinfoil hat, march down to Starbucks and use their Wifi.  Problem solved."

This was taken off of a Bushmaster and is factory to them. It fits the standard USGI profile barrel and has one additional part that is kind of cool. I purchased the Bayonet Lug / Rail attachment years ago and can’t remember the manufacturer. It is solid aluminum and gives you a spot to put a light or laser on the bottom, right in front of your support hand. I really like this attachment and anyone who has a useless bayonet lug would appreciate it too. I honestly do not know what to price these parts for as finding them new is hard unless you buy the entire upper kit. I paid $30 for the bayonet rail adapter on the bottom but it is used… so if you want to make a cash offer or trade for quality 9mm ammo that would be great. If you are interested, I travel for a living across most of NC so if you want to meet and take a look at them please let me know and I’m sure we can work something out. Thanks for looking.

I bought them to protect the mags when they drop to the ground. One additional thing I did not expect was that it really helps me keep control of the mag. It is a semi-tacky rubber that really grips. I liked them I bought a ton thinking I would tear them up. Well, 3 years later they are still in great condition so I figured I would sell off a few. I paid about $7.00 each for them in bulk and I have 15 for sale. I'd be willing to sell them for $5 each if you buy more than one. I travel all over NC from Winston-Salem to Wilmington on a regular basis. If you are interested please let me know.

I have 2 sets available.

$125 is bottom dollar for these kits of 240 rounds in ammo box.  If you don't want the box, subtract $5.  If you want all 480 rounds, I would go $230.  I am leaving the area on 17 October, so if you are interested, sale must close by then.  After that I will just keep them or list them in my new locale.

Please don't email me telling me you can get it cheaper somewhere else.  I'm sure that obscure websites with little or no reputation do have lower per round prices for some M855 ammo.  If that's what you want, then buy it there, but I don't want to hear about it.  Either you're looking for this PMC ammo or you're looking for something else.  Good on ya.

This is cheaper than both Cabela's and Sportsmans Guide for this exact setup.

For comparison, Cabelas price is $75 per 120 rd battle pack,

It has ONE magazine through it, otherwise been in the box. Bought it 2 weeks ago for my wife and she decided she liked the way anther gun felt in her hands so now I am trying to sell this gun.  Great gun!  Would love to keep it but I can't justify keeping this and buying another one, at least not to my wife haha.  S&W has been a top manufacturer of guns for years and the M&P is no exception.  No manual external safety (internal trigger and magazine safety) so you can just point and shoot with no added steps in that pressure situation.  Great carry gun and with the double stack, you are afforded 10+1 rounds as apposed to the 7 rounds from the shield.

Comes with 2 magazines, 3 backstraps, original box, lock, information, manual, 1st fired round.....everything just as you would get from the store! Like I said this is basically a brand new pistol.

Everything together is 1,080$ or just the rifle itself for 775$. (Retail is 858$ but I have the new muzzle break on it.) Prices are fairly firm.

Glock Perfection. The Glock 26 Gen3 is ideal for home defense, concealed carry or as a back- up duty weapon. It is a sub- compact, 9mm, polymer frame handgun that uses a locked breach system referred to as ""Safe Action"". This is the combination of a trigger safety, firing pin safety and drop safety that render the loaded pistol incapable of firing, even when banged or bumped, unless someone actually squeezes the trigger. Because it does not have a hammer, the spring loaded striker (firing pin) is technically blocked off, partially retracted and not in geometric alignment with a chambered cartridge. It is only by squeezing the trigger, which fully retracts and then releases the striker, that makes the pistol then capable of firing. The absence of a hammer also provides a sleeker profile that reduces both size and weight, while optimizing a smoother draw from concealment."
