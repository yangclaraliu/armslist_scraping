Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum magazines, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 100-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum magazines, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

Why choose between a Red Dot or Telescopic sight when you can have both in the Blink of an Eye?

The SpecterDR™ Dual Fields-of-View (DFOV) sight provides both close quarter and precision fire ranged capability in a single package.

Whether utilizing the Red Dot in 1x or 1.5x magnification or the ranging reticle in 4x or 6x mode, the SpecterDR™ DFOV sight provides ultra-wide viewing angles for optimal situational awareness and unmatched low-light performance. The SpecterDR™ DFOV sight allows the user to safely and effectively transition in and out of building for close quarter or extended range without changing sights.

The 1x or 1.5x FOV provides a generous viewing angle (24° in the 1-4x and 16° in the 1.5-6x version) and an extremely fast, ""both eyes open"" target acquisition capability.

The second FOV provides 4x or 6x magnified sight (FOV 6° & 4° respectively), a range compensating reticle, long-range target identification and precision marksmanship capability.

The two unique fields-of-view are easily and quickly interchanged by means of the patent-pending, locking lever mechanism on the side of the optical housing.

There is nothing wrong with the revolver but I have a few physical disabilities of my own which have arisen recently that hinder my operation of the weapon.  The revolver comes with fiber optic front sight and it has the 8 round capacity cylinder. MSRP from Ruger is a rather large $719.00 but I am willing to negotiate of course.  There is a set of LG 111 Crimson Trace Laser grips already installed on the revolver which adds $200.00 to MSRP.  The barrel length is 4.2” with a 1:16 RT hand twist.  The grips are standard rubber without the wooden inserts which reduces the price about $100.00 from MSRP.  
To enable you to start shooting right away I am including a free box of 375 rounds of .22lr CCI Standard Velocity in the total price.  Text (or call) me with an offer that we can use as a starting point.  I will require a signed Bill of sale.

The Rev 9 does not require proprietary tools for disassembly, ensuring that if lost, you can find the disassembly tool almost anywhere in the world.The Rev 9 is shipped in it's full size configuration with an included 1/2x28 booster piston on your 9mm pistol barrels. However the user can swap out the pistol booster assembly with Griffin Armament's integral 3 lug QD assembly if desired to run on MP5's, 9mm AR carbines or anything wearing a standard 3 lug adapter.The Rev 9 can also be configured into a short (K) configuration by removing the Stainless black oxide external booster housing extension and collapsing the booster housing or 3 lug assembly into the silencer tube. This configuration is best used wet. By adding 5cc's of rem oil, wire pulling gel, or some other ablative medium sound suppression can be dampened extremely well in the short configuration.The Rev 9 uses TiN coated 17-4PH frustoconical baffles with Griffin Armament's Return to Zero (RTZ) Geometry. The Return to Zero baffles key together so that every time you disassemble the silencer and put it back together you can achieve the same baffle orientation so that your point of impact shirt will remain the same negating the need to re-zero you carbine or pistol after servicing. (Applicable to full size configuration) The Titanium Nitride baffle coating increases wear resistance 5 times over an untreated stainless surface and improves cleaning efficiency.Piston IncludedSpecificationsDiameter1.375 inchesOverall Length7.6 inchesWeight11.2 ouncesMaterials 17-4PH Stainless Steel and 6061-T6 AluminumAttachment1/2x28 booster pistol or Griffin 3 Lug assemblyDB Attenuation34 dBFinishMil-Spec Type III Hardcoat Anodizing, Black Oxide, and Titanium NitrideFull Auto Rated Yes"

The Rev45 is also rated for 300 Black Subsonic with use of the Revolution Fixed barrel spacer (available separately).Most unique about this series, the Rev 45 can also be configured into a short (K) configuration by removing the stainless black oxide external booster housing extension and collapsing the booster housing or 3 lug assembly into the silencer tube. This configuration is best used wet. By adding 5cc's of rem oil, wire pulling gel, or some other ablative medium sound suppression can be dampened extremely well in the short configuration.Includes .578x28 PistonSpecificationsDiameter 1.375 inchesOverall Length8.2 inches Full size, 6.75 inches (K configuration)Weight12 ouncesMaterials 17-4PH Stainless Steel and 6061-T6 AluminumAttachmentRevolution booster piston or Griffin 3 Lug assembliesDB Attenuation28 dB Dry Full SizeFinishMil-Spec Type III Hardcoat Anodizing, Black Oxide, and Titanium NitrideFull Auto RatedYes"

I have about 250 rounds through this rifle. The rifle is in near-perfect condition and functions flawlessly. I have mostly used American Eagle 7.62x51 168 grain OTM ammo but have shot some Federal GMM 168 & 175 grain ammo as well. The rifle seems to get slightly better accuracy with the 175's, but overall it has been shooting about 1 MOA accuracy. The gas block is currently at setting 9 (0=closed 16=wide open) and is easily adjustable without removing the handrail. 

This is a very nice rifle and I am not all that thrilled about selling it but I just don't shoot it as often as thought I would and I could certainly use the cash.

This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor, help us design the perfect shop and select the correct tools and people for the job.  

The club will be touting a Gunsmith Shop capable of modern firearm Safety Checks or Civil War Era Restorations. This manager will be in charge of the Shop and the Firing Range. Due to possible lead exposure on the range, all Gunsmiths will be certified as RSO’s, and eventually sales staff can be certified as well. This will allow us to perform a staff rotation of one on, three off the range. Starting, the Shop Manager will lead 3 other Gunsmiths. As sales staff is certified, the Shop Manager will be able to include these personnel in the RSO schedule rotation.  
You will be responsible for bound book entries for firearm maintenance (I am exploring ebound book software), Shop staff scheduling, Shop staff training, advising executive management on prices for services (public pricing, and club member pricing), tool and supply purchases, proper disposal of spent shop supplies, creating estimates for service, budgeting, customer service, and other duties as assigned. The Shop counter will be equipped with a Point Of Sale system to charge for services, but the cash handling will be managed by the Pro Shop Manager. 

•	Experience as a Gunsmith is required. 
•	Pass a background check to be added to the FFL, required.
•	Experience as a shop manger preferred.
•	NRA Certifications preferred. (Pay increases with certifications)
•	Basic computer operation required. Please be able to use email, write estimate letters to customers, and create some spreadsheets in excel.  

I would expect the shop to be able to perform regular maintenance of firearms but also be able to perform more exotic services, like scroll work, stippling, grip reductions, etc. You don’t have to be able to perform all of this work yourself, but I expect you to be able to lead those who can and identify a job well done, or a job that’s just crap.

We will be an equal opportunity shop, so be comfortable working with men, women, and everything in between, and working with people who like the same or opposite sex.

Please send your resume and example photos of your work, if you have any to REDACTED. Please include a little bit about yourself."

This allows you to thread on a Wix 24003 or NAPA 4003 fuel filter directly onto the barrel. then you have your choice of endcaps, a solid one for use with push swabs, which will totally trap the solvent and smell, or the threaded hole one, which will allow you to pluck off regular patches and leave them in the filter. The hole is threaded on this cap with 1/2x28 threads, which allows you to replade the 3/4 NPT filter cap with this cap to install on a regular .223 / 5.56 AR15. this still leaves you with an open or closed end option for your favored patch type. A neat and convenient package to get you going on this much better cleaning solution.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding ""return-to-zero"" when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new Slim Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15 inch rail gives operators the option to have the support and extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is know to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail iron sights. The DDM4 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16 inch Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.Materials and ConstructionLower ReceiverMil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

NEW!,"Madison, Madison, Wisconsin",$ 685,"Listed On: Monday, November 30, 2015",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014."

I also have a ""hunting"" stock which is completely glass bedded and has 2 stainless steel rods in the forearm to stiffen up the plastic stock. The butt end is balanced with lead. The lead is removable but when you shoulder the rifle it feels very steady. It is spray painted for camouflage and is a designated hunting stock to be beat up. I have never taken it out hunting.

20 MOA rail torqued to the action. It has Leupold Mark 4 rings which are rock solid and retail for $100. I also have a Vortex Viper 6.5-20x scope with hunting caps on the turrets but you can still adjust it with your fingers as needed. It is a mildot scope with a transferable lifetime warranty.

Here is a piece of firearms history.  It is an German-made 1921-1924 Deutsche Werke Ortgeis 32 Auto / 7.65mm. This model was a common WWII era Finnish prison guard pistol, used in target competitions for it's accuracy, and known to be carried by outlaw John Dillenger.   For being over 90 years old, this gun is in GREAT working and consmetic condition.  I've fired over 150 rounds without any failures to feed, jams, or any issues whatsoever! I've disassembled and cleaned it thoroughly.  It's a rock solid piece and absolutely a BLAST to shoot. I can explain how to disassemble and clean and provide PDF manual and there are Youtube links to dis-assembly and cleaning.  It's not hard, but not quite as easy as modern pistols to take down.  It comes with an original magazine and an Uncle Mikes holster. I'll add 200 rounds of 32 Auto for a great day or two of fun at the range.  I can tell you the previous owner carried it as a personal backup throughout his enlisted time in Vietnam, so this gun has seen combat.
