The stock has been replaced with an enhanced stock which is much more versatile than the standard stock. 
The entire gun has been given a cerakote finish in coyote brown, in a much better tone than the factory coyote brown. One that matches much better with other coyote browns on the market, especially the limited edition Bushmaster coyote brown Magpul Pmags (shown in picture).
The barrel has been professionally cut and crowned, and a PWS muzzle brake has been pinned to bring the barrel to a 16.3"" length, making the gun much shorter and giving it a closer military carbine look.
Lastly, the trigger has also been smoothed out to give it a better pull than stock GI triggers.

Comes with 1 limited edition coyote brown Magpul Pmag and Magpul flip up sights.
Does NOT come with Eotech. The Eotech 553 can be included for an additional $300. 

Must meet at local gun store(s) for transfer."

The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar. The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed. The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer. The MKA 1919 comes with four 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal chokes. The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location. The manual safety also duplicates the M16 style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip. The top of the receiver has a carrying handle and integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or any optical accessories. The MKA 1919 12 gauge shotgun is appropriate for all levels of hunting and sporting enthusiasts.

I have an old West German Hawes Fire Arms Single Action 22lr Revolver here for sale. This was my uncles firearm as a boy and somehow my grandfather ended up with it. When he passed I inherited it. I went through it about a year ago and replaced a worn cylinder advance and some other parts. 

Cosmetically it has a black barrel, cylinder and body. The frame is gold with wood grips. The last inch of barrel on the left side has some scratches. There is a wear line on the cylinder and the hammer could use to be polished as it has some light surface corrosion. The frame plating is in good shape and the wood grips are perfect. 

I will also be including a hunter branded holster and child's gun belt for it. Brown/red leather. 

Trying to figure out value on this thing is near impossible as I almost never see one. I did find this link from 2011 where an all black model in better shape sold for $239 at auction: http://www.gunauction.com/buy/10680924

From Rider Magazine: ""What we have with the FZ6 is a legitimate middleweight standard with the versatility to keep experienced tourers entertained and the simplicity to keep the newer rider from getting in over his or her head. Despite our minor gripes, the engine is fit for the job and the adequate suspension is actually a good learning tool for being smooth. Throw in the quality brakes and all the provisions for luggage and you get a bike that’s a welcome tribute to the versatile way things used to be. Sometimes the old ways are the best ways.""

Other info: Nice example of a rare FN 1922 Turkish Contract. The Turkish guns were produced in 1939 and taken by the Germans before WWII. This one has been nickel plated after production. A lot of these were plated in the 40's and 50's. A little flaking around the muzzle. Beautiful gun...I've fired about 20 rounds through it, no problems.

The price has been lowered $200 due to a blemish and also marks from hunting. THE BLEMISH: At one time the gun had a ghost ring gun sight. When removing it, we found scratches in the grove on top of the receiver. To remove the blemish, about two inches of the grove was ground. But the grinding did not go as deep as the original flutes in the top of the receiver, so as not to compromise the strength. That two inch ground area was then cold blued, (rather than re-plating the whole receiver). See photos of cold bluing and grinding before cold blue. So this is not a “show-case” gun. It’s a fancy custom 1100 that has been used for hunting. The name WILLIAMS is stamped onto the lower right side of the receiver. WILLIAMS is the name of the gunsmith who honed and polished the slides, accurized the trigger and polished the barrel and receiver for plating. It is nickel plated with a matte stainless finish, inside and outside. The barrel is a 21’ Special Field barrel which was fitted with choke tubes by www.briley.com. Their chokes are longer and more gradually tapered than most, (and expensive). It has two chokes, Improved Cylinder and X-Full. It has a custom Monte Carlo stock which shows signs of hunting use, (dents that did not break the finish as a scratch). On the left side of the butt stock at the top of the white spacer, the recoil pad was ground thru and exposes about one inch of aluminum. It is high grade solid Missouri walnut. Original forearm is included with purchase. WILL SHIP FOR $59 TO COVER FFL HANDLING AND ACTUAL SHIPPING COSTS. Three day inspection return policy, but you pay FFL, shipping and 15% restock. (That's what most dealers charge) NRA LIFE MEMBER."
