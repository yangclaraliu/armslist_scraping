The strobe mode works perfectly and is very disorting if you're on the receiving end. The holster fits well, draws easily and is just past break-in. The pistol has been cerakoted zombie green and graphite gray, the finish is about two years old and is functional but not beautiful. The pistol also comes with five magazines, (4) ten round and (1) 14 round, and the original box with all the goodies. I am asking for $650 cash.

I'm in the process of refinishing this pistol right now, I will update the post and pictures when it is done."

I got this in trade to use the lower on an older colt slide build but decided I like the stainless that is currently fit to it better. And really, who needs 5 full size Colts. I am not picky about trades, but am only interested in nice or interesting guns and can add or accept cash to make the deal. These were reissued military serials from WWI, and the 278XXX prefix relates to a 1912 original date. I removed the miserable plastic MSH and added an EGW magwell housing, but can replace with the plastic and lower the price to $800 (The plastic magwell will be included if you decide on the EGW). It also has had trigger work, with a very very nice, crisp trigger at about 4.5 lbs (professionally done). Comes with 2 magazines but no box. This actually has better fit and finish than either my mid 2000 production Gold Cup Trophy or Delta Elite. This is an 80's series gun, but I can remove the apparatus if you prefer the 70's series trigger.
I am looking for other Colts, Sigs, railed 1911's, Pistol Caliber rifles and uppers, Higher end target uppers or Pistol uppers in 300 blackout or AR10's. No interest in AKs unless the trade is way heavy in my favor. I have a new Bushmaster lower that can be included if we decide to trade for a complete rifle of higher value, however it is not available for sale (i.e. dont message me asking to buy it). I will include original slim black grips and either the Parachymer finger grooves or an original Delta Elite grip with medallion."

Has all the features of a classic S&W revolver like a pinned barrel, hammer mounted firing pin, pre MIM parts and of course its pre lock. The 2"" barrel paired to the round butt frame is one of the desirable less common pairings most are on a square butt frame. Was rated in its day for beyond the modern equivalent of +P. Comes with a HKS speed loader and a 40rd box of Remington SJHP. Makes a great addtion if your a collector or it still makes a perfect EDC option. Only trading because I have a couple other medium size 38s I have more of a sentimental attachment to and want something else. Would prefer to trade but might sell. Transfer on EFA10 or at a FFL.

CV joint knocks when you take a hard left, there was a toggle switch installed for the heat and AC. front windows won't always roll back up...they roll down but half the time won't go back up. There are small dents and a scrape on the passenger side, 2 or 3 small rust spots, the paint isn't perfect but not bad all around, the front driver's side wheel cover is missing, driver's side head light is out, needs a couple tires,

but it runs quietly and drives real smooth.

I put a brand new battery in it right before my wife decided to buy a different car. it's got cruise control, power windows, power door locks, power steering, steering wheel cover, tilt wheel, dual air bags, am/fm with cassette deck, very clean interior, she's always taken very good care of it.

I'm not a mechanic so I can't tell you everything it needs but feel free to come inspect it before making an offer. I'm honest and negotiable and will disclose everything we know about it.

I naively purchased this weapon sight unseen, with a strong regard for a Stainless Steel construction (I believe this to be the 1st time Desert Eagle available in Stainless Steel construction) also with a Muzzle Brake Integrated into the design and manufacture of the pistol.

While the Integrated Muzzle Brake promises to offer substantial weapon control to a gimpy old fart with loose of strength and muscle mass, I was not prepared for the “shock and awe” when this little hummer arrived, and the gun case was opened for the first time.  This was a couple of clicks from a cardiac moment for me!  in my view, this is a large weapon…

This pistol remains unfired and has only been mauled and groped by an unbelieving buyer.

I have decided to purchase some hot loads for and to remain faithful to my trusty Left Handed Randall 45 Caliber 1911A1 and to sell the Desert Eagle, .50 AE Caliber Hand Cannon with all of the extras thrown in!

Shipping expenses will be paid by the buyer at my cost and I can deliver face to face to a Texas buyer with a Texas DL or ship to an FFL agent of your choosing.  I’ve got to tell you that I am not anxious to meet up with a shady character in a dark alley on a cold rainy night.  I’m going to avoid that scenario like the plague!

I have fired a box of shells through it and it performs fine.  There is also an old redfield micrometer aperture sight on the back that also works. I have more pictures available.

I used this gun when taking a long range class and could bang steel MOA targets consistently out to 800 yards. When we chrono’d the gun with Dallas Reloads 168gr AMax bulk loads we were getting an average of 2510 FPS out of 10 shots. Not bad for a shorty 16” barrel. All of my dope data will be included with the gun from 200 out to 800 yards for what MIL holds to use. It is also taped on the stock. Everything in pictures will be included in sale except bipod, suppressor, and suppressor mount. The suppressor mount will be replaced with a competition muzzle brake. I have changed the stock Magpul ACS-L stock to a long range fully adjustable Luth-AR MBA stock. It is adjustable for length of pull and comb. The gun comes with the rifle buffer tube, spring and buffer installed with the Luth-AR stock, but will also come with the carbine buffer tube, spring and buffer so you can switch it to a collapsible stock if you want. Any AR15 milspec butt stock will work.
