 Here is the rest of the story... 
 This pistol started life as an Argentine Systema Model 1927 in ,45 ACP. Built under Colt contract and under Colt supervision in 1953. Converted to .22LR by Ventunini (an Argentine company) in the 1960s for use as a training pistol for the Buenos Aires Police Dept. These pistols were refinished after the conversion, with little or no regard to the outer condition of the base pistol. Their very nice black oxide finish was applied right over the existing pitting.  This pistol retains about 100% of that arsenal refinish. The Blue Book rates this pistol with all of them being refinished, because that it the only way that they came... None had the original DGFM finish.  This pistol has no import mark because it came into this country in private hands. All numbers are matching including the slide ( right side and top ) , Right side of the frame, under the mainspring housing, on the bottom of the floating chamber, and on the specially made magazine.  The lower frame has not been altered in any way. A .45 slide,  barrel, magazine and recoil spring and you have a .45 again !! The floating chamber works just like the Colt Service Model , and the Conversion units. The grips look like the originals, but are actually modern day replacements . All other parts are original to the pistol. This pistol is very rare in this country, but you can read all about it in the 1911 FORUM and other places on line. Thanks for looking."

As pictured, the stock has a Graco adjustable butt plate for length of pull (LOP) from 12 1/4"" to 15 1/4"", cant, and height/drop with the factory Kimber butt pad. The stock was chemically stripped (not sanded down) and refinished with over 20 coats of hand-rubbed Danish oil. No poly, varnish, shellac, or other top coat. Repairs, if needed, will be simple with products you buy at Home Depot. Additional custom parts include a milled aluminum trigger guard, and the scope blocks have been removed and plugged with the correct blued screws. (They are included if you want to put them back on.) There are enough extra blued screws to remove the front sights and make the rifle completely slick for scope use. There are two Graco butt plate extensions, both are milled out for the included Graco 8 oz mercury weight insert for the butt extension tube to allow you change the center of gravity to match your shooting style. All the factory parts are included if you wish to reinstall them and return the rifle to factory specs. No modifications to any of the factory metal work or the stock were made (other than the butt plate extension tube bore hole). All the Kimber factory paperwork and the factory boxes are included. Sale includes is a new Jensen's deluxe leather cuff sling with a quick release and a new Creedmoor leather/rubber open finger shooters glove (XL) (left glove for right handed shooters). This rifle is unfired and in beautiful condition. It was purchased and customized in the hopes a grandchild would take up junior NRA four-position competition but that isn't going to happen. Over 80 hours have gone into the stock and custom metal work. My loss is your gain. If you see this gun in person you will recognized the extreme attention to detail and superior craftsmanship that make this rifle a true work of art. It needs nothing. Price is $1100 cash (firm) or trades as shown below. NV ID required for local sale."

This gun was recently several months ago and used (fired) about 150 times.  I am not using this and wish to sell (sorry-no trades).  

This LC9's Pro is in excellent condition and comes with original Ruger Box, Warranty Card, Instruction Manual and (2) magazines.

The new Ruger LC9s Pro is virtually identical to the LC9s in appearance and function, with a few key differences. The new Pro model is offered without a thumb-operated manual safety lever or a magazine disconnect safety.

The absence of the external safety allows the shooter to engage targets during high-stress scenarios when there may not be time to deactivate a manual safety. Likewise, the removal of the magazine disconnect benefits tactical reloads and permits the user to fire with one round in the chamber and the magazine removed.

I purchased this rifle new and had the telescoping buttstock (manufactured by ACE) professionally installed and the instalation is very clean with no scuffs or scratches. I shoot it on very rare occasions and about 75 rounds total have been fired through it and I clean it after every use and is meticulously taken care of. I use Hornady Superformance 308 150-165gr ammo and I have tried 308 Winchester ammo and have noticed that the rifle performs much better with the Superformance ammo. I have 20 rounds of Hornady 150gr and 20 rounds of 165gr and 15 rounds of 308 Winchester ammo that will be accompanying the sale of the rifle. I also have the OE pistol grip and buttstock with the adjustable/interchangeable recoil pads and cheek pads, hard case, two 10 round magazines and two 20 round magazines, bipod, and owners manual. The scope is a Nikon Monarch 4x-16x 42mm BDC (Bullet Drop Compensator) with 4 inches of eye relief attached by a DNZ one piece scope mount. The reason I am selling it is because I dont shoot it that often and would like to get something different. I am asking $1600 OBO and will be open to some trades like the Rock River Arms LAR47 or well made AK 47 and ammo. I am also interested in the 5 inch STI Edge or Tactical 2011 in 40 S&W.
