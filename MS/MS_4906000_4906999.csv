AR-10 variants have long held an important place on the battlefield as special-purpose rifles for designated marksmen. DPMS Panther Arms and the AR-15 platform has been leading a new resurgence in the tactical use of the 7.62X51 NATO round with its Long Range 308 line. The LR-308 is one of DPMS’ most popular rifles due to its compact size, rugged military carbine features and .308 firepower. Side-by-side the LR-308 and the M4 may look almost identical, but inside the LR-308 is a powerhouse with comparatively larger barrel, bolt and BCG.

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility. In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years.

Info from RWS website:

 The RWS 460 Magnum utilizes an under-lever cocking mechanism that provides superior leverage when cocking the airgun, resulting in less cocking effort than other spring guns. The 460 offers magnum velocities of 1250 fps in .177 and 1000 fps in .22. With an easy to use top-side loading port, micro adjustable sights, fixed rifled barrel, an 11 mm scope rail, and a classic American Sporter stock with rubber butt pad, the 460 magnum delivers the performance, power, and grace expected from an RWS rifle."

Got good quality stuff from e-bay and started loading it. Did not like the way the parts fit so customized it in my machine shop.
The laser bright and the highest output I could find, it is pressure turned on when you grip the pistol stock and is in the rear area instead of the front.
The illuminated crosshair sight is tucked in nicely next to the laser and is a natural alaignment with your eye.
Metal cased flashlight on the nose that works well in the dark on targets.
6 clip side shell holder.
Leather hand grip on the slide feels real secure and steadies the aim when running slugs.
Mounted a delrin custom machined nose which extends past the barrel so you can store it muzzle down Rubber pads so when you lay it down , the sights do not touch the table.
Adjustable shoulder strap on swivels.
Adjustable stock with standard rubber shoulder pad.
Back - up flip sights front and rear.
Extra batteries for sights and allen keys store in grip handle base.

Why am I selling it. I am a small framed guy and with all the gizzmos it's a bit heavy for me to swing in the house ( home defence use ) A larger set guy or for general all use hunting it's good to go.
Only about maybe 50 rounds have gone through it.
weighs 9 1/2 lbs with 11 shells ( 5 in  gun, 6 on clip )
Come with +/-200 rounds of mixed, slugs, buck and bird shot

This thing is seriously cool.
Perfect shape, better in person.
Many of the parts are custom machined to fit the best way.
Have all the origional stock parts if you want to go duck hunting.
Shoots perfect from the hip with the green laser beam sight.
I have many more pictures with good detail I can forward.
Nice piece of work that was fun to build.

This is an absolutely unbelievable rifle. I know that the price is high for an AR15, but it is 1 of 10 and he never plans on making more. If you don't believe me that this rifle is worth it, we can meet at a range and shoot it--you will be convinced. He has 1 of them left for himself, and a couple of his coworkers/friends have them. Then a few of them are owned by professional 3-gun shooters. Everything on this rifle was hand-selected and is the best (or close to) choice. It will come with the Dueck Defense angled sights ($150ish). I'm only posting this rifle because I am looking to acquire a lightweight hunting rifle (Listed in trades). I want $2500.00 OBO for this rifle and am willing to ship to most states."

I bought it in May of 2008 at the El Cajon Gun Exchange, while I was stationed as a Marine at MCAS Miramar. I have put maybe 50 rounds through it since. It has been totally worked over in true McCoy fashion with full glass bedding and also has a Globe front sight conversion kit with interchangeable reticles. I will also include around 20 clips and an ammo belt. I will also throw in a very solid and fairly clean bayonet if I get my full asking price. It also has a full proper cleaning kit in the stock. As goes for California gun laws, this is about the best piece you can own for defense purposes, especially with all the turmoil going on these days. This is a top quality select grade competition rifle. You know what I have and therefore the price reflects as such. I may negotiate the price a little, but I am only selling due to a financial crisis. I live back home in Illinois now and will plan on shipping it back to the El Cajon Gun Exchange for pick up.

9mm is great for new shooters and teaching and is just pretty fun, no recoil and ammo cost is a good bit lower than .223.

There is some scratching on the gun from me practicing quick draw and holstering the gun over and over(watched Tombstone and became obsessed). So it is in fair condition I would say. I have fired around 200 rounds through it. 

With all this being said, I will be honest and say that after firing, you have to use the ""ejector"" pretty tough to get the empty shells out, It has been like that since day 1(a common problem with lower end revolvers), and may just need to be broken in. (I have tried many other revolvers and some slide out as smooth as butter, but I have a tough time with this one.)

Interested in trades, or trade + cash for the right gun(very interested in a Taurus PT-111, but can buy them new at Bass pro for $220) (lower end pistols preferably, Hi point and Diamondback come to mind. ) .380, or 9mm.

Turret-style windage and elevation adjustments
Designed for long-range performance
Optimal lens coatings for exceptional clarity and definition
Precise tool-free adjustment
One of the most advanced optical systems in the industry. Multicoat 4® or Index Matched Lens System™ coatings result in exceptional clarity and definition for optimal viewing. Target-style 1/4-MOA click adjustment windage and elevation dials on all but the LRPR models make these scopes easily adaptable to any shooting application – particularly long-range conditions. The LRM1 scope models have Leupold’s PR (Precision Rifle) finger-adjustable turret knobs. The PR knobs offer the advantages of the adjustable windage and elevation, but at a lesser cost. An all-matte finish including the objective ring provide a subdued look that is less visible to game. Each is nitrogen-filled and sealed using Leupold’s proven process to seal out moisture. Most importantly, these scopes truly deliver all the ruggedness and dependability that you expect from Leupold. Comes standard with flip-up lens cover. Backed by Leupold’s full lifetime warranty. Made in USA.

It has the really nice Glock recoil spring w/3 springs installed on later models.  No other stuff available including ammo.

Its the Gen 3 SF (short frame) version that is similar to the Glock Gen4 reach to trigger using no insert.  From a lot of reading it seems the Gen3's are held in high regard for their ability to handle the hot ammo like Underwood better than the Gen4's.
