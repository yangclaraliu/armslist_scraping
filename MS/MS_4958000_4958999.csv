It is a 16"" carbine with gray Magpul furniture, including an MOE+ pistol grip, MLOK handguard with vertical grip, MOE buttstock, Magpul ambi sling mount, Magpul enhanced trigger guard, and MBUS rear flip up sight. The rifle has a nickel boron coated bolt carrier group (photo below) and includes the mounted Streamlight TLR-1 HPL weapon light, Vortex Strikefire 2 red/green dot optic, and a 200mw green laser, which is much more powerful than any laser you will find locally. It can easily be seen at 200 yards in broad daylight. The rifle also has the BCM Gunfighter charging handle. I will include a Pmag. I think my asking price is fair. I have a ton of money in this gun. The MSRP on this gun without the nickel boron BCG and other extras is $1,300 (https://www.bushmaster.com/firearms/MOE_series.asp). Now, obviously you can find them cheaper. They run right around $1,000 online, but I am including at least $800 in extras. Just to give you an idea of the value here, I will break down the money I have in the gun:

Vortex Strikefire 2 - $180
TLR-1 Streamlight - $120
BCM Gunfighter charging handle - $50
Nickel boron BCG - $200
200mw green laser - $100
Magpul furniture - $150

So as you can see, I'm losing money here. The gun has maybe 200 rounds through it. It is sighted in at about 100 yards. The laser, red dot, and iron sights all co-witness. The gun is in perfect condition. It has mostly just sat in my closet. I would do $1,000 for the gun without the optic, light, laser, and Pmag. I can meet anywhere in the Clarksville or Nashville area. Text REDACTED"

If you are a serious buyer, I am happy to meet you anywhere in/near Portland, and I can also get pictures of all the extra goodies that come with it.




Price is firm; I'm only, ONLY, selling this because my kids need Christmas gifts. If it were not for my kids, I would never ever let this rifle go. Certainly not at $100 less than I bought it for. I've had this rifle for years, never failed me in any way. It's an absolutely gorgeous rifle, and the slightly shorter variant means it's much easier to walk the woods with your rifle, as opposed to a full-size Mosin. I am a veteran Mosin collector, this rifle has been cleaned thoroughly every time it's been taken out, and spends its idle days in my humidity-controlled safe. You won't find a nicer 53 in the entire city of Portland, likely not even in Oregon.



I also have for sale some other firearms and random goodies, great for Christmas gifts(just not for kids):
-Hawken Rifle, .50 CAL, w/ TONS of goodies
-1911 Rock Island, .45ACP, w/ Goodies
-Ammunition
-Patron Collector's Set(Two types of Tequila, plus glasses)
-Wireless Canon Printer(great for the worker in your life)
-MRE's by the crate(discounted for quick sale!)
-Warhammer(Every 12-year old boy's Christmas dream)
-Medieval weapons(no replicas or display weapons here, only perfectly reproduced copies of originals, down to the type of steel used).



Email me ASAP; last time I sold one of these it was snatched up in a matter of hours. This is the ultimate deer-hunting rifle, and can easily take down bears of all sizes as well. Ammunition provided is armor-piercing and will put down anything you need it to. Plus, nothing says 'home defense' like an 8-inch spiked bayonet! It's a foolish robber that takes on a Mosin-armed man."

CMMG is top quality and is very accurate.  Was going to be my 3 gun AR since how smooth the trigger is and how accurate it is but I don't 3 gun as much as I thought.  Maybe 200-300 rounds through it.

Has a round hand guard for comfort, Easy Pull Ambidextrous Charging Handle, and color filled Lettering (serial number is not color filled so it is not easy to see)

A new Mod4's are $1000 without upgrades. (this one just has a few)

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art."

Purchased in 9mm (model 99104), the PF can be converted to .22, .40, 10mm and .45 with a conversion slide --even to a compact length (see link below -but don't purchase from EAA --too expensive). The pistol has a 4.5"" barrel with rail, and comes with a single 17 round magazine. Gun is DA/SA. Sale includes factory box, rods/lock and instructions. It's been to the range on two occasions. The pistol is in excellent condition, shoots great. Purchased it for daughter who now wants a smaller compact model (less rounds/smaller barrel).  Note: the grip on this full size feels great even for a small hand.
I have owned many Witness models. They are excellent pistols, Italian made by Tanfoglio and modeled on the CZ 75 design. The rail rides inside the frame (as opposed to outside like the Glocks and S&W) for more control and less recoil. I wouldn't mind keeping, except I have enough 9mms. This one is priced to sell quick. Buyer must be FL resident; possess a CWP and sign bill of sale. May be willing to travel short distance to conduct the sale. Thanks for looking. Text any questions to Two Three 9 Eight 2 Three One Eight One One.

It is designed to be used with both eyes open, providing the operator with maximum situational awareness.

The large aperture and tapered light path maximizes the viewing area in such a small optic, allowing for fast target engagement – especially from non-standard shooting positions. Advanced lens coatings and electronics produce a crisp red dot.

The brightness control dial on the MRO is specifically designed for ambidextrous usage. With a mid-adjustment “off” position and eight discernible brightness settings, this brightness dial allows for quick and ergonomic adjustments.

The MRO features fully protected adjusters that maintain zero even during rough handling, and can be adjusted without the need for special tools.

Cold Hammer Forging of barrels has been known for decades to produce the most accurate, longest lasting rifle barrels obtainable. The Cold Hammer Forging of barrels is accomplished through intense hydraulic pressure applied at opposing angles by carbide steel hammers. During the hammering process, a mandrel is inserted into the bore while the carbide steel hammers shape the barrel around the mandrel creating the chamber, the lands, and the grooves. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, the Cold Hammer Forging process creates a defect free bore and the most consistent chamber possible. All Daniel Defense barrels are made from start to finish in a state-of-the-art facility located in Black Creek, GA. In keeping with their heritage of not cutting corners, all barrels feature a forged chamber, chrome lining, and heavy phosphate exterior coating. These barrels will prove themselves to be more accurate and last longer than a barrel that has cut or button rifling.selling at cost.REDACTED. WaltPs.

This is the law enforcement or military (depends on the catalog you look at) model. What that means is night sights, and three magazines instead of regular sights and two mags that you get with the base model. It has a STD 1913 accessory rail instead of the H&K proprietary rail on the USP models which means more accessory options and no adapter plate.Comes with three different sets of grip panels and backstraps to accommodate different size paws. I also have a Streamlight TLR-3 weapons light, that I will throw in for an additional $75.

Model 99
Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy.

The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain.

Model 99 in action
The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is virtually maintenance-free and the bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on.

Like new, Includes Bushnell Elite 3200 Tactical Rifle Scope 10x 40mm 1/10 Mil Adjustments Mil-Dot Reticle Matte. 30 rnds of xm33 660 grn fmj, 20 rnds of PMC Bronze 660 grn fmj, 7 rnds of Hornady A-Max 750 grn silver tip, and 12 misc 700 grn loose rounds.

 Great shooter or collector. 
Very clean. 

Advertised with the slogan ""Ten shots quick!"", the Model 1907 was very popular because, despite its small size, it had a 10 round double-stack magazine. The advertising included a number of early celebrity endorsers, including William ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody, Bat Masterson, and the Pinkerton Agency. Teddy Roosevelt was even presented with a Model 1907. Much of the advertising in the popular press played on the ability of an otherwise defenseless woman to use the Savage to subdue burglars and ""tramps."""

This is a very well cared for gun that is in overall excellent condition.  It has been carefully used and is not dead mint, but it is a gun you will be proud of, while saving hundreds over a new gun.

The gun has a 1"" Pachmayr Decelerator recoil pad. Stock length is approximately 14 inches.  Aside from the recoil pad there have been no modifications.

Bluing and metal are about 95%.  The main wear is on the bottom of the receiver where it was carried.   There is a slender scratch in the blueing  (not the metal) ahead of the forearm where it was removed during cleaning.   The screws are perfect.

Wood and checkering are also about 95%.  There are a few small dents and handling marks in the wood from normal use. There are no cracks in the forearm or stock, there are no chips missing.

It shoots very well and is probably capable of 2 MOA or so but I'm not that good of a shot with the irons on this rifle.  The wood is in great condition, the bore is good as well.  There is very little pitting on it and a tad of surface rust but nothing in places where it matters.  I have always kept it clean, oiled, and the stock has been waxed.  I've seen a number of 1916 Spanish Mausers and this one is definitely on the good end of the spectrum-not pristine-but better than 80% of the other ones I've seen.  It's a great shooter, wall hanger, and piece of history.  

I am interested in trades for other military surplus/historical firearms.  I like old mausers in 7x57 and 6.5 Swedish.
