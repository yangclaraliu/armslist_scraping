I've seen it cut into sections and then used as see through flooring.

Lexan glass comes in several thicknesses and this is the thickest they make at almost two inches thick. Should stop most handgun and rifle rounds. I've seen lots of youtube videos of guys shooting this and the only handgun round that penetrated was the 5.7mm x 28mm armor piercing round.

The sheet has two smaller circular holes cut in the middle which were the voice ports for the bank window.

It is very heavy and will take two people and a pickup truck to move.

It reads multi on the lower instead of 223/556 so people cant prove it is a class 3 weapon.

Being externally and internally quite similar to its predecessor, the CZ-999 nevertheless has some interesting features. First, it has a selectable mode trigger system, with two modes of fire, Pistol and Revolver. In Pistol mode, first shot can be made either in Single action (hammer is cocked manually before shot) or in Double action (hammer is lowered, and then cocked via the long pull of the trigger). All subsequent shots are made in Single action mode, unless hammer is lowered manually by the decocker lever. In Revolver mode, hammer still can be cocked manually, but it is lowered automatically after each shot, so each subsequent shot is made in Double Action mode, unless hammer is cocked manually. Another interesting feature is the ""ammunition supply is low"" indicator. This indicator is made in the form of the pin, which protrudes from the grip into shooter's palm when only three or less rounds are left in the magazine. The grip shape also is slightly improved when compared to CZ-99.The CZ-999 is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. Barrel is locked to the slide by single large lug, which engages the ejection port. The Browning-type cam system is used to lock and unlock the barrel from the slide. Frame is made from aluminum alloy, slide is stamped from sheet steel, with separate steel breech block insert, fixed by the cross pin. Double action trigger system, with external hammer, has an automatic firing pin safety, and ambidextrous decocker levers, on both sides of the grip frame. The decocker levers also operate the slide stop, reducing the number of manual controls. Pistol is also equipped with loaded chamber indicator. The trigger mode selector switch is located at the top left side of the slide, and marked with letters ""P"" (Pistol mode) and ""R"" (Revolver mode). Standard sights are of fixed variety, with white dot inserts, and both sights are dovetailed into the slide."

 .308 /7.62x51
Made by Zastava, model M70. 
Purchased NEW in 2013.
This is NOT a sporterized military rifle.

This rifle is identical to the Remington 798, Parker-Hale 1200, and Intersrms Mark X.. Zastava actually manufactured the receivers for all of those rifles. 
Typical mauser awesomeness- claw extractor, recoil lug machined into receiver body, controlled feed, hinged floorplate on milled steel trigger guard/bottom metal. Hammer-forged barrel.

Shoots well under MOA with good ammo.

The walnut stock has been free-floated and glass bedded to the action. A complete trigger job was performed, trigger breaks around 2.5 lb, perfect for hunting and very safe.

The bluing is phenomenal on this rifle. The stock has a couple small dings from falling over in the safe but looks very good. The scope pictured is not included, but I will include a 4-16x50mm scope. Leupold one piece base and rings included.

I will also include some ammo if interested, I have several types available.

Other info: This is a Huldra (Adams Arms) 5.45/39 Piston upper on Spikes Tactical lower. This gun has 150 rounds down the tube and has barely been broken in. This was cleaned immediately after the two range trips it has been on and has been stored in a padded bag. I have had zero problems with this gun and the two times I have taken her out she has performed flawlessly. Huldra's are extremely hard to come by in California as the company will no longer ship into the state. The gun has full Magpul furniture on it. It comes with an STR stock, Moe hand guard, Moe grip, Moe foregrip, bad lever, lwrc trigger guard, and Mbus sights. The piston system on this gun is amazing, it keeps it very clean and runs very cool. Here are the specs from the factory on the upper.

This tiny and light blowback-system pistol gives you the reliability and quality you expect from Beretta in an ultra-concealable, easy-to-use package. 
The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber without racking the slide. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by giving an easy and absolutely safe way to check the bore and and remove a live cartridge. Jamming and stove-piping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design.

Keeping an eye on uncompromising quality helps keep Beretta small caliber semi-automatics ahead of the pack. Beretta pistols in the 21 Series utilize a tough forging process for their barrels, while slides are fashioned from solid steel bar stock--and frames from solid aluminum forgings. 

This pistol is in great condition, it's maybe had ~150 rounds through it.

I have 4 boxes of CCI Stingers 22LR I will throw in to sweeten the deal!

Co. Projector-Pyrotechnic Hand M-9 This projector developed by the Eureka Vacuum Cleaner Co. in 1942 was to overcome the deficiencies of 10 gauge signals in ground to air signaling as noted by the U.S. Army Infantry Board. Originally authorized as standard with the designation M5, this designation was changed to M-9 in November 1942, to avoid confusion with the type of ammunition it used. The M-9 projector consists of a short barrel with a hinged breech which houses the firing mechanism. The breech is secured to the barrel with a latch. The latch houses a spring actuated plunger assembly which serves to lock the latch to the barrel and thus keeps the breech closed. The ejector is operated by opening the breech. The safety is a spring attached to a chain to the latch pin. The firing pin is held in the retracted position by a ""U"" shaped spring which is positioned around the firing pin. The M-9 uses both the rimless types of flares and signals AN/M-28 through 36, and the rimmed types AN/M37 through M45. Note: The preceding description kindly copied from Robert M. Gaynor's fine book ""Flare Guns & Signal Pistols"". This flare gun is in very good condition.

This gun has less than 500 rounds. It is sooo fun to shoot, no recoil at all compared to a 1911. I want to invest in 9mm and say goodbye to 45, I will miss this gun but 9mm is more practical for me.

Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock-resistant design.

In 1961, Miroku and Winchester formed a new company named Olin-Kodensha Limited.
Miroku made the Browning Citori. The Citori and the Winchester 101 are virtually the same 
gun.
Aficionados of Winchester® shotguns know well the Model 101. The styling and handling are legendary, the reliability never in question.
The Model 101 has long had a reputation for strength and durability, and like mine, many built in the 1960s are still in service. Many think the 1964 production year the best ever made. I have checked nation wide and this price is in line with others out there. I had this site taken down because someone thought the price was too high. If you think the price is too high, then don't buy it."

The bore is bright and shiny, and it is in perfect mechanical condition. (And fully functional; I have fired it.) The frame and slide have matching serial numbers. The frame, slide, and barrel have the Eagle N proof marks. There are no import marks on the gun! Cosmetically, I would rate the gun at 85 – 90%, due to some honest wear (but no rust).

In 1961, Miroku and Winchester formed a new company named Olin-Kodensha Limited.
Miroku also made the Browning Citori. The Citori and the Winchester 101 are virtually the same
gun.
Aficionados of Winchester® shotguns know well the Model 101. The styling and handling are legendary, the reliability never in question.
The Model 101 has long had a reputation for strength and durability, and like mine, many built in the 1960s are still in service. Many think the 1964 production year the best ever made. I have checked ARMSLIST nation wide and this is a fair price, willing to entertain offers. Gun is in excellent condition. Have more pictures on request."

I have started a new Cerakote company, I can coat your FIREARMS, KNIVES, CAR PARTS HEADERS, PISTONS, EXHAUST. MOTORCYCLES PARTS, FLASHLIGHTS, SUN GLASSES. Basically if you can think of it then we can more than likely coat it. Cerakote is a ceramic based finish that can be applied to metals, plastics, polymers and wood. The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the forefront of the ceramic coatings market. Cerakote ceramic coatings utilize state-of-the-art technology to out-perform any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications.
