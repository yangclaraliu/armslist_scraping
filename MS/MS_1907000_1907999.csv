I put a Redfield Revenge 4-12x44 on it, the Caldwell bipod, 4 AR mags, 73 rounds of Hornady .223 REM 52 gr BTHP(which is what i found to work best for accuracy) and 50 rounds of .223 FMJ. I took exceptional care of this firearm but now i want to start a new project with it. AS i mentioned about accuracy, I put 4 shots under a penny at 200 yards. i think thats fairly good, but then again im no expert. 3 of the 4 mags work fine, 2 of the 4 work best, the one that doesnt work might need a new spring, but again....no expert. not a mark on the stock anywhere, not a spot of rust anywhere either. will sell altogether, will not spread out ammo, not interested in trades. I have original box and papers, will let go for $700 OBO. Ive seen this rifle go for 6-800 dollars new. as i have only fired less than 100 rounds through it, i still condsider it new.

This gun is in showroom condition with no blemishes or scratches anywhere. This gun has never been carried and has been a ‘Safe Queen’ all of it’s life. This gun was born right here in the USA with a manufacturers date of: April 15, 2013. It is positively like new with only 50 rounds fired through it for break in purposes.  Prior to break in the weapon was fully cleaned and lubed (including the barrel interior) with ‘Mil-Comm TW-25b” military grade synthetic lubricant (This is the same lube used by the US military and is also the lube recommended by Sig Sauer for all their weapons). The handgun was properly broken in using factory ammo (not re-loads) by firing 10 rounds then allowing for a cool down period then fired 10 more times until the quantity of 50 was reached. During the 50 rounds fired the gun performed beautifully. The FNX-9 shot accurately and did not have a single failure to load, fire, or to eject. The balance on this gun is superb and the sights are easy to see. I found the double action trigger to be very smooth and the single action was crisp and predictable. This gun is a pleasure to shoot! 

The FNX-9 has all of the ‘Goodies’ you could possibly want; accessory rail, lightweight polymer frame with replaceable metal slides, nickel coated stainless steel upper, SA/DA, ½ cock position, de-cocking lever, ambidextrous safety, de-cocking lever, slide lock, and magazine eject button. The gun even has easy ‘one lever’ breakdown for cleaning and disassembly. 

I hate that I have to part with my FNX-9 but my loss is your gain. I am asking $550.00 firm. The FNX-9 comes complete with the factory case, owners manual, original Test Fire cartridge, safety padlock, backstraps, and 3 – 17 round magazines (all items that were originally included when purchased). I will sell only to state of Alabama resident with valid CCW permit. Must sign Bill of Sale. I desire face to face cash sale or I am willing to trade up for Beretta CX4 Storm rifle in 9mm. Please reply to this email or you may call or text me at:  (205) eight, three, five, - 5850. I am located in the Birmingham area.

The KSI we have in stock now is pre-owned, and unfortunately has a magazine issue that makes the pistol a single shot at the moment. I am unsure as to whether or not a traditional Browning Hi-Power magazine would work in the KSI or not (any input on that would be great, just email us!), but we do have a magazine with, it needs a follower. This would make a great project gun for the budding gunsmith!

Picked it up as an impulse buy at a show and really don't have the time or motivation to learn to compete in NRA Conventional Pistol. I've put in around 200 rounds and have attached pictures of a couple of targets. (5 shot was 25 yds from a sandbag rest and 10 shot was 25 yds standing, off-hand). Both targets were using cheap Remington Standard Velocity and not match ammo. From a machine rest, I have no doubts there would be a single hole from 25yds. Judging from the brass deflector after shooting it once, this gun may have not been fired by the previous owner - though I couldn't guarantee that. 

Since purchasing it, I have cleaned it thoroughly with gun scrubber, blown it clean, and lightly oiled contact surfaces and pins. These guns were left quite rough from the factory and it was clear that it had never had the manufacturing debris cleaned out. Following the factory manual (as well as the Walther KSP200 manual), I have also set the trigger release and over-travel. Pull weight set around 2.5-3.0 lbs with Lyman digital gauge. I have also replaced the shroud screws with allen-headed screws - which is something almost all owners do as the factory screws are too soft, and loosen after just a few shots. I have also installed a factory rail (nearly impossible to source) and sourced a second magazine. The second magazine has NOT been fitted or used, and there is information online (http://www.ammoclip.com/images/IZH35M%20fitting%20instructions.pdf) indicating slight hand fitting is required. 

Pistol includes 2 (5-shot) magazines, installed rail, Ultradot Matchdot II red-dot sight (with all original box/papers/accessories), and a hard case. Asking price is $1250 OBO - completely open to offers. Only trades I'm really looking for at the moment are:

You want an accurate DMR (designated marksmen rifle)? This is your rifle

This rifle started off as an orignal FMP G3, very few were imported from FMP factory in Portugal in the early 90s before the 94 assault ban took place. FMP is a government contract factory for the Portugal government and all their equipment are licensed and inspected by H&K German, as a result you have a rifle that rivals the quality and performance of HK G3/HK91 without the ridiculous pricetag. This rifle came with slim forearm but I also added a set of HK wide tropical set with bipod, these HK grip sets are now $300+ and the only one avaliable in market are Pakistani sets which are still $100+ . Along with the rifle has also been send to Bill Springfield for a match ""set"" trigger mod, you basically place thesafety between fire and safe, pull the trigger, and then move the safety to fire for a crisp 2 pound trigger pull. Last but not least the rifle is currectly sitting with a PSG-1 scope mount and a Zeiss Devari 1.5-6 308 turret scope, both of which are nearly impossible to find and valued at $1000

So here's what you're getting along with an FMP rifle for $2750, $1750 without the scope/mount

HK green wide handguard set with HK Bipod
Bill Springfield trigger mod
10 HK marked magazine, most of which has magpul ranger plate for easy access out of a vest
30 rounds of german MEN ammo for you to get started, if you want to meet and shoot the rifle at Pigeon Hill , Saint Joseph MO you are more than welcomed to, bring ammo......

Looking to trade for

M1a rifle, Springfield or otherwise, prefer preban set with USGI parts

Whatever, try me, please dont offer me a WASR and tell me that ITS A PREBAN, worth $2000, I dont play game and neither should you.

However, it wouldn't eject properly from my Ruger LCR .38. I don't know if it's because this is steel cased or what, but I never had a problem through any other .38 (Charter Arms). It seems like it might swell or something, so it's tight removing the casings from the cylinder.

I'm not trying to be a dick, but should you buy this ammo and have the same problem that I experienced in my Ruger with it not-ejecting, I'm not buying it back. It shoots fine,  and it's a good price. There are actually about 10-15 extra rounds, but I'm advertising it as 300 because I know that there's at least that much.

I have a Gen 3 G26 bought new in April.  I have had one range trip with it where I put 500 rounds through it to test/break it in--flawless.  I have the manufactures box and all paperwork is still sealed test fire date 3/25/13.  I originally thought I would use it for summer carry but it turns out I prefer my G19.  The gun has only been holstered a couple of times, otherwise just has sat in the safe.    

The gun comes with 4 mags all with pierce +2 pinky extensions and truglo night sights.  These sights are green and very bright.  After trying them on this 26, I decided to get a set and replace the trijicons on my G19.

This rifle has been modified from it's original ban-produced form. It features a Tapco G2 Trigger Group, Tapco Folding Galil Stock, Tapco Galil Handguard, and Tapco SAW Pistol Grip. The bolt carrier has been polished, and the mag well has been expanded to accept hi-cap magazines. The rifle comes with x1 30 round ProMag Magazine, and x2 10 round steel magazines. I am also including an extra Galil Handguard and SAW grip. This rifle is 100% 922r compliant.

The rifle is in good condition and has a round count of about 250. The trigger group was replaced after 160 rounds. There is some scuffing on the bottom of the receiver near the mag well as a result of the cutting process. The rifle is a WASR, and like most WASR's produced during the ban, it tends to jam from time to time. Usually just a  FTF that can be cleared by simply racking the gun. It likes to eat Mil-Surp ammo which is always available, even during scares.

If you haven't tried an AK-74 before, now is the time. The ammunition is about half the cost of .223/5.56, yet shares similar, if not better ballistics. The 5.45 round is potent, and earned the name 'Poison Bullet' in Afghanistan for it's wounding capabilities. Light recoil, hard hitting, and cheap!

One of the best made compact .380 pistols on the planet.  Comes with the original box, lock, 1 magazine, original Sig holster and a new box of 20 rounds of Spear Gold Dot Defensive ammo.  There is just a little holster wear on the frame from a year of carrying it.  It has had about 500 rounds through it, just enough to get her broken-in.  The one and only reason this pistol is for sale is because I just got my wife the ""Rainbow"" version of this pistol.  These are very hard to come by and when you shoot one you'll see why.  Asking $650 or best reasonable cash offer and I will include the box of ammo at my asking price.  Well cared for and cleaned after every time it was fired.  I can't fine the original manual for it.  Send me an email with your contact information and I'll get back to you.  Rude people and low-ball offers are promptly ignored."

The M4 Commando is famous for its lightweight, ease of handling, accuracy and reliability, qualities that make it a valid choice for a wide variety of law enforcement applications. In fact, the Colt M4 Commando is often chosen over smaller, less powerful sub-machine guns, allowing for full 5.56mm power and accuracy, in a sub-machine gun size.

The 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations.

TheFlat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories. Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation.

I fired a few defense rounds through it, and have decided I would rather have another striker fire pistol, as it's what I'm used to. The SA trigger pull is really nice, however I'm more accustom to a consistent striker pull, as opposed to the initial transition from DA to SA on the first shot. The grip on this gun is second to none, it's amazing! Very, well made, light recoil, also it will fit any glock 19/17 or 23/22 holster perfectly.

The dimensions from the internet are as follows:
Perfect for concealed carry, personal protection security & law enforcement roles. Reversible magazine release. Ambidextrous decocking/manual safety levers. External hammer. 4"" hammer-forged SS barrel, SS slide, full length guide rod, 3-dot sights. Ergonomic, checkered polymer frame with interchangeable backstraps & integrated accessory rail. DA/SA. High-capacity & light recoil. 
 Trigger Pull: SA is rated at 3.96 to 5.06 pounds. DA is rated at 8.8 to 12.1 pounds.
 Weight: 24.8 oz (according to the FN manual, but 25.2 oz according the FN USA's site, and 1lb. 14oz or 30oz according to the Browning site.) To find out, I weighed my empty FNP9 and got 25.5 oz, but my scale is not the most accurate. I think that the 25.2 oz weight is probably correct. I loaded 10 rounds w/115-gr. bullets into the magazine and got a total weight of 5 oz. I think this is where at least the major part of this discrepancy occurs. (The gun is available in the US with 10-rnd magazines in states restricting magazine capacity while the standard capacity magazine available in the rest is 16. FWIW, with 16 rounds, the total weight of the cartridges and magazine is 9 oz.)
 Capacity: 16 + 1, (10 + 1 in some states)

 Height: 5.40""
 Width: 1.55""
 Barrel Length: 4"" (rifled length: 3.15"")
 Pitch: 1:16, right-hand (The manual says ""1:6"" but comparing it to a BarSto Hi Power bbl, the twist does appear very similar and I believe it is 1 turn in 16"" and that the manual's description is a misprint. A 1:6 twist would be very, very fast. In any event, it does not appear as fast as the 1:10 twist in the factory Hi Power bbl.)
