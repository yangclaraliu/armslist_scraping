This rifle has had maybe 300 rounds shot through it? Thats probably stretching it and it's probably more like 260. I bought this rifle about 3 years ago, and just haven't been shooting it. The rifle itself is in very, very good condition. Almost like brand new. It's always been kept in a case and sitting in my closet. 

The rifle comes with 410 rounds of mixed ammo (TulAmmo 122gr. & Herter's 154 gr.), 6 30-round magazines (2 IO Inc brand magazines, 2 Tapco brand magazines, and 2 generic metal 30 round magazines). I must admit, I have had a few problems with the IO Inc brand magazines, and recommend using the Tapco brand or the metal magazines. 

This rifle and ammo package also comes with an Allen rifle soft case. The case is not built specifically for this rifle (the case is a little too long), but the AK47 fits in there and it's padded. 

I'm pricing this package at $650. Thats $100 off the retail price of the rifle, $60 for 6 30-round magazines, and about $5 per 20rd box of ammo. 

You won't be disappointed in this rifle. I bought it when it was $700, and now it's about $600 online. This is a great deal for you if you're looking for a beginner AK 47. The receiver is stamped. 


Please no trades and low low ball offers. $650 is my lowest price. Thanks

HK branded ones can go for well over 3k, and even the cheaper clones made on parts kits run around 1k. In the 80's and 90's Springfield wanted to expand their selection without the effort of designing a new gun, so they struck a deal with HK to resale their HK 91 firearms in the US. These were all new parts, made in an HK factory by HK technicians. After the import ban in 89, they had the new parts shipped in, and assembled on a US made receiver in the Springfield Armory shop. Arguably the best thing about these rifles, other than being as close to an HK as a clone gets, is that they SA lifetime warranty follows them! If you ever manage to kill it they will replace it with their equivalent model, the M1A1!

This one has a low round count, 6 all steel German made 20 round mags and 3 super hard to find steel 30 round mags, that go for around $80 a piece in surplus condition.

Franchi SPAS-12 (Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun).  It is in good condition.  I have owned it for about 10 years.  I have put about 100 rounds through it since I have owned it (I don't shoot very often).  It comes with one survival strap, one plastic case, one bandolier, and an electronic copy of the owner's manual.  This shotgun in particular is in the very rare 18"" barrel configuration with the pistol grip safety.  This shotgun is a duel mode shotgun, so it can be pump action or semi-automatic.

Below is a little information about the SPAS 12.

The Franchi SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun manufactured by Italian firearms company Franchi from 1979 to 2000. Production stopped fully in the year 2000. Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated Franchi SPAS 12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the United States. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 was sold to military and police users worldwide on the civilian market, and has been featured in many movies, TV shows and video games.

The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS-12 initially led to its ""Military"" designation as a Combat Shotgun. The SPAS-12 was designed from the ground up as a rugged military shotgun and it was named the Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun. In 1990 Franchi renamed the shotgun to the Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun, this allowed continued sales to the United States as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994. Following the United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban, imports of SPAS-12 shotguns were stopped into the United States. In September 2004 the ban had expired, but Franchi had ended production in 2000 of the SPAS-12 to focus on the manufacturing of the Franchi SPAS-15 model.

 These are becoming harder to find due to no more gun imports allowed from Russia. So what is here is here until they decide to lift the ban, if they ever do. The trade embargo with Cuba lasted over 50 years, so I have no faith in it being lifted soon.

 Must be legal to own guns and able to provide a valid DL. I reserve the right to refuse sale to anyone at anytime. Must be willing to meet in public location. 

I live in Nashville, TN currently but I am from Spartanburg originally. I will be coming home this weekend to visit family and friends and wouldn't mind lining up a sell. The dates I will be in town is Aug. 7-9.

 May consider partial, multi-gun or total trades. No wall hangers, no odd calibers, no SKS, no 1200 glocks with tons of mods because its still a glock in performance. Trades must either be in 9mm, 12 gauge, 5.7, 223 or 5.56. I can add cash on my end for the right trade. I need to know ahead of time if you are wanting to sign a bill of sale so I can bring 2 copies.

 Some stuff I may be interested in is:

 - Mossberg 930 spx
 - Benelli M4 tactical. Can add cash or a Kahr cw45 with about 500 rounds to make up the difference.
 - Other semi-auto tactical shotguns that holds 7-8 shells.
 - Glock 9mms Gen 3 or 4

Background:
I am the original owner, and purchased this about a month ago. As soon as I got the gun I ordered an Apex Tactical forward set sear and aluminum flat face trigger. I had never shot an Apex trigger M&P before, but now I know what all the support is about. I've never felt a better trigger on a striker fired gun. It has the reliability of a striker fired M&P but with the smooth and light trigger pull of a 1911. I put 100 rounds through it and it shot great. Super easy follow up shots. I was originally going to shoot USPSA limited 10 with this but chose to continue shooting production with my Glock 34. This gun really needs to be seen, these triggers really are amazing. The gun itself goes for around $600 with the factory night sights. The Apex parts cost me $175. You could always buy this, install the factory trigger and sell the Apex parts and have yourself a great gun and some extra cash.

Price:
I am asking $575 firm.

Buyer must have valid Ohio driver's license. Buyer must be able to legally own a handgun. I prefer buyer to have valid CCW license.

The Kestrel series is Osprey's most versatile: these packs love to go backpacking, climbing, skiing, and travelling. Their streamlined features won't weigh you down, but are still functional enough for many different backcountry pursuits. An adjustable shoulder harness ensures a custom fit, and the top-loading design gives you lots of options for carrying ropes, snowshoes, skis, or anything else you can think up.

Although its capacity is smaller than Thunder 9 PRO high capacity, it is bigger than most in its category. Most importantly, it keeps its absolute accuracy and reliability. This pistol has a surprisingly compact size and as well as comfortable.

This model is 100% ambidextrous like high capacity versions. Its safety and decocker lever and slide stop levers are located on both sides of the gun. The magazine catch is also reversible. The location of the safety and decocker grant unequalled comfort and perfect grip.

The Thunder 9 Ultra Compact PRO has the Improved Browning Petter barrel locking system, giving an excellent reliability during ejection of empty cases and feeding live ammo.

As we always do, safety is first, and Thunder 9 Ultra Compact PRO has many safety devices: manual safety lever and decocker, firing pin safety, hammer automatically remains in half cock notch and separate the hammer from the firing pin, and a new loaded chamber indicator. This compact pistol has also a Integral Locking System, to store the gun safely.

Looking to possibly sell or trade my Beretta 84BB. This is basically a mini Beretta 92fs chambered in .380 Auto. The Beretta is in excellent condition. I have not seen one of these before and am in no hurry to part with it, just seeing what else might be out there. This model comes straight from Italy and from the research I've done, is the more desirable of the Beretta 84 variants with the BB action, blued finish and round trigger guard.

Comes with IWB galco holster. Can add ammo for the right trade.

ARES-16‚Ñ¢ Small Arms Family

The ARES-16‚Ñ¢ small arms family represents a military grade, state-of-the-art advance in compact, lightweight and mission-configurable weapons. The ARES-16‚Ñ¢ features a unique and patented receiver group from which a variety of military firearms can be configured including
1.Sub-Carbine
2.Carbine
3.Assault Rifle
4.Designated Marksman Rifle
5.Magazine-Fed Assault Machine Gun
6.Belt-Fed Assault Machine Gun
7.Dual-Feed Assault Machine Gun
8.Belt-Fed Mounted Light Machine Gun

All of the ARES-16‚Ñ¢ weapons share significant part commonality for reduced logistical footprint and can be
 user-arranged from one configuration to another in less than 30 seconds supporting ‚ÄúOne Weapon, Any Mission!‚Ñ¢‚Äù

ARES-16‚Ñ¢ weapons are primarily chambered for the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge and accept a variety of Ball, Tracer and Special Purpose ammunition from NATO-Standard 30-round M16 magazines and/or NATO-Standard M27 linked ammunition packaged for the US M249 SAW. The ARES-16‚Ñ¢ small arms system is available as a complete weapon or can be supplied as an upgrade kit to existing M16/M4 service rifle and carbines.

ARES-16‚Ñ¢ Assault Machine Gun

The innovative ARES-16‚Ñ¢ extends the longevity of America‚Äôs longest serving infantry weapon, the M-16, and significantly expands its lethality and operational utility with the introduction of a new warfighter solution; the ARES-16 AMG‚Ñ¢ ‚ÄúAssault Machine Gun‚Äù.

The new ARES-16‚Ñ¢ Assault Machine Gun bridges the capability gap that exists between M16/M4 rifles and the M249 light machine gun. The ARES-16 AMG‚Ñ¢ is user-arranged into three discrete base configurations to provide a magazine-fed Assault Machine Gun (AMG‚Ñ¢), a belt-fed Assault Machine Gun (AMG-1‚Ñ¢), and a dual-feed Assault Machine Gun (AMG-2‚Ñ¢) which fires interchangeably between magazine and belt-feed. In all present configurations, the ARES-16 AMG‚Ñ¢ weapons are gas-piston operated, select-fire from a closed bolt; and feature MIL-STD 1913 rail interface system and quick-change barrels for ultimate mission flexibility.

Manufactured from high-strength aerospace alloys; the ARES-16 AMG‚Ñ¢ weighs as little as 7.5 lbs (3.4 kg) placing it in the size/weight envelope of an M4 Carbine but with the firepower of a light machine gun. Sound suppressor and grenade launcher capable; the compact and portable ARES-16‚Ñ¢ Assault Machine Gun provides an individual operator with an unprecedented combination of decisive firepower and swift mobility during special operations and high-speed military assaul"

The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.Like the P-09, the P-07‚Äôs safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.The P-07 shares the P-09‚Äôs updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we‚Äôve had to date.Note- Some CZ-USA dealers order special versions that vary from the standard configuration. This might be a difference in sights, safety mechanisms, finish or accessory package. From time to time you may find a P-07 with an extended barrel, tactical light, tritium sights or safety levers only. There are a number of special versions we ship throughout the year.SpecificationsProduct Name CZ P-07 ‚Äì 9mmFirearm Type HandgunMSRP $510.00Chambering 9mm LugerMagazine Capacity 15 Magazine Type Double StackFrame Black PolymerGrips StippledTrigger Mech DA/SASights Fixed Three-DotBarrel Cold Hammer ForgedBarrel Length 3.8 inWeight 1.7 lbsOverall Length 7.2 in Height 5.3 in"

Luke Miller worked for years at Precise Machining, a manufacturing company that produces parts for the aerospace and defense industry. In 2012, Luke was driving in to work and thought about how great it would be to take the skills he gleaned working with metal all day, and put them to use making a tough, pared-down, aluminum case for his iPhone. So he paired up with a programmer, made a case perfectly attuned to Miller's needs, and ran it on the machine! After being asked countless times where his case was from and if he could make unique cases for friends and family, he decided to launch Top Secret Case. The rest is history.

When I got it from him, it was in pieces but I had a professional gunsmith re-assemble it and he indicated it appeared functional to him. However, I cannot verify that it has/will fire. I have no ammo for it to determine that either. By the look of it, this is likely a Chinese Type 53 and the upper is stamped 1955. 

It will be sold with the ""Allen"" brand Army green carrying case and the accessories shown in the photo. Not sure if the bayonet pictured actually goes with the rifle. Again, it was given to me in parts. All that said, it dry fires fine, the bolt operates smoothly and is not overly-loose. It's a neat piece of history but I just have no practical use for it. It has been priced accordingly for quick sale. Please contact me if you have any further questions or want more specific photos."
