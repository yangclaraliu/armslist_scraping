Unfortunately have to sell a rifle to help pay for bills and what not. It is a Ruger Gunsite Scout rifle in .308 Win. Rifle comes with the Nikon Buckmaster 6-18x40 Side Focus scope. The scope has the BDC (Bullet Drop Compensation) reticle. Also come with factor ammo and some hand loads that I made myself. I've put about 60sih rounds through it since I bought it.

The rifle shoots amazing. Normal factory ammo has a nickle sized group at 100 yards, and stacking shots with the land loads. Quarter size groups at 200 yards with the hand loads as well.

Bought the rifle and scope for a little over $1500 (back when the rifle was $1000 and the scope was $450 and then add on the damn taxes...) Not trying to get my money back but I know what the rifle and everything is worth.
