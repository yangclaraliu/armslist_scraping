Not a single issue, jam, FTF, etc.

--------------------

Back story from the previous owner:

Started life as a factory assembled PSA / FN 18"" 223 wylde upper with a 15"" Midwest Industries SS15G2 free-float rail - Magpul moe fixed riffle stock / PSA lower. A trip to Curts is where the biggest change occurred. They had a Noveske 18"" ss barrel (made when John was still with us)

As new AR-15 (round count is exactly 50 on the barrel ) total round count is under 150. PSA factory upper / lower with proper upgrades (original barrel has been sold)

Noveske 18"" Stainless Steel lightweight contour 5.56mm barrel (installed at Curts)
1 in 7"" twist, improved polygonal rifling, extended feed ramps, bead blasted finish and has the intermediate gas system. (You can shoot 223 or 5.56 ammunition).

PSA F/A bcg with BCM bolt (new bolt installed when new barrel was put on). Probably not necessary as round count was under 100 but I felt better lean on the side of caution.

Noveske (not marked) mil-spec charge handle

Troy 5.56 Medieval flash suppressor

Midwest Industries SS15G2 15"" free-float key mod rail with 4 qd sling socket mounting points (factory)

Magpul moe riffle buttstock (with Magpul qd sling socket installed)

Leupold VARI-X III 3.5x10-40 1"" scope with target turrets

Scopecoat scope cover

American Defense AD-Recon SL 20 moa qd mount

Ice Arms Nickel Boron EXO hammer (makes trigger perfect) /
original hammer included

Ics Arms Enhanced Hexagonal
trigger guard / original trigger guard included

Odin Works XMR extended magazine release

Hogue ""monogrip"" pistol grip

4 magazines (total) included -
one D&H 5 round, one D&H 10 round, one new in package Magpul 30 round pmag and one new in package Magpul 40 round capacity pmag.

One key mod rail section and no name bi-pod is included

The factory assembled PSA upper / lower are both forged per mil-spec 7075-T6 material, T marks (upper), and black hard coat anodized per mil- 8625. The upper also has M4 feed ramp cuts.
Because I started with factory assembled parts this build cost me about $2,200 dollars. One would save a couple hundred if not done this way but still would set you back much more than I'm asking for this one.

-------------------------

Since then:

Bought 1000 rounds of wolf .223, sold 500 of them. Shot 150 and the remaining 350 come with the rifle. (minus 1 round that sits on my desk)

This is an almost brand new Steyr AUG rifle (5.56 caliber). I'm the original owner and the rifle has seen less than 500 rounds down the pipe.

The rifle will come with 6 original Steyr Mags, (four 30 round and two 42 rounders). I'll be including the original Steyr rifle case, a Blackhawk rifle sling, and Magpul MBUS Gen 2 sights, front and rear (the rear sight was originally an OD green one that I duracoated black--its barely noticeable but meh, I thought I'd mention it).

You'll also notice in the pics that I have installed a Bushnell TRS-25 red dot sight and a Fenix flashlight mount combo. I'd like to keep these but I'll add them for an additional cost if you'd like.

Cash price: $1470 ----- That's the lowest you'll find online with the number of magazines I'm supplying and its as low as I'm willing to go. I'm pricing it for a quick sale--it'll go very fast.

Like new. Purchased July '15. 

I put just over 500 rounds though this pistol.  I took this to the range with about 10 different types of ammo and 4 different mags to test it out. It ran absolutely everything through every magazine. 

I had mostly ball and some HP ammo. Everything from Winchester, Federal, PMC, Magtech, Rem, Hornaday, and a few others. One or two duds, but no failures from the weapon.
The mags were the stock Sig mags, Wilson Combat (47D, 500HD), and CMC Powermags. All ran fine. The slide locked back every time.

Comes with 2 factory mags and everything else that was in the box. I'm throwing in a bore snake as well, as I have no need for it.

The Ruger® Super Blackhawk® Single-Action Revolver is designed specifically to handle the chamber pressures and recoil of the powerful .44 Magnum cartridge. The Super Blackhawk is similar to Ruger's standard Blackhawk model in that it has a solid cylinder-frame made of premium modern steel, and uses all coil springs in the mechanism that retain their power for ultra-durability (instead of leaf-springs). The robust Super Blackhawk features an all-steel grip frame to add weight and balance the sidearm, and the grip is slightly longer than that of the standard Blackhawk to provide a solid grip and disperse recoil over a larger area. The back of the trigger guard has been squared off to give more room for the shooter's knuckles to protect them from punishing recoil. The hammer spur on the Super Blackhawk is lower and wider, and the trigger is wider as well. An unfluted cylinder is also featured to add weight and withstand high-pressure .44 magnum loads. Common to all Ruger Single-Action Revolvers, the Super Blackhawk uses Ruger's patented transfer bar ignition system that provides an unparalleled measure of security against accidental discharge, allowing the shooter to carry the revolver safely with all 6 chambers loaded. The traditional western-style grip pattern of the Super Blackhawk is known for aiding in natural pointing characteristics, enabling shooters to instinctively draw and shoot, as well as stand and take fine aim. The rear sight is click adjustable for both windage and elevation, and is protected by integral frame topstrap ribs. The front sight is an improved Partridge type that provides a good sight picture, and allows for snag-free withdrawal from holsters. The Ruger Super Blackhawk Single-Action Revolver represents a great value in a big game hunting or target-shooting sidearm. Made in USA."

Safety pin, flip up sights, intact sight covers and sling, trigger mechanism clicks when you press it, and the rubber fins covering the front end are all in excellent shape.  There are some scratches on the stickers but are all legible. This is a great collectible and is a must have for any serious military collector. This would also look great hanging up on the wall, showing it off your friends, or building a lamp for the perfect man cave. Shipping included."

 The best you've ever seen. 
 The Germans call him Devil Dog, 
 His real name is Marine. 
 He was born on Parris Island, 
 The place where God forgot. 
 The sand is 18 inches deep, 
 The sun is blazing hot. 
 And everyday he'll wake up, 
 Before the rising sun. 
 He'll run a hundred miles or more, 
 Before the day is done. 
 He's deadly with a rifle, 
 A bayonet made of steel. 
 He's took the Devils calling card, 
 He's mastered how to kill. 
 And when he gets to heaven, 
 St. Peter he will tell.

AR-10® A-Series Carbine
$1,571.00


The AR-10A family of Armalite rifles is functionally identical to our AR-10B family. Operation, controls, and maintenance are the same however, the AR-10A family is designed to accept early Armalite AR-10 “Waffle” magazines and other magazines copied from them. 
The new A10A carbine is both rugged and flexible. It is perfectly suited to both military and law enforcement duty. It is a gas operated, magazine fed, semi-automatic produced to provide a level of accuracy, dependability and durability that is not found in other rifles of similar design. The A10A provides a perfect platform for all sighting options with its forged flat-top receiver, MIL-STD 1913 rail and forward assist."

The rifle uses a removable ""shell holder"" rotating bolt with three locking lugs. For each shot, the bolt was rotated and removed from the receiver, the cartridge was inserted into the bolt face, and the bolt and cartridge were inserted back into the receiver and locked. It featured a fully adjustable trigger and buttstock so shooters could adjust it to their liking. The rifle did not have a forearm as it was not intended to be fired offhand and instead came with a folding bipod.

And its just not Fin, Top Shot Fire Arms, Sporting Defense, Kames, Bud's. All cheaper at times. I think sometimes a wife told the husband to get rid of toys so he askes for the moon knowing it wont sell, others are just morons even a unfired gun is used once the FFL sells it to you.

Sonny Crockett had one in season 3 of Miami Vice, now you can have one too.  They are getting harder to find in any kind of great condition.  This one is pristine condition and comes with all the original items Original S&W box (s/n does not match though but the box is correct and in excellent shape for the years), original wax paper the gun was wrapped in, Safety pamphlet, warranty card and statement, 645 owners manual, magazine dis-assembly, up opened S&W cleaning kit, and finally a warning label.  The standard weapon comes with 2 – 8 shot magazines, there are an additional 3 more making a total of 5 – 8 shot magazines all are S&W. 

This 645 is all stainless steel with wood grips and white outline adjustable rear sight plus red insert front sight.  There are no marks on the frame or slide at all it is the best one that I have seen in years.  This one has been shot but it looks new.  This is the most complete package that I have seen and the weapon is the best looking on the net.  Check out the others and you will see.

PAYMENT- Paypal/ Gift/ Discreet. I will ship USPS with tracking.. 

Call it Text 803.981. 2 six zero 6

Specs and details from Larue Tactical's website 

Converts low-profile EOTechs to lower 1/3 cowitness, and provides a better cheekweld too.
 The LT110 is another mount designed ""by request"". The LT110 raises the EOTech by .275"". This extra height sticks the irons low in the EOTech's window...you can still see the irons if push-comes-to-shove.

 The response has been outstanding. The extra height is just what the EO has been needing. The design had room for a piece-of-picatinny on the back, so we put it there and now you can mount a PVS-14 or Aimpoint 3X Magnifier in perfect co-witness.

 Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and matt black anodized to provide a durable non-reflective surface finish. The locking LaRue Speed Lever provides outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.


NOTE: The LT110 EOTech Mount will work correctly with 511, 512, 551, 552, XPS-2, XPS-3 and similar models. It will NOT work with the EXPS2 or EXPS3, it also will NOT work with 516, 517, 553 or 557 models (or any EOTech with a built-in riser). The LT110 is not compatible with an EOLAD installed.

 The LT-133 (PVS-14 Mount) and LT-602-1 (fixed Aimpoint 3X Magnifier Mount) attach on the rear of the LT-110 and correctly line-up with the LT-110-mounted 511, 512, 551, 552, XPS 2, XPS 3 and similar models. The LT-649 ""Tall"" Pivot Mount (with Aimpoint 3X magnifier), mounted on the receiver rail will work on all models, but may interfere with rear sights."
