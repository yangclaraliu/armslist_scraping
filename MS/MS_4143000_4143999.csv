I don't hunt any more, so it's been mostly a home defense item for years.  

This shotgun comes with two vent-rib barrels for 2 3/4"" shells, an Improved Cylinder 
barrel (25"") for skeet and small birds, and a Full Choke (30"") barrel for trap and waterfowl.  It comes with a factory Recoil Pad, and checkering on beautiful walnut stocks.

This gun has been in the field many times so it has a couple of minor dings and scratches in the stock, but the blue metal finish is still good and there is no rust.  According to the serial number, the shotgun was manufactured approximately 1976.

If the Model 870 Wingmaster were introduced today, it would be hailed as a major advance in pump-action shotgun design, the ultimate in strength, durability, silky-smooth bind-free action, and sleek classical lines.  Yet this remarkable shotgun has been around for almost half a century, and has become the best-selling shotgun of any type in history, with over ten million made.

The Model 870 is so smooth and reliable that today, nearly 60 years after its introduction, it’s still the standard by which all pump shotguns are measured. With a receiver machined from a solid billet of steel, it is the model of enduring strength. True to its original design, the pump glides on two twin-action bars for the utmost in positive chambering and ejection. These characteristics, along with its flawless balance and natural pointing qualities have made the Model 870 the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, of any action type, from any manufacturer.  The Model 870 Wingmaster is a true American icon. 

You need to see this shotgun to appreciate it.   Don't be shy.  Give me a reply with your phone number and let's talk.  I live in the LaFortune Park area."

I bought this rifle in November one week before deer season and shot my first deer with it. I purchased it at Village Tactical in Oklahoma City.  This is an EXCELLENT rifle for the price. I have shot a 1.5"" group with a Vortex  Scope (not included) at 100 yards. 

I put the original scope it came with from the factory and sighted it at 25 yards. Its a 3-9x40. I looked it up and I think it is a Bushnell although it has no markings on it.

I had the bolt buffed to smooth out the action. It shoots great. If you want a hard case and a shoulder strap I will sell it for $300.

This gun was manufactured in 2000 because it does have the crossbolt safety. It is chambered in 357mag and 38 special.  This Is the JM model which is a gunsmiths exclusive from my reading. These rifles are rare and hard to find in the 357 mag chambering.  There are a few scratches in the blueing But nothing major and the wood furniture is perfect condition.  My asking price is $800 now and from my research is more than fair.  Sold gun auctions have these guns selling over $800 because of rare Availibility. It does come extra with a Skinner peep sight installed. Very nice rifle and a classic marlin 1894 action.

A full sized battle rifle can be a tight squeeze in your truck or in the heavy brush. The Springfield Armory® M1A-A1™ Scout Squad™ combines the legendary power and reliability of the M1A™ with the quick handling and fast sight acquisition of a scout style rifle.

From the two-stage military trigger to the aperture style rear sight (adjustable for windage and elevation), you’ll find that the Scout Squad™ is packed with all the standard features that make the M1A™ great. The barrel is shortened to 18 inches – something you’ll appreciate on those longer hikes over the mountain and through the alders. The forward position scope mount brings you the added versatility of extended eye-relief optics. The Scout Squad™ also features a specially designed muzzle brake to help tame the recoil.

Whether you’re looking to save some space on your next big hunting trip, or you need a ranch rifle that will be a constant companion, the Scout Squad™ will give you the maneuverability of a scout rifle with the same power and features of a legendary American battle rifle.

Very similar to CZ-75. This pistol comes with two 15rd mags and the box. These guns are no longer imported from Turkey, thanks to Obama. Dont be fooled this gun is fully forged from the ground up. Extremely accurate and from being all steel gun, it barely kicks. Again these are no longer imported so they are hard to find but are extremely well built. I tested against a CZ-75 with it, nothing wrong with CZ but the Armalite was more accurate and comfortable to shoot.  If I wasn't trying to pay some bills, I wouldn't be selling this gun ever.
Here is some more information regarding the pistol. You will be very impressed.

Most is rings and chains. All but 2 pieces is stamped with its purity. I Have acid tested all of the gold. The marks are correct. Here's a list of what I have..... 

10k gold: 1.155 grams 
12k gold: 16.700 grams 
14k gold: 85.810 grams 
16k gold: 4 grams 

Calculated down to melt value of pure gold in ounces: (weighed with a standard scale, this is not Troy ounces, just standard ounces.) 

10k gold: 0.0154. $17.94 
12k gold: 0.2683. $313.56 
14k gold: 1.6070. $1,878.11 
16k gold: 0.0858. $100.16 

Total market value: $2309.77 

For a cost of about $100 it can be smelted down to a bar of pure 24k gold in the weight of about 1.9756 ounce. Market value of it is about $2300 depending on when you do the calculations. 

With gold value always changing I'm setting my trade value at $1600. If I get a chance to take my gold to the smelter before trading it off the price will change. I just wanted to try listing it before I smelt and sell it outright. I can acid test it in front of you to show purity 

No I will not just sell the gold as is. My plan is to try to trade it or next week I'm going to smelt it and have it poured into a solid 2 ounce bar. 

Im looking for an ar-10 or ar-10. Only calibers I will consider is a 6.8 spc first. I will consider a 458 socom, 450 bushmaster, 50 beuwolf, 308 win, 338 federal.  I might consider other calibers but nothing smaller than the 6.8

Only other thing I will consider trading for is a night vision scope."

The Leica 8x32 Ultravid HD Binocular offer big picture in a small package. These Binoculars by Leica have been remade and perfect to give you the best looking picture and color quality available. Now, with the innovative Leica Ultra-Vid HD 8 x 32 mm Binoculars, the Leica engineers have once again succeeded in setting new standards. Fluoride lenses in combination with a particularly small housing made from robust magnesium make the Leica Binoculars ideal for anyone wanting to be out and about especially during the day with excellent optics but not much equipment. The newly developed AquaDura Coating by Leica reduces fogging and allows moisture droplets and dirt to simply roll off ensuring clear visibility - even in wind and rain. As with the leaves of the lotus plant, droplets of rain simply roll off the lens, and fingerprints and dirt particles"

This thread adapter easily attaches to the factory-finished plain muzzle. The largest diameter is a little larger than current A2 Birdcage and similar flash hiders.

Features and Benefits
•Fits the Ruger 10/22 carbine and takedown models
•Natural stainless (silver) finish for years of trouble-free service.
•Designed, developed, and manufactured in the USA.
•Less expensive than going to a machinist or gunsmith to thread your barrel.
•Held in place with a single set screw that is flush when tightened.
•Install it yourself in minutes, and remove it just as quickly.

Note: You will need to purchase the end-of-barrel accessory and crush washer seperately.

It is your responsibility to know and follow all Federal, State, and local laws, rules, regulations, restrictions and legislation about purchasing/owning/using this product.
Above all else, be safe and have fun.

These carbines were used by Hungarian forces and rear line German forces in WW2.

This particular rifle is in very good condition. Metal looks about 70%; there are some old dings and wear in the stock. The bore has some roughness but is still mostly bright with good rifling. The numbers seem to be matching except the stock. It was made in 1918. One en bloc clip is included.

These handsome rifles were made famous during the Mexican War with their use by the future president of the Confederate States, Jefferson Davis who commanded a small force in Mississippi. The Model 1841 was used by Davis’ troops in the Battle of Buena Vista which saw Davis drive a superior force of the Mexican army from the battle field. Thus, these accurate weapons gained the name, Mississippi Rifles and became well known for their far better accuracy than the smoothbored muskets of that era. This rifle is in MUCH better condition than most seen; it has fine smooth metal with excellent deep markings, a fine bore, and almost no pitting whatsoever, not even around the nipple. The wood is equally superior with just minor bumps and bruises and does still have two visible cartouches. It also still has the spare nipple in the patchbox and the nipple wrench, as well. The sling is an obvious reproduction but is the correct type. Definitely very good collection quality! VG++ to near Fine overall."

These handsome rifles were made famous during the Mexican War with their use by the future president of the Confederate States, Jefferson Davis who commanded a small force in Mississippi. The Model 1841 was used by Davis’ troops in the Battle of Buena Vista which saw Davis drive a superior force of the Mexican army from the battle field. Thus, these accurate weapons gained the name, Mississippi Rifles and became well known for their far better accuracy than the smoothbored muskets of that era. This rifle is in MUCH better condition than most seen; it has fine smooth metal with excellent deep markings, a fine bore, and almost no pitting whatsoever, not even around the nipple. The wood is equally superior with just minor bumps and bruises and does still have two visible cartouches. It also still has the spare nipple in the patchbox and the nipple wrench, as well. The sling is an obvious reproduction but is the correct type. Definitely very good collection quality! VG++ to near Fine overall."

Product Information

This Federal Lake City Ammunition has been loaded to true NATO specifications. This is the same ammunition that is currently being used by the US Military and meets strict quality assurance standards and specifications. Packaged in a new, sealed, Mil-Spec reusable metal ammo can closed with a tamper-evident seal. Ammunition is conveniently loaded into Mil-Spec 10-round stripper clips. A Mil-Spec steel stripper clip guide is included for quick, easy loading of any USGI Spec M16/AR-15 magazines. The SS109 bullet is a steel penetrator tipped, lead core bullet complete with the standard green paint used to designate penetrator tip ammunition. This ammunition is non-corrosive in boxer-primed, reloadable brass cases.

This 1883 dated trials rifle is in excellent overall condition with the finish retaining about 97% original blue that has light handling wear and is lightly flaking to brown with a few areas that have specks of very fine surface oxidation present. The steel buttplate shows the most wear with light oxidation and abrasions, most likely from spending a good portion of its life on a rack. The bolt assembly is in the white and has a light gray patina slowly spreading over its surface and mixing with a few lights spots of surface oxidation. The receiver and barrel markings are all crisp and all numbers are matching. The left side of the receiver and barrel are both marked ""(crown)/C / J.P 1883 J.G."" The wood has some light added finish but otherwise rates excellent having only a few light dings. The area under the action has a blank brass diamond held on with two screws, which most likely would have served as an ID plate had the rifle been adopted and issued. The rifle's features include an eight shot tubular magazine and magazine disconnect on the left side of the receiver. The forward sling swivel and cleaning rod are missing but the rifle otherwise is complete. Only about 1500 of these were manufactured, and were never adopted for service. The first 500 were the two-band variation, made for the Royal Life Guard, and the remaining 1000 were this three-band variation produced for the Navy. Many were destroyed by the Germans or sold as surplus and/or converted to the M28 Harpoon rifle."
