I'd like to get this rifle sold, but I'm in no way desperate to do so. So $600 is my ""bottom dollar"". I'm willing to sell the complete upper alone for $400 as well, then I'd just end up keeping the lower for later projects.

Here's a Palmetto State Armory complete lower and 14.7"" upper. The upper is a premium chf mid length that's unfired. The lower also has not been used, so basically a brand new rifle. Both upper and lower were 100% built by PSA. It will come MOE-Ed out (no rear sight) with a 30rd pmag. The a2 fh has been pinned on to make it the legal length of 16"".

You'll need a valid ncdl and a ccw/original pistol permit, to show me you're legally able to own a firearm. We both get a bill of sale.

In trade, I am looking for a PPQ M2 in 9mm, a gen 4 g19 or a FNS 9 Compact, no safety or recent production FNS 9 full size, no safety. Any of these would also require some additional cash. I have my ccw so no issue there. Or $600 in cash works also.

I bought this shotgun from a local farmer who bought it new in the 70's who says he put about 2 boxes of shells through it. I put only one box through it myself.

Here's a quote I found about this shotgun on shotgunworld dot com:

""If I were you I would run very fast & get that gun before someone else gets that minty 28ga Flite King. I will tell you what my 12ga Flite King Deluxe will do, I can stand the gun on it's recoil pad press the action release & the action will fall open by it's self. Smooth as butter.""

I just tried this (never tried it before) and it does indeed fall open by itself...smooth as butter. :)

I would also consider a trade for a Zastava NPAP or OPAP with wooden stock and no modifications.

If you want a professionally built very special Type 3 milled rifle using original military parts and barrel, this is it so don't miss out! 

This is a very nice 7,62x39mm Type 3 milled rifle that was custom-built with all original mint new military parts on a rare high quality Bulgarian SLR-100H machined receiver that was imported in the early 2000's. These receivers were factory made and have very little in the way of needless markings on them. The builder was gunsmith Dean Davidson, a perfectionist and master of his craft. The receiver was carefully polished and blued to match the other parts by Dean and blued in Las Vegas by a very well-known high end custom pistol building establishment. The numbers on the removables do not match, obviously. All of the removables are mint new Polish. 

The scope rail is a hyper rare original 1950's era Soviet part that was imported to Poland in the 1960's. I only know of 3 originals in the US. It still retains it's original deep blue polished finish. In fact, all of the parts other than the barreled receiver have their original factory bluing. The wood is all correct, new and original 1960's-early '70's dated Polish laminated furniture that took me about a year to piece together, buying in bulk and picking and choosing until each part was an exact match in condition, wood and glue color. It has never been messed with other than fitting to the rifle. 

This sale also includes the correct 1965-dated NSP-2 IR Polish-made night vision scope. The scope has it's matching battery pack container and cable assembly, as well as a hyper rare Polish drop case in mint new shape with excellent stampings. The scope and battery box are in excellent shape, but due to the fragility of early electo-optical devices of this age please bare in mind that I am selling the scope with the rifle as a collectible only and cannot currently verify if it still works or not. It should thus be considered a display piece. I just do not have time to mess with it at this time. 

The rifle will also come with one blued Polish AK magazine, and a very hard to find Polish night fighting rifle Y-pod. I'm going to put a slightly earlier Polish sling on the rifle before it ships out, that is dated in the early 1960's, it has an all leather end-piece and is more appropriate to the build. 

There's only a few other less obvious details that need to be mentioned. One, I never engraved the rifle with any fake markings because I didn't know for sure if I wanted to go with Russian or Polish furnishings. Therefore, it's a clean slate for the new buyer to play with (make it a Soviet rifle if you prefer). I also never riveted the scope rail on, it is currently securely attached with screws from the inside. I was going to eventually have custom rivets made so I could save the gorgeous blued finish on the outer surface of the scope rail plate, but I never got round to it. As you can see, the screw install is clean and functional, the assembly is rock solid as is and i never say a need to mess with it again. You can leave it as i have, or do it up with rivets if you like.

require immediate payment, no holds 

I accept USPS MO or Bank Certified cashiers check.

Key to this are: an all new elastomer extractor spring, new extractor material, dual ejectors, and a steel insert feed ramp. These components fundamentally change the way the conventional MSR functions. The result: the most consistent, efficient, and reliable Extraction and ejection pattern of any MSR.The biggest revolution to the GII might just be the smallest. Improved extractor & elastomer Extractor spring. Through countless hours of research, testing, and tens of thousands of fired rounds, DPMS has selected a new extractor material that is nearly impervious to breaking, and a patent pending elastomer extractor spring. We ran tens of thousands of rounds through during testing without fatigue, breakage, failure, and the new materials resisted temperatures from -60˚F to 650˚F+ as well as every gun cleaner, solvent, oil or degreaser we could get our hands on.Dual Ejectors The dual ejector system reduces the ejector spring fatigue. Through duplicity, the likelihood of a failed ejection is significantly reduced.Steel feed ramp. GII incorporates an inserted steel feed ramp, allowing a lighter, smaller barrel extension and receiver, while improving feeding of more ammunition types. Enlarged ejection port Lengthened port allows for better, more consistent ejection.Smaller. Lighter. Stronger.The rifle simply feels better when you pick it up.The heart of the GII is a matched pair of forged, level III anodized, Teflon* coated 7075 receivers, providing improved strength and durability. With the advancements in the forging, feed ramps and bolt geometry, the GII has a shorter overall receiver length, as well as a reduced receiver diameter.Forged upper and lower receivers are contoured to be more ergonomic. Compact design is both lightweight and only 1/2” longer than a 5.56 MSR receiver, 5/8” shorter than the current LR-308.Lower receiver incorporates integral trigger guard and accepts any standard MSR pistol grip.Reduced weight, yet lighter recoil.Reduced mass carrier provides smoother, softer recoil impulse than the GEN1 .308.Reduced mass, forged, monolithic bolt carrierwith forward assist. New lightweight, forged, monolithic bolt carrier utilizes an integral gas key tower and removable gas key extension. Beveled mag well. The beveled mag well provides a comfortable grip for those that prefer a mag well hold and also aids in quicker mag changes. Improved bolt & barrel extension. An all new bolt geometry provides superior lockup and strength. The bolt geometry allows a smaller diameter barrel extension to be used, in turn allowing upper receiver to be smaller, reducing overall material and weight without compromising strength. This MSR is adaptable,versatile and has the accuracy you’d expect from DPMS.With its adaptability in accepting standard MSR fire control and more .223 two piece hand guards than before, the GII core also remains versatile in both tactical and hunting configurations. A true game-changer.Increased .223 platform hand guard adaptability Accepts more 2 piece MSR handguards than previous LR-308. Newly designed barrel nut allows the use of .223 diameter free float hand guard systems.Accepts standard MSR fire controls DPMS GII rifles accept standard MSR fire controls for even more adaptability. An exceptional tactical rifle. Contoured steel feed ramps, revolutionary redesigned extraction system, and a dual ejector design decrease feeding, extraction and ejection malfunctions.Completely re-designed gas delivery system utilizes a monolithic bolt carrier and optimized gas ring clearances to eliminate the possibility of gas leakage during operation."

Included with the lower: the single piece, solid forged, non-removable, over sized for gloves trigger guard. A typical six position telescoping stock is standard, along with sling mounts allowing for single or double point sling attachment. There is even a bayonet lug just in case. All of the M&P15 Sport’s parts are interchangeable with the rest of their AR15 product line. The M&P15 Sport’s barrel isn’t an M4 cut. This cut in the barrel will allow to mount a M203 grenade launcher. This additional cut also does not help the harmonics of the barrel. We think this a advantage that will help accuracy but will ultimately come down to the ammo used. The Smith sports a full profile barrel of American 4140 Steel. The bolt carrier and gas key are chromed, and the barrel sports their Melonite coating. Smith claims that the bare bones approach has no effect on durability. There have been reviews with this rifle firing 85,000 rounds of various brands of ammunition without any visible damage to the Melonite finish. We have found this to be a very reliable platform and so have law enforcement and countless other agencies. The engineers at Smith and Wesson made a great call when deciding to reduce the cost of their AR15 by not including a forward assist most shooters don’t use forward assists often, and when they do, it can lead to a dangerous situation. When using a forward assist, there is a potential for an inexperienced shooter to use the forward assist to jam the bolt forward when it is not the right response to a jam. A forward assist on any AR15 could cause the cartridge to get super stuck in the rifle. The original Mil Spec on the AR-15 did not include the forward assist. Smith and Wesson made another good call deciding not adding a dust cover to their M&P Sport AR15. Most AR15 shooters have little or no need for a dust cover because they’re firing from safe and clean environments. The M&P Sport is mostly used at shooting ranges, hunting, etc. In this day and age everyone is looking for the best value out there and with out any doubt this is it, you are defiantly not paying for any unneccessary features on this model."

It is a Nikon Prostaff 5, 2.5-10x50mm with ballistic reticle, and goes for $303 right now on Amazon, as of the date I created this post - look: http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-PROSTAFF-Riflescope-Black-2-5-10x50/dp/B00BAHVBDC . Like New / Pristine Condition. Price: $720 for everything except scope, or a better deal at $955 for everything including scope. Hard to get into a real custom precision rig like this one, for less money than that. (Old prices were $850 / $1,105, so this is a large reduction and I'm taking a loss). I will sell the barreled action, dies, and brass (no stock or rings) for $300.Shipping Info: Add $45 for shipping in Lower 48. If you are in-state (MT), it is shipped FedEx ground, insured to your door per BATFE regs (but you have to text me your driver's license and I do a background check for convictions). If you are in any other state, it is shipped via FedEx ground, insured to your FFL, for the same price. Thanks for looking. Text or call REDACTED to buy or for more pics.

I bought this new and love it. I have shot 410 slugs and buckshot as well as many different kinds of 22LR from it with never one misfire. 
Both the 22LR and 410 shoots straight.
I took the trigger guard off but still have it. Easy to take off or put back on just one pin holds it in place.
I preferred the guard off, for folding tighter when packing it.
The military version never had a guard on it.
This is a super cool gun

This is the special custom shop SAS edition, which has had all the edges and corners of the slide rounded to make it snag free.  I upgraded the grips to the Hogue rubber wrap-around grips with finger grooves.  I found that it gave a little more swell for the palm area to grip and allowed for more accurate shooting.  I also have a reduced weight spring, if you want to lighten the trigger, but I have not installed it.  It includes one 7-round magazine.  I have a laser sight, made specifically for this model, that I'm selling separately.  Low round count, in the neighborhood of 300rds.  Very well kept/cleaned, and coated in frog lube.  All the P938's have night sights and stainless slides.  This pistol replaced my Glock 26 and my Kahr PM9, but I find that I like my LC9s just a little better as a concealed carry piece (especially since I carry appendix).

The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.How Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-HaveThe CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ TechnologyIt allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round.Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols.Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot.Size & FeaturesWith an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster.The CCP comes in stylish stainless or Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation.This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface.Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide."

Multi Flow System is basically an ebb & flow type hydroponic system that uses gravity as its major source of moving water through the system. The brains of this system is a controller unit assembly which consists of a 3.5 gallon container, with a timer and relay box mounted on the side, and float switches mounted inside of it to control the level of water in the system automatically. Each timer pin on the controller has a duration of 15 minutes which allows for better control over watering cycles. Each pin pushed down on the timer will water the system for 15 minutes. This is an advantage over most 30 minute increment timers because the plants really only need to be watered to the point the roots are saturated and then the water should be drained out. Also, because this system is an ebb & flow system, as the water is drained out it actually pulls oxygen down to the roots.

I have had a hard time figuring out what to value this package at but would like $900 for the package which is pretty fair considering that's about what the pistol cost new not including the extras.

All products are new and in original packaging unless otherwise indicated. We do not accept any trades. All listings are for SALE ONLY. All sales are online only and can not be picked up in person. This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comThe newly re-designed GG&G Heavy Duty XDS Bipod with swiveling capability now offers a greater range than previous versions. In addition to a much stronger pivot mechanism, the new design affords 25 degrees of cant in either direction of center. Not only does this increase better rough terrain adjustability, but this pivoting capability allows the deployed bipod leg to be used as a vertical foregrip if required for rapid transition. In addition, a tension mechanism and adjustment knob has been added so that the operator does not need tools to make tension adjustments to the swivel. The GG&G Heavy Duty XDS Tactical Bipod is specifically designed and manufactured to meet current military requirements. It is exceptionally rugged. It will not only withstand extreme environmental conditions from –55 degrees Fahrenheit to +155 degrees Fahrenheit, but be operational under those conditions. Manufactured from aircraft grade 6061 T6 aluminum alloy with extreme duty connection points and fasteners, this swiveling bipod is still remarkably lightweight at only 17 oz. Features include a 8"" to 10.5"" height adjustment when measured from the dovetail attachment, silent deployment, fully adjustable legs with thumbnut adjustments, and grip tight foot pads. All aluminum parts are bead blasted and Type III hard coat anodized per mil-spec in a non reflective matte black combat finish. The bipod is equipped with a MIL-STD-1913 rail adapter that does not require tools for installation. The bipod will also attach to any rifle with a 6 o’clock under barrel MIL-STD-1913 or Weaver type rail.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GG&G EXTREME DUTY SWIVEL BIPOD, HEAVY DUTY"

This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comThe newly re-designed GG&G Extreme Duty Bipod with swiveling capability now offers a greater range than previous versions. In addition to a stronger pivot mechanism, the new design affords 25 degrees of cant in either direction of center. Not only does this increase better rough terrain adjustability, but this pivoting capability allows the deployed bipod leg to be used as a vertical foregrip if required for rapid transition. In addition, a tension mechanism and adjustment knob has been added so that the operator does not need tools to make tension adjustments to the swivel. The GG&G Tactical Bipod is specifically designed and manufactured to meet current military requirements. It is exceptionally rugged. It will not only withstand extreme environmental conditions from –55 degrees Fahrenheit to +155 degrees Fahrenheit, but be operational under those conditions. With the bipod legs deployed it will withstand the military’s three foot drop test onto a concrete floor while mounted to an AR15/M16 or M4 carbine and maintain full battle capability. Manufactured from aircraft grade 6061 T6 aluminum alloy with extreme duty connection points and fasteners, this swiveling bipod is still remarkably lightweight at only 11.5 oz. Features include a 7"" to 9.5"" height adjustment when measured from the dovetail attachment, silent deployment, fully adjustable legs with thumbnut adjustments, and grip tight foot pads. All aluminum parts are bead blasted and Type III hard coat anodized per mil-spec in a non reflective matte black combat finish. The bipod is equipped with a MIL-STD-1913 rail adapter that does not require tools for installation. The bipod will also attach to any rifle with a 6 o’clock under barrel MIL-SPEC-1913 or Weaver type rail.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GG&G EXTREME DUTY SWIVEL BIPOD, STANDARD"

The G.P.S.™ system offers the operator a number of advantages including: -Increased Speed -Increased Accuracy -Increased Weapon Flexibility -Stronger than conventional vertical grips -Smaller Than Non-Integrated Solutions -Retracted Bi-Pod Reduces Entanglement Factor The vertical fore-grip is widely known throughout the armies and tactical communities of the world to enhance control, accuracy, and speed of short range /CQB (close quarter battle) target acquisition. This is true for soldiers utilizing all types of small arms (submachine guns, rifles, and light machineguns). Medium to long-range target acquisition requires more precise accuracy, and most if not all, police and military snipers worldwide utilize bipods to enhance their ability to make surgically precise long-range shots. The G.P.S.™ fore-grip allows better performance while moving through faster, more accurate target acquisition, and the G.P.S.™ bi-pod allows better performance while prone through increased stability and precision - Now you can have the best of both worlds.Available in color: Black and Tan.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GRIP POD, VERTICAL GRIP WITH BUILT IN BIPOD"

 Starting with their Extra Large Frame, the Smith & Wesson engineers worked to deliver maximum velocity - over 2,300 feet per second - to reach the target faster than ever before. The 460XVR™ has interchangeable compensators to accommodate every load and its ""gain-twist"" rifled barrel means superb long-range accuracy (beyond 200 yards) with every shot!

The G.P.S.™ is manufactured from aerospace materials to exceed military specifications for construction and finish. It mounts directly to Picatinny rail systems, and additional mounting options will be available soon. Patents are pending. The G.P.S.™ system offers the operator a number of advantages including: -Increased Speed -Increased Accuracy -Increased Weapon Flexibility -Stronger than conventional vertical grips -Smaller Than Non-Integrated Solutions -Retracted Bi-Pod Reduces Entanglement Factor The vertical fore-grip is widely known throughout the armies and tactical communities of the world to enhance control, accuracy, and speed of short range /CQB (close quarter battle) target acquisition. This is true for soldiers utilizing all types of small arms (submachine guns, rifles, and light machineguns). Medium to long-range target acquisition requires more precise accuracy, and most if not all, police and military snipers worldwide utilize bipods to enhance their ability to make surgically precise long-range shots. The G.P.S.™ fore-grip allows better performance while moving through faster, more accurate target acquisition, and the G.P.S.™ bi-pod allows better performance while prone through increased stability and precision - Now you can have the best of both worlds.Available in color: Tan.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GRIP POD, VERTICAL GRIP WITH BUILT IN BIPOD, LAW ENFORCEMENT MODEL"

All products are new and in original packaging unless otherwise indicated. We do not accept any trades. All listings are for SALE ONLY. All sales are online only and can not be picked up in person. This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comDesigned in partnership with Tango Down, the Vltor Bipod is a sturdy and lightweight unit that mounts to the left and right side rails of the weapon. It locks at every 90-degree angle to fold out of the way when not in use and is adjustable for height. The Vltor Modpod utilizes the rail mounting components of the Scout Mount series and the TangoDown bipod. At first, Vltor was originally going to develop their own bipod legs, but instead chose the robust TD legs. Unlike the TD bipod, Vltor bipod legs fold forward and rearward, locking into each 90 degree position. This gives the user multiple mounting options. Most rail systems will work with the Vltor ModPod, but with a few exceptions, including the 7-inch (Carbine Length) rail system. If mounted at the muzzle end of the rail and with the legs folded, the bipods legs may interfere with the weapons ejection process. So, for the short rail systems, Vltor recommends a mid-mounted position. Mid-length rail systems are a little more bipod friendly; unless they are totally extended (third position) then it may hamper the ejection process. The ModPod was mainly developed for a rifle/SPR type system. With the legs totally extended, the bipod legs work perfectly on any rifle length rail system. Design: Lightweight, durable and simple. When mounted to the weapon, there is full access to the bottom handguard/rail. Feet are adjustable to three different lengths. Construction: Impact and temperature resistant polymer, specially blended for TangoDown. Metal components are both stainless steel and aircraft aluminum alloy. Compatibility: Mounts to any weapon that features a 3 and 9 o’clock position Picatinny-railed handguard/rail system. Weight: 10.6 oz. Length: (from the centerline of the pivot): 8.430” collapsed. Length: (from the centerline of the pivot): 10.940” totally extended. Color/Finish: All ModPods have a matte (anti-reflection) finish. ModPods are only available in Flat Dark Earth (Tan).Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: VLTOR MODPOD BIPOD"

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comKINETIC DEVELOPMENT KINECT M-LOK BIPOD ADAPTER FOR HARRIS TYPE BIPODSThe Kinect™ by KDG for MLOK™ is a revolutionary QD mounting system that will change the way we attach accessories to our modular weapons platforms. Much like the Sidelok™ for Picatinny attachment, Kinect™ insures proper and easy installation, eliminating common variables that would cause issues.(ie: over tightening) Although revolutionary, Kinect™ is quite simple in its operation. There are two spring-loaded wedges in the base of the Kinect™ mounting point. When you press the accessory or rail section down in the MLOK™ slot, two tiny deployment triggers get pressed against the rail firing the wedges into place. There is nothing more frustrating that fiddling with an allen wrench (if you can find it) to get your accessories on an off your weapon with traditional modular rail sections. This changes the whole dynamic of the MLOK™ system and really makes every accessory truly removable with the ability to mount it in a second when needed.SPECS:  Length: 1.68″ (42.8mm) Use with one MLOK section Width: .82″ (20.9mm) Height (Over MLOK): .41″ (10.5mm) Finish: Black Anodized Compatibility: Compatible with any MLOK rail system and Harris “style” bipod Weight: 1.0 oz    ***Please allow your new Kinect piece a break in period, due to the new anodizing finish.***The Kinect Pieces are made fully assembled from the factory and not intended to be disassembled by the end user. Because these are mechanical items, all kinect pieces are tested multiple times at the factory to insure they work properly and are securely mounted onto MLOK rails. So if you see marks of use on your new Kinect piece, do not worry, that is the factory test marks. Since the MLOK system has varying tolerances, each Kinect piece may attached differently to each different manufacturers rail. (ie: thicker rails, thinner rails, rails of different materials) Kinect was designed to work with the full range of MLOK accessories on the market.

From Wilson's Website:
Executives, professionals in all walks of life, and others who carry daily asked for Wilson Combat®’s legendary reliability, fit, and finish in a package even smaller than our Professional series – with the excellent recovery characteristics and accuracy offered by our innovative heavy cone barrel. The S.D.S. is the answer we provided. It includes the best of several of our models, enhanced with a 4 1/16” version of the hand-fit, heavy flanged cone match grade barrel pioneered on our Tactical Elite, and a frame shortened by ½” with 7 round capacity. The slide length is reduced by a full inch from a standard length 1911, giving you a speed advantage in target acquisition with the shorter sighting plane. The shorter frame S.D.S. with the accompanying short slide gives you the maximum concealability available with outstanding accuracy and successive shot recovery. Many shooters find the S.D.S’s near perfect balance and controllability exceeds many pistols with 5” barrels.

This is a civilian model not a military surplus version. Made in 1946. Factory Redfield 75 micrometer sights. Factory Unertl scope bases. Has wear on the bluing and some small spots of patina on the front sight and barrel. Trigger guard and bottom metal is all patina. Some dings and scratches. Bolt is factory case hardened with that rainbow look as well as the rear sight mount. Trigger is adjustable and breaks at around 2 lbs. I have many up close pictures I can email for details. Still in nice shape for a 69 year old rifle. Rifle will include a $100.00 Ken Viani scope mount with life time guarantee DuraSight rings. The scope mount attaches to factory drilled and tapped holes so the rifle did not have to be modified.  Most accurate 22 rifle I've ever owned so far. My best 50 yard 5 shot group is 0.202 center to center using Norma Tac 22 ammo. Rifle was scoped at the time. It also likes CCI standard velocity ammo.

The reason I'm selling this is my wife doesn't like me having so many guns and one had to go.
