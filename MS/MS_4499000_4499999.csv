Site description below.
The Remington® R-25 Semi-Auto Rifle is built on the proven AR-10 platform, using the direct-impingement gas system, where gas is ported down a tube into the action to cycle the rotary bolt locking mechanism. The lack of an operating rod and piston allows the barrel to be free-floated, greatly improving inherent accuracy. Movement of the bolt carrier in-line with the bore, and the recoil spring inside the stock reduces recoil and muzzle jump considerably, allowing for rapid follow up shots at multiple targets or running game. The Model R-25's operation controls, including the bolt hold open/release, mag release, and forward assist, are the same as those of AR semi-automatic rifles. The Remington R-25 has a 20"" fluted barrel that reduces weight and enhances heat dissipation. Both upper and lower are machined from rugged aluminum forgings, and a machined aluminum fore-end tube surrounds the free-floated barrel. A receiver-length Picatinny rail allows the attachment of AR tactical sights, or hunting scopes. A crisp, single-stage trigger comes from the factory set at 4-1/2 to 5 lbs. The Remington R-25 Semi-Auto Rifle comes with a 4-round magazine, and is compatible with aftermarket DPMS 308 Win-type magazines of greater capacity. Includes front and rear sling swivels. Made in USA. - See more at: http://t.basspro.com/Remington-R25-Autoloading-Rifle/product/REDACTED2026/#sthash.53dpPsIY.dpuf

Federal's proven reputation for highly consistent loading is married together with Nosler's Partition projectiles to produce an accurate, consistent, and deadly hunting load.

Nosler has been producing the Partition line of projectiles since 1948 and it continues to set the standard for premium hunting bullets. The Partition design features a fully tapered copper alloy jacket that is designed to rupture instantly at the thin jacket mouth and due to the thickening jacket along the bullet's axis, it controls expansion and curls the jacket uniformly outward at both high and low velocities. This makes this cartridge effective at both close and long range. This bullet is sure to deliver superior mushrooming upon impact while retaining more than 2/3's of its original weight for deep penetration.

This gun is just about brand new. I mean REALLY NEW!!!!
Still has a mint Glenfield sticker on it clean as the day bought.
Bought new in 1984. Shot only 5 rounds in 1984 on my birthday at the field and stream. Than put in a padded protective case and didn't touch it until April 2015(31 years later) when I took it out to the range to shoot 8 rounds to check it out to sell since I never really was into guns. Took it to several gun dealers to have them check it out fully. All of them said its sweet but Delaware is not a rifle hunting state. Better suited for rifle states.
Buyer pays proper transfer and background check fees at fully licensed gun dealer. Certified check only. received and cleared prior to transfer. Prefer local pickup so transfer can take place at local gun shop."

 NP3® – THE ADVANTAGES

•Increases reliability
•It requires little to no oil for lubrication, although we recommend using some oil during break in.
•Very accurate and even coatings on all activated surfaces.
•Cleaning is minimal
•Permits firing for longer periods of time between cleaning, as dirt and powder residue has no wet or oily surface to cling to.
•NP3 has a micro hardness of 48-51 Rockwell as plated (nickel matrix).
•NP3® is very corrosion resistant, a 1 mil (.001) coating exceeding a 250 hour salt spray test.
•NP3® has a high lubricity and low friction co-efficient; therefore, the life expectancy of a firearm will be greatly increased due to reduced friction wear.
•The coating is strippable with no effect on the base metal, allowing other coatings to be applied or a new coating of NP3® to be applied, if necessary.

 NP3® – THE ADVANTAGES

•Increases reliability
•It requires little to no oil for lubrication, although we recommend using some oil during break in.
•Very accurate and even coatings on all activated surfaces.
•Cleaning is minimal
•Permits firing for longer periods of time between cleaning, as dirt and powder residue has no wet or oily surface to cling to.
•NP3 has a micro hardness of 48-51 Rockwell as plated (nickel matrix).
•NP3® is very corrosion resistant, a 1 mil (.001) coating exceeding a 250 hour salt spray test.
•NP3® has a high lubricity and low friction co-efficient; therefore, the life expectancy of a firearm will be greatly increased due to reduced friction wear.
•The coating is strippable with no effect on the base metal, allowing other coatings to be applied or a new coating of NP3® to be applied, if necessary.
•NP3® plated onto stainless steel guns will prevent galling, a problem common with stainless steel.
•NP3® is a satin gray, non-reflective color ideal for all firearms.
•NP3® can be plated to all internal parts giving a smoothness to the action not found with any other coating.
•In cases where the NP3® has been perforated, the corrosion shows no tendency to spread or migrate under the coating.
•NP3® is guaranteed against corrosion, peeling or flaking for the lifetime of the firearm.

Comes with 2 mags, hard case, mag loader and extra backstrapsThis new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in Taurus' opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.What I personally love about this pistol is you have the option of carrying like any other double action pistol, or carry it ""Cocked and Locked"" like a 1911.Only $299 plus tax.

He is placing ads all over the country for cheap, yet good quality AK's for $300. I emailed him and asked for pics- he sent me stock photos off of Google- one of them was even an airsoft rifle! When I pushed him about the photos,  he got defensive and told me 'he don't deal with people that don't trust him""- that ""I should trust in the quality of what I want"" whatever the heck that means. 
I asked him again for photos of an actual rifle in his possession and again got defensive demanding I place my order before he had to prove anything. He had been in this business a long time and  essentially didn't have the time to prove his legitimacy. At this point for me, there were too many red flags. 
I know there are a lot of honest  and law abiding folks using ARMSLIST and until this one, have enjoyed every contact I have made.

Firearm is like-new. Firearm is totally stock, no mods/custom work has been done. Have only shot around 200-300 rounds though the weapon. 

Comes with all items that were included in the original purchase: the firearm itself, 2 magazines (10 round), Glock magazine loader, firearm case, test fire cartridges from the factory, paperwork, and action lock. 

Also, selling with 150 rounds of 230 grain ammo (FMJ), 100 rounds of 185 grain ammo (FMJ), and 20 rounds of 230 grain Horandy Critical Defense rounds, as well as a gently used SHTF IWB holster. 

Holster has adjustable height, canter, and retention. Holster is a leather Kydex hybrid. Very comfortable and sturdy.  

This is a package deal. All items will sell together. 

I used this firearm as my EDC. There is no holster rash on the weapon, however, the only flaw on the firearm is a small gouge in the frame. This does not affect the performance of the weapon and is purely cosmetic. 

Firearm shoots great, able to get tight groups, smooth trigger pull, and manageable recoil for a small weapon chambered in .45 ACP. 

Selling because I recently acquired a new EDC firearm and have no need for a second. 

I WILL REQUIRE the buyer to furnish a valid driver's licence AND/OR a valid CCW. 

NO felons. MUST be able to LEGALLY own a firearm in the state of GA.

11 shot (!) fast handling- cocks on closing FIGHTING RIFLE! This example built in 1965. Rear sight calibrated to 800 yards. A 2A/2A1 is a 7.62mm NATO (7.62×51mm) calibre bolt-action rifle adopted as a reserve arm by the Indian Armed Forces in 1963. The design of the rifle - initially the Rifle 7.62mm 2A - began at the Ishapore Rifle Factory of the Ordnance Factories Board in India. 

The Ishapore 2A and 2A1 rifles are often incorrectly described as "".308 conversions"". In fact, the 2A/2A1 rifles are not conversions of .303 calibre SMLE Mk III* rifles: they were designed and built right from the outset to fire 7.62mm NATO ammunition."
