Living in Ottawa County, this was my primary deer gun.  I've killed many deer between 50 and 220 yards with this shotgun using Copper Solids.  (Admittedly, the 220 yard kill was about a foot over hold and kinda lucky.. haha)

The shotgun is in Excellent condition and completely mechanically sound and functional.
-- I've only ever had a fully rifled slug barrel on this shotgun and have always fired Remington Copper Solid Sabot Slugs as my first shell followed by cheaper lead Buckhammer shells if a quick 2nd or 3rd shot was needed to drop a wounded deer or in case of multiple deer in the same area.
-- After returning home from the Marines I added the synthetic butt stock with the pistol grip to make it more like the M16 I was so familiar with.  Makes an incredible different with control ability and movement.
-- Shell holder was added to both the left side of the chamber and the right side of the butt stock.  (I typically kept extra Copper Solids up front and extra cheaper lead follow up shots in the rear.)

Shotgun is incredibly accurate and holds a very precise grouping when shot well.
I always kept it zeroed at just over 100 yards.

**The Leupold VX-I   3-9x40 mm scope IS NOT included in the price; however, I could leave it on (untouched and still nearly completely zeroed) for an additional $200.
(The additional price would include the Leupold, the rings, and the pop open lens covers.)

Feel free to get a hold of me with questions and I'll do my best to answer them all.

I also have 4 12 round magazines and 1 22 round magazine, 6 boxes of ammo, Blackhawk holster, original case and all original parts. 

I have modded the gun a little with a 3.5lb trigger and a punisher back place and punisher filler for the magazine hole. 

All in all the gun cost me $500, the 40SW barrel was $100, the holster $25, the 5 magazines total atleast $100, the punisher additions plus the 6 boxes of ammo and not to mention every magazine is filled with ammo as well. So there is quite a bit of money in this thing. 

I simply never use it so wanted to give it a home it will be loved in."

This gun is being sold as used, but has never been shot.  It has been stored in my safe.  It may have some light handling marks.  

The 376 is the hardest hitting Steyr cartridge and would make an excellent hog gun considering it has open sights.  This also has weaver bases on it and will easily take a scope.  It uses the bases of a Browning A Bolt, so they are plentiful.

Included is a full sealed case of Hornady 270 grain ammo.  This is 200 rounds of ammo.  It is about $2.50 a round.  So there is about $500.00 worth of ammo included.

I want $850.00 for the gun and the 200 rounds of ammo.

For some reason this website stretches out the photos.  Contact me and I will email better pictures if interested.

128,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4799128,For Sale:  anti personel mineTS-50,"deerfield beach, Broward, South Florida",$ 50,"Listed On: Thursday, February 4, 2016",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The mine has a ribbed plastic case which is olive green, brown or sand colored. The mine has a central raised pressure pad on the top surface of the mine, but is designed to operate even with the mine upside down. Pressure on the mine forces air through a diaphragm into a small rubber air bag, which inflates. As the bag inflates it pushes a shutter, which in turn removes the striker retaining lug. The striker is free to impact the detonator. The mine requires an average of 0.11 seconds of continuous pressure of an about 5 to 11 lbs before the fuze will detonate. This allows the mine to be laid in a high density pattern without the shock of a detonation impacting the nearby mines."

H4831SC - Ballistically, this Extreme Extruded powder is the exact copy of H4831. Physically, it has a shorter grain size, therefore, the designation SC or short cut. The shorter, more compact kernels allow the powder to flow through the powder measures more smoothly, helping to alleviate the constant cutting of granules. With the smoother flow characteristics comes more uniform charge weights, while the individual grains orient more compactly, creating better loading density.

Well its because its the competition ready model, its got a longer 5.25"" barrel, which in turn gives you a longer sight radius, the top portion of the slide is milled out to balance the slides extra length. The sights aren't regular 3 dots either, the front sight is fiber optic with green and red tubes. The rear is all black and serrated to prevent glare and is both windage and elevation adjustable. I've also invested in having it stippled for texture, nothing crazy but I don't like cleaning grip tape gunk off guns. a serpa holster and extra mags bringing total to (4) 19 round mags. It also comes with the XD gear holster, dual mag carrier and speed loader. The pistol alone costs more than $784 new especially in the two tone configuration. I'm asking $700 for the whole package."

Secondly being that it doesn't have a detachable magazine you don't need to worry about losing any of them while hunting. Another great advantage is that being tube fed, this rifle is able to fire 3 different types of .22 rim fire ammunition making it versatile as well as reliable. It will feed, load, extract and eject .22 short, .22 long,  and the most popular .22 Long Rifle. Place a scope on and have an amazingly accurate and reliable package. I can add ammo and take you shooting if its your first rifle I love firearms and do my best to promote their safety."

Looking for a cheap, used, functional, double barrel shotgun so:

""I got these Damascus barrels so you can only use black powder...""  PASS
""I have this expensive custom engraved receiver of my grandfather strangling a duck""  NO!
""I'll sell you my imported Italiano, sneezed upon by a dead Pope for $1,000,000,000....""  HELL NO!
I can get a brand new Stoger for $395 so please, no price gougers.

This gun was being restored by a specialty gunsmith who passed away before completing it. It will be a shooter, the mechanism functions but needs finesse to cock it (needs to be pulled back very hard). A bit of filing should fix it. If you pull the mechanism plate, it cocks and fires perfectly, so there is just a bit too much metal somewhere. Priced to sell quickly,  these generally go for $1000+. Open to offers and trades.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.



The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of various accessories. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.



The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward"

I'm selling a mint condition Kimber Ultra Raptor II. This is the all black version. Its been to the range once and had two 100 rounds boxes through it. Absolutely no stovepipes, FTE's, etc. Its been cleaned and either stored or carried since then. This is one of the lightest 3'' 1911's on the market. This has been my primary concealed so I invested in just about every carry option available including a leather OWB hip holster, a leather SOB (small of back holster), two Fobus paddle holsters (the KM3 which says ""Kimber"" on it and the C21B which takes all 1911 models), and a tuckable leather holster. I can send more or more detailed pictures if desired. Box, manual, all factory paperwork, and lock are included. Also included are two black (blued) Kimber magazines and one stainless Kimber magazine with a slam pad. I also have a pair of dark charcoal VZ Operator grips that fit this beautifully. The full list is below including the prices I paid for each. I do not expect you to pay what I paid for everything. I'm simply showing common, retail price for each. If you're looking for a EDC 3'' 1911, this is a complete setup. I'll even toss in a box of HP ammo.
