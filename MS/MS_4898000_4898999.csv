I purchased this rifle new in Columbus, Ohio about six months ago. I have put about 400 rounds through it. It is a very accurate rifle and has NEVER not fired a round when I pulled the trigger. The only reason I am getting rid of it is because I want an extended rail without the standard A2 sight. The only modification I have made is installing a quad rail. I still have the stock fore grip which can be installed again by simply unscrewing the aftermarket rail. 

I will include with the purchase one PMAG.

Excellent concealed carry weapon,February 9, 2015
By Sungloblu from Southwest Florida(read all my reviews)(read all my reviews)
Advantages: Lightweight, highly concealable, holds up over years of use, never fails to fire
Disadvantages: slower reload than semi-auto
"" This was one of the first handguns of many that I bought several years ago. It is the most used concealed carry weapon that we have. I prefer the feel and punch of a Model 60 or a medium-sized semi-auto but there are times and attire that make this little jewel the best choice. This is my wife's preferred carry weapon. It shows signs of use, as any carry weapon will, but it is light, yet solid and never fails. On a bad day at the range, my wife puts all of her shots on a body target at 15 yards. On good day when she if well practiced from frequent visits to the range, she holds a 6-8 inch group at 15 yards. One day I'm going to get another 637 or a 642. ""

By matthedingoduk (read all my reviews)(read all my reviews)
Advantages: very light weight, cleans easily, small package with a big punch, fits well in different sized hands, very comfortable to shoot
Disadvantages: absolutely none!
"" I purchased this pistol for my wife to carry once she gets her CC licence. It's super light weight but still feels very solid and didn't have as much kick as I was expecting for the weight. I haven't shot the +P rounds yet but I expect it to be a pleaseure as well! I like it so much I'm seriously thinking of buying another one for me to carry! Can't go wrong with this little slice of .38 heaven! ""

It's 20 years old and has been lightly used. Overall the condition is very good, if you take it hunting this year, you don't have to fear using it. It feeds .44 SPL. and/or .44 MAGNUM rounds interchangably like the older REAL MARLINS (of course it's JM marked). I don't have the box, I bought it for Cowboy Action shooting. Yes, it's about the same price as a ""new' RE-MARLIN (cheaper than a Henry ""bigboy""), but do you want to deal with sending a new gun back to try to get it feeding reliably? Available for local CASH sale only as I can't do pictures of any kind and will not ship. For pictures see the pawn dealer listings with a PAGE of  listings for EACH PRIVATE SALE + TAX. PRICE FIRM. Even if you can find a REAL Marlin in a pistol caliber, some pawnboys have a 3 day wait! This is for SALE, not trade.

Up for sale is a Remington Autoloading Rifle; this model later became known as the Model 8, the granddaddy of deer rifles. This example is chambered in .30 Remington and was produced in 1908. Bluing is about 60% (receiver is 95%, barrel shroud about 30%) and the wood, while worn, is in great condition for being over 100 years old. I have shot it; the barrel is a bit sticky and should be taken apart to be cleaned. The action is solid.

The rifle comes with 32 rounds of ammo + 1 spent case. Ammo for this rifle is scarce and costs $2-3 per round. Buffalo Arms is the only ammo manufacturer that I know of that produces this ammo, and they only make it from time to time. RCBS does make dies for .30 Remington (cannot use .30-30 dies, though bullets and load data are the same). If you have the tools, you can convert .30-30 brass by turning down the rim, cutting an extractor groove, and fire-forming the brass (different shoulder angles)."

American Tactical Imports 22 Round 22 LR w/16.25"" Barrel & Synthetic Stock
The GSG 5 is an identical replication of the MP 5, except one great thing: Its a 22 cal. Because of the low cost of ammunition the GSG 5 makes a perfect plinking rifle, training rifle or a serious varmint hunting rifle. Nothing of its kind has ever been introduced in the United States. The user will be impressed with its weight and performance. If you are a varmint hunter you will be encouraged by all the options the GSG-5 has to offer with its railing system, faux suppressor and easy change magazine. For training purposes, the GSG-5 is a low cost alternative for Law Enforcement agencies.

Each unit allows for vertical adjustment (by using head straps), fore-and-aft adjustment, objective lens focus and eyepiece focus. The device is also equipped with an Infrared light-emitting source. The ATN NVM14-3 Night Vision Monocular utilizes the principle of intensification of the residual light which is reflected from the surrounding objects. The optical system of the Night Vision Monocular consists of an objective lens, an Image Intensifier Tube and an eyepiece. Even under unsteady brightness conditions, Automatic Brightness Adjustment System always keeps the IIT brightness level constant. The Automatic Protective System controls the existing illumination level through the photo receiver. If the illumination level surpasses 100-300 lx for the following 10 seconds, the Monocular will shut off automatically. The eyepiece incorporates several LED indicators: - Red - serves as an IR Illuminator Indicator and an Battery Low Indicator at a time. - Green - serves as an Excessive Brightness Indicator. If the bright light remains unchanged for over 10 seconds after the indicator turns on, the Monocular will automatically shut-off. Features: - Compact and rugged design - Waterproof - Head or helmet mountable for hands-free usage - Weapon mountable - Auto Brightness Control - Bright Light Cut-off - Total Darkness Technology with built-in infrared illuminator and flood lens - Compatible with most IR lasers - Adaptable for use with cameras - Ergonomic, simple, easy-to-operate controls - Utilizes either a 123A Lithium battery or an AA Alkaline - Battery Adapter included - Optionally available patented Life Tracker System for measuring hours of operation - Limited two-year warranty Specifications: - Total Darkness IR System: Yes - ""SMART"" Technology: No - Multi-Purpose System: Yes - IIT Generation: 3 - Resolution: 64 lp/mm - Magnification: 1x - Lens System: F1.2, 27 mm - Proshield Lens Coating: Yes - FOV: 40 - Range of Focus: 0.25 m to infinity - Diopter Adjustment: -6 to +2 - Controls: Digital - Automatic Brightness Control: Yes - Bright Light Cut-off: Yes - Automatic Shut-off System: Yes - Infrared Illuminator: Yes (Built-in with flood lens) - IR Indicator: Yes (in FOV) - Low Battery Indicator: Yes (in FOV) - Power Supply: (1) 3 V lithium, or (1) AA Alkaline - Battery Life: 50 hrs - Environmental Rating: Waterproof - MIL-STD-810: Complies - Operating Temperature: -40 to +50 C - Storage Temperature: -50 to +70 C - Dimensions: 120x49x69 mm / 4.7""x1.9""x2.7"" - Weight: 0.34 kg / 0.75 lbs - Warranty: 2 years

This gun set is no more, or less accurate than the usual GSP Expert, but does not have the recoil buffers, or cost-reducing production methods.  It does include a 2 stage trigger, but single stage can be provided.  The grip uses the newer bottom bolt system.  Two grips are provided, the OEM Walther with finger grooves, and the more accuraate Nill grip without the groves.

Roughly 7 commercial versions were offered, not counting the OSPs, prototypes, and commemorative editions. Here is most of what is available. Price for each gun is at the of EACH INDIVIDUAL description. Shipping runs $40 to 80 depending on method. Those that are “fixed” (lower offers NOT considered) have a !. There is a discount for multiple guns. No shipping charge for total purchases over $2500. On the others, close offers are considered. The stated price for each gun is with one magazine, but additional magazines for each are available, as are cantilevered frame weights and alternative grips (mostly not pictured). The 10” barrel fits all of the guns except for the one OSP that is imaged, or the .32 nickel upper section.

All CAN BE SHIPPED to the FFL of your choice. In many areas these guns are assault weapons so be sure they can be delivered to you. They are CA legal, and in .22lr, MA, MD, and some other states legal as well. All have 5 rd magazines, but can use 10 rd magazines if desired in .22lr. The Walther “James Bond” cases are available as well, but with gun purchase only.

The GSP (and OSP grandfather) is a direct descendant of of the Mauser C96, one of the first true military assault weapons. The OSP was the first such derivation, and evolved into the GSP via modifications by a Mauser engineer and gunsmith (Romitanski). Several prototypes and experimental versions followed, resulting in the first version GSP offered below. From there, a number of clones appeared in the 1960s from a variety of European origins (Germany, Sweden primarily), but the clones did not use the modular structure of the C96, OSP, or GSP. 

The most recent clones are from Pardini and Morini. These are quite good pistols, but do not use the modular structure and component system to the extent of the GSP. Feed systems also is quite different. In the GSP, final feed actually is controlled by channels in the receiver, similar to the FN49. This assures essentially perfect feed, with no bullet tip damage, and is a key factor in the overwhelming continued popularity of the GSP, for decades.

Rifle comes with a Sightron SII 6-24x42 scope.  This is a nice optic made in Japan.  I have included a link below because many people are not familiar with them.
I have the box for the rifle and the scope.  I do not have the factory 5 round magazine anymore, but I do have a 10 round p-mag to replace it.  Comes with a M-223 scope riser/rings.  The A2 stock has quite a few marks on it but the gun is in really good shape other than the A2 stock.  I will throw in 40 rounds of 45G winchester JHP bullets that is shoots super well.  This setup new would cost 1640.00 without tax or shipping and you would not get as nice of a rifle as the new bushmasters are not nearly as nice as the older ones.

I'm still himming and hawing about selling this because I know I'll never find another.

The rifle is a full length Russian Imperial m1891 Mosin Nagant 'three line rifle' chambered for the modern smokeless 7.62x54r. This was a 1917 or 1918 capture by the Finns in the chaos of the Russian revolution. It was also not chopped down into a 91/30 or M39 which is unusual.

The rifle is a 1897 dated Tula on both the receiver tang and original barrel. The stock is in good condition and is a Finnish 2 piece grooved re-work of the original Russian stock. Finish is at a easy 90%+ of a Pre- WWII Finnish arsenal Re-blue. Bore is grayed, sharp rifling, zero pitting or counterbore- not bad for 1897. Typical peened and re-stamped sight markings. SA marked on the left side of the barrel. Bolt is a Remington and forced matched. Butt plate is off by a couple hundred. Pre 1968 import or (bring back?) zero import markings anywhere.

Overall a great collectable Tsarist rifle that still is a nice shooter. 8/10 on the 7.62x54r.net rarity scale.

Pre 1898 antique ships to anyone over 18, no FFL necessary. If you are a serious buyer that has researched and knows the value of the rifle, make an offer.

Would only be interested in trades for high quality HK, Pre-Smith/Umarex Walthers, Pre lock S&W's in .357 or .44 mag, or other high end or collectable firearms.

The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods and more.

The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy. The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like no Savage we’ve ever made.

The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team. Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum. Standard features in this series include an oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots.

I believe the pattern is Real Tree AP.  Zeroed and used in deer stand for a couple seasons, so possibly three boxes of ammo through it if that.  Great condition.  Serious tack driver.  Perfect Carolina deer rifle.  Dropped deer in tracks with both shoulder and head shots.  Read lots of comments of real hunters experiences taking deer and hog prior to making purchase.  I agree with them, the 6.8 in an AR platform is a perfect deer gun.  It just drops them and I don't have to climb down and go looking for my deer.  My 308 on the other hand sent them bolting on several occasions.  My children can adjust the stock and shoot it with about zero recoil too.  I wanted to build an AR so I built another 6.8.  Need to pay for my build so the DD Ambush must go per my agreement with my significant other;)  I think this rifle is the best shooting gun I have ever had the pleasure to use.  Geisslle SSA 2 Stage trigger, cold hammer forged DD barrel, perfect tree stand camo (see pics) and something not on paper, but non the less wonderful.  For some reason, the signature of this 6.8 round, or this gun, I have had other deer just stand there when I take the one right next to them.  I read about the different rapport of the 6.8 on game, and I think there is actually something to it.

JMT has now engineered the best polymer/composite .308 on the market today unparallel by any other with the same refined cosmetics that you find in our AR-15 composite / polymer lower. We invite you to take a look and compare the new JMT .308 to the competition. After doing so, we are completely confident you will choose JMT. Key enhancements include:Extended upper fire control box sections.Upper left magazine well box section.Webbed magazine wells L & R side (matched for MagPul) magazines.Extended bolt release roll pin posts.New JMT Gen2 logo markings.DPMS Compliant The polymer 80% lower receiver for your .308 platform is engineered and manufactured by James Madison Tactical (JMT) in the USA. This is not your average polymer 80 lower, in fact, The JMT .308 80% lower is fully engineered using current finite element structural analysis for reliable, long-term high performance. POLYMER 80 versus ALUMINUMAfter much research in polymer .308 lowers, JMT created its own formula of hybrid polymers and fibers with additional reinforcements in high stress areas to bring you the best .308 lower on the market today. All of the JMT polymer 80 lowers are engineered to Mil Spec tolerances and because it is fashioned from extremely durable fiber polymer materials there are no concerns about corrosion as you may find in aluminum .308 lowers. IN FIELD DURABILITYJMT uses only the best high quality hybrid polymer/composite materials, advanced engineering, precision manufacturing and stringent quality controls. This way you can trust it not only in the harshest field environments but for personal protection as well. PARTS INTERCHANGEABILITYThe Polymer 80 .308 80% lower is designed specifically to Mil Spec tolerances for a high level of interchangeability with other Mil Spec .308 parts and accessories on the market today. This is achieved through current technology and computer aided manufacturing processes combined with exacting quality control procedures. PERSONAL DEFENSE AND PROTECTIONHow you decide to defend and protect yourself and your family is a personal matter. No one wishes to experience a personal breach of your safety or a home invasion but it does happen. The mission at JMT is to give you the assurance in a product you can trust. The operations left to be completed to complete your JMT .308 80% lower are as follows: fire control group, trigger pin, hammer pin, trigger slot and the safety selector hole. This is a not an FFL item. This is not a complete receiver and still requires machining to be done."
