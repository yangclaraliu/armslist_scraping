The rifle has a cosmetic issue: considerable spotting on the right side and top of the receiver.  It appears that some type of liquid was on the rifle during storage, causing the spotting; re-bluing will definitely solve the problem.  

The rifle is in perfect mechanical condition: it consistently puts 3-round groups in the bulls-eye.  The stock and forearm are in very good condition with the only blemishes being pressure marks from normal use.  The rifle comes with Williams sights, Weaver scope mounts, and a Nikon 4.5-14x40 scope mounted on Leupold see-thru rings.  

This BAR delivers bolt-action performance in a caliber whose ballistic performance is comparable to magnum rifles without the magnum recoil.  The buyer gets all of this at the price of a budget rifle: $595.00.

	I have for sale/trade a used but good shape great little carry gun. This is a AMT Backup 380 ACP. I just got this in trade and have not gotten to shoot it myself, but the previous owner said it ran good. It does appear to be tight and still action smoothly though. I would keep this, but i am getting away from 380 caliber and have already sold off all of my 380 ammunition. Need to be able to meet up in Norman if possible due to my schedule. 
	Im mainly looking for cash on this, but i would consider trades as long as they are firearm related. For any offers or questions shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there.

This is Sigs description
From the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop comes the ultimate in concealed carry performance – the P220 SIG Anti-Snag™ Pistol. Chambered in .45ACP, this limited production P220 pistol from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop has gone through a radical dehorning process resulting in an ultra smooth, snag free profile that’s ideal for concealed carry. Each pistol utilizes the new SRT™ trigger system and features a smooth, dehorned stainless steel slide with front SIGLITE® Night Sight and a contrast rear sight over a light weight black hard-anodized alloy frame with rounded trigger guard and dust cover. The P220 SAS comes with the new SIG SAUER® Custom Shop Grips and is covered by a Limited Lifetime Warranty
I purchased a Pelican Storm IM2050 case I was going to use for this pistol but never did. Foam is uncut. I will include it as well or sell it for $45. I also have 200-250 rounds of .45 ammo. 
Cash price is $1000 for everything or trade high end AR (will consider any caliber), bolt gun in 300 win mag or 338 Lapua, high end optics (Vortex, Nightforce etc).. I can add cash for the right deal.
This is NOT compact. I can not find any currently for sale in the United States. Please do your homework before low balling. There is one on gunbroker but it is not custom shop. The P220 carry has been called the best carry firearm in the world by several reviewers/magazines.

This is the full 20"" version and comes with iron sights and a picatinny rail for mounting other optics. If you're reading this you probably know about this rifle and its outstanding quality. The rifle on this barrel is made from 4150 steel and has a 1:7 twist, which mirrors the M16. Most ARs are made from 4140 steel and the Sabre is a little more durable over time. The Sabre was made here in Nashville but they are no longer in production, thus making this a very scarce rifle these days, especially in this condition. It's a great gun for a collection but it's an even better shooter!  The rifle comes with two 20 round magazines. I might consider some trades, especially for high end optics,  but cash would have to be included.  Thanks for looking."

490,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4162490,For Sale:  Pellet Grill Green Mountain Grill (GMG) Daniel Boone Wi-fi - $485,"NE Minneapolis, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",$ 485,"Listed On: Saturday, March 21, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling my Green Mountain Grill (GMG) Daniel Boone Pellet Grill w/stainless lid in NE Minneapolis. This grill is about 3 years old. It has spent two winters in a warm garage since then and most of its life was spent on the west coast out of the harsh winter. It has relatively low hours on it. I have a lot of extras and new parts to go with it. These include: Wi-Fi upgrade controller (last fall). This is a feature that will allow you to connect to the grill through Wi-Fi with your android or apple phone or device. You can monitor and control the grill temp, set cooking profiles to adjust temps at certain time intervals all without having to walk outside in the cold. This grill controller can be set for temps ranging from 150 to 500 degrees. Thermal Blanket (bought this past Nov) this upgrade is basically a welder's blanket type of material that is custom cut to fit this grill like a jacket for cold winter cooks. It will keep pellet consumption down when the temps are cold. I have cooked in -5 temps this past winter with no problems. Stainless steel downdraft hood (New). This feature in the inside of the grill will help even out grate temps and bring the smoke down lower to the meat level. Newer thicker steel drip pan (last fall). This upgrade was a thicker drip pan the helps with lower temps. The other thin one is good for searing. That one is still in great shape and comes with it as well. Second removable upper stainless steel shelf (barely used). This gives you a second upper half shelf of grill space and sits right on top of the grate. Cover, and a new grease bucket. I also replaced the thermal sensor last fall that. This also comes with the older controller board that has the older remote radio controller which you can monitor temps and change temps without going outside. Both still work great. The grill is in over all good shape and works great. The only thing that does not work is the meat probe and you can pick one up on the website for 20$ (I mostly used a maverick anyway). I will also throw in a 15 lbs bag of GMG gold blend pellets to go with it (and another half bag as well if you don't mind an open one). Asking price is $485 OBO. This is a turnkey set up with all the extra goodies which will cost you well over 1k brand new and that would be without the extra controller. If you are interested in getting into pellet smoking but don't want to put out the high upfront costs, this is about the best deal you will find. Easily the best value on CL right now for used pellet grills. This can easily fit two pork butts, maybe 3 depending on the size, 3 racks of baby backs or St Louis style ribs with a fourth if you use the second shelf. 458 square inches of grill space without the second shelf in. This is for local pickup only in NE Minneapolis and you will have to haul it as I no longer have a vehicle capable of transporting it."

This is the final price cut. This unit is two years old but is still brand new in the box and has never been unpacked or powered up. I got two of them a little less than 2 years ago and only ended up using one which I still use today. The other one, this one, sat in my closet for two years and I have no future plans on deploying it so it is now for sale. Out of the box every major feature works such as wifi, router/switch, firewall and VPN. For the UTM features such as IPS, Anti-Virus/Spyware and web filtering, you'll need a license. The 1 year hardware warranty is of course no longer valid. This is hardware only with no license (licenses sold separately when purchased new as well). You can purchase a license directly from Fortinet or go through a regional sales associate (usually cheaper). This is a great unit for a small business, enterprise branch location, home office or even home use (I use one at home). These go for around $950 brand new. Since the warranty is up on the hardware though, I am only asking $400 OBO which is over half off retail, again this is new in the box and has never even been powered up. There is a link below for all of the tech specs on a Fortinet PDF and a few notes from it but read the pdf as there is a LOT more features in it.

Proven Security for Remote Offices, Retail, and Customer Premise Equipment
FortiGate/FortiWiFi-80 Series consolidated security appliances deliver
comprehensive enterprise-class protection for remote locations, branch offices,
customer premise equipment (CPE) and retail networks. FortiGate/FortiWiFi-80
Series platforms feature an integrated set of essential security technologies in
a single device to protect all of your applications and data. Simple per-device
pricing, an integrated management console, and remote management capabilities
significantly reduce costs associated with deployment and management.

Comprehensive Protection
Fortinet's market-leading security technology and research results in appliances
providing unmatched protection against today's sophisticated multi-vector threats.
FortiGate/FortiWiFi consolidated security platforms integrate firewall, IPSec and
SSL VPN, antivirus, antispam, intrusion prevention, web filtering and vulnerability
management into a single device at a single price. They also provide data loss
prevention (DLP), application control, and endpoint NAC.
The FortiGate/FortiWiFi-80 Series specifically addresses many policy enforcement
requirements included in government and industry regulations, such as the PCI
Data Security Standard. They also ease migration to new industry standards such
as IPv6, supporting dynamic routing for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Fortinet's
Global Threat Research Team and ICSA Labs-certified inspection engines ensure
the best possible protection in your network.

Redundant Connectivity
The FortiGate/FortiWiFi-80 Series platforms offer dual WAN Gigabit Ethernet (10/100/1000) links, for load balancing or redundant ISP connections delivering high availability and scalability to small or home office application. Six Fast Ethernet (10/100) internal security zone or switch ports and one dedicated DMZ port eliminate need for additional networking devices, reducing investment and management burden.An ExpressCard slot allows for optional 3G wireless
WAN connectivity such as EV-DO, W-CDMA, HSPA and GPRS, which provides mobile network connectivity for remote deployments or backup data connectivity in the event of a network failure. The FortiGate/FortiWiFi-80CM platforms gives
you the additional convenience and reliability of an analog modem

Firewall
Fortinet firewall technology delivers industry-leading performance
for network and application firewalling including Web 2.0 application
policies based on the application identity, up to and beyond 10 Gbps
throughput. Our technology identifies traffic patterns and links them
to the use of specific applications, such as instant messaging and
peer-to-peer applications, permitting application access control. By
coupling application intelligence with firewall technology, the FortiGate
platform is able to deliver real-time security with integrated application
content level inspection, thereby simplifying security deployments

Intrusion Prevention
IPS technology provides protection against current and emerging
network level threats. In addition to signature-based detection, we
perform anomaly-based detection whereby our system alerts users
to traffic that fits a profile matching attack behavior. This behavior is
then analyzed by our threat research team to identify threats as they
emerge and generate new signatures that will be incorporated into our
FortiGuard services

VPN
Fortinet VPN technology provides secure communications between
multiple networks and hosts, through both secure socket layer, or
SSL, and IPsec VPN technologies, leveraging our custom FortiASIC to
provide hardware acceleration for high-performance communications
and data privacy. Benefits include the ability to enforce complete
content inspection and multi-threat security as part of VPN
communications, including antivirus, IPS and Web filtering. Additional
features include traffic optimization providing prioritization for traffic
across VPNs

Web Filtering
Web filtering technology is a pro-active defense feature that identifies
known locations of malware and blocks access to these malicious
sources. In addition, the technology enables administrators to
enforce policies based on website content categories ensuring
users are not accessing content that is inappropriate for their work
environment. The technology restricts access to denied categories
based on the policy by comparing each Web address request to a
Fortinet hosted database

Antivirus / Antispyware
Antivirus content inspection technology provides protection against
virus, spyware, worms, phishing and other forms of malware being
transmitted over the network infrastructure. By intercepting application
content in transit, and reassembling the data into user expected
content, the FortiGate Antivirus features ensures that malicious threats
hidden within legitimate application content is identified and removed
from the data stream destined for internal (or external) recipients. The
addition of Fortinet's FortiGuard subscription services ensured each
FortiGate has access to updated malware signatures, resulting in
high level of accuracy and detection capabilities including emerging
and newly discovered viruses. ICSA Labs has certified our antivirus
functionality"

Back in the mid 90s, Back in the mid 90s, Kimber of America, located in Oregon (the predecessor to the current Kimber company located in NY), imported a bunch of small ring Swedish Mausers which they subsequently sporterized. The sporterization process included:

-Removing factory sites, turning the barrel down to a sporter contour, and cutting and crowing the barrel at 22”

-Drill and tap for scope mounts

-Install low-profile safety to clear scopes

-Turn down bolt

-Modify follower to allow closing on an empty chamber

-Install Ramline synthetic stock

-Lighten and smoothen original two-stage factory trigger

I completely disassembled this gun, ultrasonically cleaned every part possible, cleaned the barrel and receiver, re-oiled and reassembled the whole thing, and it’s ready to go. I bought this last week because I always wanted one, but as I am want to do, I’ve already moved on to the next firearm project.

Gun is in excellent shape, a few small marks here and there, but I doubt you could find one in better shape. Bore looks great. I doubt it was shot much if at all after sporterization.

I’ll include one boxes of factory loaded S&B 140gr cartridges (20). I do have the original scope bases for this gun, weaver-style. They were a bit chewed up, so I stripped the original finish off them, so they are raw aluminum now. You will need to finish cleaning them up and duracoat, paint, or anodize them.

Aimpoint Micro H-1

Easy to carry and fast to aim 

Small enough to be used anywhere you could put iron sights, these sights can be used on any type of firearm or archery equipment:
•A lightweight rifle with an H-1 Micro mounted on it remains a lightweight rifle!

•A hunting revolver with an H-1 Micro installed remains as easy to carry as with iron sights and is much faster to aim. 

•On a bow, the parallax free H-1 Micro eliminates the need for a peep, allowing you to shoot accurately in lower light.

Unique features of the Micro H-1
•Lightweight – 84 g without mount and 105 g with mount
•Integral Weaver-style base allows easy attachment
•ACET technology allows 50,000 hours of operation on one battery
•Available in 2 dot sizes (2 and 4 MOA)
•Fully waterproof
•Patent pending mount is keyed to the sight body to absorb recoil
•Precision adjustment for windage and elevation: top of protective caps fits into holes on adjustment screws – no other tool required
