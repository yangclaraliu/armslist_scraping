Call or Text anytime  REDACTED This is the ruger 22/45 Lite made exactly as it sounds, as ligth as a feather. Coming in around 22 ounces for the comfort and stability you would come to expect from an american made gun. There is not 1 scratch on this gun from top to bottom as you can see from the pictures. the barrel comes threaded to accept any compensator or suppressor if able to own one. This ruger has been modified with new HiViz front sights which absolutley pop when aiming down the sights. the original ruger grips come with the gun but i have installed rubber hogue grips to insure ultimate grip and control of the firearms for accuracy up to 35 yards easily. Another addition was the addition of the pac-lite tactical solutions compensator which reduces muzzle flash and what little flip the barrel did have is basically eliminated. Perfect for beginning shooters who strive for the feel of a 1911 but cannot afford or cannot handle the power of a 45 ACP bullet. Make your practices count for years and years after with this gun. About 100 round fired through it if that. You can easily tell. Comes with 2 magazines and if purchased i will throw in 1 box of federal automatch 325 round 22lr ammunition! You cannot beat this deal for a retal whopping 650$ value for 500$. Realized i can't get al the money back i put in the gun so atleast trying to get within 175$.

They are wonderful ""sleeper"" rifles in that to the antis they look like grandpa's hunting rifle, but you can slap in a 30 round mag or a drum when needed, and have the effectiveness and firepower of an AK-47. They are also the platform of choice for folks looking to build an authentic looking Galil clone firing the more economical 7.62x39 round. 

Some handling marks but internally in great shape. This would make an excellent deer gun, truck gun or SHTF weapon. However it is also one that is likely to increase in value over the years."

I also installed rubberized talon grips onto it, but those can be easily removed and leave no residue if you don't like them.

You can find plain m44 and m38 carbines for around $250 online.. But then you have to pay shipping and ffl fee. So you will be spending at least $300 on an unknown likely common rifle. Both of these are rare, you could buy 50 rifles and likely get neither as far as luck goes. So please.. spare me the ""I can get this for $250 online"" If you can find THESE cheaper then buy them. But know that you could spend years looking for a 44 tula m38 and never find one."

172,8XX miles
3100 SFI V6 engine

Runs perfect. I've owned it for over 3 years now and have never been left stranded or had to jump or tow. Extremely reliable. Surprisingly great on gas, it uses less gas then my wife's pt cruiser. Selling to get money towards a used Mercedes or BMW.

-The original alternator went out 2 years ago and had it replaced which has a lifetime warranty (i still have paperwork for it).

-New drive belt was replaced a year ago.

-Replaced rear shocks last year. I also have lifetime warranty for those.

-New tires last winter at 166,668 miles. They are all season tires. Drive amazing in the winter. They are rated for 85,000 miles. So they have 79,000 miles left on them! I will also rotate them before sale as I am doing that this week as well as an oil change.

-New brakes and rotors were installed less then a year ago.

-Air conditioner pumps out COLD air!

-Heat works great

-Cruise control

-Power seats

-Power windows.

-Tape deck and AM/FM radio

-Never leaked oil, coolant, ect.

-Huge trunk


Here's the stuff that needs work...
-It has some rust. As you can see in the pics. There are no dents but does have rust.
-Missing a hub cap.
-Turn signals won't blink fast, left and right work but for some reason it does it slower then normal. Don't know why, I never looked into fixing. I tried replacing all the bulbs but none were burnt out and didn't help the problem.
-Wipers only wipe on higher speeds. Again don't know why they do that could be a wiring problem that might even be tied to the blinker thing.
-Hood release is broken. Not on the actual hood, the one inside the car for the hood to pop up. It still works you just take a pliers and pull the wire. PLIERS INCLUDED WITH CAR!

Perfect car for a daily driver, first car for your kids, very safe, drives great in the winter and great on gas!

The member stated it had been unused and I believe him, there was NO wear or markings on any of the tools inside the case. I have since gotten dies for all of my .300 Savage needs.  MFG date on this is mid 70's.  Amazingly it went from the 70's to 2013 without being used at all.

I used this and there was ONE drawback. I didn't have a scale at the time and the powder density was a little off from 1976 when the kit was made. Kit is still intuitive and works very well. I loaded about 10 rounds with this kit, and have used it as a universal decapper for some pistol rounds and some 30-06. I've considered keeping it around as a small SHTF loading unit but I've since loaded all of my 300 savage rounds for grab and go!

So... here is my offer:

$40 (asking what I paid for everything) for this reloading kit AND you get a Lee Safety Powder Scale that I have.

Above price is FTF but I will ship on buyers dime.

Quit paying $30 for a box of 20! Reload your .300 Savage brass and you can shoot it for $0.47!!!
Imagine how happy your wife would be if you paid for the kit with the savings in the first 40 rounds you reload?

Maybe she would start to think your firearms were investments not ""chunks of money she could have spent on a vacation"".

Freudian slip there.... 

Anyway, message me, email me, if you are interested in it."

Just had someone let me know this was a quality control problem for smiths made during this time and can be fixed for free.

These are getting rather rare. They were converted from WWI GEW98's after The Great War. They got a reputation as a dangerous gun, but that is far from the truth. It's very light and would make a great collectable or nice bird gun. It's is very accurate and holds a pattern tighter than I've ever seen from a 12 gauge. I've run a few 2 1/2 loads and it worked like new. It is missing a takedown disc, but is otherwise complete and original. I've lost interest in it, as I have quite a few shotguns that I shoot on a regular basis, and I would rather have another military rifle. Shoot me some trade offers, the worst I can say is no. I am only interested in military weapons. Bolt action, semi-auto, shotgun, pistol, whatever you got. I also have a Spanish CETME kit and/or Rossi .410 I'd throw in for the right trade."

Coming in around 22 ounces for the comfort and stability you would come to expect from an american made gun. There is not 1 scratch on this gun from top to bottom as you can see from the pictures. the barrel comes threaded to accept any compensator or suppressor if able to own one. This ruger has been modified with new HiViz front sights which absolutley pop when aiming down the sights. the original ruger grips come with the gun but i have installed rubber hogue grips to insure ultimate grip and control of the firearms for accuracy up to 35 yards easily. Another addition was the addition of the pac-lite tactical solutions compensator which reduces muzzle flash and what little flip the barrel did have is basically eliminated. Perfect for beginning shooters who strive for the feel of a 1911 but cannot afford or cannot handle the power of a 45 ACP bullet. Make your practices count for years and years after with this gun. About 100 round fired through it if that. You can easily tell. Comes with 2 magazines and if purchased i will throw in 1 box of federal automatch 325 round 22lr ammunition! You cannot beat this deal for a retal whopping 650$ value for 525$. Realized i can't get al the money back i put in the gun so atleast trying to get within 150$.

This pistol has been a great companion for me for quite a while now, but unfortunately, the time has come to part with it.  The Steyr M-Series pistol was designed with police and military application in mind.  With unique features like it's extraordinary low bore-axis that makes it more comfortable to shoot by reducing muzzle rise and allowing for faster aim recover in rapid shooting sequence, trapezoid fixed sights, and super-comfortable ergonomic grip, you will be sure to fall in love with this sexy little cannon.  I've outfitted it with a great little 190 lumen light with a laser and strobe function, in a quick-detach mounting on the Picatinny rail, making this a perfect nightstand gun.  Also included is a pistol bayonet, for... well, whatever a pistol bayonet is for.  I have also included two modified sigma mags, which function, but not quite as well as the harder-to-find factory magazines.  I'm sure with a little more dremel work, that can be adapted to be quite suitable, but as of present I would limit them to range use only as they do exhibit frequent feeding errors.  This pistol features some very unique fast-acquisition trapezoid/triangle sights that take a little getting used to, but are drop-dead quick and accurate.  It also has a loaded chamber indicator, as well as a crisp 5.5lb trigger with an external safety similar to another Austrian pistol of some renown.

Face-to-face local sales only.  Will NOT ship.  Prospective buyer MUST present valid permit to purchase or carry and government issued photo ID for sale to be considered.  Not super interested in trades, but I would consider a nice revolver in .357 or a nice rifle.  Milsurps are welcome, but I have no interest in Mosin-Nagant, Carcano or SKS rifles as I already have some.  I live near Iowa City, but travel to Des Moines rather frequently, so I'm fairly flexible as far as meeting goes."

Call or Text anytime 504-259-0732 This is the ruger 22/45 Lite made exactly as it sounds, as ligth as a feather. Coming in around 22 ounces for the comfort and stability you would come to expect from an american made gun. There is not 1 scratch on this gun from top to bottom as you can see from the pictures. the barrel comes threaded to accept any compensator or suppressor if able to own one. This ruger has been modified with new HiViz front sights which absolutley pop when aiming down the sights. the original ruger grips come with the gun but i have installed rubber hogue grips to insure ultimate grip and control of the firearms for accuracy up to 35 yards easily. Another addition was the addition of the pac-lite tactical solutions compensator which reduces muzzle flash and what little flip the barrel did have is basically eliminated. Perfect for beginning shooters who strive for the feel of a 1911 but cannot afford or cannot handle the power of a 45 ACP bullet. Make your practices count for years and years after with this gun. About 100 round fired through it if that. You can easily tell. Comes with 2 magazines and if purchased i will throw in 1 box of federal automatch 325 round 22lr ammunition! You cannot beat this deal for a retal whopping 650$ value for 525$. Realized i can't get al the money back i put in the gun so atleast trying to get within 150$.

I've got up for sale a used but in beautiful condition 1911 45 ACP Compact. It is made by ATI and is the more sought after compact version. It has a 3.13 inch barrel and is a very smooth and great shooting gun. I am only selling it because I need the money and could rather use the cash, or possibly do a partial trade for other pistols. I would love to get ahold of a single stack 9mm conceal pistol plus cash on your end. (the gal doesnt like the doublestack she just got, so now im on the hunt for a new conceal for her). Id prefer to just get cash though. It will also come with a full box of 50 Tulammo fmj rounds. It is a really beautiful gun and is great for a conceal gun that still retains the full frame design and the knockdown the 45 is known for. I can shoot pictures to you via cell. My cell is REDACTED. Please try and text only because i have work or school almost all of the time. But, if you must call feel free to do so and I will respond ASAP. Please leave a message as well so I know what it is about (i have alot of different listings up). Please dont lowball me on this one, It has only had maybe 150-200 rounds down the gun and still looks beautiful. Also, these are listed all over on here for 550-650 and list online for 549-699 and are out of stock everywhere online (that i have found). I am looking for best offer on this, but please dont waste our time on it.

The blade is AUS 8 steel, it can be sharpened easily to a razor edge and holds that edge VERY well.

Please look up pictures and more information online about this crossbow as I have no real practical experience with it other than knowing they sell for $500 brand new at Dicks.

805,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1969805,For Sale:  Serious Duck Boat - War Eagle 860 LDSV (90 HP Merc) with custom removable hard blind,"Burlington, Racine, Wisconsin","$ 6,900","Listed On: Tuesday, August 6, 2013",Hunting,Springfield                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"This listing is for a fine 18' duck hunting boat (I suppose you could fish out of it too) with gun locker, fold up seat, live well, dual bank battery charger, dual high capacity bilge pumps, standard horizon chart plotter, minnkota trolling motor for use when the blind is off, raised front and rear platform and lots of other options.  The make is War Eagle and the year is 2000. 
The removable hard blind comes off in around 45 minutes and re-installs in about an hour or so with one person doing all of the work.  The blind is painted the color of Lake Michigan water in the fall and it fastens tight enough to withstand 70+ mph road trips as well as the crashing of the waves on the big lake.  The blind also has fasteners so that you can tie on brush to further camoflauge the boat as well as velcro on the top so that you can add some fabric to further break up the outline of the boat.  There are brackets for you to put your spinning wing decoys in while hunting, etc.  If you can't tell already, this is a serious duck rig.
This boat, (the ""fowl weather friend"") has hunted successfully for many years on Lake Michigan, Lake Tichigan, and the Mississippi river, but alas my faithful duck dog has passed and I'm spending all of my time on deer hunting and upland game now instead.  That means that this boat has been used and has scratches on the paint and a worn area or two on the vinyl floor covering.  Nothing that should matter to any outdoorsman.
The boat has a 90 hp Mercury outboard on it so it gets you to the hunting area fast.  Comes with the trailer as well.
These are heavy duty boats (look them up) with an extra thick modified V hull on them.  Here are the specs: Length - 18 feet, Bottom Width - 60"", Beam - 82"", Side depth 26"", Hull Gauge - .100, Transom Height - 21"", Max Horsepower rating - 115, Hull angle 12 degrees.
