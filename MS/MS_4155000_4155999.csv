DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECT AGENCY (DARPA) XM-3 Sniper Rifle used by the United States Marine Corps. In mid-2005, DARPA worked with Lt. Col. Norm Chandler’s Iron Brigade Armory (IBA) to field items to expeditionary units in Afghanistan.  Since they already had a great working relationship, DARPA contracted IBA to build and test lightweight sniper rifles that incorporated the improvements the snipers desired in combat.  The mission was to be lighter and smaller than the existing M40s, while having better accuracy, clip-on night vision that did not require re-zero, better optics, and better stock, and it had to be suppressed. The barrel had to be short enough to allow maneuverability yet long enough to deliver a 10” group at 1,000 yards. If the barrel was too heavy, maneuverability would decrease, yet if the barrel was too light it would only be able to shoot a few rounds before the groups started to shift due to barrel temperature. IBA tested a number of barrel lengths, ranging from 16 to 20 inches and in different contours. Each rifle with a different length was assigned an XM designator starting with XM1 through XM3. In each case, everything on the prototype rifles was kept the same except the barrel. During the final phases of testing it was found that the 18” barrels had no issues keeping up with their longer 20” brethren. The final barrel length was set at 18.5”, and the contour was a modified #7. The straight taper on the barrel was only 2” vs. 4” and the overall diameter at the muzzle was .85” vs. .980”. This helped reduce a lot of the rifle’s weight while not negatively affecting accuracy or effective range. A number of the groups at 1,000 yards were <1 MOA.

The Marines of I-MEF were the first to field test the rifles at Camp Pendleton. Shortly after I-MEF took receipt of the XM-3s, the first units in II-MEF took receipt of theirs.  By mid-2006 there were dozens of XM-3s in Iraq.  There were few XM-3s made and even fewer make it to civilian population.

The rifle has a skull wrap with no wear and tear. The rifle is brand new and has never been fired. The XM3 rarely makes it way to the civilian population - the rifle was given as a gift to one of our decorated retired Marine Snipers. He fell onto hard times and had to sell his prized possession. Now is your chance to own a piece of our American Military's sophisticated weaponry. 

I am including two Links in which the information on the XM-3 can be found and where all of the development information above was found.

1) This in not a pre-lock 629. We have never had a single issue with locks on any of our guns but internal locks get a bad rap so I feel this is something I should mention. 
2) If you messaged me about this gun and I didn't respond, I apologize. I had one person interested the first day I posted it and that fell through. The next day I had to deal with a family emergency which is why I wasn't able to respond to messages. The gun is still available
**End Update**

We purchased this earlier this year after having a hard time locating a 329pd which we have just located so since we're running out of room this one needs a new home. I am the second owner of this pistol so I don't know the back history of the gun. We've put 50 rounds through it and find it to be reliable and accurate. The factory porting helps you stay on target a lot better than I thought it would. The trigger has a nice smooth, clean pull with a crisp break.

Unfortunately I don't have the original box but it will come in a gun rug. I am asking $675 cash, no trades."

the “S” configuration for perfect weight and balance.

In addition to its custom barrel, this Number One also features
beautiful casehardening of the receiver, lever, and grip cap.

The beautiful stocks are original to the rifle and did not require
replacement to create this spectacular custom rifle. This also keeps
the cost for a Trophy Ruger No.1 at a reasonable price. Custom wood
for a Number One will generally add an additional $4000 to the price.

Also included with the rifle are loading dies, 100 new brass cases,
and both jacketed and lead bullets.

All in all, this custom Ruger No.1 is a handsome Trophy Rifle that is
capable of handling any game in North America with ease. And with
heavier bullets, most anything in Africa as well.

Because I rebuild Custom Ruger No.1s, another Number One may
be considered as a bargaining chip in trade toward the purchase
of this custom rifle.

FFLs, Collectors, and Departments, however, may take any number of very similar 4043s we have at the same price. The .40 S&W chambered metal frame Smith & Wesson pistols descended from the 59 series. Smith & Wesson brought its 4006 online in 1990, and followed with this 4043 variant, S&W number 108528, in 1991. Here you had a real metal pistol instead of a plastic gun, yet competitive and light. The 4043’s full time double action made it easy for police departments to transition from double action revolvers, and eliminated the possibility of an officer going into a tense situation with a 3 pound single action trigger pull. The 4043 has a smooth consistent trigger pull of 10 pounds in a .6 inch travel distance on every shot. Its .260 bobbed hammer does not stand for single action. Weight empty is only 28 ounces, almost 10 ounces less than the steel frame sibling. From these pistols’ V serial number prefixes, they were manufactured between late 1995 or early 1998. They served in the State of Pennsylvania during their law enforcement careers. Barrel is 4 inch stainless, 1:16 Left Hand 6 groove, with Smith & Wesson’s distinctive muzzle collar configuration that ensures consistent lock up with the bushing. Its combination with the steel full length guide rod produces the legendary accuracy of this pistol. Frame is white alloy with type 2 serrated face trigger guard, and serrated grip frame front strap. Caliber is .40 S&W, with 11 shot magazine capacity, 12 rounds fully loaded. The 4043 has a firing pin safety and a magazine safety; it will not fire with the magazine removed. Sights are Novak dovetailed front and rear black anodized that we have refurbished to standard 3 white dot configuration. Barrel, slide, and internal parts are stainless steel, with .304 smooth black anodized combat trigger that matches the hammer. Surface detractions on each pistol are moderate, principally holster wear on its edges, and moderate contact wear on the one piece black polymer grip and on their grip frame struts. We rate these as Very Good, 80 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading for themselves. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean, and we estimate each pistol has been fired fewer than 1000 rounds annual qualification. We are furnishing it with a total of two eleven round factory magazines. Any ammunition showing in any of our photos is NOT included. Replacement pricing on the most recently produced 4043s has approached $800 apiece.

capable of handling any game in North America with ease. And with
heavier bullets, most anything in Africa as well.

be considered as a bargaining chip in trade toward the purchase

This thing is built like a tank and a pleasure to shoot, almost no recoil felt compared to most shotguns.

The receiver of this rifle is patternered after the RPK Light Machine Gun (reinforced, thicker and more heavily constructed). It has a fully functional side folding stock, ambidextrous safety/selector, bolt hold open mechanism with release located in the trigger guard, & mag well for faster reloads. It is also chrome lined throughout, including the gas block, barrel, and chamber. The gas system is self regulating allowing to shoot any commercially available 12 ga. loads without damaging the rifle (unlike Saiga). It also has a picatinney rail mounted to the dust cover that is hinged so you never lose zero on your mounted optics. The barrel is threaded for supressor or muzzle brake use and covered by a factory nut to protect the threads. A HOUGE AK-47 grip has been installed and I will also include the factory grip. 

Comes with: factory box and paperwork, factory 5 rd mag, and one extra 10 rd. mag

The cash price is $1100

I am not interested in any trades at this time, and lowball offers will be ignored.

If you can find this package with the folding stock anywhere else cheaper, then by all means buy it, but good luck finding one.

You can e-mail me and leave your contact information. I will call you back as soon as I can to set something up. I WILL NOT TEXT YOU OR RESPOND TO TEXTS.

Like stagecoaches, swinging saloon doors and Pony Express riders, there are many innovations of the Old West that have long faded from use and live on only in Western movies and history books.
But there are still a few frontier staples that were so effective and ahead of their time that they remain in use today. Take, for instance, the intimidating octagonal barrels commonly found on the repeating rifles of that period. These heavy-duty workhorses sported added mass and extra weight to aid in heat absorption, making them the forerunners to the bull barrels used on modern target and varmint rifles.So as a tip of our Stetson in honor of this timeless barrel style, we replaced the standard round barrel normally used on our world-famous .22 LR and .22 Magnum rifles with a classic 20″ octagonal model, like those favored by the cowpunchers, lawmen, homesteaders and outlaws who blazed the trail westward across America. We rounded out this traditional look with an easy-to-adjust Marbles semi-buckhorn rear sight with a diamond insert and a highly visible brass beaded front sight seated in standard 3/8″ dovetail slots. A metal barrel band secures both the barrel and the high-capacity tubular magazine to the highgrade American walnut stock.If you prefer a more modern look, the receiver is grooved so you can top off any rifle in this line with your choice of scopes. Both the stock and forearm are crafted of the same richly grained hand-finished American walnut typically found on rifles costing up to three times as much.Comes with box, manual, lock and warranty card.

Up for your consideration is my prized Lenovo T420 Laptop...  This computer is perfect for those replacing a business computer on a budget and lacking an IT department or for use as a home school system.  If you need Microsoft Office installed (2010 or 2013) and have a legal and valid key, I can install and fully update it for you at no additional charge before pick up.  Can also install any software for which you have a license or freeware as well as transfer data from an old system (working or not working)...

I am a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer and would also be willing to trade networking and computer skills as well...

Detailed Specs located at the bottom of this page specific to this system...

The 9-cell battery is in great shape, charges to 100%, and will run for approximately four (4) hours on a maximum speed power setting and approximately six (6) hours on a balanced power setting.

The T420 has been upgraded with 8GB (2x4GB) of  Crucial DDR3 RAM and a 1 TB Solid-State Hybrid Drive for fast performance and plenty of storage.

Comes with a 65W Lenovo charger.

The base image is from a scratch install and customized to auto-update windows and auto-defragment the hard drive.  A desktop icon for the Lenovo System Update and two Ninite icons that will automate the updating of both Lenovo software as well as the software listed below; all you have to do is leave it powered on one night a week and at least once a week double click the two blue 'N's on the desktop.

These computers are ready to use out of the box and are fully updated as of 18 Mar 2015.  A list of software is located below.

A custom updater can also be created at ninite dot com like the two that come with the system.  This site will consolidate a great majority of commonly used programs; if the program selected isn't installed it will install it and if it's installed but out of date, it will update it.  This site can be used for any windows based system.

Please feel free to ask any questions you ay have...

After shooting the weapon, it has been totally disassembled and thoroughly cleaned every time (yea, a little OCD). The gun shoots perfect and is a blast to shoot. I already have a different model Sig Carry 1911, don’t really need 2. All specs can be found on the Sig website:
 http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/1911-fastback-nightmare.aspx

MSRP for this weapon was around $1250

Trades that I am interested in are higher end 1911’s only. Kimber, Springfield, Colt’s, or other Sig’s with the 3inch barrels or the 4inch barrels (Ultra, Carry, Pro carry). I will look at all offers, but my hip is not big enough to haul around a full size. Not interested in any Para products, I have had a few. I would also look at the right AR platform, not something built, but something bought. 
I am located near Clarksville, but will travel a little for a solid trade, FTF transactions only, and must be legal.

345,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4155345,For Sale:  HK VP9! NEW 2 MAGAZINES & NIGHT SIGHTS!,"Madison, Madison, Wisconsin",$ 675,"Listed On: Thursday, April 2, 2015",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.
Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.
A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.
The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.
HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.
VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.
Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014."

Green, 3rd Gen MSAR STG-556 Bullpup Rifle (Steyr AUG Clone) with stack of 42rd Magazines and THREE NEW BOLTS + firing pin spring. Rifle is also equipped with LED flashlight on side-rail and a Neu-Trigger (polished stainless seer insert). 

EoTech NOT included.

I upgraded to a .308 for hunting purposes, so I don't feel the need to keep this rifle anymore (I originally planned to buy a 7.62 or 6.8mm conversion for it). Rifle shoots amazing rapid fire; very accurate; gas piston keeps it running clean and reliable. 1 or 2 of the high capacity 42rd magazines have had issue with double-feeds, but, I think it's because the springs are too strong; they've always been stored empty. I haven't had the time to separate which mag is causing the trouble. Only about 1000rds have been shot through this rifle, no steel case russian crap either. I've always cleaned it and kept it well oiled.

Rifle was recently test-fired at factory; I sent it back to have the original bolt replaced because of a small crack on the cam pin. So all 3 of the bolts are basically new. (Ratworx Hybrid bolts- AR15 style extractors)

About the design:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steyr_AUG
After Steyr's AUG patent expired, there were a couple companies that ""cloned"" the classic rifle platform, with some modernized upgrades of course... It's Austrian design and one of the first bullpups ever. The rifle and its variants have also been adopted by the armed forces of Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malaysia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Pakistan, and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Adjustable gas piston action, quick change 16"" barrel, space-age polymer composite stock & compact design have made it legendary."

Equipped with the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone™: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone™, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone™ doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone™ advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. ***IMPORTANT*** We accept cash, money order, Major credit cards, cashiers or personal checks, but product will be held until check clears. *You must have a driver's license and Permit to Carry or Permit to Purchase.

Below is the description from RUGER

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556 Employs a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.
 The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles."

It also has a Wilson Combat Full length guide rod installed along with a Wilson Combat National Match ultra-light trigger with an outstanding trigger job. I haven't weighted the pull yet but I would put it at 2.5-3lbs. And the reset is perfect. It comes in the original case, with 2 original mags, but I have plenty more 1911 mags laying around that I could throw in to sweeten the deal if needed and I mean quality mags. Chip McCormicks, Springfields, Kimbers, Colts, etc. And last but not least...... It's also equipped with a brand new Crimson Trace Rail Master Pro (the green laser/light and strobe combo). One of if not the best handgun combo lights out on the market. I paid $300.00 for mine and still have the original box with all of the paperwork. I will list the specs below. I have around $1300.00 tied up in this amazing handgun and it is very much worth it.

Rifle is one of the most unique rimfires ever produced. These nifty little
rifles offer everything you need: dialed in ergonomics, fast handling and
modern styling. Plus, like their namesake, the Buck Mark rifles provide
outstanding accuracy, dependable blowback operation, a crisp single action
trigger pull and magazines that are interchangeable throughout the Buck
Mark line.

It is quick to bring up to fire it is light weight and is a joy to shoot. The Truglo red and green sights are really bright. This rifle is a great plinker, put on a scope for even more fun at any range.
The scope comes with the rifle, it is a Bushnell Elite 3200 2-7x32 with gold crosshairs. The rings come with the scope but are to large for the factory scope mount. This a factory made rifle only, it will not come apart to make a pistol. Price is firm. Rifle, scope and rings.

With reduced dimensions compared to the standard size GLOCK 20, the subcompact GLOCK 29 is also suitable for concealed carry. In addition to the use as a backup weapon for hunting, more and more security personnel on patrol appreciate the comfortable firing characteristics and the grip ergonomics of the G29 10 mm with its standard 10 round magazine.

This pistol has two 10 round factory Glock magazines with Pierce pinky extensions on both magazines to give you a bit more purchase on the pistol.  With the 10mm power, recoil is surprisingly mild.  If I were to close my eyes and shoot my Glock 30 (.45ACP) or this considerably more powerful 10mm, I honestly don't think I could tell which pistol I was firing.  For those not familiar with the 10mm cartridge, the .40 cartridge was born from being basically a 10mm short; much like the .380 is a 9mm short.

Must meet FTF and purchaser must have valid IN ID and preferably an Indiana carry permit.  Payment by cash only; sorry, no checks.  Any questions, just ask.  I would be willing to trade for a Springfield XDS .45 or ?? if it is like new and has all accessories it came with."

One of the coolest .22LR rifles to be release recently is the Walther G22 bullpup. It has a futuristic look and feel combined with great accuracy and a built in front rail for lasers, lights, bi-pods  grips or just about anything you’d like to throw on it.

Walther G22 22LR is a long-range semi automatic rifle. It’s produced in Germany by Carl Walther production. This rifle has bullpup design, like the rifle Steyr AUG rifle made from Australia. In this article, we are going to discuss several aspects of Walther G22 rifle: design, rifle case, material, ammo, maintenance and application in the field.

Rifle Design
As mentioned above, Walther G22 followed bullpup design. There are some advantages and disadvantages for this rifle design. We found this bullpup design made it quiet light compared to the other contemporary rifle such as FAMAS. We also find this rifle easy to handle and less tiring to hold for extended period of time. At 2.7 kg, it’s weight is comparable to FN-90 however it is lighter than most of other rifle. One of the best thing about G22 design is it’s grip. The grip’s tight and not slippery. It’s size’s perfect and fit to my hand nicely.

Also includes factory iron sights and 2 factory (19-round) mags. $2,200 price includes all 4 mags and ACOG with mount.

Rifle is in like-new condition. It has only had approximately 250 rounds through it. It cycles wells with various brands and weights of US-made .308 ammo, as well as US-made 7.62 NATO. It has NEVER FIRED foreign ammo, corrosive ammo, or steel casings. This rifle is extremely accurate.

I have 500+ rounds of various 308 ammo that I'm willing to negotiate or sell separately. 

I am also willing to sell the ACOG separately. The TA01B ACOG is the one that includes tritium and has different size crosshairs for range (similar to what the US Army uses on the M4, except this one is set up for 7.62/308 instead of 5.56). Pics available upon request."
