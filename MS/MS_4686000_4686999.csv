5,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4686005,For Sale:  7.62x25 Ammo - 1014 Round Assortment All Military,"Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 340,"Listed On: Saturday, October 24, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is an assortment of military produced 7.62x25 ammo. There are 1014 rounds in total as follows: (5) 70 round boxes Polish military, (2) 72 round boxes of Romanian, (8) 40 round boxes of Czech on stripper clips and (4) 50 boxes of repacked Bulgarian

All of it is in excellent condition loaded in shiny brass cases with FMJ bullets. It's powerful stuff that's loaded to full military velocity, so it's typically hotter than the commercially loaded ammo. This is especially true of the Czech ammo which was originally designed for their sub machine guns and is the fastest of them all. All are corrosive primed but that's no problem at all if you simply take 5 minutes to clean your gun after use. All in all this is a great assortment of most  of the popular military made ammo thats been imported over the last 20 years that will allow you to see what shoots best in your guns.

Price is $340 and that's firm. If you can find an assortment like this for under .34 cents a round then buy it. Price assumes pickup in the Brandon, Florida area. I could ship this to places where it's legal but it will be a heavy package and shipping could be as high as $30 or more depending on where you are. Finally buyer must be at least 21 and ID is required if your age is not obvious. Thanks for looking."

Chambering the popular and powerful .44 Magnum rounds, revolvers are built for a lifetime of tough use. Offering award-winning designs these monsters feature a crisp trigger break and smooth pull for accuracy, cushioned grips and factory porting to reduce felt recoil.
Cushioned insert grip
Exclusive on the RAGING ™ Series large frame revolvers, Cushioned insert grip pillows recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

Built on the G30 SF frame, the G30S combines the full capacity .45 AUTO round count with a slimmer slide. This pistol offers a lighter, more easily concealable option for Law Enforcement and legal concealed-carry enthusiasts. Built in conjunction with elite law enforcement, the newest edition to the GLOCK product line brings a venerable history of consistency, dependability and safe performance in the powerful .45 Auto round.

Like new condition, low rounds, can hardly see any slide wear on barrel, maybe a hint of holster wear if you really look for it.
$60+ TruGlo Brite Sites installed in Red/Green
Original box and everything from factory w/2 10 round mags. 
10+1 rounds of defense hollow point ammo included.
Love the 30S. Only selling because I ended up with two in my Glock collection.
Price is fair so please no low ball offers.
May consider trades but will need to lean in my favor and not really much I'm looking for so probably would not consider rare, uncommon, hard to resell items.
Most of my collection are modern striker fired pistols like Glocks, M&P, etc.
Possibly a good .308 rifle, preferably mag fed and longer barrel."

Why argue when you can have both? The SR-8 series of rifle scopes provide a generous magnification range that includes a true 1X power setting at the low end though a high end of 8X. All available models are ideal for engaging targets at distances ranging from point blank out to 800+ yards.The SR-8S features an illuminated C2 MIL reticle for low-light target engagement at near to far distances in 0.5 MIL increments and, the outer ring of the C2 MIL reticle, at low power, allows for quick center-mass shots on a man sized target at 30 yards.The SR-8C incorporates a daylight visible, 4 MOA red dot sight in the second focal plane that is precisely positioned in the center of an 8C MIL reticle in the first focal plane. The illuminated dot is optimized at the lowest power setting for rapid target engagement in any condition and subtends at all magnification settings from 1X through 8X. The SR-8CH50 features a Horus Vision H50 reticle for the marksman who is looking for a high performance reticle.SPECIFICATIONSSR-8CH50Elevation Knob: 2/10 MIL ZeroingTotal Elevation Travel: 38+Windage Knob: 2/10 MIL ZeroingWindage Adjustment Range: 2/10 MIL ZeroingWindage Adjustment Range: 11L / 11RReticle: Horus Vision H50, First Focal PlaneReticle Illumination: N/ADot Illumination: RedThe H50 reticle easily switches between eliminating close targets using the bold aiming ring, and engaging long range targets (to 600 yards) using the grid.

First off I want to say that this Sig shoots very nicely and I've never had a FTF, FTE out of it. With that being said, I've only run a few boxes of ammo through the gun, and I have carried it almost daily for a few months. Gun does show normal wear and tear, and is not a gun safe queen. I don't need to sell this gun. Its one of the nicest shooting 1911's I've owned and carried, but I am currently looking to fund a custom 1911 build so I have chosen to part ways with this gun.

When I purchased the gun, it had aftermarket grips on it and I found these at a gun show. Couldn't afford the top of the line set at the time for the gun to sit in the safe, so this is what I ended up with. The gun has a beautiful Colt blued finish with a very slight bit of wear on the end of the barrel. The pictures do have some glare and the gun actually looks much better than the pictures show.

I just don't need this, it's not perfect and would be a terrific shooter or collector piece.
It does have a few minor handling marks and has been fired. Nothing serious. The wood is beautiful, really. I'm the second owner. I fired 2 rounds through it, cleaned it and put it back away.  Pawn shops sell junk, beat-up, shot-out Marlins for $125-$175. This IS NOT a pawn shop rifle. If you want a cheaper rifle, go to a pawn shop, pay the taxes and transfer and get a $150+ ""beater""."

- A4 upper with M4 feed lips,

- MAS defense 9mm bolt, 
- Leapers fore-end, 
- YHM flash hider, 
- Delaware Machine lower, 
- CMMG lpk, 
- Spikes 9mm buffer and Wolff spring, 
- pistol buffer tube, 
- NcStar reflex sight, 
- VM HyTech Mag block that takes unmodified UZI mags. 
- two IWI 32rd UZI mags, both run great

100% reliable, fun fun fun, love this, but must move some stuff. Well over $1800 into the build, my loss is your gain.  Less than 500 rds through it.

This is built as a pistol, so it must go through an FFL and transferred as a pistol.  Federal Law.  No exceptions.  if you don't like that, don't reply.

Note: I will not split the above parts UNLESS the upper sells first.  Once the upper sells, everything else will be parted.  And no, I will not sell the uzi mag block separate, as it renders the rest of the firearm useless :)"

It was
 bought in the mid 40s by a family member in Denver, CO.  I recall
 him tagging a coyote at near 300 yards with it and its iron sights when I
 was a kid.  It is just as he left it.  Has a sling made of old fabric
 belting and some dark varnish still on the barrel to reduce reflections
 when he went elk hunting with me in the mid 50s.

 The bore is clean and bright.  It has the original ramp up sight and I 
 have 5 rounds of live ammo for it.  A soft case can be included. This weapon is part of American History. The .30-40 Krag (also called .30 U.S., or .30 Army) was a cartridge developed in the early 1890s to provide the U.S. armed forces with a smokeless powder cartridge suited for use with modern small-bore repeating rifles to be selected in the 1892 small arm trials. Since the cartridge it was replacing was the .45-70 Government, the round was considered small-bore at the time. The design selected was ultimately the Krag–Jørgensen, formally adopted as the M1892 Springfield.

I also have a soft case for it as well as one used military clip and a green box holding 50 live rounds of military ammo, and a box of 20 plus 18 loose brass cases. 

I  also have two vintage boxes  from Western Super X Silver tip ammo and 10 live rounds of 180 grain silvertip.

The M1903 even today is considered to be one of the most actuate rifles ever made. The M1903 Springfield, formally the United States Rifle, Caliber .30-06, Model 1903, is an American clip-loaded, 5-round magazine fed, bolt-action service rifle used primarily during the first half of the 20th century.

It was officially adopted as a United States military bolt-action rifle on June 19, 1903, and saw service in World War I. It was officially replaced as the standard infantry rifle by the faster-firing semi-automatic 8-round M1 Garand starting in 1937. However, the M1903 Springfield remained in service as a standard issue infantry rifle during World War II, since the U.S. entered the war without sufficient M1 rifles to arm all troops. It also remained in service as a sniper rifle during World War II, the Korean War, and even in the early stages of the Vietnam War. It remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical collector's piece, and as a military drill rifle.

The Ammo alone is $50.00, total package for the M1903 and ammo $750.00

The stock is in average condition with minor dings from usage. Bluing is maybe 75% and the bore is bright and shiny. Some minor discoloration on the bayonet, probably from the years of storage in cosmoline grease. Includes NOS (new old stock) Chinese SKS sling. 

This is for someone who wants an original SKS (no tactical stocks, removable magazines, etc) with a much more usable sight system. Original Russian SKS's are going for near $600 on Gunbroker but would rather a local sale. The sight upgrades were $100 alone. I will also include a handful of stripper clips, good ones not the crap that doesn't feed properly.

Racine. Wis.---Made in  U.S.A.   I find no model or serial number.  I do have the ""Hand Book"" I  got with it and it and it is titled Silver Streak Models. I have an original yellow plastic canister of 500  pellets I got with it originally.  There are still about 40 pellets in it  so that indicates how much it has been fired.  It still pumps up, holds  pressure, and fires.  It uses 5 mm or .20 cal pellets. 

This gun includes a William Peep Sight as you can see in the picture.

An American favorite for 50 years! The Sheridan Silver Streak continues to be one of the best-loved airguns. This .20 cal. rifle is a multi-pump pneumatic. The hardwood stock is sleek and lightweight and fits perfectly in your hands. The rifled brass barrel is finished in nickel and throws lead up to 675 fps! You can vary the velocity by the number of pumps (up to 8). The Silver Streak is ideal for hunting small game, plinking, target shooting, spinners and paper targets. It's a ""must have"" in every gun locker!

Although this gun has been made for decades, the manufacturer continues to put extra fine details in the rifle, such as a swelling in the forearm to make it easier to pump and a fully adjustable rear sight. If you want to drill out every last bit of accuracy (0.50"" at 33 ft.), pop a scope on it. 

The bore is clean, bright and clearly rifled.

The imported Cockerill barrels are fluid steel, bearing ""ACL"" and ""LLH"" marks, and can fire modern low-brass cartridges. The bores and barrels are in good condition with no noticeable pitting or corrosion.  Years ago I enjoyed hunting quail and grouse with this gun until the stock began to chip at the receiver and loosen.  I attempted a repair and did alleviate the looseness, but an imperfect fit between the stock and receiver soon caused the appearance of a new splinter forming, so I retired the gun.  It has not been fired in 35 years. It is in average cosmetic condition for a 102-year-old gun. Best offer."

The scope on it would be good to stick on an AR or .22 if you have one in need of some glass.

Still in the original box from SEARS.

The Hawken rifle was a muzzle-loading rifle built by the Hawken brothers, and used on the prairies and in the Rocky Mountains of the United States during the early frontier days. It has become synonymous with the ""plains rifle"", the buffalo gun, and the fur trapper's gun. Developed in the 1820s, it was eventually displaced by breechloaders (such as the Sharps rifle) and lever-action rifles which flourished after the Civil War.

The paperwork for the gun is included and there are parts still in their original wrapper.

I am asking $300 for the kit.

This particular gun runs 100%. I have not had any malfunctions related to the gun itself. All the malfunctions I have had were ammo related (failure to fire). The gun itself runs 100% every time.

I am looking to trade rather than sell. If I do sell, it will go for $350 for the rifle and three magazines. You can contact me by texting me at: four-eight-four nine-five-one four-six-six-two"
