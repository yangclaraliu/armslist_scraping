Very nice postwar rebuilt M1 Carbine.  Still has the flat top bolt, barrel is original to the receiver and is dated 2-44.  Apparently Uderwood is known for their high quality one piece barrels.  This one appears to be unfired since rebuild.  Comes in a very attractive walnut M2 stock.

Comes with one original 15 round USGI magazine.

The discontinued M18 model is virtually identical to the current M26C, with the exception that it's all Black (no Yellow stripes)! We think the M18 looked a bit more threatening if you ask us -- looked more like an actual gun, but wasn't! Maybe that's why they added stripes?

There is just the tiniest bit of paint chipping to the rear sight and two very tiny indentions near the rear strap mount. Must have a valid purchase permit and sign a bill of sale.

In addition, the compact eTrex Vista H includes an electronic compass for continuous bearing information and a barometric altimeter for precise altitude. Put the great outdoors in the palm of your hand.
Pinpoint Your Location--and Direction
The Vista H's barometric altimeter pinpoints your precise altitude, and its built-in electronic compass provides bearing information even while you're standing still.

The Vista H can also receive position corrections from the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), which makes its already-accurate positioning data even more reliable. In fact, when you turn on WAAS, you can increase the accuracy of Vista H's position reporting to within three meters. The device's high sensitivity means peak performance in any environment, from heavy foliage to deep canyons.

Add More Detail
The Vista H's basemap contains lakes, rivers, cities, interstates, national and state highways, railroads, coastlines, and landmarks. It also comes preloaded with marine navigation aids. And, with 24 MB of memory, you can add even more map detail with data from Garmin's entire line of MapSource mapping products (add maps in a snap with the high-speed USB connection).

24 MB is also plenty of room for waypoints, routes and saved tracks. The Vista H's automatic track log saves up to 10 tracks for retracing your path, and stores 20 routes with up to 125 waypoints per route.

See More Detail
With a high-contrast, backlit 2.4-inch LCD display, and 64 x 128 pixel resolution, you'll have no problem seeing your maps. The Vista H is compatible with mapping software including topographic maps, Bluechart and inland lake maps. It also includes built-in celestial tables for best times to hunt and fish.

Handheld Performer
The Vista H is engineered for comfortable, efficient handheld use. With its slim form factor, and weighing in at only 5.3 ounces with batteries, the Vista H is ready to go wherever you might take it. The four-way cursor provides smooth, one-hand operation, allowing you to move through menus and screens with ease. The rugged waterproof case (IPX7) gives you added protection against the elements, and a pair of AA batteries gets you up to 17 hours of use."

The little logo on the Spike's Tactical buffer isn't even marred.

Anyway, the upper is an Advanced Armament Corp. 5.56/.223 with a 16"" 1:7 barrel. It has the enhanced nickel boron bolt carrier group, so it's easier to clean and maintain. There is an AAC flash hider so it has the easy screw on ability for silencers. Handguard is a really nice Knights Armament rail system. The lower is a Spike's Tactical/Sharps Bros. Hellbreaker. Has the shark design on the magwell like similar to military aircraft. It has a nice two-stage trigger in it. Spike's Tactical heavy duty buffer rounds it out.

If someone is interested in the complete upper I would sell that separate. Let me know.

It's a really nice rifle but I just keep going back to my other AR so I figured I might see if anyone is interested in buying or trading for this. Feel free to make me an offer, this thing is just taking up space and I'd rather have something I'd actually shoot."

This brass has been fully processed by myself and is 100% ready for reloading.

My processing process consists of the following:

1. Is a 2 hour tumble in my Dillon CV-2001 tumbler in pretreated corn cob media to remove dirt and grime.   

2. I personally physically inspecting the head stamp of every piece and separating out everything but Lake City brass (it all appears to be from years 06 & 07).  

3. I physically inspect it for unusable defects, this brass is free of defects that would make it unusable and there is not a piece of it that I would not personally reload and use myself (brass may have some small marks or discolorations on it from being once fired and the fact that it is range brass).  

4. I run it through my Dillon 650XL press which deprimes the brass in the 1st station, 2nd station is the trim die where the brass is trimmed to 1.755 OAL (+/- .003) and full length case sized in the trim die, 3rd station it is run through my Dillon size die and once again is full length case sized and neck sized.

5. Each piece of brass is run through my Dillon Super Swage 600 where every piece of it had to be swaged, so I know that every piece of it is truly once fired brass.

6. Once again I tumble the brass in a water and stainless steel media bath for 3 hours in my Frankford Arsenal tumbler to clean the lube off the brass, clean the inside of the brass and primer pockets.

7. Each piece of brass has the case mouth deburred and I make sure that the inside of the casing is free of any tumbling media.

Lastly brass is separated into lots of 100 pieces and Ziploc bagged. 

Also, as I am not infallible I have included an extra 50 pieces of brass to cover any casings that might have defects in them that I might have missed.  The grand total of 1050 ready to load Lake City .223/5.56 brass casings can be yours for $120.00.

- Turkish Mauser 1936 Gew 88 (8mm Mauser)

    To the best of my knowledge (and by the serial #/research), this Turkish Mauser variant is a Gew 88 with Gew 98 bolt. The rifle is in 100% condition. Bore is great and rifling is deep and smooth.
    This rifle was produced in the late 1800's and over the years has been modified by multiple military's (notably the Germans and Turks) to accept 8mm Mauser as well other major changes. 

PRICE: $300 obo

- M91 Mosin Nagant
This Mosin seems to be unissued. The shellac finish is flawless. The rifling seems untouched as well as the bore. There is still cosmoline on the exterior of the weapon, but I have thoroughly removed it from the inner workings.

This gun functions nice although I have yet to shoot it I will be doing so tomorrow morning to make sure it shoots as nice as it cycles. I bought this rifle to save my nicer one from range trips but as it is they both just sit in the safe so this one has to go. Rifle has a couple light freckling spots in the bluing, stock shows signs of wear and tare, the bluing on the crown of the barrel is about gone. The bore is bright and shiny. I understand this rifle is no show piece but they are increasingly harder to find.
I'm interested in other unique Marlins Only for trade. I can add cash on my end if need be.. Please don't offer to trade your run of the mill 30-30 or .35.. Interested in cowboy limiteds, xlr's, special Davidson type run 1894/1895's, or any odd ball caliber. Trader must be willing to sign a written bill of sale and provide proper ID.

Recently I did a trade here on this site with a pretty interesting fellow, and got a beautiful little Raven mp-25 with pearl grips. I love the gun and I have to say it makes me smile to look at her on occasion but I figured I'd look around here and maybe post an ad seeing if I could find some other guns to look at and possibly do a trade. 
Now I know the gun by itself isn't going to buy me a high end and top of the line pistol but I figured I could throw some things in on my end to help sweeten a deal if anybody was interested. 
I do have a family sized camping tent and case, a decent quality but not too perfect collectors hunting knife with steel knuckle grips, a little guitar and a rifle case I can throw in. 
I'm not looking for much to be honest but I'd like to see what's out there? I wanted be able to protect myself and I think it's good to explore. 
Well guys I hope you have a good night or a good day, suppose it depends on what time your reading this but I'll let ya carry on with your day if this isn't a deal you'd contemplate over. 
Thanks for reading good sir or madam :)"
