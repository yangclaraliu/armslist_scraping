The wood stock looks perfect and the only marks I see on the metal is where the previous owner installed the rear dovetail sight filler block and made some light marks.  Cleanest one you will find, unless you can find one new in the box.  Very low round count as well, took a pic of the lever open, so you can see there is no wear at all.

$600 firm in cash or better in trade value for rifle and 1 mag.  

I have extra Ruger factory 9rd. mags, if the buyer wants for $15 each, saves you about $10 each. 

I also have 50rd. boxes of .22 Mag. ammo I will sell to the buyer, if wanted.  CCI Maxi-Mag 40gr. or Winchester Super X 40gr. $15 per 50rd. box.

One of my favorite pistols that I have had for a long time. These guns have a lot of history. A quick search on Google and you will find endless stories of how this gun was used to hunt terrorists for years. I really hate to let it go but sometimes compromises have to be made. One recently sold on gun broker for $600. I hope she ends up in the hands of someone that will enjoy her not only for her accuracy but also for her history.

This S&W model 686 (AKA: ""Distinguished Combat Magnum"") is one of the last group of .357 magnum, 4"" barrel, service revolvers purchased by the Kentucky State Police for issue to State Capitol Officers.  It has a KSP property number engraved on the left side, plus bears the original Hogue Monogrips.  Additionally, it has a white outline adjustable rear sight and red ramp front sight.  This weapon comes in a S&W hard case, with six Safariland Speed-Loaders, a KSP issue black retention holster, and one box of factory .357 Magnum 158 grain, SJSP ammunition.

HISTORY:
A couple years after it was placed in servcie, this meticulously maintained service weapon was purchased by the Officer who carried it, when KSP replaced their EDC S&W revolvers with Glock 35 semi-auto pistols.  As such, this revolver shows almost no carry wear and has a very low round count through it.

If you are looking for a great shooting, professionally maintained, totally reliable .357 Magnum stainless steel revolver, at a fair price, this is it."

Driver side window regulator does not move, driver side seat leather is shot, rear vinyl window is cracked/tore. Interior is dirty and could use a good shampoo. right side body does have two dents that was filled with bondo and then painted, IDK why. The top is an aftermarket one piece and does have a small tear where it meets up with rear side window but it does not leak. The rest of it is what you would expect from a car that has been driven for the past 21 yrs.
Clean Title but the title states that miles are unknown do to the odometer gears being broken. has been fixed.

7N1 Soviet/Russian sniper ammo is one of the most sought after rounds by 7.62X54R  shooters.  Check out the auction sites and see what it's going for.

Russian 1997 7.62x54R 152 grain ""7N1"" CHAnNEPCKnE Sniper ammunition was developed by Russian armorer Sabelnikov for the SVD “Snayperskaya Vintovka Dragunova” which translates as (Yevgeniy) Dragunov's Sniper Rifle.
   The match grade cartridge consists of an annealed copper washed steel cases with a special 15 grain boat tail bullet. It has a steel jacketed projectile with an air pocket, steel core, and a lead knocker in the base which is designed to cause the projectile to ""tumble"" once it hits its target. 

Though made for the Dragunov, this ammo should be fine in any 7.62x54R Mosin rifle, like the Dragunov Tiger Carbine, M91, M38, M44, 91/30, PSL, SVT, Finnish M39 Chinese Type 53, (and NDM-86/EM-351, when chambered in 54R) ...   
Headstamp is 188 (Novosibirsk Factory) over 97.

This is a 4"" Kimber 1911 with Crimson Trace laser grips. Never been fired besides at the factory, so new in box. Since the new gun transfer law came into effect I have dropped the price to buffer what some FFL dealers will charge to transfer this gun, so obviously must be able to pass a background check. I have not included pictures as it is brand new so you can get them online. The only thing I have done to this gun is clean it to get the packing grease out of it. I work at an FFL so I know what it is worth so please, no low-balled offers or offers of trades. I do NOT need to sell it I just hate that I own a gun that will not be fired, and need new floors in my house. That is the only reason I am selling it. MUST be willing to do an FFL transfer. Asking $900 because I do not know what an FFL dealer will charge for the transfer fee, which is $200 less than you can find it at Sportsman's Warehouse for. Thank you for your interest."
