This is a vintage Winchester .22 cal break barrel air pistol in .22 caliber.
It is stamped Mod. 353 and Made in Germany. Right hand grips.
The barrel breaks and you insert a pellet into the barrel. There is no safety. It cocks and makes a bang. Untested, so unless I can verify that it shoots well, I always sell it as is and you should assume it will need a rebuild. It has some “blueing” loss and light scratches to the plastic (bakelite?). It has a rifled barrel. Will ship only to the legal lower 48 US States. Shipping will be $15.00. 
I accept Postal MO or Paypal plus 3% of the total sale. Know your laws. If you are not 18 years of age or older do not contact me. No sales to New York City, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Staten Island, New Jersey, Chicago, San Francisco CA, Washington DC and Philadelphia PA. Or other areas where prohibited.

I bought the Ruger to hunt but it's light weight makes it recoil a little too much for my liking. The rifle only has 10 rounds of Hornady Superformance ammo through it to zero the scope (other 10 rounds included as well as a full box of awesome Speer Grand Slam) and is other wise perfectly new. The archangel stock on the mosin is feels fantastic in your hands and is an all around joy to shoot but i'm in the middle of a build for a rifle that i'll get a lot more enjoyment out of and could do apart with this one. The spam can is the silver tip penetrating stuff and the white boxes are non-corrosive 147gr rounds that have been surprisingly accurate.

It was made in 1990 and has been a safe queen for most of its life until I bought it a few months ago. I have taken it to the range a few times since I purchased it and love how it shoots. It gave me no issues and performs as well as my full size Beretta 92FS.

This is essentially a 92FS Compact without a rail, which are getting hard to find these days. As far as ergonomics go, it only differs from the 92FS in that the safety is on the frame instead of the slide, a feature than many prefer to the original design. Has the benefit of having a durable frame, but it's short enough to not poke out when holstered in a waistband like a full size 92FS.

The pistol comes with 1 aftermarket 13-round magazine, and the original 12 round magazine. Also included is the original owners manual, and a soft case.

I bought this handgun with the intent of getting a CCP and carrying it, but decided CC is just not for me at this point in my life, so now I'm looking to sell.

This is a later model, with a roller bearing in the striker channel for a smoother and more consistent trigger pull.  It is in excellent condition, and included are three 17 rd. magazines, the original case & papers, and keys for the built-in trigger lock.  Also included as a bonus is a stainless steel BT guide rod (not installed), which adds a little extra weight to the muzzle to further reduce the minimal muzzle flip this pistol has.

For those not familiar with the M9-A1, here are some facts and some comparisons with the ""Other Austrian Pistol"", the Glock 19:  The Steyr has a similar grip angle, but a smaller diameter and much more ergomonic grip shape. The Steyr has a 4mm lower bore axis, for less muzzle flip and less perceived recoil. The Steyr has a steel frame incorporating longer frame rails and the trigger / sear mechanism (very solid and precise).  This steel frame fits into the polymer grip as a module.  The glock uses its polymer grip as a frame to locate & hold the trigger mechanism, and the shorter frame rails are molded into the polymer grip. The Steyr uses unique fast acquisition trapezoidal / triangle combat sights which are made of steel (easily replaced if you prefer standard rectangular or night sights).  The glock has plastic sights. The Steyr has a shorter trigger pull, with a quicker reset. The Steyr has a two round greater standard magazine capacity (17 rds versus 15). The Steyr has a built-in keyed trigger lock as an additional safety feature. The Steyr was initially designed for the .40 S&W, and then adapted for the less powerful 9mm.  The Steyr's barrel  has a fully supported chamber, and standard rifling to allow use of non-jacketed bullets, while the glock's chamber is not fully supported, and their rifling requires jacketed bullets.

The Glock 23 Gen4 introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol
with compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry and minimum
weight despite its large magazine capacity. The modular backstrap design
lets the user adapt the grip to hand size, and the frame surface exhibits
the scientifically-designed Gen4 rough textured technology. This model
features a dual-recoil spring assembly that substantially increases the
life of the system, and the reversible magazine catch easily accommodates
left- or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 retains the Glock accessory
rail for accessory attachment.

Contact #l REDACTED
Beretta® uses a reliable tilt-breech system on the PX4 Storm Sub-Compact Semi-Auto Pistol to keep it as slim and lightweight as possible, as opposed to the rotating barrel design used on the full-sized PX4 Storm. The tilt-breech system works to dissipate the recoil in the web of the hand and reduce muzzle rise. The PX4 Sub-Compact semi-automatic pistol shoots in either double or single action mode, and is equally suited for concealed carry, home defense, and recreational shooting. The Sub-Compact PX4 Storm features a lightweight, corrosion resistant, fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame that includes an integral Picatinny rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser sights. Interchange backstraps allow a perfect fit to any sized hand; the PX4 Storm has an ambidextrous slide lock and safety, and the magazine release is reversible. The slide has a durable Bruniton™ non-reflective black finish that provides superior corrosion resistance, ideal for concealed carry use where the firearm can be exposed to perspiration on a daily basis. The gun's stainless steel barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance. 3-dot sights provide quick target acquisition, and both front and rear sights are dovetailed into the slide, allowing user to easily change them with after market night sights. The Beretta PX4 Storm Sub-Compact Semi-Auto Pistol uses a double-stacked magazine with a hinged baseplate for the pinky, if needed. Full-sized PX4 Storm magazines can also be used with the sub-compact model."

These guns have a reputation for having tight chambers, making it difficult to remove the empty cases after firing a few cylinders worth of ammo.  And this particular specimen is no exception.  If you're planning on using this as a defensive gun it's probably not an issue, since a .22 LR revolver in a defensive role is not the type of weapon for protracted gun battles with multiple reloads.  It's more for ""shoot the bad guy and get away"".  For plinking and shooting at the range, I would definitely bring a cleaning rod to push out the empty cases that will eventually get stuck in cylinder chambers after a while.

If you're looking for a .22 LR _solely_ for defensive use, a Ruger LCR-22 would probably be a better choice for a lot less money.   If you want something for recreational shooting, that can also be an heirloom you can hand down to your kids or grandkids, the S&W is a better choice.

""Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag,
And smile, smile, smile!""

Once upon a time, everybody knew what a kit bag was. The lyrics above were from a World War One marching ditty that was later used for the title and theme song of a Laurel and Hardy film released in 1932. At the time, S&W had been without a truly ""packable"" .22 caliber revolver for over a decade, since the tiny ""M-Frame"" Ladysmith had been discontinued in 1921 which left the ""Bekeart Models"", with their 6"" barrels and target stocks, as the only small-frame .22 revolvers in the catalog

Three years after the release of Pack Up Your Troubles, Smith released the .22/.32 Kit Gun. With its round butt grip profile and 4"" barrel, this little .22 revolver on the .32-sized I-Frame was perfect for tossing in your kit bag for camping, hunting, fishing, or hiking. The little gun was extremely popular, and continued in production after WWII with a 2"" barreled version added to the lineup. In time, the excess screws in the frame were dropped, the gun went to a coil mainspring, and was eventually moved to the larger ""J-Frame"" platform. S&W has abandoned the small steel-frame .22 revolver market to Taurus these days, but old Kit Guns are still extremely popular and increasingly coveted as plinkers, and the 2-inch guns make excellent ""understudy"" pieces for .38 caliber snubbies used for self-defense.

A S&W .22 revolver is the hardest thing to sell to the average consumer in the handgun showcase.

We are conditioned by a generation of .22 plinker self-loading pistols to think that a rimfire should naturally be cheaper than a centerfire, right? But even a classic Ruger Mark II has a barrel threaded into a piece of tubing, mounted atop a gripframe that's just a couple of big stampings joined together; it's essentially a well-polished Sten gun with fancy stocks.

Meanwhile, over in the revolver case, the only real difference between the Model 617 .22 revolver and the Model 686 .357 Magnum is the size of the hole drilled in the barrel, but having walked past the auto case to get there, our brains tell us that the price should be lower for the .22 because it's just a .22. It's more expensive than an M&P auto because, with the exception of its barrel and rather elaborately-machined slide, the M&P is a collection of injection molded parts and stampings that are much cheaper to make than a Hand Ejector revolver.

This is the same sort of economics that killed the Woodsman and relegated the 41 to an esoteric niche product, despite an attempt to come out with a sort of de-contented matte blue Highway Patrolman-esque version in the late '50s.

It's kind of ironic that the inexpensively-constructed Ruger self-loaders are themselves threatened from below by products of injection molded polymer and cast zinc alloy, for people who don't want to shell out the bucks for a ""high end"" Mk. III auto.

There are inexpensive .22 revolvers on the market, but most tend to be fairly crude constructions of painted zinc, like the Heritage. If all you're looking for is a plinker as opposed to an heirloom, and understand that you could certainly wear one out with a high enough volume of shooting, then I reckon they'll do.

I’ve always wondered about rimfire revolvers as self defense tools. Right out of the gate I need to establish that we call agree that .22 LR and .22 Magnum are not ideal self-defense rounds. We’re not going to re-hash that discussion, because it’s been done before.  . . .  I have an inkling as to the appeal, and it’s the lack of recoil. . . .  my initial feeling about their niche is just that – they’re for people who’ve been sold on the concept of a revolver, but don’t like recoil.  It makes sense when you start to think about it. The micro .380s and small .38s aren’t exactly fun to shoot and practice with; a .22 wheelgun though is going to be something you can put serious trigger time into without getting beat up by muzzle blast and recoil.

Finish is rough looking but it works fine mechanically.  Double action only with a long and heavy trigger, plus a safety.  It would take a series of highly unlikely events to set this off by accident in your pocket.

It's small and slim, just a little bigger than a deck of cards.  All metal construction with plastic grips.  Bores are good.  This would be an easy one to sand and duracoat if you like to tinker around with stuff.

It is NOT an American Derringers product, but the listing made me select a brand and it didn't offer ""other"".

Open to trades- low powered rifle scope, youth size gun, knives, other interesting stuff.  Cash either way to make the trade fair.

Includes a box of ammo (50 rounds)  since 22 has been challenging to find lately.

CCW holder preferred.  Don't bother trying if you are a prohibited person, underage, obviously insane, or an Obama supporter (oh, sorry repeated myself there....).  I won't sell it to you."

We are looking to trade or sell his Mossberg Super Bantam in .243 to get a new rifle so he can hunt elk this year. The rifle is in great shape and is an excellent shooter. He took 2 mule deer and a nice pronghorn buck with it, but has grown quite a bit and needs the bigger cartridge for the bigger animals. The gun comes with the pads and a nice Bushnell scope. It is zeroed for 100 yards and does very nice 1-1/2 inch groups from the bench. He dropped both of his deer with immediate heart shots. Let me know what you may have to offer, we can bring cash for the right gun.
It has an adjustable trigger and free floated barrel. The gun is a great shooter and easliy adjusts for new hunters. I may also have a 22/410 Rossi combo I can throw in for the right trade."
