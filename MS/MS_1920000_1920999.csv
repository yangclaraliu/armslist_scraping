My 938 was purchased used and has some slight signs of wear, nothing bad though. Just on barrel. Slide, frame and grips are perfect. It has night sights, the Extreme grips and is a single action pistol with a Ambi safety for the lefties. I have put over 400 rounds through it with 3 FTE's. That was with Winchester White box 115 grain. I did some research and called Sig and Sig does not recommend 115 grain. Although I still shoot it with no issues. I hqve over 150 failure free rounds with my carry ammo. 147 grain Federal HST. I had a XDS 45, accually 2. I had some function issues with them and 45 in that small polymer gun was just too much for me. So I traded it in and upgraded to the 938. Well as much as I love the Sig the XDS feels much better in my hands and I love that it's now out in 9mm. My 938 comes with factory case and 2 extended 7 round mags. Your XDS MUST have all the accessories and be in new or near new condition for an even trade. I would also prefer the XDS to come with a extra holster aside from the one that came with the gun. If your XDS doesn't have an extra holster or is not in near new condition I would require some cash or 9mm ammo on your end as the Sig is a more expensive gun than the XDS.

Sig Sauer gave the discreet, all-metal P238 platform some 9mm muscle, and the result is the P938: the first 1911-inspired 9mm microcompact by SIG SAUER®. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever all in familiar places. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. The P938 can pack six or seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame."

Hard to find, you'll see one for sale on here once every several months, Glock 20 OD Gen 3 in excellent, near new condition.  About 200 rounds through her. Just picked up a 20SF and I don't need two Glock 10mm so this is for sale. I paid $750 so taking a little loss. Comes with two 10rd factory Glock mags and original case. Standard sights. This gun is a zinger and tons of fun. Great knock down power. You can feel the kinetic energy behind it. Should sell pretty fast as this is a discontinued model.

One pic is 100yards good grouping but need more trigger time the bigger center target is at 300yards my first time ever shooting a gun that far and first time ever using bullet drop reticle, also barrel was a little warm more cooling time between shots and more practice i think this rifle could be amazing at 300 + yards."

BRAND NEW IN THE BOX WITH ALL PAPER WORK.....

The COP 357 is a 4 shot Derringer type pistol chambered for the powerful .357 Magnum round. It is made of solid stainless steel components. Cartridges are loaded into the four separate chambers by sliding a latch that ""pops-up"" the barrel for loading purposes, similar to top-break shotguns. Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time. Older ""pepperboxes"" also used multiple barrels, but the barrels were the part that rotated. The COP 357 operates similarly to the Sharps rimfire pepperbox of the 1850s, in that it uses the ratcheting/rotating striker, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence.

Ad will be pulled when sold.  Ruger Old Army Cap & Ball Black Powder Percussion Revolver for sale.  My neighbor (for whom I am listing this) purchased it new on December 2, 1982.  This pistol has never been handled more than a few times, never dry fired, and never shown around to any friends – it was purchased, looked at and put away that same December of 1982…it was rediscovered and is now for sale.  

This pistol, still in the plastic bag, is new in the original box with the associated paperwork (a lot less back then) and the nipple tool.  Pistol has no marks on it, blued, 7 ½ inch barrel, with the original wood grips.

Serial number on the pistol shows it being produced in 1982.  Production, according to Ruger, started in 1972 and ran through 2008.  My neighbor is asking $450 and he is not interested in any trade.

This gun was my great grandfather's.

Turned out I was wrong, thankfully. 

So, Up for sale and specific trades is an unfired Springfield XDS in 45 acp. This highly sought after, extremely easy to conceal, and top 5 sub compact pistol comes with the original box, and has all the generous extras that Springfield includes, like the holster, magazine holster, interchangeable back straps and other misc items. (Manual, lock, etc.) Gun has only been loaded to sit on the night stand. Just fmj rounds. I'll include those  to get you started. I've seen reviews regarding how light the recoil is due to design and ergonomics. I really love this beauty. If only I was a 45 guy. Springfield knocked it out of the park with the XDS series, I'm hoping, and I'm a Glock guy, through and through! 

Also,  New in package Inside the waistband holster included. Gun was Purchased as a gift to me about a month ago, with the person gifting me the gun not knowing I only own 9mm and 40, & those calibers are ""my preference."" I bought ammo in bulk, and didn't want to add another caliber, though to most the 45 is the ultimate ""one shot stop round,""  and I don't disagree. Gun is pristine. Ohio residents only as I will not ship. Face to Face and Cash only. 

THE ONLY trades I would  consider for this gun is the XDS in 9mm,  or a LNIB Glock 27, or Glock 26. My gun is brand new, so if you have any  of those 3 handguns they need to be in new condition. Serious inquiries only, please. No window shopping. 

Asking $525 FIRM,  so no need for other offers. I appreciate  your interest! Emails will be responded to quickly. Thanks again!"

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556™ offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

The tanks are TIG welded using supreme skill and elaborate tooling. The outside of the welds are treated and polished to reveal the beauty of the stainless steel and show the excellence of the weld. We maintain complete passivation inside the weld during manufacturing. Please look at the last picture taken of the inside of the weld, you will see that it remains brilliant and shiny. If you see a weld in stainless steel that is black or rust colored inside this means that proper provisions were not taken and rust and breakdown will start immediately when your liquid is applied."

This rifle was built for the price conscious user who is looking for a good quality and inexpensive AR15 style rifle for range practice and/or home defense. They were able to do so by changing some features that should NOT upset the majority of target shooting users out there. The barrel used is made in house – 16″ without m203 cuts, melanite coated inside and out, 1:8 twist rate, and 5R rifled. The 5R rifled barrel designs have been in use by Thompson Center, a S&W owned company, for a long time in order to produce an inexpensive and very accurate product. Those looking for a milspec rifle, this isn’t the one for you, but melanite has proven itself a durable, corrosion resistant, uniform coating that can be considered more accurate than chrome lining. Other differences on the Sport models include: an upper receiver lacking a dusk cover and forward assist, a lower receiver with integral enhanced trigger guard, LMT style removable rear sight and A2 style front sight, chromed gas key and bolt carrier and other standard A2 styled parts. For those budget conscious shooters out there looking for a rifle that offers good quality with a low sticker price, the M&P15 Sport rifle may be just what you’re looking for.

This high velocity 45 acp+P load offers numerous tactical advantages for anyone using their 45 acp pistol for anti-personnel purposes. First, this load is operating at velocities of normal +P 9MM 115gr. ammo, yet it is a 45 caliber, 160gr. bullet. Second, this load will penetrate roughly 15 to 18 inches of penetration in flesh and bone, depending on which bones are hit. Third, this load generates relatively low recoil because of the light weight bullet, which assists in fast follow-up shots. Fourth, we are as per usual, using a low flash powder, so the shooter is not blinded by his own gunfire should he be required to drop the hammer in low light, when the criminal element is most active.

This 45 ACP +P load is safe for use in ALL 45 ACP pistols that are in normal operating condition."

FULL-AUTO RUGER 10/22 .22LR CONVERSION DVD  (from the ORIGINAL producer)
This DVD video explains an easy way of how to convert the very popular semi-auto RUGER 10/22 .22LR rifle into a true full-auto sub machine gun. Many months of research and testing went into this conversion and put onto DVD video that shows the worlds most reliable and easiest full-auto ever made for the RUGER 10/22 rifle. There is no modification to the rifle's factory original receiver, bolt face, hammer, trigger, sear, disconnector, or any part of the trigger group. This is a non-permanent conversion. The full-auto converted RUGER 10/22 can be put back into its original semi-auto mode of fire. You do not need the skills of a gunsmith to make this conversion to the RUGER 10/22 rifle. This full-auto conversion functions similar to that of the reliable MAC-10, UZI and M3A1 sub machine guns. All other full-auto conversions for the RUGER 10/22 suffer from 'bolt-bounce / light-strike' which cause many malfunctions. The GUN SLINGER VIDEOS full-auto conversion has been tested and proven reliable. Any person in the U.S.A. can buy my DVD gun videos and booklets.

This is a copy of the famous (and expensive) Browning SA.22 takedown semi auto rifle.  It is made by Interarms and is very well made, very reliable, and very accurate.  It breaks down in seconds without any tools and reassembles just as easily.  Broken down each piece is roughly 18” so it’s a perfect backpack or camping rifle that’s fully capable of getting the job done.  It only shoots 22lr (not 22 shorts or 22 magnums).

This rifle is NIB (New In Box) and is therefore in absolutely perfect condition.  I have 2 of these and decided to let one go.

These rifles have nice checkering on the stock and forearm with a high gloss finish and the bluing is quite nice too.  There is some light scroll work on each side of the receiver (sorry my picture is a bit blurry).

You load this gun through a loading tube in the stock (hold 11) and it ejects the empties out the bottom of the receiver. These were only imported by Interarms for a short period in the 80’s.
