96,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4739096,For Sale:  New-in-Box GLOCK 19 Gen 4,"North Chesterfield, Richmond, Virginia",$ 559,"Listed On: Thursday, January 14, 2016",Handguns,Glock                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"Standing behind a nearly unblemished tradition of reliability, The GLOCK 19 Gen 4; a mid-size, general-utility pistol, is the standard for home defense, target shooting, EDC, and law enforcement across the country. The mostly unchanged GLOCK design lends itself to the old adage ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"", and has been flawlessly unleashing lead for 30 years. Its 9mm NATO cartridge, the most prolific handgun cartridge in history, makes the pistol quite versatile and that much more user friendly. Although it lacks a manual safety, the GLOCK SAFE ACTION system more than makes up for this with its 3 safety systems: trigger tab safety(external), firing pin safety(internal), and drop safety( internal). The latest evolution of the GLOCK, the Generation 4, features well thought out ergonomic and functional upgrades over previous generations. These include:  Enlarged, Reversible Magazine Release - For the fourth generation features a highly improved magazine release button. It retains the classic look and feel of a GLOCK mag release but shooter acquisition and ease of use is vastly better than the previous generations, using it is almost instinctual. Reversing the mag release, for left handed shooters, is quite simple; requiring only a screwdriver and 5 minutes of the owner's time.   Interchangeable Backstraps - The ""Multiple Backstrap System"" features 4 interchangeable grip     backstraps in 2 sets; medium or large without a beavertail, and medium or large with a beavertail. This beavertail feature is a welcome and long overdue feature for large handed shooters which prevents ""slide bite"" or the cutting of the strong hand by the slide during the recoil stage. The customizable grip size, which this feature enables, allows shooters of all hand sizes to effectively use the gun so the whole family can enjoy a day at the range.   Rough Textured Frame (RTF) - The new, fairly aggressive grip texture is an excellent improvement over previous generations which could and would shift in the hand (in my experience) during firing. The nodules of the RTF provide positive traction even with gloves and during wet conditions. The RTF also solves the palm discomfort problem of the previous generation with high round count and/or heavier projectiles.   Dual Recoil Spring Guide Rod - This is reportedly meant to be an improvement in felt recoil, but could also be included in order to further enhance reliability when using certain types of ammunition with attached accessories, i.e. rail light etc.  This Generation 4 GLOCK 19 includes all the standard GLOCK goodies such as:  GLOCK OEM Plastic storage case Nylon bore brush with cleaning rod Cable lock w/ 2 keys 3x15 round magazines (The Gen 3 included only two) GLOCK OEM Speedloader Owner's Manual and other related documents Two fired cases for MD, NJ, NY etc. legal compliance  The GLOCK 19 is a perfect handgun for those new to shooting, all the way up to LEO's and other professionals. And with the improvements of the Generation 4, the GLOCK 19 is as user friendly as its ever been. This, coupled with its accuracy and legendary reliability, make the GLOCK 19 Gen 4 a clear winner for anyone interested in handgun ownership.***NOTE*** This is an FFL sale, please bring 2 forms of ID"

I have started a new Cerakote company, I can coat your FIREARMS, KNIVES, TOOLS, CAR PARTS HEADERS, PISTONS, EXHAUST. MOTORCYCLES PARTS, FLASHLIGHTS, SUN GLASSES. Basically if you can think of it then we can more than likely coat it. Cerakote is a ceramic based finish that can be applied to metals, plastics, polymers and wood. The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the forefront of the ceramic coatings market. Cerakote ceramic coatings utilize state-of-the-art technology to out-perform any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications.

I have started a new Cerakote company, I can coat your FIREARMS, KNIVES, CAR PARTS HEADERS, PISTONS, EXHAUST.  MOTORCYCLES PARTS, FLASHLIGHTS, SUN GLASSES. Basically if you can think of it then we can more than likely coat it. Cerakote is a ceramic based finish that can be applied to metals, plastics, polymers and wood. The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the forefront of the ceramic coatings market. Cerakote ceramic coatings utilize state-of-the-art technology to out-perform any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications.

The mostly unchanged GLOCK design lends itself to the old adage ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"", and has been flawlessly unleashing lead for 30 years. Its .40 S&W cartridge bridges the gap between the high recoil of the .45 ACP and the low  terminal energy of the 9mm, making for a package with excellent stopping power and lighter recoil.Although it lacks a manual safety, the GLOCK SAFE ACTION system more than makes up for this with its 3 safety systems: trigger tab safety(external), firing pin safety(internal), and drop safety( internal).The latest evolution of the GLOCK, the Generation 4, features well thought out ergonomic and functional upgrades over previous generations. These include:  Enlarged, Reversible Magazine Release - For the fourth generation features a highly improved magazine release button. It retains the classic look and feel of a GLOCK mag release but shooter acquisition and ease of use is vastly better than the previous generations, using it is almost instinctual. Reversing the mag release, for left handed shooters, is quite simple, requiring only a screwdriver and 5 minutes of the owner's time.   Interchangeable Backstraps - The ""Multiple Backstrap System"" features 4 interchangeable grip backstraps in 2 sets; medium or large without a beavertail, and medium or large with a beavertail. This beavertail feature is a welcome and long overdue feature for large handed shooters which prevents ""slide bite"" or the cutting of the strong hand by the slide during the recoil stage. The customizable grip size, which this feature enables, allows shooters of all hand sizes to effectively use the gun so the whole family can enjoy a day at the range.   Rough Textured Frame (RTF) - The new, fairly aggressive grip texture is an excellent improvement over previous generations which could and would shift in the hand (in my experience) during firing. The nodules of the RTF provide positive traction even with gloves and during wet conditions. The RTF also solves the palm discomfort problem of the previous generation with high round count and/or heavier projectiles.   Dual Recoil Spring Guide Rod - This is reportedly meant to be an improvement in felt recoil, but could also be included in order to further enhance reliability when using certain types of ammunition with attached accessories, i.e. rail light etc.  This Generation 4 GLOCK 23 includes all the standard GLOCK goodies such as:  GLOCK OEM Plastic storage case Nylon bore brush with cleaning rod (rod not shown in pic) Cable lock w/ 2 keys 3x15 round magazines (The Gen 3 included only two) GLOCK OEM Speedloader Owner's Manual and other related documents Two fired cases for MD, NJ, NY etc. legal compliance  The GLOCK 23 is a perfect handgun for those new to shooting, all the way up to LEO's and other professionals. And with the improvements of the Generation 4, the GLOCK 23 is more user friendly as its ever been. This, coupled with its accuracy and legendary reliability, make the GLOCK 23 Gen 4 a clear winner for anyone interested in handgun ownership.***NOTE*** This is an FFL sale, please bring 2 forms of IDThis gun cannot be directly sold to anyone outside of the stste of VA - willing to ship to out-of-state FFL holders"

The CZ 75 B Stainless is the first stainless steel firearm to bear the CZ name. With the exception of an ambidextrous manual safety and rubber grips, the stainless version is functionally identical to the CZ 75 B. The only difference is an improvement in corrosion resistance, though many will argue that there is an improvement in appearance as well. CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.

* This single action, stainless finish, 5.5"" barrel revolver is in excellent shape overall. It has fired only roughly 400 rounds in its lifetime and has been well cared for. It is in original condition except for the addition of custom scrimshaw ivory grips with very fine and detailed ""Spade"" and ornate engravings. I cannot remember the manufacture of these particular grips, but they are very high quality and cost nearly $150.00 when new. The original wood grips are NOT included however.

* Please take a look at all the pictures to assess the condition of the gun, but I can say the only noteworthy flaws are all very minor. These minor flaws include some scuffing around the perimeter of the cylinder (very minimal and will happen on all Vaquero guns within a few hundred rounds fired), and some extremely minor and small scuffs/scratches to the stainless finish on top of the barrel. I would rate the condition of this gun a 8.5/10 and in overall excellent, near-new condition.

This is an early, very desirable version of the M77 known as a ""round top"", which means it takes standard bases and not the later (current) integral Ruger rings.  Additionally, this is the version with a tang safety instead of the current 3 position safety on the bolt.  Metal is in great shape but the stock could use a refinishing.  A previous owner put a sticker on the right side of the stock and it removed the clear coat when it was removed.  (See pic)  I have that area covered with a cartridge holder.  The stock also has some scratches, dings & grooves from years of being carried in the woods.  I like keeping my guns in their original condition, but some would see the wood and say it needs to be redone.  I'll send more pics to your phone if desired.  This M77 weighs approx. 8 1/4 lbs. Thanks to its weight, the recoil is very manageable.  24"" barrel / 44 3/4"" OAL.  Good solid gun.  Brand new Weaver (gloss) bases.  $450 for the rifle WITHOUT SCOPE & RINGS.  $475 for the rifle WITH SCOPE & RINGS as pictured.  The scope is a vintage Charles Daly 3-9x40mm Wideangle scope with old style Weaver steel gloss rings.  The Weaver bases stay on the rifle with either option.  If asking price is paid for the rifle/scope package, I will include 45 loose Remington soft-points.  They were removed from their boxes during a day at the range but I didn't end up shooting them all.  The boxes were thrown away and the rounds were put in a plastic tub, but I assure you that these are new factory loaded rounds.  NO RELOADS.  This is an affordable way to add a magnum rifle to your arsenal in the event that you gain access to hunting property where you can take that longer shot or if you decide to go out west to hunt.  Great caliber that if pretty versatile for a magnum!  See specific trade options below.  Text or call Matt @ (732)213-seven nine four six.  I can meet at the Greeneville Walmart, downtown, or in the Mohawk area at 81 & 11E, whichever is more convenient for you.

This is for a Traditions Vortek Strikerfire model.  It has the camo synthetic stock and Cerakote finish.  It has a 28"" barrel with fiber optic sights (no scope).  
The Strikerfire is a relatively new model and has two features that many other don't.  One is that it has an internal hammer that is to be cocked by a recessed button on the stock where your thumb would be.  This is an added safety feature in addition to the normal trigger safety.  The other feature is a removable butt pad that comes off to allow storage in the stock.
This ML was my dad's Christmas present but he died before being able to try it out.  Read a review on the gun here:

I bought this gun in 1986.  I shot one deer with it and put it in the safe.  I felt it was too nice for the type hunting I wanted to do.  It has only 40 rounds down the barrel. It is well on it’s way to be a fine collector gun, as well as an extremely accurate hunting rifle.

This description is not sexy enough for this gun.  It is gorgeous.

I had a gun collector tell me:
“You have the earlier version of the A-V prior to the ""Hunter""-style stock. Your rifle is essentially identical to the earlier A-III and L61R, and it is a beautiful rifle.”"

Comes with some fireformed brass , rotary mag, and 1"" scope rings. You never have to reload because it shoots standard factory 22 Hornet ammo. You have to shoot the factory, or 22 Hornet reloads,  to fireform the cases.
I haven't shot it more than 100 rds since had it done as I got some surgery and involved with another caliber. Is accurate. See target with 45 gr factory ammo at 100 yds at 3/4"" dot.  Have no reloading dies for it.

The frame is from a like-new, German frame P229 (sold the .40 slide some time ago). 

The folded carbon slide/barrel is from a Made in Germany P228. The serial number from it is a 2001, with approximately 100 recent rounds through it total, and has been a safe queen part. The guide rod and spring are like-new as well. It also has brand new night sights installed by Sig Custom Shop.

The 9mm locking block insert was just purchased. I replaced the .40 insert for it so that it could be properly converted to 9mm. I have the .40, too, so if you need that, I'll throw it in.

Comes with 1 OEM P228 13-round magazine. Essentially there is no real difference in this version versus the last run coming out of Exeter around 2009, I believe, except maybe the price. Need to sell to fund an upcoming November trip. Will come with original (P229) owner's manual and gray plastic hard case.

Point of balance is 7” forward of the trigger which makes the weight well distributed between the hands. Loading and unloading is easy, and the gun is convenient to use as a single-loader. The trigger pull weighs 4 ½ to 5 lbs. It has some creep, but this seems to have no adverse affect on the shooting. The gun weighs only 6 ¾ lbs. which is light for a 12-ga. shotgun, especially for an autoloader. This is an advantage for an upland field gun where the gun is carried for long periods, but the lightness increases recoil. The recoil is not very great with light loads, and can be endured even in prolonged firing. It is much more pronounced, however, with heavy loads such as 3 ¾-dram equivalent. With magnum loads, recoil is severe. In firing 2 ¾” magnum loads, the heaviest for use in this gun, the computed recoil energy is 45 ft. lbs. Click here to buy it now, or just calculate shipping."

Email or call REDACTED with questions.Components of the ARAK-21® Upper Receiver:The ARAK-21® is a gas piston actuated, complete upper receiver assembly designed to seamlessly interface with the standard AR-15 platform.  The total extent of the interface is simply the take down pin, and the pivot pin.  The new ARAK-21® upper receiver offers you all its features with no change to your current lower receiver and can be installed in less than one minute with no tools. Your ARAK-21® upper receiver will be shipped to you with one “Barrel Assembly Unit” (BAU), or two, depending on which package you purchase.The BAU is comprised of the barrel, gas block, muzzle brake, gas piston, gas adjuster, and barrel trunnion.  The only removable part of this assembly is the gas adjuster knob.  The gas adjuster knob has 4 settings.  Three of the settings allow different gas flows for optimum operation, and one setting blocks the gas flow for a single shot operation.The upper receiver includes the charging block, standard charging handle, lower forearm with screws, three aluminum full length picatinny rails, three insulating shims, bolt carrier assembly, lower recoil lug with spring guide rod, and dual recoil spring system.  Along with your new ARAK-21® upper receiver you will receive your owners manual, and two allen wrenches that will fit the screws that attach the lower forearm, and the front picatinny rails.Due to the unique and innovative features of the ARAK-21® upper receiver, there are very few parts that are interchangeable with a standard AR-15.  The firing pin, extractor spring, and ejector spring are the only parts that are standard and interchangeable with an AR-15 upper receiver.Other features include:The upper receiver is fully machined from an aircraft grade 6061-T6 aluminum billet in a one piece design that incorporates a full length picatinny rail (Mil-STD-1913) on the top and three additional rails on the muzzle end of the receiver, making it a full M4 style quad rail upper.  The top picatinny rail is laser engraved for optic placement.  There are also half-length picatinny rails available.12 ½” length BAU is available in 5.56, heavy profile. 16” and 20” length BAU’s are available in both the 5.56 and 300 BLK. There are two profiles to choose from, medium and heavy.  BAU’s can be interchanged in less than 3 minutes by removing the (6) captive allen screws on the bottom rail using the enclosed allen wrench.  Long stroke variable setting gas piston system.  There are three options for gas flow, and one for no gas flow.  This allows for single shot operation.  There is also a clean out port for the gas block between the gas cylinder, and the barrel.Charging handle is ambidextrous, non-reciprocating, foldable, spring returned and is easily relocated from left to right side without tools by the operator.Model “39” Eight (8) lug bolt design with involute profile for both right and left hand versions.  The extractor is positioned at 3 o’clock.  This allows for a left hand version to use the same bolt by simply removing the cam pin and rotating 180 degrees and reinstalling the cam pin.Self-contained firing pin retention system enclosed in a rectangular bolt carrier that no longer requires a cotter pin.Bolted in hardened steel rail system for the bolt carrier to ride on.  This allows a metal on metal wear surface for better wear characteristics and a much smoother operation.The ARAK-21® system allows for a folding stock to be added, as our recoil system does not extend beyond the upper receiver to fully operate.  This eliminates the noise and feel of the buffer tube cycling back and forth."

In like-new condition. I bought it new, have ran a few hundred rounds through it, and decided it's not for me. In almost perfect condition, it just has a few minor marrs here and there, not even noticeable unless you look for it. Performs just as well as the normal 10/22, this one has the ability to come apart and fit into the bag in moments. No unscrewing, just lock the bolt back, push a pin, and the front half pops off. Included is the bag, and three off-brand magazines, along with the Ruger 10-round rotary magazine. Two extended mags hold 25 rounds, the other 32. The off brand magazines will have some feeding problems with the first five or so rounds, and the rest shoot fine. I find that loading five fewer rounds solves the problem, but hey, the mags are just free to sweeten the deal. This gun retails at Bass Pro for 350, and online stores.

The exclusive, custom Ares Armor - AustriAlpin COBRA™ Buckles allow for quick donning and removal of the carrier. The triple bungee cummerbund positions plates close to the body projecting a power profile appearance while increasing the amount of coverage provided by plates as compared to bulkier carriers.
