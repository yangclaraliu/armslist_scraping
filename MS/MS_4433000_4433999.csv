This semi-auto gun is about 50 years old and in remarkably good shape for it's age and use (No, it hasn't been shot to death). It has been thoroughly cleaned and tested for function. It works. The feed latch is secure. This is a common complaint about the 1100s not wanting to feed or complete the firing cycle. It has pressed checkering on the stocks that is not beat up. There are some pressure dents, but none are severe and if you want to remove them, a wet towel and a steam iron should do the trick. There are no scratches or gouges in the wood. There are two or three very small places where rust was, but have been cleaned and are hard to see. The bluing is not worn and there are no dents or dings in the metal surfaces. 

Price is $400.00 picked up in midtown Houston, or I will ship to your FFL for $35.00. I'll entertain offers and trades. Please don't be offended if I decline to accept your offer.

THIS IS A 4"" BARREL S&W THAT ORIGINALLY CAME WITH 10 ROUND MAGS BUT I REPLACED THEM WITH 17 ROUND MAGS. THESE MAGAZINE STILL FIT FLUSH TO THE HAND GRIP AND DO NOT EXTEND PASS THE HAND GRIP AS SEEN IN THE PHOTO.   THIS IS A STAINLESS STEEL SLIDE WITH ALLOY FRAME ALL IN ORIGINAL BLUE/BLACK FINISH.  COMES WITH A NICE CARRY HOLSTER THAT CARRIES THE SECOND MAGAZINE.  SINGLE/DOUBLE ACTION PISTOL, SAFETY DE-COCKER, MAGAZINE SAFETY.  I HAVE ALL THE ORIGINAL CASE & MANUALS . THIS IS A VERY ACCURATE PISTOL AND FUNCTIONS FLAWLESSLY.  I DID SOME SMALL UPGRADES BUT TRUTHFULLY THE PISTOL DIDN'T REALLY NEED MUCH. I REPLACES THE FULL LENGTH GUIDE ROD AND RECOIL SPRING.  FINISH IS VERY GOOD.

THE ONLY MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE S&W 910 AND THE 5906 IS THE GUIDE ROD AND THE AMBI-SAFTEY ON THE 5906.  I INSTALLED THE 5906 GUIDE ROD IN THIS SW910 AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE AMBI-SAFETY.

Never taken out of the plastic, this 12 ga beauty is chambered in 3 inch and comes with everything that it came with out of the factory.  Sporting a 28 inch barrel, this light yet rugged autoloader has better reliability than the SBE's (in my opinion) and better looks than the Vinci (also a matter of opinion).  I need to buy an engagement ring, so need a new home for this one.  I will ship to licensed FFL Via FedEx overnight at $50, but that can be worked out.  Willing to drive within 2 hours of Memphis.  Please feel free to text me anytime at REDACTED.  Motivated seller here.  Thanks for looking, and God bless."

Patented Multi-Part Containment (MPC™) technology facilitates ease of disassembly and reassembly – an essential function of .22LR suppressors.

The brake is the surefire brake with the teeth for a can. ran about 300 rounds through gun then had the barrel done and ran about 200 rounds though it. There was a stock pinned in place at one point as I used to live in NY so the buffer tube has the pin holes which are not visable when buttstock is on and in no way affect the gun. I would have changed the tube but the magpul sling mount would have been lost as it was staked in place. A gunsmith or anyone handy could change this with minimal effort.

This pistol looks well worn on the exterior, parkerizing is worn down, very slight surface rust that goes away with oil. The insides are like new, strong rifling and a few new parts, trigger, trigger spring, disconnector, front pin set and trigger pin with spring. The side mounted safety has been deleted. I did this because when the gun is hot the bolt is open, when not in use the bolt is forward and locks closed by the charging handle. Its a great little setup and they have been climbing in price lately. I'm asking $1200. With cerakote or repark you'd probably get close to 2k. That's what the last one on GB sold for.

I refinished the stock and it is much nicer than when new even (IMHO). Works great in every way. This rifle was made in Spain for RWS by one of the oldest air gun makers there (established in the late 1800's). RWS is a great name in this sport too, with a long history. Fully adjustable two stage trigger, automatic safety, very nice rubber butt pad, cold hammer forged barrel, 4X32 scope. Additionally, air guns are a great way to practice trigger control that any firearm owner can benefit from. Quiet enough to shoot in the basement when hunting season is over! 4X32 scope w/rings included (or not)! No trades! U S Postal Money orders only as personal checks can take weeks to clear. $10./or less buys 500 pellets/shots; hard to beat that!! A very nice way to introduce new shooters to the shooting sports. I find it has an excellent trigger too. Buyer pays shipping. Rifle can be sold alone for $20. less! Thanks for looking. All state and local laws must be complied with."
