CTD description:

The Steyr SSG 04 A1 is a slightly modified version of the professional model. With a long rail Picatinny system (Mil. Std. 1913), adjustable cheek piece and butt plate, affixed bi-pod, high capacity magazine and a muzzle brake developed by STEYR MANNLICHER it has every technical detail required for precise results.

To satisfy the individual needs of the shooter, the robust synthetic stock excels through its adjustable length of pull and cheek piece. The adjustable cheek piece is especially needed when optics with different mount height are used.



It is also furnished with a Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 optic currently mounted on Burris Tactical rings. In addition, this package includes a Nightforce 30mm Ultralite Ring Set (NIB), one 10 round magazine and a hard case for the rifle. There have only been 20 rounds put through it, it is essentially brand new. No blemishes on the gun nor the scope.

This is one of the finest and most accurate rifles on the market. I am looking to sell as a total package. I would consider the following trade items plus cash:

SIG P229 Stainless Elite 9mm
KAC SR-15 (preferably MOD 1)
Arsenal SLR107-36 or 107-31

I built this weapon myself using all Glock OEM and Lonewolf parts.

I started with a brand new Glock 21 SF frame
I then ordered brand new Lonewolf Glock 21 Longslide slide and threaded barrel. I paid to have the slide and barrel blind-marked and black oxide coated. The barrel is topped with a Sig thread protector.

The slide was completed using all Glock OEM small parts, and the guide rod is a Lonewolf stainless steel guide rod with a Glock 21 spring. The slide also has Trijicon Tritium suppressor sights.

The gun performed great, and was a blast to shoot. The barrel comes in at about 6.5"" in length. Definitely not a Glock you see every day.

Comes with 1x Glock OEM 13 round magazine.

All together this cost me about $800 to build. It was a fun project and someone will get a lot of joy out of it. My loss is your gain

Also included is a Midway USA pistol case, and 50x blazer brass .45ACP and 20x Barnes JHP so you can test it out when you take it home.

I am open to trades, just offer.
Buyer must have valid Ohio Driver's License. Valid CCW is preferred.

I have other guns for sale, I would be willing to shave off hundreds of dollars if you purchase multiple items."

Now Don't drool on it... It's a beauty isn't it? Highly Minty Browning model 12 Takedown model Pump in 28ga. Takedown models are always worth more. This beauty won't hurt you. Recoil minimal. You can leave the bore as is MOD, or send it to Briley for a screw in choke job. This one is one of two brand new unfired, and this one only recently been assembled for the first time. I've only handled it 3 times, and am wondering if I'll shoot it, or just admire it's fantastic John Moses Browning design. Although Winchester was the first to manufacture the model 12, Browning ran a bunch years later due to the cult following of this beauty.

Designer T.C. Johnson & John M. Browning. Originally Manufactured by Winchester Repeating Arms Company Produced 1912–1964, with special production runs until 2006 Number built nearly 2,000,000 Specifications Caliber 12 gauge, 16 gauge, 20 gauge, 28 gauge Action Pump-action Feed system 6-round tubular magazine.  This is a newly manufactured shotgun made by Browning.

If you have been looking for a brand new Model 12 and haven't found anything but used... look no further. I haven't taken any photos, because what is better than 100% brand new in the box with original packing materials and paperwork. I'll likely have to take photos of the one out of the box so people will have a better idea what it looks like.

The only other listed anywhere is Guns International #: 100517885 and is for the same price by a different provider. The one I'm selling has never been put together, still in the original box... Pristine!!!

It does have some pitting on the receiver and indentations but no cracks on the stock.  Still cycles and shoots like a Winchester should.  Simply a neat old gun, with an octagon barrel.  

Also available: 70 factory rounds, 30 once-fired brass, an unopened package of 100 unprimed brass, 250 bullets and an unused set of RCBS .25-20 dies.  If you've priced this stuff lately, you know this is nearly $200 worth of extras.

I have had this rifle for nearly 20 years and only fired 30 rounds, so it is time to move on.  I guess getting older makes it harder to shoot open sights and putting a scope on a gun like this seems sacrilegious.

$950 cash for everything.  $800 for just the rifle.  FTF in the Eugene area.  No shipping, no felons, etc.  I have my CHL which is a comfort to some.

Not really looking for trades unless you happen to have a next to new LC9S for partial trade.  (My wife likes the LC9S in muddy girl camo, so hopefully you don't have on of those.)  I can buy the LC9S for $379 brand new, so keep that in mind as far as trade values.  Might also consider a pistol in .22LR that is pink, or purple, or some other color my wife likes for partial trade."

Reminds me of my .40 caliber Glock 22, but a heavier trigger pull.  There is no safety on these guns, so the trigger pull is stout for that reason.  Original owner said he put less than 50 rounds through it.  My son and I shot a box of 50 UMC FMJ without any problems, but we like the Glock better.  (That's probably why this gun is $315 instead of $500.)  This gun is like new with the original box and contents and two 14-round magazines.

$315 cash, FTF in the Eugene area.  No shipping, no felons, etc. etc. etc.  $15 discount for CHL holder.  Otherwise ODL and bill of sale.  I have my CHL, which is comforting for some folks.

Not really looking for trades unless you happen to have a next to new LC9S for trade and I can add a little cash or ammo on my end.  (My wife likes the LC9S in muddy girl camo, so hopefully you don't have on of those.)  I can buy the LC9S for $379 brand new, so keep that in mind as far as trade values.

I bought it last summer as a spare sear host and I ended up with one too many “K” model spares. Like anyone can have too many guns, but that is where I am now. I have had excellent luck with all of my Bobcat/Coharie pistols. My only issue ever has been a weak extractor spring but this one seems fine. It is unfired by me. Under the fore grip is a 3-lug barrel. I see no finish missing or wear on the paint which looks great. It also comes with its original box.
It needs to go to someone who will use it. This type of pistol sells for about $1,800-$2,200 new, depending upon manufacturer, phases of the moon, internet hype, etc. Prices have not come down and in fact are rising a little bit. Unlike the most recent MKE import, no coordinated rework is required to use this pistol as a sear host. You will also not have to acquire parts and wait to have one custom built from a flat. My price is a reasonable, quick-to-sell $1,400 plus shipping."

Not really looking for trades unless you happen to have a next to new LC9S or Sig P938 for partial trade.  (My wife likes the LC9S in muddy girl camo, so hopefully you don't have on of those.)  I can buy the LC9S for $379, so keep that in mind as far as trade values.  Might also consider a pistol in .22LR that is pink, or purple, or some other color my wife likes for partial trade."

A REAL DEAL you will rarely see anywhere, IF EVER!!

This is an Estate sale. I estimate everything is approx. 1 year old. Stored in the house in Climate controlled conditions

EVERYTHING is in Excellent, Like New or New condition.

WILL NOT SEPARATE AT THIS TIME!

A complete rotary relaoding set up. ALL in EXC. To LN condition.  LYMAN T Mag 2 Press with several sets of NEW IN BOX or LN dies(Hornady, I believe) Including 38 Super!  I saw this loader on MIdway for about $385.
 I'm just going to list enough to more than justify what is asked. Many of you know how hard it is to find powder and primers in stock, and when you can you have to pay the high HAZMAT shipping fees!!  Here we go!!

Powder: All in 1lb. plastic unopened bottles. I opened the lid on a couple saw the seal still in place so just weighed the rest of the bottles so they would be undisturbed. All appear unopened, NEW!

-4- 1Lb. Herco
-4- 1LB. Accurate #7
-4- 1LB. Ramshot Silhouette Pistol powder
-4- 1LB. IMR 4756
-4- IMR 7625
I just looked at Midway and wideners at these powders. Many were out of stock, but IF you can get them They'd cost you approx. $445 for them alone.

Primers:   same shortages as above looked on Midway at these.
-5K Federal Match Small Pistol Primers
-900 Federal small pistol primers
-1K- Winchester Small Rifle Primers
These primers would cost you approx $240 when you can find them

So lets see, just with powder and primers we are at Approx. $685.00. EVEN BEfore we get to the Press, Powder dispenser, extra die sets, primer pick ups and wait a minute, DID I MENTION THE JACKETED BULLETS?  No I did not!! But there are a lot of them, I don't know all calibers but some are 9MM and 38Super, but I'm no expert so don't know for sure. But I'd guess there are about 50 lbs. of these.
Oh well, there is more but I won't go on. If you ARE SERIOUS about reloading you know this is a REAL DEAL and will be happy with finding this opportunity. 
So having said that, here are my sale rules, no exceptions. All is described as best and accurately a I can. Sold strictly with no guarantee and where as and as is!
1. Price is Firm
2. Must Pick up in NW Greensboro, NC. I won't drive anywhere more than 10 minutes.
3. I am not an expert on this stuff so no questions, cause I prolly don't know.
4. NO tire kickers!! If you don't know if this is a REAL DEAL or not, don't ask!
5. PMT via cash only!!

Listed on several sites so the first person contacting me and getting me a NON REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT via Email gets the deal.  If You are insecure or don't think it is a good enough deal you don't need it, please save us both the trouble of an inquiry. If you just want to look at it to make sure, I'll need a $100 non refundable deposit for you to do so.  I want to sell this, not play or entertain curiosity.  
I think this will go quickly, so get it while you can!"

For sale or trade, excellent condition Glock 27 Gen 4. Traded for this gun used, I'm unsure of the round count, but it's got to be low from inspecting the barrel, which shows no signs of wear on the muzzle from slide movement, nor on the barrel hood. I've put about 40 rounds through it, and there are no issues I can find.

Comes with all factory stuff - backstraps, 3 mags, case, etc., plus additional 13 round mag.  Cash price $450. Looking for single stack subcompact 9mm in like condition and value (either by the gun itself or gun and extras). I have NO interest in any manual safety guns, so please don't offer them as trades. No Taurus, Kel-Tec, Jennings, Hi-Points, etc even considered. Low-ballers cheerfully ignored!

Sorry for the quality of the pics - my iPad evidently didn't like the lighting last night. If you need to see more detail, I'll try to accommodate when I get home.

Located in Argos - along the US 31 corridor. FTF only - no shipping. I can meet as far south as Peru, as far north as US 6, west to Grovertown, east to Etna Green.

I'll need to see the buyer's Indiana drivers license and License to Carry Handgun, and will show you mine. No exceptions. For those who question this requirement, I apologize if it offends, but I can't perform a background check so I will deal only with those folks the State Police have cleared.

History, Details, Ballistics, and Drop for the .280 Remington




Cartridge Type: Rifle
Height: 2.54""
Width: 0.473""
Average FPS: 2896
Average Energy: 2793
Average Gr: 150
Recoil: 1.95
Power Rank: 4.34 of 20 [?]
The .280 Remington was designed in 1957 by Remington Arms Company for the 700 series rifles. The parent case is a .30-06 Springfield, and is narrowed down to fit the .284 inch (7.2mm) bullet. The semi- automatic 740 was the first rifle Remington used for the .280 factory loads with a psi of 48,000 to 50,000 for 150 grain bullets. The ballistic performances based off five grain types for velocity are 3,112 ft/s (120 gr), 2,839 ft/s (140 gr), 2,825 ft/s (154 gr), 2,723 ft/s (168 gr), 2,681 ft/s (175 gr).
Remington changed the powder charge of the .280 factory load in 1979 and re-named the .280 Remington to the 7mm Express Remington. After some confusion on the market they reversed the name change back to the .280 Remington. The factory loads consist of 140-150 grain cartridges that are best suited for medium sized game.
The .280 factory loads can be used on medium sized game up to 250 yards before a noticeable drop in wound penetration occurs. Hand loading .280 brass can reach 3,100 ft/s (140 gr), 3,000 ft/s (150 gr). They can be suited to lower powder use for varmint hunting, or custom fit on a 26 inch barrel for maximum velocity in hunting medium sized game. Hand loading rounds can reach upwards of 375 yards before a noticeable drop off in wound penetration occurs.

I bought it brand new recently. I needed something to pocket carry turns out I don't like pocket carry. 

On my first time shooting the gun, after about 20 rounds, the cylinder locked up and the gun wouldn't fire. I had to open and close the cylinder once to get the gun to fire. I fired 80 flawless rounds after that. I called smith and Wesson and they said it sounded as if there was debris/metal shavings from production inside the action and that it will probably not be a problem. I opened up the side plate, cleaned and lubed the internals. That is the whole history of the gun. Both smith and Wesson and I feel that the problem is resolved, but the price reflects the history. Let me know if you're interested. 100 rounds down the pipe. If you are hesitant you may dry Fire the gun, or if you insist, we can take it to the range so you can shoot it. I just have no use for this little gun and there is no point in sending it to smith and Wesson even though it is under warranty because it is working fine. I just want you to know the history of the gun. Thanks for reading."

Bluing is overall good although it has the heavy wear on the receiver as most 1980's model 94's do. I have been told this was due to a different alloy being used on the receiver which did not hold the bluing as well. The rest of the bluing is in good to excellent condition. Wood is very decent as well with very few handling marks. According to Winchesters records this rifle was produced in 1981. 20"" barrel is in excellent shape with excellent factory rifling intact.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs."

An action job was done at that time along with large fixed WILSON COMBAT FRONT AND REAR SIGHTS. It wears Hogue wrap around finger grove grips and has an extended magazine release. The finish is the original dark olive PARKERIZED and gains a 2 toned look with the STAINLESS parts. It looks BETTER THAN NEW. 2 original magazines included but the box is long gone.

Background:
The Astra A-90 pistols was developed by Spanish company Astra-Unceta y Cia SA, in 1985, and is patterned after the Sig Sauer P-220. A-90 features a similar frame and slide shape, similar recoil-operated, locked breech design with improved Browning-style linkless locking and one large lug that locks into the ejection port in the slide. The double action trigger with frame mounted decocker on the left side of the grip is also patterned after the P-220. Another feature that is different from the SIG-Sauer P220 is that the A-90 has a double stack, high capacity magazine.
The A-90 features a two-piece firing pin with firing pin safety that locks frontal part of the pin, plus ambidextrous, slide mounted manual safety, that, when engaged, removed the rear part of the firing pin from the hammer path, regardless the position of the hammer."

Beautiful 1970-90's Surplus Yugoslavian 7.62x39 ammunition. This is the best shooting 7.62x39 ammunition available. Features a 123grn lead core copper jacketed bullet, brass case, and berdan corrosive primer. 1,260rds (84 boxes) sealed in metal tin.

In the 1960s Yugoslavia experimented with new bullet designs to produce a round with a superior wounding profile, speed, and accuracy to the M43. The M67 projectile is shorter and flatter-based than the M43. This is mainly due to the deletion of the mild steel insert. This has the side effect of shifting the center of gravity rearward in comparison to the M43. This allows the projectile to destabilize nearly 17 cm (6.7 in) earlier in tissue. This causes a pair of large stretch cavities at a depth likely to cause effective wound trauma. When the temporary stretch cavity intersects with the skin at the exit area, a larger exit wound will result, which takes longer to heal. Additionally, when the stretch cavity intersects a stiff organ like the liver, it will cause damage to that organ. However, the wounding potential of M67 is mostly limited to the small permanent wound channel the bullet itself makes, especially when the bullet yaws (tumbles)."
