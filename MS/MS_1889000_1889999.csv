It has a steel frame and a steel slide. One of 8,159 produced from 1980 to 1983 before the totally forged carbon steel guns were discontinued because of costs and the popularity of stainless steel. In my opinion the three generations of the 39, 49 and 59 series of firearms were the best ever produced by anyone.  They continue to be better than most on the market today.   

It is custom hard chromed.  It is more durable than forged steel or stainless.  The entire gun is hard chromed over forged steel except for the working internals.  It is in good to excellent condition.

Have 3 firearms for sale today:

1. J.C. Higgins Model 58 - $130 SOLD
12 gauge bolt action shotgun, 5 round capacity, adjustable choke, beautiful stock. Great condition aside from a few dings on the stock.

2. Mossberg ATR - $350 SOLD
.308 bolt action rifle, includes bipod, BSA 4x16 illuminated scope w/ mil-dot reticules, great rifle. Great rifle I got in a trade, but I need the cash so have to sell it. Previous owner painted it a green pattern.

3. STAR 1921 - $350
9mm Largo handgun. 8 shot capacity, includes 2 magazines. Rough finish. Original slide stop was damaged, so had a new one machined for it. Still a little sticky and rough, would recommend replacing. Includes most of a box of handloads a friend of mine found at a gunshow, would not recommend using though since they don't feed too well, however the handgun feeds great with surplus/factory 9mm Largo.

Must be an OR resident and 21 or older to purchase any of them.
Willing to accept reasonable offers, especially on multiple firearms.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

This is a Jericho 941, with blued steel frame, and the full length dustcover. This is not the Magnum research Baby Eagle, though the design is identical. This is the real Israeli import. This little beauty has been my competition pistol for about 3 years - I wanted a pistol that would soak up recoil during timed shoots, and provide a consistent trigger. It weighs about 2lb, and you will feel how heavy it seems. The weight absorbs recoil nicely. To improve the trigger, I sent it off to have the action replaced with a double action only trigger, and a bobbed hammer for draws during IPSC matches. As such, it has a beautifully consistent pull for every shot. I've sighted it with a six o'clock hold at 25 yard bullseye, and point of aim bullseye at 50 yards. The bore I can't get a good photo of, but its still has the mirror shine - It is polygonally rifled. 

I've replaced the IWI grips with a set of rosewood grips, though I still have the original Israeli IWI grips with it. I've also purchase another two magazines, so the gun comes with 4 17 round mags. 

Look, I know I'm not going to get back the $875 I've dumped into this gun. I'd like to get a little cash back, and see it go to a good home. I'll do $600 for quick sale."

~New BSA ""Sweet 17"" 3-9X40 rifle scope for .17HMR rifles.
~New Marlin Trigger Guard
~2 magazines 

Also Includes:

4 unopened 50 round boxes of Federal Premium V-SHOK 17 grain TNT HP 17 HMR (200 rounds total). 

I purchased this new rifle as a project and just completed. I replaced the stock and slapped a new trigger guard on it. This is not an upgrade that is done easily. The trigger guard and screws are not in stock anywhere, not even Marlin has them.

There are a few small nicks on the stock. The rifle got up against an ammo can in the safe. The nicks are not noticeable unless you really look for them.  I can send a picture if you like.

Price is $465.00.  FTF Knoxville area. Buyer will be required to show valid Tennessee State I.D or HCP (preferred)."

It is accurate and strong.  The SpecterDR switches instantly from 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight at the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes. Depending on the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the entire crosshair or just a 1.5 MOA dot in the center. In 1x mode, theSpecterDR has an extremely large field of view. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN's legendary crystal clear image. Situational awareness in both magnifications is improved with ultra-wide viewing angles and unmatched viewing in low light conditions. The SpecterDR has half the weight and twice the capability of carrying two scopes, without compromise to mission effectiveness or reliability."

I bought this from someone else with the intention of making it a project gun, however, I simply don't have the time to right now and would like to pass this one along. This is a great base gun for a custom build or would make a fine range gun that has a lot of similarities to WWII 1911s. I personally never fired it, but the person I bought it from had and reported no problems unless using JHP which the 1911 was originally never designed to do. The previous owner installed a full length screw in guide rod and Wilson Combat shok buff. I have detail stripped the weapon to check for any thing that needed obvious attention and found none. The slide to frame fit is tight especially for a base model 1911 and I feel the weapon was well taken care of. There are some light handling marks on the weapon but nothing that's stands out. It will come in the original green hard case with the Springfield holster and magazine holders, 6 magazines, a Blackhawk Serpa holster, and approximately 80 loose rounds with about 10 JHP.  Feel free to email me any questions. Not looking for any trades. I will meet within 1hr of Pinehurst, I will not ship the weapon. Thanks."

What's in the deal with what I paid in parenthesis:

Glock 21 Gen4 (Like New, $585 is the lowest I've seen not including FFL transfer or tax from Bud's Gun ... I paid $635 out the door)

Warren Tactical Sevigny Competition Sights ($77) professionally installed by Chuck at Bear Creek Gunshop ($40)

3 Glock 21 Mags, Backstraps, Original Box/Paperwork

1 Kriss Vector 30 Round Magazine($67)

In all I have over $800 invested in the gun and you can have it for $625, no trades please. Essentially you're getting a new G21 with all the mods most people would do anyway for the price of one bone stock. Price listed is for a local, cash deal.

I also have extra G21 magazines I'd sell for $15 each with the gun, I will not sell the magazines separately.

To me the sights are truly superb, if you've never shot combat style sights these will shoot the wings off a fly.

It fires 38 special, and has the very concealable 2inch snub nose. I bought this one and a half years ago and haven't even shot it (though my gunsmith did and said it shoots great.) Carried it some as a concealed gun, but didn't really want it as a plinker since it's old and cool.  I bought this at ""Big Boy's Guns and Ammo"" in Mustang, OK for $440, and all I want to do is get my money back.  I love this thing, especially the look and feel of it, but I've gone on a real rifle kick lately and have another handgun that I also use for concealed carry, so this has become a bit of an extra. I'd rather put the cash toward some of the rifles I'd rather have.  

I'm happy to meet up with someone in this area if you want to look at it/buy it. I will consider shipping to an FFL if someone is very serious about getting this, the shipping would probably be less than $20, definitely no more. I can take more pictures if you want to see them, but this is a nice gun. It shows some character from the nearly 40 years it's been around.  But only has blue wearing in a couple of places I tried to highlight in the photos. But overall the blue is probably at 85-90%."

Lone Wolf R&D LLC proudly introduces the WolfPack™ Series Replacement Frame.





If you had the ability to build your own custom Glock frame, this is what it would look like.





The TimberWolf is intended as a direct replacement for your 3rd generation Glock frame or use it as the foundation to build your own custom Glock pistol. It incorporates all of the most desirable features custom builders offer including: a choice of 2 quick change grips, rounded trigger guard, extended beaver tail, round mag catch, improved checkering, higher grip angle and improved rail system.





Slap the slim grip on your new TimberWolf frame and you instantly have the smallest sculpted grip in the industry. No grip reduction can compete with this custom fit or feel. Many claim it is better than any double stack 1911 offered! Install the swelled grip and try to decide, is it an XD or a Sig. Either way, it takes less than a second to try them both.





This new, shooter friendly polymer replacement frame works with Gen3 Glock models: G/17, 17L, 22, 24, 31, 34, 35 and 37. The Timberwolf frame includes the basic parts unique to it: round mag catch and two grips. All remaining Gen3 Glock factory parts are standard ""fit and function"". Drop them in, perform the basic safety function test and you are ready to go.

Done with Lacquer so it holds up to use and abuse AND can be removed if you ever decide to go with a different look. 

Make your Glock rock! with a custom look that looks great! 

Done and touchable within a few hours.. Cured in 24 hours.  

Drop your firearm off with me... 4 hours later come pick it up. Who else works for $5 an hour these days!?!?.. times are hard and money is tight, so I'm doing what I can to feed the family and I'm good at custom lettering.

Can possibly do it on other firearms (Colt's, Ruger's, Ect...) but I know that Glock finishes hold up to the chemicals I use. I can Always Chem check it under the slide if you have a different pistol you'd like it done to, but as of right now- Glocks are the best for this process. 

Gun Store wants $100 to do this (just the pistol- no mags)... Just plain crazy.

**Pics are of a customer's firearm... please check local laws before trying to make yours look like hers... I think the front grip is not legal, but sure does look good!*** 

Some reflections on the mags look like lacquer, but it's not. 

Process looks great when I'm done... Thank you and God Bless."

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize in standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

This is in my opinion one of the best polymer guns on the market, why I like it so much is that it is two guns in one. With the ten round mag it conceals like nothing yet you still have a very accurate gun with 11 rounds at your disposal. With the 17 round mag, it is still concealable and you have plenty of peace of mind. I carry it with the ten round and carry a 17 round as a backup. The second thing I love about this gun is the trigger, it has such a short trigger pull with a very clean break. It is also 100% reliable I have never had a misfire with it. 
I also polished the feed ramp and outside of the barrel (where you see on the slide) which looks much nicer than the dull factory finish.

I purchased this little 637 for a carry pistol as I'd been eyeballing it for weeks! I went in on July 3rd and purchased it when I had enough money saved up! Then on july 5th I ended up making a trade that involved the exact same revolver only a little older. I hadnt even taken this one out of the box yet, before I'd gotten another. I dont need two. I'd like to recapture some of my $ spent. If you happen to be looking for one, but dont want to go through all the paperwork hassel, and want to save a few bucks you can buy mine. It comes with everything, the locks, the key to the pistol, the test round, manuals, box, etc! I paid 419.99 plus tax which totals $441.91. I'd sell it for $415 cash or $430 Credit card. I've looked around and the cheapest around is at Fleet Farm for $409.97 by the time you add tax you'd be way over $415.00. If you have interest let me know. Thanks everyone! 

PS. This is a sick, light, awesome carry gun! I got ride of my 642 (hammerless) model and got this one as the single action is so smooth, and increases your range of fire. Many people think the hammer will get snagged for a CCW, however they dont take into account it's size. Its very small, and when put in an uncle mikes pocket holster it never snags coming out at all! Love love love it! Glad I have one."

The following description was pulled from spyderco.com

Spyderco Strech FRN

The Spyderco Stretch has changed over the years much like watching one of your kids grow up. What started as a small basic Hunter model in the 1980s matured/stretched into an elegant high performance drop point folder available in a variety of handle materials and blade steels. The latest is a lightweight model with a black FRN (fiberglass reinforced nylon) handle.

The VG-10 modified drop-point blade is ground thin and fully-flat with an arcing belly, installing itself as a winner for outdoor endeavors and carrying everyday. Turned-out with a mid-spine positioned back lock the FRN handle is injection molded and surfaced with Bi-Directional Texturing® When the palm meets the texturing tactile resistance results, stopping in its tracks forward or backward sliding under harsh, wet or slippery cutting circumstances.

The steel pocket clip screws into pre-drilled holes on both sides and both ends of the knife making four possible carry options: left/right-handed and tip-up or tip-down. Overall Length: 7-15/16 "" (202mm). Blade length:3-1/2"" (89mm). Weight: 3.4oz (95g). Available in a PlainEdge, SpyderEdge or CombinationEdge blade"

Although this SN does imply that this was a Bulgarian contract Model B, it is not. This stamp is not original and is a postwar counterfeit marking that should not be confused with the Bulgarian contracted Model Bs. One can tell this because of the centered ""A"" under the eagle. The originals had the ""A"" slightly to the left under the eagle. This gun is in good mechanical condition with an excellent bore and rifling to go with it.

The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. 
Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection.

It has a very thin profile and feels good in your hand.  Comes with everything pictured which is two 7rd mags and a 6rd mag.  It also has two backstraps and I have installed rubberized grips. Also it comes with all the manuals and the original box it came in. The gun shows some holster wear but that is the only issue with the gun.  It shoots accurately and it is rated for +P loads.  I live in Danville but will travel up to an hour to meet FTF.  Thanks for looking.
