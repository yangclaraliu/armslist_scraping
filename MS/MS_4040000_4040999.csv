Hello, my fellow gun nuts. I have a newly assembled AR pistol up for trade. The VA in all of its wisdom has put me between a rock and a hard space, so my hand has been forced and I need wheels worse than all of my firearms. I got out of the Marines last year, while in I completed a armorers course. The weapon is put together right. With that said here we go.

Serial# 6888, all parts matching serial #s.

Early example of the breachblock cocking indicator. No import marks.

(The Rheinische Metallwaaren & Maschinenfabrik - RM&M, later known as Rheinmetall - of Sömmerda was an engineering firm founded in 1889 that primarily made field artillery.  In 1901 they purchased Waffenfabrik von Dreyse, a manufacturer of sporting rifles and revolvers, afterwhich RM&M used the Dreyse name for its small arms production--machine guns and pistols. Full production probably did not begin until 1908.  Limited production from only about late 1907 to 1915, but used extensively throughout WWI and into late WWII.)

The Dreyse M1907 was never imported to the U.S., but a number were brought back by GIs following WWII. This is in very good condition, with original black leather holster with spare magazine. Everything seems to function mechanically but I purchased this solely as a WWI-II collectible and have not fired it and I am selling it as such. Will ship but it will have to go from my FFL to yours and add $35 to price."

This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided."

Nice laser accurate rifle that is perfect for any new shooter, or any rifle shooter who wants to improve their shot group.  Picatany rail installed and ready for any optic you prefer.  I have a bushnell 3x9 and truglo red dot available for a little extra if you'd like.   Overall the rifle is hardly used, roughly 400rds through it, and little wear on any of the internals other than cosmetic.  
The main reason I'm getting rid of it is because I haven't used it in about 2 years.  I'm a veteran and have spent too much time away from home to justify keeping this rifle.  I bought and put it together during college, and haven't used it much since.  It is great for improving your overall abilities as a shooter, and the VQ trigger is fully adjustable to whatever Lbs pull setting you'd prefer (hair trigger if you want!).

I hope the rifle can find a good home, I compiled the build off competitive shooter standards and will outperform anything else less than $1000.

The Model 597™ is easily the most advanced autoloading rimfire rifle ever built, and the most technologically advanced breakthrough in autoloading rimfire rifle technology in 35 years. The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy.

Of course, we didn’t stop there. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597™ all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot “hold open” magazine feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine.

KEY FEATURES:
•	Bolt-guidance system features twin, tool-steel guide rails
•	Sear and hammer are Teflon®/nickel-plated for crisp, smooth trigger pull
•	Non-glare matte finish
•	Adjustable big game iron sights
•	Patented drop-out staggered-stack, detachable, 10-shot metal box magazine
•	Last-shot ""hold open"" bolt for added safety
•	Unique attachment system rigidly joins barrel to receiver for perfect alignment and enhanced accuracy

Comes with gun (Realtree Camo edition), (2) x 10 round magazines (came with 1, bought 1 extra), and original owner's manual.  In great condition.  

Asking $200 obo.  Located in Northwest Columbus and you must be willing to meet in the Hilliard/Dublin area for the sale.  NOT interested in trades at this time.  Thanks for looking!"

Great condition with box and 2 mags. The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols."

Also comes with approx. 850 rounds of ammunition.  It has 3 rails on the forend and a scope rail on top of the dust cover.  Also has an adjustable AR style stock.  This gun is exactly as it was when I bought it.  I had a buddy that had fallen on bad times and I purchased this from him exactly as you see it a few years back.  I have never shot it but he said he put about 150 rounds through it.  He could not find the original stock, forend, or dust cover so you get it exactly as shown in the pictures.

Total rounds, possibly 250. The bluing shows loss near the very front of the slide from holster storage and bottom of the backstrap is discolored, likely due to handling.  I call it 95%.

This is one of the better ones I've seen.
Its a 1938 Izhevsk (Russian), better known as an IZZY. This Mosin 91/30's serial numbers match. The barrel is well marked with the Triangle with the Arrow that signifies it was manufactured in Izhevsk (Russian).  Above that marking is the Russian Hammer & Sickle. The cleaning rod is in 100% condition.  Included is the matching Bayonet, tool kit and ammo pouch. The stock/forearm have lots of distinct markings. The sling & slot escutcheons are clean. The sights are well marked and in perfect condition. The lands and grooves of the barrel are deep, bright and shinny. The finish has a nice patina and is true to it's age. Include is a duel leather ammo pouch and 7.62X54R ammo.
If you're looking for that average, cheap run of the mill Mosin..................... 
THIS AIN'T IT................I've seen many Mosin Nagant 91/30's, but none much better than this one.
This Mosin Nagant is a must see. This Relic of the Russian revolution is history!

The Hi Power and the Superposed shotgun were the final designs being worked on by Browning at the time of his death.

The Mark III is the Hi Power used by the British and Australian Armies, among many others. This Mark III was made in 1997; all Hi Powers made after 1994 have cast steel frames that are more durable for shooting +P ammo. It also has the internal firing pin drop safety. This one was a European police trade in imported by Group West LLC of Knoxville TN. It has not been refinished like many of the ex-Israeli guns; this pistol has some wear and scratches on the black epoxy finish from being carried and worked on. The bore is excellent and this Hi Power is extremely accurate. The pistol came to me with Meprolight night sights fitted that are faded, but still work. I had the sear and hammer replaced with a Cylinder and Slide no bite hammer kit. The magazine safety has been removed and a older style 2 coil trigger spring put in place to improve pull. The recoil spring, mainspring, and extractor spring have all been replaced by me. Roll pins are all new. Comes with one Phosphate coated Browning factory magazine, and the factory plastic grips. If you want, I'll throw in a set of factory French walnut grips that were cut for the lanyard ring of another HP I own (don't use them anymore).

I'm only considering a sale because I am looking into getting a new Hi Power Standard with adjustable sights to play around with because I reload. I have 3 other surplus Hi Powers and this is the most accurate of the bunch. I can take any pictures you require of it.

FTF transfer at a LGS; I would do many different locations in Butler, Armstrong, Westmoreland, and Allegheny county depending on where you are located. No trades, cash only. Make an offer!"

Every 40-50 rounds, the hammer drops into the half-cocked position when the slide racks another round. The half-cocked position keeps the hammer from dropping onto the firing pin so it doesn't fire, you have to cock the hammer again to fire the gun. It seems to be an easy fix from what I've read, but I don't feel like messing with it. I've been told that Taurus will fix it for free. I'd rather sell it.

For sale is a stainless Taurus PT 1911 .45. Used, in excellent condition, minus the defect noted at the top of the description. 800 rounds have been put through this gun. I've never carried it as a CCW weapon. It's been kept clean and oiled. It has some very light scratches on it from taking it to the range a couple times. Inlcudes case, 2 mags, manual, cleaning brush and tools required to strip it.

I have a copy of a 1950's Browning Hi-Power, the FEG Hi Power PJK-9HP 9mm (1911 style pistol). I believe it's from the 1990's. Great solid all steel pistol, grips in great shape, bluing is worn a little but nothing serious. Fires everything I have fed it with no problems. 
4.64"" barrel
SA trigger
4 - 13 rd dble stack mags
1 - RH Bianchi Accumold Belt holster - Leather
1 - LH Bucheimer Concealer Belt holster - Leather

I see these going for $300 - $350 online with only 1 - 2 mags in much worse condition than this one before tax, shipping and transfer. So I figure with 4 mags and 2 very good holsters it is worth $400.

I personally am not a fan of the 1911 style pistols like I thought I would be so looking to trade it or sell to someone who will get some use out of it."

With asking price I will include a custom kydex iwb/owb holster.

The Type-C is hammer fired and has its own version of half-cock. When you rack the slide, the hammer is suspended half way through its travel, so it is under tension. A squeeze of the trigger finishes cocking the hammer and releases it. Very similar to a striker fired pistol.

This is a great gun. The recoil is moderate and it runs flawlessly.  The only reason I'm selling it is because I'm consolidating to the 9 mm caliber. This gun lists for $578.00 on Bud's website.

I took this rifle in on a trade and has decided to restore it and keep it, but I have changed my mind. The rifle was restored by Hillbilly223. I replaced all springs and stripped the wood and applied 15 coats of tung oil and installed a new Colt buttplate. Extra springs and parts are included with the rifle (springs, firing pin, extractor, etc.). When I stripped the buttstock, I noticed it had a hairline crack. I applied epoxy to the crack....I only mention because I want to disclose everything. The crack is fixed and is visible in the first photo. I didn't know Colt even made a semi-auto 22 rifle....there is a Colt engraving in the bottom of the receiver and the barrel has Colt Courier. Just know that these Colt rifles have no where near the collectors value as their handguns. It is a cool rifle for a Colt collector though. $300

I love the gun but thanks to Obamas shitty healthcare fines, I need to sell for tax time. 

Since Springfield only warranties the gun to the original owner, I'll throw in my receipt. I do not care to hear about how much these things are selling for at Bobs Gun Shop or any other shop. I'm already dropping the price $166 and throwing in extra mags and ammo which aren't cheap.

The gun has had 100 rds of Winchester range ammo through it and 22 rds of Winchester +P PDX1 bonded hollow points through it. Per Springfield, this gun can accept +Ps but doesn't recommend continual use of it as it wears the parts down sooner.
