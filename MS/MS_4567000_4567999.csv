http://www.adamsarms.net/14-5-mid-tactical-evo-upper-pinned-xlp

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own."

Item Description:

This is an extremely fine surplus Polish Radom P64 9X18 caliber pistol. Designed in the early 1960's by Polish Army personnel, this pistol replaced the TT-33 as the standard service pistol of the Polish Army and Government agencies. Each features the 1960'-70's year of production and ""Circle 11"" markings. This pistol is in very nice condition and will have only very minor, if any, metal finish wear, includes a total of 2-6rd magazines.

I bought this gun from AIM Firearms last year.  See their current stock at the link below:

http://www.aimsurplus.com/product.aspx?groupid=2092&name=Polish+Radom+P-64+9x18+Pistol  

 I have never fired the gun.  I just never got around to it.  It is a nice looking gun especially for military surplus.  Fits and finish are very, very good.  It was rated by AIM as EXCELLENT condition.  

200 Rounds of 9x18 Makarov ammo comes with the gun.

MUST HAVE a valid NC driver’s license, CCW or Permit. Bill of sale will be completed at time of purchase. I will not ship. I live in the Garner / Clayton, NC area (40/42) and would prefer that you pick the gun up at my residence but would be willing to work something out if necessary.

$250.00 (includes ammo)

Please know that I value your time so if the listing is still up then my item is still available for purchase. (No need to ask that question)"

The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory®’s forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect."

Good quality, and he would fix any problem that you would come across with the holster.","Soulard, St. Louis, Missouri","$ 100,000","Listed On: Saturday, August 1, 2015",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I recently seen a ad saying how 77 solution holsters aren't good. Well that's hasn't been the case in my experience. I have bought two holsters from him at two different times. The first one I told him what I wanted and he totally came through for me. It was a holster that he hadn't done before and it turned out perfect! He made me the Incog holster that Travis Haley made. His attention to detail is amazing. I have used it everyday for the past eight months, and its in the same condition as when I bought it. He doesn't know that I'm writing this, I have done this on my own because I have witnessed the work that he does. He is a good, honest, family man. If you had a problem with something he made he would definitely take care of it. So please don't listen to the ad about his holsters. Anyways have a good day!

Little over 500 rounds through it without any problems, always taken great care of it. SA/DA, Ambi safety, surprisingly light, a good conceal carry gun. Fits in any XD holster or CZ PO7 holster. Im really only looking to trade, but will sell for the right price I guess. Will also put some cash down on my end for the right trade.

Gun comes with original hard case.
Nine 16 round clipazines.
Roughly 400 rounds on 9mm depending on trade. 

I prefer another 9mm, im most familiar with it. But will consider other calibers,  just kinda seeing whats out there honestly so the worst I can say is no, aside from a few things (anything made by taurus, dont even ask it will be a no, same goes with any 22lr or magnum)  ill really consider any handgun. Preferably something SA/DA but im not picky.

Like I said I will put cash down for the right deal, if its another 9mm, ill keep most of my ammo, but will give you some with the gun. If its anything other than a 9mm ill give you all of the ammo with it obviously. (All brass case, some are hollowpoints)

Located in Oregon City, will travel within reason, preferably not wanting to give number out until we make a deal. (Email only for now) thanks for looking.

Feel the need to justify the price,  which includes ammo with it. These go for just under 300 gun alone and two mags, mags are 25+ a peice, and there is 9 counting the ones that came with it. Plus all the ammo. So all together its a pretty good deal."

The auto hubs were bad so I put manual hubs on it. It starts but idles a little high currently, my next step was going to be a tune up and replacing the vacuum lines but I don't have time. It has a set of ford rims on it and I have a set of chrome pacers that would fit 32x11.5x15 or bigger. The interior is in decent shape, driver seat needs some attention. The typical electric window issues, driver and back works but needs help, passenger doesn't work. Door panels need to be resecured. Body is in decent shape, rust on the tailgate and the drip rails, front bumper and trim has a dent. Pics available

It is a 5.8l 351w, with c-6 tranny. 

I would trade for a cruiser style motorcycle that needed a little work or firearms are always welcome.

I have been wearing one of them everyday for about eight months. I have never had a single problem with it. The holster that I wanted he had never done before. I wanted the Incog that Travis Haley designed. He found the specific belt clip and designed the holster exactly how I wanted it. I didn't want the mag caddy so its a lil different than the incog. The attention to detail was perfect. He's a good family man, I know that if there was a problem he would fix it for you. Anyways, if your looking for a holster get in contact with him.
