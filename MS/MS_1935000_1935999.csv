This is a beautiful home defense shotgun with a 5+1 capacity. It has amazing ghost ring sights with a green fiber optic front sight.  This is one of the best and most affordable tactical home protection 12 gauge shotguns. This shotgun shoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells. Has a total capacity of 5+1 and has AMAZING accuracy at 100 yards with rifled slugs.  The only reason this shotgun is listed as ""LIKE NEW IN BOX"" is because it was purchased ""New"" and was tested with exactly 5 rounds of rifled slugs down-range to verify the functionality and accuracy of the ghost sights.  Comes with original box, pistol grip stock, original manual, and brand new soft case (see photo) for transport to/from the range or hunting.  

The pistol grip stock and ghost rings make this an amazing weapon.  Only five rounds have been put through it to ensure it works - and it does function flawlessly.  After speaking to our local gunsmith, we have been advised that this gun is interchangeable with 99% of the Remington 870 accessories out there which adds immensely to it's value!  Shotgun was only purchased a few months ago and has been stored in an atmosphere controlled Barska rifle safe this entire time while awaiting sale.

This gun does not shoot accurately. I am not sure why, but it shoots about a 12 inch grouping at 100yds. The barrel has pitting but the rifling is still pretty solid. The parts are worth more than my asking price. If your interested in an inexpensive bolt action to have fun with, this is it! If your looking for a parts gun, this is a great deal! It shoots fine.

Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game within the 556 platform. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The gun measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces, LEO, or responsible civilians requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable operation and function. 



This gun is packaged with a 3x SigTac Scope - the CP1 - and has three rail sections for mounting accessories to the stock. The long-stroke gas piston has two settings as well, making this the most versatile 7.62 available in mass production. 



We're adding another TAPCO 30-rnd AK magazine to match the one Sig gives you as well."

I have a full size Springfield XD 9mm Law Enforcement package available for trade. I can't claim its brand new since when you drive a truck off the lot its considered used, but this thing has had maybe one mag run through it. The pistol hasn't even begun to be broken in and the slide is still nice and stiff. Includes hard case, foam cutouts, Springfield holster, Springfield mag carrier and law enforcement 16rd mag. I own XDs and Glocks, and for me its a toss up between this and the glock 26 Gen 4. Only thing missing from the package is the speed loader, but I can find it (I'm pretty sure) or I'll throw you $15 to buy a new one from any gunstore. For the right trade I might throw in some 9mm ammo also. Will be in St. Pete 1st through 2nd week in Aug and will only meet face to face. If your trade is worth more than mine, Id consider some boot - Alternately, I have access to class A cuban cigars, ranging from Monte Cristos to Cohibas. These are genuine Cubans - I meet the guy at the airstrip in the Bahamas when he arrives back from Havana.

You are welcome to go home with one cigar and smoke it (on me) to ensure authenticity."

DPMS LR-308 ORACLE AR-10 TACTICAL THE MILITARY KNOWS OF THIS WEAPON, CAN REACH OUT   300 YARDS
 Brand new in box; unfired, DPMS Panther Arms LR-308 Oracle. AR-10 variants have long held an important place on the battlefield as special-purpose rifles for designated marksmen. Now DPMS Panther Arms has been one of the manufacturers leading a new resurgence in the tactical use of the 7.62X51 NATO round with its Long Range 308 line. The .308 Oracle is one of DPMS’ most popular rifles due to its compact size, rugged military carbine features and .308 firepower. Side-by-side the LR-308 and the M4 look almost identical, but inside the LR-308 is a powerhouse. This AR-10 is fully equipped to take advantage of the power and precision for engaging long-range targets as well as the versatility of the 16” barrel to excel in the CQB role as well. Includes an uninterrupted quad-rail, recoil absorbing grips, adjustable bipod, and 3X magnifier for the sniping role; and a red dot sight, twist-off magnifier mount, battle-ready buttstock, and a folding foregrip, for the control and flexibility needed for sweep & clear mode. Compare the quality and accuracy of this rifle to a Colt, LWRC, Bushmaster, Sig Sauer, Smith & Wesson, Windham, Daniel Defense, Troy, Ruger, LMT, HK, CMMG, Rock River, Stag, Delton, POF, Core, Adams, Double Star, Knights, Spikes, Christensen, Olympic, Yankee Hill, or any other manufacturer’s AR – 10  and you will not be disappointed.

Blue is very good-excellent, slight rubbing on bottom of floor plate and a bright spot from a gun rack on top of barrel. No rust or pitting in and out. Bore and trigger are very nice. Shoots sub-MOA with Hornady Heavy mags and my loads. No scope or rings included for list price, buyer gets a good price on ammo I have (3-4 boxes and reloading dies and components if wanted ($125 for everything).  
If scope wanted (Bushnell Elite 3200 3-9) for $125 more.
Local cash sale only, I may meet you part way. Buyer will have to provide me a photocopy of driver's licence, fill out and sign a bill of sale form stating they can legally own this rifle."

The wife recently decided that she was ready to step up to 9mm, so we no longer need this. 
Here are the package details: 
- Walther P22 Platinum Pink edition
- Kydex adjustable under-the-steering column holster
- 2 extra magazines
- 100 rounds of CII Stinger 22 LR ammo

The gun does have minor wear marks (on the slide - visible in picture) from the kydex holster, but nothing major. It functions great and fires smooth; it is a tad picky in particular with Federal bulk ammo that I've noticed, so it might require more breaking in before it will eat that particular ammo. Other than that, it's a great little shooter; I have no complaints.

I would really like to sell this for $375.00 cash, but would settle for a partial trade of cash and ammo. The ammo I'd accept: 22LR and 9mm priced fair. I will respond to all offers, and if I feel your asking value for the ammo is too high, I will let you know.

HotGunz was created by gun owners who felt that regular citizens should have access to stolen gun information. With law enforcement databases only available to law enforcement personnel, there was no simple way of knowing if a used firearm was in fact a stolen gun. The HotGunz stolen gun database is not all inclusive, but it is quickly making it much more difficult for gun thieves to sell stolen firearms. Since the database was created in January 2009 we have never charged any fees to list a stolen gun or search a stolen gun."
