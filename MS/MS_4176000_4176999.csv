By far the most fun to shoot and the most accurate at distance of any big bore I have shot. Bushmaster used to have it guaranteed as 1 MOA accurate on their site. Perhaps with the new model they have taken that away. The good news is this model came with that guarantee! Out fitted with a 30"" match grade Lothar Walther free floated barrel. This rifle will send those massive 650 grain bullets as accurately as you can. Even more accurate with the match bullets ie 750 grain Amax, Bore Riders etc. 

      I have successfully engaged targets out to 1,800 yards, that's just over a mile to the lay man. As pictured; that is 3 of 5 shots on a folding chair, yes at a mile. The other 2 weren't what you would call ""flyers"" they were just off the chair on the rock the chair was braced against. The rock is quite large and very impractical to fit in my vehicle to bring home to show off the group. To note that type of shooting with this rifle is the norm, not the exception. As long as you, as the shooter, are doing everything you can this rifle will perform exceptionally. 

       I have fired exactly 123 rounds of pure joy with this rifle. Each shot was a slow methodical calculation. No barrel burnouts on this one. The bore is like new with the exception that now it is broken in.... Trust me there is a lot of copper to get out with a 50 BMG on a new barrel. As the new owner you won't have to go through all that.
The main features that drew me to this rifle were; it is magazine fed, match grade free floated barrel, LEFT HAND BOLT RIGHT HAND EJECTION (more on that in a minute), being a bolt action vs a semi auto.
	The magazine fed feature speaks for itself. Multiple rounds down range with minimal time. 

---Match grade barrel for ultimate accuracy at any distance. 

---Left hand bolt-right hand ejection means the following. If you are RIGHT handed, which I am, you keep your firing hand on the grip/trigger- without breaking your firing position you reach up with your left hand to manipulate the bolt to extract the spent case and feed the next round. The entire time you can be watching the target through the optic to mark changes in shooting conditions. Extremely valuable. In fact many serious competition shooters have their rifles built this way to get as many rounds down range without breaking position and being able to watch the conditions the entire time. 

---Bolt action vs semi auto means there is the inherent safety with a bolt action rifle vs a semi auto. Does that mean that bolt actions are infallible? Of course not. Just MORE safe. 
With the extreme pressures and sheer mass of the 50 BMG cartridge, to me safety is paramount. 

	I put serious thought into which 50 BMG I wanted and it easily came down to this rifle. I have tried out a few different optics on this rifle and currently have a Sightron SIII 20x42 mounted on Burris tactical rings. Before that I had a Nightforce Benchrest 12-42x56, before that a Bushnell Tactical 10x42. The 10x was ok out to 1,000 yards.   The Nightforce just didn‚Äôt have enough travel to reach a mile even with a 20 MOA Nightforce mount and 10 MOA rail. The Sightron has an extremely impressive 150 MOA of elevation to get well beyond 2000 yards with the 50 BMG cartridge. Without holdover. It is currently dialed for 1,800 yards with a 5 mph wind left to right (last conditions I shot in).

	The rifle comes with everything pictured in the case and of course that massive case itself. The rifle, 2 10 round magazines, the factory bipod (I have installed a standard bipod stud as well), I took the forward rail off but the screws and rail are still in the case if you want it on there. 

No ammo is included at the list price. I have some available. Which will be shipped separately. 	

As the price sits the optic and rings are not included. If you want them add $500 USD.
Shipping will be actual costs via UPS to your location. 
Payment via certified funds only; cashier‚Äôs check, USPS money order, or cash face to face. 

Rifle will ship 5 business days after payment received to clear the bank.

I have the rifle listed elsewhere and reserve the right to take down the listing if it is not sold here first.

*Note: If you should decide to contact me please be a serious buyer and someone who is interested. I am Legitimate and real as I would expect you to be the same.* Thank you this is my contact information 480-228-eight one nine-five

Right now I do not currently have any vests however I will soon.
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

NOTE: I have six test shot plates if interested to use them for target practice I am selling them for $20.00 Each let me know if you want them thanks."

Right now I do not currently have any vests however I will soon.
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

NOTE: I have six test shot plates if interested to use them for target practice I am selling them for $20.00 Each let me know if you want them thanks."

Here is a very nice replica of the U.S. Army issued holsters for John Moses Browning‚Äôs 1911A1 pistol that went into service in World War I, and has now continued to protect and serve our country for more than a century. Photo specimens and their identical mates are some we found in an old Appalachian Warehouse recently. Manufacturer is Surya Company of Dehradun, Republic of India. This holster will fit any 1911 type pistol whose barrel measures 5 inches or shorter; and that includes everything from Armscors to Colts to Umarex .22 copies to Wilson Combat pistols. Our Cousin Ernest from Mississippi even carries his Ruger 22/45 in one of the old originals. Like any new, real leather holster, the first two weeks will be a very tight fit. If that weren‚Äôt the case, leather holsters would get too loose too quickly. Construction is .155 thick tanned Moroccan style genuine cow leather, just like the originals. This holster has more of a mahogany brown finish, whereas our #002 has a lighter, more reddish finish. ALICE retaining plate on the reverse side is secured by copper tabs, not as slickly finished as the brass tabs were on the original Boyts, but good enough. Flap stud, instead of being brass like the originals, is glossy anodized aluminum alloy, and it‚Äôs good enough, too. Dimensions are exactly like the originals, from the top of the US marked flat to the blue steel eyelet that holds its genuine leather leg string strap. Color, as the photos show, is Mahogany brown leather finish. We‚Äôre offering these excellent Replica holsters, the ones in the photos or their identical mates, each for only $ 39.00.¬†Shipping. Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

Here is a very nice replica of the U.S. Army issued shoulder holsters for John Moses Browning‚Äôs 1911A1 pistol that went into service in World War I, and has now continued to protect and serve our country for more than a century. This variant is the most traditional, where the strap for the right shoulder goes across the soldier‚Äôs chest, and the pistol sits under his or her left arm. This holster is for a right handed shooter. Photo specimens and their identical mates are some we found in an old Appalachian Warehouse recently. Manufacturer is Surya Company of Dehradun, Republic of India. This holster will fit any 1911 type pistol whose barrel measures 5 inches or shorter; and that includes everything from Armscors to Colts to Umarex .22 copies to Wilson Combat pistols. Our Cousin Ernest from Mississippi even carries his Ruger 22/45 in one of the old originals. Like any new, real leather holster, the first two weeks will be a very tight fit. If that weren‚Äôt the case, leather holsters would get too loose too quickly. Construction is .155 thick tanned Moroccan style genuine cow leather, just like the originals. Leather retaining tabs on the reverse side is secured by stitching that is similar to the original Boyts, only not as closely looped. Strap stud, instead of being brass like the originals, is glossy anodized aluminum alloy, and it‚Äôs good enough, too. Dimensions are exactly like the originals, from the top of the back flat to the blued brass snap that holds the belt loop securely. Color, as the photos show, is brown leather finish. The AOC Thompson 1911 showing in some of our photos is not included but we offer them many times on different ads from this one. Original Government Issue World War II holsters like this one command prices upwards of $300 apiece. We‚Äôre offering these excellent Replica holsters, the ones in the photos or their identical mates, however, each for only $ 39.00.¬†Shipping.

Here is a very nice replica of the U.S. Army issued shoulder holsters for John Moses Browning‚Äôs 1911A1 pistol that went into service in World War I, and has now continued to protect and serve our country for more than a century. This variant is the most traditional, where the strap for the right shoulder goes across the soldier‚Äôs chest, and the pistol sits under his or her left arm. This holster is for a right handed shooter. Photo specimens and their identical mates are some we found in an old Appalachian Warehouse recently. Manufacturer is Surya Company of Dehradun, Republic of India. This holster will fit any 1911 type pistol whose barrel measures 5 inches or shorter; and that includes everything from Armscors to Colts to Umarex .22 copies to Wilson Combat pistols. Our Cousin Ernest from Mississippi even carries his Ruger 22/45 in one of the old originals. Like any new, real leather holster, the first two weeks will be a very tight fit. If that weren‚Äôt the case, leather holsters would get too loose too quickly. Construction is .155 thick tanned Moroccan style genuine cow leather, just like the originals. Leather retaining tabs on the reverse side is secured by stitching that is similar to the original Boyts, only not as closely looped. This is the double strap variant with shoulder pad and across-the-chest clasp that attaches as the soldier‚Äôs photo shows. Strap stud on the holster itself, instead of being brass like the originals, is glossy anodized aluminum alloy, and it‚Äôs good enough, too. Dimensions are exactly like the originals, from the top of the back flat to the blued brass snap that holds the belt loop securely. Color, as the photos show, is brown leather finish. The AOC Thompson 1911 showing in some of our photos is not included but we offer them many times on different ads from this one. Original Government Issue World War II holsters like this one command prices upwards of $300 apiece. We‚Äôre offering these excellent Replica holsters, the ones in the photos or their identical mates, however, each for only $ 39.00. Shipping.Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

Finally for optics, I mounted a EoTech 512 and  a UTG 3x magnifier with a ""flip to the side"" Quick Detatch mount plus a set of MagPul MBUS flip up sights.  I topped the whole thing off with a 1"" light on a detachable mount and a Blackhawk! single point sling.  It comes with Ruger Tactical Carrying Case and one MagPul 30 round P-Mag.  I have put around 300-350 rounds through it and it has always functioned flawlessly.  I can usually shoot 1"" or better groups at 100 yards.

Here is a real find from where they‚Äôve been sitting for years in an Old Southern Warehouse. These grips are for the Colt Scout series of .22 caliber rimfire revolvers manufactured in large quantities in the 1960s and early 1970s. Manufacturer is Sile of Italy, and Sile made a good many of Colt‚Äôs factory grips during the 60s, 70s, and 1980s. Construction is cut checkered, satin finish semi-gloss Italian Walnut, with nickel plated grip screws and escutcheons. As the photos show, these grips can be modified for a good fit on a whole host of Single Action .22 Colt Clones, most of which were manufactured first in Germany and Italy, then in Florida, and now marketed principally as the Heritage Arms Rough Riders. Most of the older revolvers will be labeled F.I.E. Buffalo Scout, Model E-15 in various finishes; or Excam TA-76 Buffalo Scout. Also included are the German-derived RG66, RG67, and RG68 revolversWe estimate these were manufactured in the late 1970s or early 1980s. They were imported by Sile, Inc., of New York, one of Colt‚Äôs primary grip suppliers back in their revolver-producing heyday, late 1960s through late 1980s.

This is a brand new, never fired, Upper: drop in your BCG and charging handle, pin to your lower receiver, and boom! You're ready to launch a can 100 yards down range! Takes literally 30 seconds or less to attach. Thanks, Danny REDACTED  WORDS FROM THE MANUFACTURER The Can Cannon is a patent pending launching device for soda cans and other heavy, thin walled objects. A proprietary gas ported barrel and pressure tube reduce the exposure to high pressure gasses which could destroy relatively delicate projectiles. The Can Cannon is currently configured for launching full, un-opened 12oz soda cans. When used with standard mil spec blanks and fired at an optimum angle it can reach an average distance of 105 yards!   Why launch soda cans instead of drinking them?  Because you can!  Projectile options are only limited by your creativity and local laws.  Our BATFE approved design is not considered a Destructive Device or firearm.  Each unit is sold as an assembled upper with receiver, headspaced and mounted ported barrel, and pressure tube.  The system is compatible with any AR-15 mil standard bolt and most piston bolts.  Enjoy our no-hassle lifetime warranty. We are currently designing the following accessories for this product:      Grappling Hook (In Pre-Production)     Net Launcher (In Sketch)      Dog Training Toys For Duck Hunting and Retrieval     T Shirt Launching (probably an easy one)     Lawn Darts      Harpoon"

The ATI Talon T2 Tactical Shotgun Stock replaces the factory buttstock on Mossberg 500/590 shotguns, converting them to serious tactical shotguns for law enforcement or home security. The Talon T2 Stock fully adjusts in length to 6 positions, so you always have a correct fit for fast shooting no matter what clothing or how much tactical gear you are wearing. ATI's Scorpion recoil system includes a recoil absorbing pistol grip with sure-grip texture, and a non-slip X2 butt pad, that together reduce recoil and shooting discomfort significantly, and allow shooters to reacquire their targets quickly by minimizing muzzle lift. The ATI Talon T2 Tactical Shotgun Stock features ATI's Triton Mount System, constructed of Military Type III Anodized, 6061 T6 Aluminum, which provides shooters the ability to switch from the 6-position collapsible stock, to the rear pistol grip in a matter of seconds. The Triton Mount System also includes interchangeable sling mounts for left and right-handed shooters, and an additional blank spacer for when a sling mount is not in use. The Talon T2 is constructed of DuPont¬Æ extreme temperature glass reinforced polymer, a material proven to withstand the extreme abuse of tactical environments. A removable, adjustable cheekrest allows shooters to find individual optimum fit. ATI manufactures a full line of quality tactical gear, and accessories for Remington 870 and Mossberg 500/590 tactical shotguns, and the Talon T2 Tactical Stock holds up to their reputation. Manufacturer's limited lifetime warranty. Made in USA.

IWI US TAVOR¬Æ SAR OVERVIEW
¬†
The dynamics of the battlefield are forever changing. With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Research & Development teams, developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF. The TAVOR¬Æ was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the ‚Äúfather of the TAVOR,‚Äù spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities ‚Äì seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990‚Äôs through the early 2000‚Äôs, the TAVOR underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies in the world.
¬†
IWI and IWI US have brought the same dedication to craft and commitment to performance and reliability to the American customer with the TAVOR SAR rifle.
¬†
TAVOR¬Æ SAR Features Include:
-Bullpup configuration allows for short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy
-Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease-of-use

IWI US TAVOR¬Æ SAR OVERVIEW
¬†
The dynamics of the battlefield are forever changing. With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Research & Development teams, developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF. The TAVOR¬Æ was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the ‚Äúfather of the TAVOR,‚Äù spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities ‚Äì seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990‚Äôs through the early 2000‚Äôs, the TAVOR underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies in the world.
¬†
IWI and IWI US have brought the same dedication to craft and commitment to performance and reliability to the American customer with the TAVOR SAR rifle.
¬†

-Bullpup configuration allows for short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy
-Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease-of-use

I have for sale military surplus .50 ammocans for sale. They are Condition: Grade 2/Very Good (Grade 1 is new).

These GENUINE military cans have many uses including storage, geocaching, tool boxes, prepping, and of course, they can be used to store your ammo. They have a rubber seal on the lid that makes them virtually air tight and highly water resistant. This can also makes a great camera box on float trips. 50 cal. cans measure 11"" x 5-1/2"" x 7"".

Don't be fooled by those new ammocans sold at Gander Mountain, Fleet Farm, Cabelas, Walmart, etc. Those ammocans are NOT considered MILSPEC and do not have the same gasket and sealing mechanism as the military models do.

Priced as follows:

$12 each if paid in cash.
$12.55 each if paid via Paypal.

Buy just one or one hundred. I'll likely have as many as you'll need.
