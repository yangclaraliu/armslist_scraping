I succeeded, but now it just sits in the safe. I don't really want to sell it but it's doing me no good sitting around, and I have too many .22 rifles.

Specs are as follows:
10/22, 2014 production with 50th anniversary stamp
Ruger Sporter hardwood checkered stock
18.5"" Standard barrel
Volquartsen auto bolt release
Volquartsen extended mag release
Nikon Prostaff Rimfire 3-9x BDC Scope w/ Butler Creek Flip up caps
Leupold 1"" scope rings
Leather sling
Includes 2 Ruger 10 round mags, one Ruger 25 round mag, and the ""Ruger 10/22"" marked soft case.
Pretty sure I've also got the original box with the plastic stock somewhere here too.
It's a fun little gun to shoot, and that stock makes it look 10000x better than the original one. Would be great for teaching the kids how to shoot. I don't really want to think about how much money I sunk into this. I'm sure over $500. Like I said don't really want to sell it but I can only use so many .22lr rifles. I already have a tack driver of a CZ .22, and another neat Remington made back in the 50s. I can't bring myself to sell either of those, so make me an offer.

These ""BO"" rifles were to be sold to Egypt, but the few thousand that were ready to go could not be shipped because of the outbreak of the Suez Crisis in 1956, after which most world armies switched to self loading, semi-auto or full auto military rifles.

Introducing the P320®, a pistol that defies comparison with revolutionary features that stand alone. A smooth, consistent trigger pull. Safe, tool-free disassembly. A proper fit for any hand size--no backstrap required. Consider the mold broken.

INNOVATIVE TO ITS CORE.
This is a gun. A gun that could only come from SIG. The P320 elevates the standard for a striker-fired pistol with an exceptional trigger and a design as dependable as it is one-of-a-kind.

SAFETY WITHOUT COMPROMISE.
Safety isn't negotiable. The P320 maximizes peace of mind with a robust safety system. Never again will you need to pull the trigger to disassemble your pistol. And, while available as an option, you won't need a tabbed trigger safety for your gun to be drop safe.

THE MOST ADAPTABLE PISTOL EVER.
No two hands-or scenarios-are quite the same. The P320 can be customized to meet the exact needs of the user. No backstraps required, no excuses accepted."

The owner knew Bob Munden and had at least three Colts customized by Munden Enterprises. This Colt was done in June of 1997 (see Munden letter included) at a cost of $500. The hammer pull back is ~4 ¾ lbs. and trigger pull is a crisp 1 3/4 lbs. (this trigger pull is not available from Munden Enterprises today). As evidenced by the photos this Colt is very clean. The one piece simulated ivory grip has some minor use marks (see photos). The barrel has sharp rifling.  The cylinder serial number does not match the frame. The owner purchased a new 5 ½” barrel ($300 today) and a new cylinder ($305 today) just in case (see photos) and they are included in the auction. We were told he purchased this Colt from a cowboy shooter who claimed the gun to be a movie gun originally customized by Thell Reed when he was the armorer for the movie Tombstone (1993). Note that the trigger guard has been modified (see photos) and he was told this was done to facilitate the Johnny Ringo gun handling sequence in the movie,. The one piece simulated ivory grip (see photos) that was on the gun when he acquired it is included in the auction. Note the condition which is said to have been caused from the gun being dropped numerous times. We contacted Thell Reed and he would neither confirm nor deny this was one of the guns he provided and used in the film. Doskocil blue hard case as shown in photos is included in the auction. Nice revolver with extras.

The 6.8 was developed as an improved CQB cartridge by the 5th Group Special Forces. The devastating performance combined with the AR15 makes it the #1 choice of hog and deer hunters . It has apx 80% of the performance of the 308 in a much lighter platform. Also more power than 30-30 and 300 BO and 6.5 Grendal
We have designed a 5 groove hybrid rifling similar to 5R with a low land to groove ratio to increase the bore area and lessen bullet deformation which leads to better accuracy. We have found that our 5R Melonite QPQ  barrels consistently produce 60-90fps more than most SPCII 10 and 11 twist 4 groove barrels with the same loads. Hornady's 110gr HPBTs reach 2600fps from our 16"" barrels and normally shoot under 3/4"" groups at 100yds. With better shooters groups are  near 1/2"" so they shoot better than some high dollar stainless barrels and most match grade 5.56s .  Hornady's 120gr SST and Federal's Fusion 115gr work very well on deer and hogs. With handloads it is possible to push a 100gr Nosler over 2900fps from a 18"" barrel, nothing else comes close to the performance of a 6.8.
The 6.8SPCII and 6.8x43 ARP chamber we use shoot the same ammo including SSAs Tac loads and Wilson Combats ammo uses the same size dies, only the throat in the chamber is different.  The chamber was designed to increase accuracy.
The only things needed to switch any 223/556 over to 6.8 is a barrel and bolt and magazine.

The rifle has a target trigger kit, though I cannot recall the brand or model.  The stock is a Shooter's Ridge right-handed thumb hole stock with a rubber recoil pad and rubber grip panels on the sides of the fore end.  The barrel is an Adams & Bennett, 18"" heavy barrel.  The scope is a BSA Sweet 22, 6-18 X 40.  I cannot recall the manufacturer of the bipod but it's a solid shooting base.  The rifle also has an extended magazine release and bolt handle.  One (1) 10 round Ruger magazine is included.

I thought about bragging on my experience with the rifle but I'm afraid the buyer might be upset if they don't perform as well with it.  I'll just say that the rifle, with the right ammo, right shooter, and right wind conditions is very accurate.  At the end of a shooting session I would remove the staples from the paper at 25 yards, one shot per staple.  At 50 yards I could still see and nail the staples, though at times it would take more than one shot per staple.

SPECS
These have undergone a full 2 stage nitriding process. Nitride is a chemical process that makes steel rust proof and has an extremely high ware resistance. Nitriding is what is being used in new production AR15  barrels (as opposed to chrome), bolt carriers and Glock slides.
Plainly put, it is the most protective treatment avalible for steel parts and these gas block sights have gone through two cycles of it.

A lot of the cheap surplus ammo is corrosive which will eat up your parts especially the gas block which is where all the gas comes out of. Having a nitrided gas block will substantially increase the service life of your rifle regardless of what you shoot out of it.

This process of nitriding is expensive to do that is why the cost of my parts are priced as they are. If you are trying to build a high end rifle, this part is a must.

INSTALLATION
These parts are a press fit meaning they are very tight fit to the barrel. This is necessary to insure it does not move. 
There is a set screw in the gas block that helps ensure it is aligned while testing. This set screw will hold the gas block in place during operation under light duty. If you dimple the top of the barrel so the set screw has something to fit into that would be ideal and insure it does not rotate if dropped. 
For extreme use and guaranteed reliably I machined two holes in the block so you can pin it to the barrel. If you want to go this route, use the set screw to keep the block in place while you drill the pin holes into the barrel.

I bought this new in later 2012 to have as a back up to an older version of the same gun. I have shot it in one tourney event right after I bought it and a handful of targets in the back yard. Action and wood have round count less than 150. Has spent the majority of its time as a safe queen. Have cased it and transported to shoots a number of times but back up was never required.

Your choice on barrel length. I have both 28 and 30 inch and have switched back and forth so both barrels have a lot more rounds thru them and show honest wear marks typical at the contact points for the forend.

There is one difference between the two barrels. The 30 inch barrel does have a second rib which is marked 70/30. the 28 inch barrel does not have a second optional rib. 

Will come in a factory plastic case with assorted manuals, tools, front end weight system and offered with 1 factory Beretta Optima Mod choke tube and a Seminole Light Mod choke tube.

Asking price is $1475 shipped to your FFL in the lower 48. Beretta no longer offers this model. It is considered one of the very best autoloader target guns ever made. My experience with its older friend residing in my safe has been exceptional."

It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.      The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.      The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes.

WILL FIT AK PATTERN RIFLES AND PISTOLS Barrel diameter must be 15mm. ONLY WORKS ON 90° GAS PORTS. SPECS These have undergone a full 2 stage nitriding process. Nitride is a chemical process that makes steel rust proof and has an extremely high ware resistance.

Plainly put, it is the most protective treatment avalible for steel parts and these gas block sights have gone through two cycles of it. A lot of the cheap surplus ammo is corrosive which will eat up your parts especially the gas block which is where all the gas comes out of. Having a nitrided gas block will substantially increase the service life of your rifle regardless of what you shoot out of it. This process of nitriding is expensive to do that is why the cost of my parts are priced as they are. If you are trying to build a high end rifle, this part is a must. INSTALLATION These parts are a press fit meaning they are very tight fit to the barrel. This is necessary to insure it does not move. There is a set screw in the gas block that helps ensure it is aligned while testing. This set screw will hold the gas block in place during operation under light duty. If you dimple the top of the barrel so the set screw has something to fit into that would be ideal and insure it does not rotate if dropped. For extreme use and guaranteed reliably I machined two holes in the block so you can pin it to the barrel. If you want to go this route, use the set screw to keep the block in place while you drill the pin holes into the barrel. $100 FREE SHIPPING Tyler Lumsden REDACTED Text or email preferred"

Single shot, 27"" barrel, chrome bolt/trigger. First year made and only year with finger grooves. Metal and wood are in excellent condition for a 80 year old firearm. It shoots like a laser beam and is hands down the most accurate .22 with open sights I have ever shot. In fact I love the Model 67's so much I have too many of them. These are great guns and with no powder or subsonic ammo it is as silent as a CO2 pellet gun. It will shoot LR, Long, Short, and CB. This is a great firearm for young and old. 

This is a  real deal Winchester. This rifle has gone 80 years and still shoots and looks great. Real wood. Real steel. No plastic. This rifle might even be too manly for some. This rifle will outlast all of us. In fact, when the world ends there will only be cockroaches, Keith Richards, and Model 67's left.

Another great thing about Model 67's is the price. I will be honest and tell you Model 67 prices stay about the same. They range from $100 to $200 on average depending on condition and when made. There are no serial numbers on any of them (all were made before serial numbers were required) so you have to know what parts Winchester used in what years. As such this rifle is $160 firm. Sure you could buy a plastic semi-auto for that kind of money, but it will take all 10 rounds to do the job versus one shot out of 27 inches of steel precision. Plus it will shoot whatever you feed it. Model 67 don't care. He eats anything. $160 folks. Take yours home today.

   For local FTF private-party transfer sale only at a nearby FFL in the South Bay L.A. area, no shipping on this one.

H&K USP with ""AC"" date code on the frame, which is 2002 manafacture date.
I bought this new in January of 2003, my pickup sticker is still on the HK case.

   In perfect condition, a H&K USP 45 with fixed tritium night sights, in the original H&K hard case with H&K operator's manual, two 10-round magazines, factory test round casing, ...

One of the world's most popular military and law enforcement carbine models, the Bushmaster M4 features the distinctive M4 barrel profile and a six-position telestock for ease of deployment. The Bushmaster A3 Patrolman's Carbine is modeled after their U.S. Military and law-enforcement utilized M4 Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individuals. The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. calibered 16-inch barrel is chrome-lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a birdcage type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. The telestock, pistol grip, and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16-A2 rear sight system on the Patrolman's Carbine offers both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. The rifle weighs just 6.7 pounds and has a 1 in 9” right-handed twist chrome lined barrel. This rifle comes with a 30-round magazine"

I would trade for something on equal value. Might add ammo to even up trade if necessary. Check out the reviews on these guns and the customer service they offer. Great value for the money. If the add is still up, then it's still available, but would like to trade soon! The temptation to shoot it is high!

952,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4464952,For Trade:  WTT ATV for Firearm,"Southtowns, Buffalo, New York",Offer,"Listed On: Saturday, June 27, 2015",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Available for trade for a firearm:  1994 Suzuki Quad Runner 4x4, with 364 original miles.  I inherited the Suzuki from my father a few years ago when he passed away.   I had the quad serviced (oil change and new battery) when I brought it here from Vermont, registered it, drove it a few miles, and it has sat in my garage since.  It currently does not start, and a rear tire has gone flat- I think it got a thorn in it while driving it on my property.  Because it doesn’t start, I’m selling it “as is”.  As you can see from the low mileage, it wasn’t used much (for hunting only), but the down side was my dad stored outside for some time, accounting for the rust on the metal, and the seat cover deteriorating.   The ATV, aside from the surface rust and seat cover, is in quite good condition.  The body is free of cracks & dents.  If you are mechanically inclined, this is quite a find.  I am looking to trade the ATV even up for a firearm.  Please tell me what you have to trade, I prefer “new in box” or “like new in box”, but am open to any rifle, shotgun or pistol.  Please let me know what you have, and I will trade when the right deal becomes available.  The ATV (and it’s owner) are NY residents, so the firearm will need to go through an FFL.   The NY DMV didn’t issue a title- (they said the registration will allow for legal ownership transfer) and a bill of sale will be included."

The bad: Someone at some point scratched an M onto the receiver. Hard to see in the photos but I have larger photo I can send. Previous owner must have hit the safe or something and there is a linear dent across the top of the stock just behind the receiver.

Price is appropriate for the two cosmetic problems. Keeps it from being a true collectors item but will make a fantastic shooting rifle and really is a great example of a Remington. Without the cosmetic items it's easily a $900 rifle. No trades please. I wouldn't sell this one if I didn't need the funds for other projects."
