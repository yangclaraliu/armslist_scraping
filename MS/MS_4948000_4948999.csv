Both the rifle and the scope are very collectible and one of the best quality hunting rifles ever produced....hard to find in this condition!  Not perfect but overall excellent collectible condition. This great rifle was made in the mid to late 50's and is all original.  This is a great find and investment.....been a safe queen for me, just thought someone else might get more use out of it than me.  Price is FIRM, but I may consider a trade up or down for a modern type toy IF it works for me only.....neither broke nor ""stupid"".....so please, no stupid trades or offer.  Face to face ONLY.  You must be able to legally buy a firearm in the state of FL and your FL drivers license and/or CWP is required. NO exceptions.  If still listed, it is still for sale. Thank you for looking and have a good one!"

Hogue wood and rubber grips with finger grooves, with checkering on the front strap under the grip, if you want to change the grips, but the grips provide a lot of cushioning.

- Fiber Optic Dual Line Sight System Optimized for fast-handling balance/instinctive pointing
- Ultrareliable Inertia Driven semiautomatic bolt system

- 4+1 capacity for 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells

The Franchi I-12 represents a new line of Franchi auto-loaders by incorporating a free-floating bolt with the Inertia Driven System. The I-12 is well-balanced, and features a narrow-profile fore-end and buttstock. This Franchi shotgun will handle anything from 1-1/8-ounce target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. Every I-12 Franchi shotgun is powered by the Inertia Driven System. That means no bulky gas cylinders, valves, pistons, or hardware. Without that extra baggage, the I-12 has a slender, low-profile fore-end that fits the shooter's hand for comfortable handling. The I-12's specially-designed recoil pad incorporates a two-part system called the Twin Shock Absorber. During firing, the TSA recoil pad initially holds its shape, and then deeply compresses with the recoil, soaking up the kick and spreading recoil energy over a wider area of the shooter's shoulder, reducing felt recoil by up to 44%. The I-12 in Max-4 HD is an ideal choice as a waterfowl gun. This variant also features a 28-inch ventilated rib barrel, and a red-bar front sight and includes a set of screw-in choke tubes.

Comes with all the chokes plus a Carlson's Black Cloud Duck Choke and even a very TIGHT EXTRA FULL turkey choke that sticks out the barrel 2 inches. These 2 chokes alone are worth at least $100.

Also includes a full set of custom Buttstock shims to allow adjustment in length, as well as side-to-side and Up/Down.

As well as an additional Buttsock Cheekpad from Benelli.

MSRP: $849

Total investment is over $1000"
