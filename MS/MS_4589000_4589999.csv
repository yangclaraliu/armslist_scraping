This an Italian manufactured tactical shotgun, as used by Czech special forces, Canadian anti-terror forces, Indonesia's KOPASKA force, Luxembourg's Police Counter Terrorism units, and others. It features a unique semi-auto or pump selectable action (useful for switching from buckshot defense rounds to specialty ammo that can't cycle the action, like tear gas or taser rounds). Benelli's semi-autos are world renowned for their speed and durability, and it holds true for the M3. 

It has a cylinder bore 18 1/2"" barrel. This one has the rare top-folding rear should stock which doubles as a carrying handle. Pistol grip. Sling, tactical case, and manual are included. Front grip plastic is worn around assembly nuts, see last pic. Firearm condition is ""very good""... some finish wear on moving parts, but rest of finish is like new. 

Works fantastic, I'm just selling to fund other toys.

The gunsmith (post retirement age) who installed the Big Dots made a bit of a mess of it. (XS Big Dot admitted some fault and sent free replacements.) There are minor scratches around front and rear sights and some blacking was unwisely added to cover. The marks are minor but detract from the appearance. I'm selling because I have four other Kahrs and need the money for some accessories. The blemishes don't bother me but they would some people. The photos make it look worse than it is. Maybe a decent gunsmith could clean it up for a few bucks, I haven't checked. Other than the minor blemishes the gun and sights are great. I'd be asking $600 if not for the marks. $425 obo."

Made in the Czech Republic. CZ-75 B. One of the most accurate handguns ever produced. Will eat whatever you feed it and cycles reliably. Upgraded hammer spring to prevent light striking of primers. Good rounds will go ""bang"" every time. Beefier recoil spring to tame those 147gr +P defensive rounds. Improved trigger for a crisper and cleaner break. 

I've put about 200 rounds through the firearm, and it has run flawlessly. The handgun is for more accurate than I am, and I've made 2-3 inch groups at 25 yards with 115gr range ammo. As much as I love this firearm, I've made the decision to let it go because I am moving soon. Also, it's a large framed pistol and I have fairly small hands. Because of an arm injury, I just don't have the strength to keep pulling that trigger after a while.

There are minor surface scratch just to the finish on the back of the frames on both side between hammer and safety and a very minor scratchings on the backside of the frame by the hand guard. Other than those minor cosmetic things, it's a beauty. Just comes with one mag."

I'll be truthful and tell you that I have shot hundreds of rounds through this little pistol and will also tell you that as long as you keep it reasonably clean, it will function without fail. The trigger is heavy and takes some getting used to. I bought it in July 2012 for my wife but she just doesn't carry.

I have added all of the upgrades you could possible add that add to the feel and function of the gun.  The big ones are the Apex system.  With this you can customize the trigger to however you want.  I have the trigger right now at 6lbs.  You can make it about 4.5 by adding the striker block spring back in and the stock trigger spring.

Both are Gen 3's and in excellent condition, and both come with 4 mags each. I don't really need both, so I'd like to trade one of them for their corresponding compact or full sized model, so I'd be interested in swapping the 26 for a Glock 19 or 17, or the 27 for a 23 or 22, any of these models with a matching number of mags. Might consider other quality handguns in 9mm or 40, in a mid or full size for one of them, but I'm only wanting to trade it for the same caliber (9mm for 9mm, 40 for 40). Would really like a Walther PPQ or Sig p320. No Taurus or Kel Tec or long guns please.

If you'd rather buy I will sell one of them (your choice) for $450.

The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel. Vepr in 7.62x39 caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 16” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope. Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage. They are shipped with one 10-round magazine and one 5 round magazine, a cleaning rod, and a cleaning kit. Pictures are stock pictures and wood grain will vary from rifle to rifle. Payment can be made with Postal Money Order/Certified Check or account. We charge $20.00 to ship this firearm UPS to your destination. contact 6264154940 or goergejwell@yahoo.com"

 The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.
 When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.

As you can see from the pics it was tastefully reworked with attention to detail and craftsmanship. The barrel is approximately 19 inches long, and looks awesome with the ful length stock. It is drilled and tapped for scope mounts, I got it with the mounts still attached and simply put the rings and scope on. The scope is a 1970's vintage Weaver 2.5-7x32 Wide field or ""TV View"". Do some research on these and you'll see that they regularly sell for what new scopes do because they work so well. If you're wondering why I set my price where I did, do some research. ANY sporterized Mauser will sell for $250-300. This one has been rebarreled, restocked, bedded, and had a new safety and trigger installed. A very well done Guild Mauser sporter can run a couple of grand. This is a former military gun, very well sporterized with an great, vintage original Weaver on it. If you were to do something like this yourself, you'd be out well north of $1000, and that's without a decent Mauser to start with! This rifle is ready to hunt as is, grab it now and kill a deer Saturday!"

There is some scuffing on the front of the bow from my wedding ring rubbing the powder off. I have never dry fired it, dropped it, tripped with it. This bow was serviced by Borkholder Archery when I bought it, they installed the VaporTrails, peep, D-loop and set my arrows up. There is no cracking on the limbs and there is no Cam lean.

A WHOLE NEW LEGEND.

It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference."

It's in good used condition, with two 8 round magazines, black composite handgrip, black alloy frame, black/blued steel slide. 

  West German issued Swiss SIG SAUER P6 9mm, their military and police version of the P225, manafactured to the ""P"" standards of the Republic.    You can tell commercial models from cop guns by the ""P6"" marking, four-digit born-on date, and funky little Deformationssporn hooked hammer.  Each of the states in Germany had its own police force known as the Landespolizei (State Police) and they, along with the Federal Police and municipal police forces were allowed to select any of the approved ‘P’ guns to arm their officers. 
  Switzerland’s SIG works had previously sold the Germans a small number of P2s, and introduced their new P225 pistol to replace stocks of Walther P1s in 1975. 
  They collaborated with J. P. Sauer & Sohn, a local German company, to make a bid. This led to the beautiful relationship that became SIG-Sauer while the gun this union created was adopted as the P6. 
  Some 40,000 of these handguns were made at Sauer’s factory in Eckenförde, Germany, making it one of the most popular Teutonic police pistols of the 1980s. 

I've heard some P6 owners say that they easily added Sig Pro night sights that popped right on with the assistance of a sight pusher.
How does it shoot? Say what you will, but like many of my other pieces, I've never had the time to take it to the range. That's what living in L.A. can do to you. Still I like it by itself, just as a piece of history.

Honestly, this is a great gun, but I need some money for school. It feeds and ejects reliably. It's compact and SUPER lightweight. The only thing needed is the optic of your choice. It's great for hunting, or as a SHTF gun because .308 Winchester is a common round. You could even squeeze it into the scout rifle category. As above, it comes with a sling, a bipod, scope rings, an extra magazine, snap caps, and a soft carry case. It's easy to clean and has an adjustable trigger. The original user manual is included. Plus, you get 120 rounds of .308 to sight in your gun and get familiar with it. Email me if you have questions OR WANT TO MAKE AN OFFER . Thanks!!!"

Only 300, this is #230. Polished blue barrel and slide and polished stainless steel frame.

It is an ""Ultimate Commander"", by name, and was only made one year, 1998. It has a bright stainless steel frame and a blue slide. I have fired the gun maybe 25-30 times and can tell you it is as accurate as I can shoot it and never once jammed or failed to detonate a round. I haven't owned the gun all that long, about a year, and am only getting rid of it because I traded into another .45 ACP Commander that I like and decided I don't need two of them in the same caliber.

A true collectors item.

ps. It has one light scuff (not a scratch - cant feel it with finger) on slide (purchased it like that) 
Comes with one colt magazine
