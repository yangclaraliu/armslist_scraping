In 1983, Ruger responded to the many shooters who desired a high-quality, adult-size 22 rimfire rifle - one that was built to centerfire standards of strength, accuracy and aesthetics. Focused on building a rifle that was accurate, economical, and extremely handsome, Bill Ruger launched the family of bolt-action rifles using the rotary magazine.
Solid, heat-treated alloy and stainless steel actions that feature a rugged, right-hand turning bolt with 90-degree bolt lift and ultra-fast lock time for added accuracy.

Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings, eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field.

Three-position safety is easily accessible and allows the shooter to lock the bolt to load and unload the rifle with the safety engaged.

Patented detachable rotary magazine features a unique rotor to separate cartridges and provide reliable feeding; mounts flush with the stock to eliminate protrusions at the rifle's balance point.

FEATURES:
- Mounts on mil-spec sized carbine receiver extension tube (not included) from manufacturers such as Colt, Armalite, S&W, LMT, and others (please see the note below)
- Two water-resistant battery storage tubes located on the left and right sides of the stock
- Each tube will store up to two (2) CR123A lithium or AA batteries

SUMMARY: 
I'm selling my Magpul STR Carbine Stock made for Mil-Spec buffer tubes. It's still in excellent condition, having rarely been used, with all of it's original packaging and package contents. I purchased this stock because of its superior cheek weld and spare battery storage (for my weapon light and optic), and it met those requirements perfectly. The reason I'm selling it is because I'm modifying my current AR build into an SBR soon (pending application), and have decided to eliminate/replace several of my accessories (including this stock) in order to make a lighter rifle.

Tamron's SP AF17-50mm F/2.8 XR Di II VC LD Aspherical (IF) is a high-speed, wide-to-moderate-telephoto zoom lens designed for Canon DSLR cameras with smaller sensors. It covers the very popular 17-50mm focal length range (equivalent to 26-78mm in the full-frame 35mm format) making it extremely versatile. Tamron's Vibration Compensation (VC) mechanism minimizes the effects of handheld camera shake (up to 4-stops), providing a means to great low-light shooting.

The lens delivers impressive sharpness and striking contrast over its entire focal length and aperture range. A maximum aperture of f/2.8 delivers images enhanced by shallow depth-of-field, and smooth, natural transitions in out-of-focus areas of the image. Additionally, this lens carries a 6-Year Tamron Limited Warranty (U.S.A. only) 

Di II Lenses are designed for exclusive use on digital cameras with smaller-size imagers. These lenses are not designed for conventional cameras or digital cameras with image sensors larger than APS-C size (24mm x 16mm)."

The gun has been media blasted and coated in a bake on matte black paint that won't rust even when the finish is scratched off. The factory stock has been taken off and a hogue black over mold stock installed, the fore end was milled to fit the 3.5in chambered gun as there are no after market fore ends for a 3.5in gun to my knowlege. The choke is made by Jebbs and alone cost over 100 dollars to get made, they hold world records with their chokes. The barrel has been polished and the forcing cone slowly tuned to increase shot velocity and paternity uniformity. The reciever has been drilled and set up with a removable rail for any optics. The factory follower was swapped for a higher quality aluminum follower. If you are hunting turkey you must run an optic on the gun or you will miss the bird if it comes in closer than 30 yards. This gun and choke is set up for 40-65 yards. If you put on another choke you can open the close range pattern and get a good standard closer range shotgun. It shoots like a dream and I don't want to get rid of it but I have a new gun project I need to fund."

This particular example has the adjustable target rear sight, target trigger and hammer (both The trigger and hammer were jeweled many years ago when it was first purchased). I have a copy of the original purchase permit dated 12/23/1970. There is some bluing loss at the end of the barrel, and a slight line around the cylinder. The original wood grips were replaced with a set of Pachmayers (no, I don't have the original grips). This is a sweet shooting pistol and extremely accurate. The trigger is smooth and crisp. It is a fantastic gun, but I just don't shoot it enough to justify keeping it.

It is extremely accurate and the recoil is very manageable. My wife could shoot it well. 

But then I figured out that it is not a 1911. Although it works perectly, I just cant get past the fact that it is not a 1911. I dont know what it is exactly, but it just is not a 1911. So I'm selling it.

I have since found another carry gun that is more comfortable and the CZ has sat unused. 

 Being as I bought the gun used, I can't be sure how many rounds it has seen. There is some wear on the finish of the slide rails forward of the dust cover. Nothing drastic, but you can tell it has been fired. Aside from that, the finish is in great condition. The gun is very accurate and a great shooter, and I love the stock sights. The tritium is almost completely faded, however. 

 The gun will come with everything seen in the picture. Box, paperwork, and two 14 round magazines. Pick up will be FTF on the west side of Indy. I'm willing to travel along 465 anywhere between 71st and East street; but would prefer the Brownsburg, Avon, Plainfield area. I'll need to see a valid Indiana DL and preferably sign a bill of sale.
