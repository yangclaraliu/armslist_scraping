I will personally draft and customize your N.F.A.firearms trust for purchasing such Class 3 items. A Gun Trust is a revocable trust, which you may revoke, or amend whenever you wish. No additional charge for up to an hour in-office, or telephone, consultation. As I will not simply be inserting names into a template, the usual turnaround time for completion is four (4) business days.  If circumstances require, for no additional charge, I probably would be able expedite the process to as little as 24 hrs.   Owners of Class 3 items should avoid relying on boilerplate forms, trust software, or trusts that are not drafted by an attorney, because they may not comply with the unique issues involving suppressors, silencers, fully automatic rifles, SBRs, and other Title 2, or Class 3 weapons regulated by the National Firearms Act (NFA). A N.F.A.Trust will allow you to: avoid Chief Law Enforcement officer sign offs; Avoid having to get finger printed; Avoid having to get photographs taken; Have the capability to file electronically; Allow more than 1 person to LEGALLY take possession and use your N.F.A.devices;and Streamline inheritance, and passing down of firearms to future generations. The majority of Gun Trusts are prepared for a total price of $219.00. Sure you can probably find an online $29.99 form, but having a trained chimp lawyer wannabee prepare your N.F.A. Gun Trust, if done improperly, can result in your firearms being confiscated by the ATF, a $250,000.00 fine, and your potential exposure to felony violations of the National Firearms Act. “Intent” is not a requirement for being convicted of a violation under the National Firearms Act. Contact Elliot Goldstein, Esq./J.& G.

 I'm being really fair on this in my estimation, based on how few there seems to be to price compare to, and then going lower by a grand. (keep in mind, this is W. German marked all real import, not like a Vulcan built post '90) 
 I'll consider some partial trades, but prefer to not take more than 700 in a trade item/s. A ps90, H&K SL8 converted into a G36, M1A, AR10 variant, or Steyr Aug would be exceptions that I'd consider up to 1400. Trades I'd really like to see: an Extar exp 556 pistol, preferably just plain and used price of 475 or less, or a Kel Tech PLR-16 under msrp priced (665). Sure, an extra mag or two, or especially a single point sling would be cool ad ons, but not hundreds in optics and furniture, I am looking for cash, so can forego all the gun bling that seems trendy lately. Okay, maybe a Pap 85np, but I prefer the lighter weight guys. Other trades I would highly be interested in, Commander or Government sized 1911, FNX/FNP 45, Sig 220 or 227 or full sized 250 in .45, Berretta 92, or a Taurus 608 4 or 5"" barrel (8 shot .357).

The SAS Model is similar to the standard P238, but Sig put it through a radical dehorning process resulting in a ultra smooth, snag free profile that is designed for concealed carry. There are no corners on this gun because of this process, and it makes it very comfortable to hide or conceal.

It is very much like a conceal size version of the 1911. The overall length is 5.5"" and the overall height is 3.96"". The SAS weighs 15oz so it fits great as a pocket carry weapon. It has gorgeous wood grips and has the SigLite night sights on it.

I bought it for my wife, and she put 2 boxes of .380 shells through it, and decided it was too small for her liking. The SAS has the smoothest slide I have ever found on a new gun.

The SAS comes with the original lockable hard case. Also, an extra magazine with the pinky extension, a holster, the lock, and test fire shell.

Please let me know if you have any questions."

Happily, this rifle is not part of the Remington 700 trigger recalls.

Note: There's a small crack in the cheapo factory scope cover, which has been there since original purchase and does not affect protection whatsoever. Despite any functional problems, l am reflecting this in the price because I would nit-pick it if I were buying too.

All original shotgun with matching barrel and receiver numbers. Shotgun was made in 1926 according to the barrel code. Action is still smooth and locks up tight. This design was later used by Ithaca in thier model 37 pump guns. Bluing is very decent considering its age though it has lightened in the usual handling areas. 28"" barrel has a clean mirrorlike bore with a fixed full choke. This would make an excellent addition to your Remington collection as they were only made for a short time frame. More info on the Remington 17:In 1915 John Browning patented a pump-action shotgun with the following features: hammerless, under-loading, tubular-magazine, bottom-ejecting, and take-down. This design would eventually become the Remington Model 17.[1] Manufacturing rights were sold to Remington Arms shortly after, but due to the production efforts of World War I, Remington was unable to begin manufacturing until 1921. Before production began John Pedersen made alterations to the design, with more changes made later by G.H. Garrison. The Model 17 was a trim, 20-gauge shotgun that served as the design basis for three highly successful shotguns: the Remington Model 31, the Ithaca 37 and the Browning BPS. Additionally, features of the Model 17 were also incorporated in the later Mossberg 500 and Remington 870.

Two 15 round mags
interchangeable back straps, two pinky extensions that add +2 to the mags, has the standard Decocker on it but also has the thumb safety you can swap out so you can go single action mode and carry like a 1911.
I paid $580(after taxes) for this from my lgs. Nothing  wrong with it, i rented one and it shot sweet, Recoil is hardly there.
it's a pleasure to shoot and has such a low bore axis that recoil is somewhat similar to a rim fire .22, yes it's that soft. Only reason I'm selling is because I would like to get back into a Glock, it's a platform I'm most familiar and comfortable with.

I will sell for $450 cash

The only reason I'm selling is because I'm just used to and prefer the Glock platform.

There are modifications to this XDM that put it a big step ahead of a stock 5.25...

- Carver Competition Weaver Optic Mount- $135 (unshippped)
- Sightmark red dot sight- $100 (unshipped)
- Powder River Precision Extreme Trigger kit: shortened 2.5 lb pull, short reset and fitted overtravel trigger stop- $165 (unshipped)
- Hand fitted grip safety to sear matchup
- smoothed trigger transfer bar with 2000 grit sandpaper

I have a little over $500 into the modifications including shipping costs.

There are 5 magazines, and all the xdm gear that comes with any new xdm as well as the factory trigger parts to return it to the factory pull if desired.

Very good shooting pistol, shot very little since I've owned it. Sighted the red dot in at 15 yards and it'll place bullet holes touching if proper trigger control is exercised. I've found out that I'm more of a revolver guy because ammo lasts longer and I want a more powerful round. 

I'm looking to sell for $1100 cash or trade for a Ruger Redhawk or GP100 .357 Mag revolver plus cash or bulk ammo to make the trade even. Other 4-6 inch revolver trades may be considered. No snub nose or long barrel revolvers please. 

I'll keep the bulky red dot sight and shave $100 off the price. You can attach any Weaver/picatinny mount red dot sight that you want to the Carver mount. 

So that's $1000 without the red dot cash or trade value. $1100 cash or trade with the sight."

The shotgun above consists of a crude barrel made from a soft metal tube sliding over another tube. The user would push it forward (as shown in the image above) and load a cartridge into the back of it. The firing mechanism was extremely primitive as well. It consisted of a fixed firing pin, which was a nail that was fixed to the handle. To fire it, the user would simply slide the barrel back hard enough so that it slammed against the nail, which would detonate the cartridge and fire it. There was no rifling in the barrel and the weapon was only effective at short ranges and was mainly used to disable an enemy and take his firearm. Several guerillas who had fought with Richardson used these weapons against the Japanese.

Gun shoots absolutely flawlessly. Has everything that came in the box. Gun, box, 2-8 round mags, bushing wrench, cable lock, manual, spent casing, etc.

 I'm the second owner. First owner put 50 rounds through it then traded it to me. I (and my brother/cousin) have put about 150 rounds through it. Zero malfunctions and it's been babied the whole time. Finish on it is still mint.

 New price on Bud's is about $850 so I'm asking $800/offer.

 Not sure about trades. Really I'm just thinking of dropping this to pick up something more practical. It's a great gun, but it's a range toy for me, and I already have a couple of those.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.
 
Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin."

Over $800 invested WITHOUT the ammo, that would easily be another $150. So, well over $900 between the gun, ammo and extras. Grip tape in pics peels right off.

The Magpul CTR (Compact/Type Restricted) – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability* and an ambidextrous QD sling mount that will accept any push-button sling swivel. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.Caliber .45ACPRecoil System Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide RodSights Fiber Optic Front & Dovetail Rear (Steel)Weight (with Empty Magazine) 21.5 ozs.Height 4.4""Slide Forged Steel, Melonite® FinishBarrel 3.3"" Steel, Melonite®, Hammer ForgedLength 6.3""Grip Width .9""Frame Black PolymerMagazines 1 - 5 Round Flush Fitting, 1 - 6 Round With Mid-Mag X-Tension™, Stainless SteelPlease note, this is the new version of the gun with the added 6 round magazine vs. two 5 round magazines.

New , unissued Springfield 1903-A3(some 2 groove and some 4 groove) barrels were then fitted to these new chambers . This is NOT a barrel sleeve/solder fill conversion.

Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing.Easy to ConcealWhether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.Personal Protection Made EasyThe Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.Easy to Use and MaintainThe Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA.For comparative price, we usually check with Bud's Gun Shop.  A benchmark for internet pricing.Their CASH discount price right now is $398 with free shipping and a typical $25 FFL fee for a total cost of around $423.We are offering the gun for $369, taxes, shipping, and FFL fee INCLUDED and you can have it NOW, not having to wait!  Save $56 off of the Bud's price and you don't have to wait!Comes complete in box with hard plastic case, the two magazines, gun lock, instruction manual, and warranty manual.  Sending in the registration will extend the warranty from one to three years!  You get the FULL manufacturer warranty as we are a dealer, not a 2nd party seller.NOTE:  The one shown in the case is all black, not the FDE version we are selling.Beretta firearms carry a One-Year Limited Warranty to the original purchaser for defects in materials or workmanship.

The barrel has a few unique options like the dovetailed front sight, integral Picatinny rail, and of course the custom muzzle brake. The best feature of all is the Red/Green dot optical sight that ships with this ultimate hunting handgun.

The U.S. Navy SEALS, state police departments across the U.S., and many of the most elite law enforcement agencies all carry the P226. There are many reasons, but just a few are the versatility the pistol gives in its 9mm, .357 SIG and .40 S&W forms, its exceptional balance, and its highly-refined ergonomics. The gun fits your hand beautifully! And while it sounds redundant with SIG, these pistols are unbelievably reliable and always accurate. If there is a standard in combat pistols, P226 is definitely it. It was designed as SIG's attempt to replace the 1911 in military trials, and it has occupied a place of honor next to the 1911 ever since.

These came with a trade I made recently, but I have plenty of factory magazines, so I don't really need these. They all function fine but being used they have cosmetic wear. Please note that these do not have slots for heel releases, so they will not work in a 92S but will work in all newer models (92F, 92FS, M9, etc). I should also specify since this became a problem that these magazines are for a BERETTA 92; they WILL NOT work in a Taurus PT92 without modification. Looking to get $45 for the lot, thats $9 a piece, which I feel is more than fair. I would also be interested in making a trade for a Mec-Gar 20 round Beretta 92 magazine.

The original name, Confederate Air Force, started as a simple tongue in cheek joke, poking fun at the organization's ragtag beginnings. As the collection of Warbirds at Central Valley Airport in Mercedes, Texas started to grow, someone painted the name on the side of the original North American P-51 Mustang Red Nose. The name stuck, and it grew to the point where the airport was renamed Rebel Field, all members were called ""Colonels"" (a tradition which still remains), and it led to the creation of a fictitious leader named Colonel Jethro E. Culpepper. There was even a humorous CAF twist put to the old AVG Flying Tigers World War II ""blood chit"" that read, ""This foreign person has come to China to help in the war effort. Soldiers and civilians, one and all, should rescue, protect, and provide him medical care."" The CAF version seen on the backs of flight suits and flight jackets stated, ""This is a CAF aviator. If found lost or unconscious, please hide him from Yankees, revive with mint julep and assist him in returning to friendly territory. CONFEDERATE AIR FORCE"".

In 2002 it changed its name to Commemorative Air Force after a vote of the membership. Many felt the name Confederate Air Force was confusing, was not politically correct, did not accurately reflect the purpose of the organization, and was detrimental to fundraising efforts. This name change was deemed by some fans to be a move of political correctness. The reason for the name change as stated by the organization was ""Because the word 'Confederate' is offensive to some.

The origin of the CONFEDERATE AIR FORCE"" dates back to 1957, when Lloyd Nolen and four friends purchased a P-51 Mustang, each sharing in the $1,500 cost of the aircraft. With the purchase of the Mustang, known as Red Nose, the group was unofficially founded.

In 1958, the group made their second purchase of two Grumman F8F Bearcats for $805 each. Along with the P-51, this gave the pilots the two most advanced piston-engine fighters to see service with the U.S. Army Air Forces and the United States Navy.

In 1960, the CAF began seriously to search for other World War II aircraft. The CAF Colonels were shocked to find that the aircraft which played such a major role in winning World War II were being rapidly and systematically scrapped as obsolete. No one, not even the Air Force or Navy, was attempting to preserve one of each type of these historic aircraft for display for future generations. The warbirds that remained airworthy were mostly in private hands modified for air racing or had been converted for commercial use as air freighters and aerial firefighters.

On September 6, 1961, the “CONFEDERATE AIR FORCE"" was chartered as a nonprofit Texas corporation to restore and preserve World War II-era combat aircraft. By the end of the year, there were nine aircraft in the CAF fleet. Their first airshow was held on March 10, 1963.

In 1965, the first museum building was completed at old Rebel Field, Mercedes, Texas. The CAF created a new Rebel Field at Harlingen, Texas, when they moved there in 1968, occupying three large buildings including 26,000 square feet (2,400 m2) of museum space. The CAF fleet continued to grow. By the end of the decade, the CAF fleet included medium and heavy bombers such as the North American B-25 Mitchell, B-17, Consolidated B-24 Liberator. In 1971, they added the world's only airworthy Boeing B-29 Superfortress, FiFi.

The group's accomplishments were recognized in 1989 when it became a National Aviation Hall of Fame Spirit of Flight Award winner.[2] 1991 marked the beginning of a new era for the CAF with the opening of the new Midland, Texas, headquarters and museum facilities. Once in Midland, the group also established the American Airpower Heritage Museum and the American Combat Airman Hall of Fame.[3][4]

In April of 2014, the CAF announced the move of their headquarters and all of the planes associated with the headquarters to Dallas Executive Airport in Dallas, TX The museum and its artifacts (including the nose art collection) will also be moved to the new headquarters in Dallas. 

You may never have another chance to own a Colt 1911 as beautiful, unique and politically incorrect as this treasure. 

The only reason I am selling it is that I am 73 years old and have serious medical problems and have no family members who would appreciate what this is. So I want to sell this to someone who can appreciate it as much as I have.

The photos do not show the proper color of the gold. It is consistent in color and depth throughout. The lighting in the photo has distorted the color of the engraving and the bluing. This gun is incredibly beautiful and the photo does not do it justice."

You can see from the photos this gun is in excellent shape.  I bought it new a few weeks ago and it has approximately 100 rounds through it.  It really didn’t need much breaking in.

I truly wanted this gun to work for me but it’s a little snappy for my old arthritic hands. That’s a shame because this one’s very reliable, unlike some of them out there.

The DB9 is an outstanding pocket-carry design with a smooth trigger, very similar to a Glock (even down to its take-down method).  It's light weight with an ultra-flat profile (11 oz. weight & 0.8 inch width) and that makes it the lightest, slimmest, and smallest 9mm available (you won’t have to settle for a .380).  It's easy to pocket carry and  just disappears in your pocket or purse.

I’ve found that the DB9 likes a steady diet of Remington UMC 115 gr JHP’s.  These rounds run toward the lower end of the SAAMI spec for overall length.  I’ve put a digital caliper on these rounds and they average about a thousandth of an inch shorter than most other 9mm rounds…certainly within the SAAMI spec but just short enough to accommodate the tight tolerances of this micro-nine.  This DB9 loves them and if you feed it well, it will perform for you.

The full package comes with Diamondback’s really nice hard case (like a Pelican case), trigger lock, all paperwork that came from the factory (as shown in photo) including the unused factory Warranty/Registration card.  It also includes the 6-round mag with pinkie extension supplied by Diamondback and a slim pocket-carry holster.

The serial number begins with “YC9...” so you know this is a very recently manufactured gun.

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with valid TN driver’s license or permit.

If I don’t respond to your email immediately, it only means I’m at work and I’ll respond soon after I get home.  If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.

Cash only please (so I can go buy a more arthritic-friendly gun).

Sorry, but I’m not looking for a trade or low-ball offers.  Thanks!"
