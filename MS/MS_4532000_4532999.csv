The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56 but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same."

156,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4532156,For Sale:  Venom Tactical AK47 / AK-74 Gas Block,"Jax Beach, Jacksonville, Florida",$ 110,"Listed On: Wednesday, August 26, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"BRAND NEW BOLTON VENOM TACTICAL GAS BLOCK, SOLD OUT ONLINE.
This gas block has been updated with double gas ports for use with 45 deg and 90 deg angled gas ports.
The front port is for 45 deg barrels and the rear port is for 90 deg barrels.
The AK 47 gas block combines the front sight and gas block into one assembly. We have sold thousands of these assembly's. They have proven to be very reliable under combat conditions.
The combination gas block/front sight allows the front end of the AK47/74 to be lightened up and makes the handling of the weapon noticeably more efficient. The assembly also allows the barrel length to be shortened for you guy's that want to SBR your AK's.
The front sight is adjustable for windage with a simple screwdriver. For elevation the sight post is left purposely long so that you can zero your rifle and then use the rear sight as normal.
Zeroing Recommendations:

AK47 : Set rear sight to lowest position. Adjust front sight length till point of aim point of impact are equal at 25 yards. Now if you move your rear sight all the way to the rear you will have a battle zero with around a 9.5"" spread from 25-300 yards.

AK74 : Set rear sight to lowest position. Adjust front sight length so that point of impact is 1"" low at 25 yards. Now if you move your rear sight all the way to the rear you will have a battle zero with around a 7.5"" spread from 25-300 yards.



    The id of the sight is .591 and clamps in place in the existing gas block location.
    The sight comes finished in black oxide.
    Gunsmith installation recommended.
    Pinch screw torque 18in lbs. MAX

Description: In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W 500, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

Wylde chamber info:
.223 Wylde is a hybrid .223/5.56 chamber designed by Bill Wylde to yield the accuracy advantages of the match .223 Remington commercial chambering but without pressure or reliability failures when using high velocity 5.56 NATO spec ammunition. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56 but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same."

Gen 3 or 4 preferred. Not interested in full priced new, or used that are priced above $500. Keep in mind, a new Gen 4 runs between $520-580 (depending on the quality and what comes in the package). So anything below $500 is something I'd take a look at. I live in Raleigh but come through Greenville from time to time."

Dual recoil spring assemblies 
Three backstraps included to customize fit 
Glock's Gen4 series of semiautomatic pistols incorporate all the features and benefits Glock is famous for, along with upgrades to enhance performance and shootability. This series still boasts nearly indestructible polymer frames that are stronger than steel. Tenifer-coating on slides and barrels makes them as impervious to the elements as their predecessors. And Safe-Action-Pistol integrated safety features are still standard. Upgrades includes Rough-Textured Frames (RTF) to make them even easier to handle in extreme conditions. RTF improves Glock's all-weather performance when shooting with or without gloves. Each Gen4 includes three differently sized backstraps, so shooters can adjust the grips for a custom fit. Magazine-release buttons are larger and reversible to make them easier to operate for both right- and left-handed shooters. Dual recoil spring assemblies increase durability and reduce recoil and muzzle flip"

A little History on the America's Heroes model Glocks: The America's Heroes Glocks were a new series distributed by Accu-Sport in 2002. They commemorate the fidelity, sacrifice, zeal and honor of the firefighting and law enforcement communities as demonstrated on September 11, 2001 during the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. The series consists of 1000 each G17s, G22s, & G21s. These Glocks are marked on the right side of the slide with a Maltese cross (symbolizing firefighting) and a star (symbolizing law enforcement) with an arched banner between which says ""America's Heroes"". Below the banner is the date: 09-11-01. These Glocks are unique in two ways: This is the first time Glock has produced a large-frame commemorative, with the G-22, and The engraving is unique, compared to all previous commemorative editions, in that the design is not cut into the metal. Rather, it is printed in a bronze-color, which, except for the color itself, appears much like Smith and Wesson's ""Laser Engraving"".

I am also including a commemorative 9/11/01 coin (it is not gold).  I have never fired the pistol, I bought it through GunBroker 10 years ago from a gun store.  The owner told me he put one magazine through it, which I believe because the factory bronze colored lube is still there and there are NO signs of use.  

This is truly a collector item to honor a significant event in America's History.

I am including the original box and the newer style glock gun boxes.  You get 2 - 10RD magazines, 2 - Magazine loaders, 2 - bore brushes and 2 - push rods."

You can still shoot 410's out of it you just don't have the choke tube. Gun is in great shape and comes with a Red-dot scope mounted on the 45/410 barrel. A really fun gun to shoot - great for all ages w/limited recoil. Really prefer cash but will look at interesting trades. Best way to contact me is via text message @ REDACTED

I am the second owner with no rounds down range by myself but previous owner stated he only put a box of CCI (100rds) through it and from the condition I believe him.
