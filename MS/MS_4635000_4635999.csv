Beware though as some of the ""good deals"" are phishing scams. It has happened to me more than a few times. The ""seller"" will be selling their firearm for a good deal, so you make all the arrangements, they get your name and phone number, ask if you ""need anything else"" (which also seems really suspicious) then they tell you they will call you later and you never hear from them again.

Before I get into the details I want to stress to all you fine gents that THE PRICE IS THE PRICE!

What we've got here is a S&W Mp15 magpul FDE rifle w 16in barrel that shoots 1.5moa w cheap 62gr tul and sub Moa w my 55 nosler hand loads. It has a custom 3.6lb single stage trigger that breaks like a Kimber 1911. Has original grip and the k2 pistol grip as shown plus the foregrip.
Then we have the custom build seekins mcsr ultra light upper with a Wilson combat adjustable gas block, WMD nickel boron BCG that is a piece of art and of course the ballistic advantage precision 8.5in 1:7twist 5R rifling barrel legally pinned and welded to the Octane 45 suppressor which brings the legal barrel length to 17inches (which can be removed from sale if you choose and this upper is to only be used for a ""pistol"" lower)

Optics are vortex spare II which is the best, lightest, most crisp 2moa dot with 10 brightness settings. I can shoot it at 400yards, off the magazine at a 12x20 steel plate! Then the bush ell 3-9x40.
Included are everything shown in pics..

The setup takes literally 10seconds to go from shooting 208gr subsonics back to zipping critters at 400+yards w the 16in complete 223/5.56 upper. Just swap mags and uppers!


PRICING: first $2950 I get takes EVERYTHING. You can get it without the suppressor (and other caliber adapters) for $2300. 
THE PRICE IS THE PRICE, that IS my motivated seller price!
Shipping will be exactly my cost

Factory Description:

http://lesbaer.com/Premier5.html

Les Baer's Premier II© has become the industry standard to which all other factory or custom built 1911s are compared. The 5"" long Government Model (pictured above) is the best single stack duty, defense or competition pistol you'll find in America -- the best quality, the best value and the best performance. No wonder so many of them show up at IPSC Limited Class matches. The Premier II© is even guaranteed to shoot 3"" groups at 50 yards! We've sold so many in the USA and abroad, the Premier II© has become the flagship of our line. It performs like a million bucks but it costs a whole lot less. 
Features include:

Baer NM steel frame, NM slide and NM barrel with stainless bushing • Slide fitted to frame • Double serrated slide • Low mount LCB adjustable sight with hidden rear leaf • Baer dovetail front sight • Lowered and flared ejection port • Tuned and polished extractor • Baer extended ejector • Baer checkered slide stop• Baer speed trigger with crisp 4 lb pull • Baer deluxe Commander hammer and sear • Baer beavertail grip safety with pad • Flat serrated mainspring housing • Beveled mag well • Polished feed ramp and throated barrel • Baer extended ambi safety • High checkered front strap @ 30 lpi • Pistol tuned for total reliability • Baer Premium Checkered Cocobola grips • Blued finish • (2) 8-round premium magazines"

The VP9 is in great condition. 

Unlike Glocks and XDs and M&Ps, the HK VP9 striker is cocked to the rear 100%, pressing the trigger simply releases it, resulting in a lighter and crisp feeling trigger break. Those other strikers are only cocked 90% and pulling the trigger pulls back the striker a tad before releasing it resulting in a creeping and mushy break. 
The VP9 is awesome.

____________________________________________________________________
Specs from Bushmaster:

THE BUSHMASTER PREDATOR RIFLE
5.56mm or .223 Rem.
Gas Operated / Semi-Automatic
5 Rounds (accepts all M16 / AR15 type)
38.25” [97.16 cm]
20” [50.8 cm]
1 turn in 8” [20.32 cm]
R.H. Twist / 6 lands & grooves
8.0 lbs. [3.63 kg] without magazine

The Predator - built as a result of numerous requests by the
hunters who wanted a slightly shorter barrel and lighter swing
weight in a carry rifle for predator hunting/calling, this 20” barreled
version of the popular Varminter will deliver all the accuracy you’ve
come to expect from a Bushmaster. The 20"" Barrel is fluted 4150
ChroMoly Vanadium Steel (not chrome lined) with sharp 1 x 8”
twist rifling for the heavier bullets typically used on bigger varmints
and predators.
• Designed around our DCM Competition Barrel, in a 20"" Fluted,
Extra Heavy Profile – machined to SAAMI specification
tolerances of 4150 ChromeMoly Vanadium steel. Full length
fluting reduces weight and increases barrel cooling. Barrel is a
full 1"" diameter under the Forend, and has an 11° Competition
Crowned Muzzle.
• Bushmaster Two Stage Competition Trigger with 3.5 lb. pull 1st
stage and 1 lb. let-off (2nd stage)
• A Vented Aluminum Tubular Forend “free-floats” the Barrel
from the Receiver forward for optimum accuracy – 12 cooling
vents in the Forend increase barrel heat dissipation.
• A Bipod Stud has been installed on the Forend for easy mounting
of most bipods or a sling swivel.
• Ambidextrous, Ergonomically Designed Pistol Grip is included
with a rubberized, non-slip textured surface.
• Mini-risers are mounted on the “Flat-top” Upper Receiver to
raise mounted scopes ½"" for a correct sight picture and
comfortable cheekweld on the stock.
____________________________________________________________________


It will come with a Bushmaster case, the mini-risers, and a 5-round magazine. I can include the Magpul BAD Lever if you'd like it. It will not come with the scope or bipod, unless we come to an agreement. The only issue on this is the hole in the bottom of the stock in front of the sling mount. I did this for a makeshift monopod. It could easily be filled in, or swap the stock for your choosing. 

Starting at $895 OBO. I can travel to meet if you are interested in buying. I would be interested in trades for a Benelli M2, possibly other similar shotguns.

This listing is for 54 Boxes, a total of 270 shotshells; buyers, however, may take any number of full case lots we have on hand at the same per-case price and no extra shipping charges. Do the math. 3 inch .410 shells usually sell for $15.00 for a box of 25. These figure only $8.25 per 25. Here is Golden Bear better grade of .410 shotshell ammunition. Manufacturer is Barnaul Cartridge Plant JSC of Russia. Importer and warrantor is DKG Trading of Evansville, IL. It is absolutely non-corrosive, open brass plated steel case, loaded with 5/8 ounce of #4 lead shot. Muzzle velocity from a 26 inch barrel is 1100 fps vicinity, with around 550 foot pounds of muzzle energy. We have tried this ammunition in Mossberg Pump and H&R Single Shot Shotguns with no hitches at all. Autoloaders seem more iffy with it. When we tried it in a Taurus Judge, it fired with no problems, but it took a rubber mallet on the ejector rod to eject it. Most any 3 inch .410 ammunition is $15 or more for a box of 25, or 60 cents a shell. We’re offering the Golden Bear .410s, however, at less than 33 cents apiece in 270 round, 54 box cases. 25 shell box price equivalent, then, is $8.25. Own a full factory case for only $ 89.00.   SHIPPING:   $15.00 flat fee shipping lower 48 for the whole order. No Returns on Ammunition. Bids and offers to buy must be for the registered user only. Don’t buy for your buddies, that kind of thing smells like a felony level straw purchase attempt for guns or ammunition. Magazines and any small light non-gun items ride free with ammo orders.

The specially designed hollow point will not plug while passing through a variety of barriers and the jacket and core hold together providing nearly 100% weight retention! This ammunition was engineered to meet or exceed  ammunition testing protocols; these protocols put bullets through 10% ordinance gelatin, steel, wallboard, plywood, laminated automobile safety glass and gelatin covered in heavy clothing and measure how well the bullets penetrate, expand and hold together. Extensive testing has shown that the on average the 9mm Luger load will deliver 13.63"" of penetration, 0.63"" of expansion, 90% weight retention through all FBI barriers when shot through a Glock 17 at 10 feet. One of the great things about this ammunition are high quality features that make this ammunition perfect choice for self-defense ammunition. Each round of ammunition is loaded into a Federal Premium nickel plated brass case with waterproofing on the case mouth and primer. Every load has a consistent powder charge and reliable primer for consistent ignition. Every HST bullet features a tapered jacket profile for reliable feeding, a cannelure that locks the copper jacket to the lead core, patented co-aligned internal and external skiving and a deep tapered hollow point that will not clog.

FN49 Rifle is in great condition and fires exceptionally well. Spent some coin on it at the gunsmith to address gas issues and extraction issues from it being left in a safe for many years Rifle is cleaned up and runs very smooth. For the size of caliber it shoots it is impressively very light on recoil, probably due to the weight of the rifle. It is a great shooter and very clean. Looking to sell for cash to help fund the purchase of an older truck for my 17 year old son. I have 1000 rounds of ammo I would consider selling separately for $500 or 50 cents per round. PM me if you are interested. I would consider traveling closer to the buyer depending on terms of sale and distance. MUST GO THROUGH FFL dealer Call or text (9one6) 437  -  87 one 7

On that extra railing I have mounted a brand new Streamlight long rifle kit complete with pressure pad that is mounted securely with Streamlights secure mounting system. No tape or Velcro. I also have installed a Magpul MIAD grip as well as a Tango Down vertical grip with an American Defense quick release. The stock is a B5 Sopmod stock. It also has a Magpul BUIS. The red dot optic is the new Primary Arms model with a 6 year battery life. Just leave it on all the time and forget it. Everything in this rifle is 100% Mil-spec. The BCG is Bravo Company and I built the lower myself using Mil-Spec using Spikes Tactical stuff. A lot of neat stuff on this rifle. I think I can only post 3 pictures on here, but if you would like to see it, please contact me. Thanks."

I'm looking to trade for handguns, mostly S&W revolvers in 357 or larger calibers, but will consider all reasonable handgun offers. Or I will just sell out right. I would like to move the 2 as a pair, but will consider breakin them up on a case by case basis. This is a perfect combo for a husband and wife/boyfriend and girlfriend. All low ball offers will be ignored. I feel $950.00 cash for the 2 or $1100.00 trade value for the 2 1100's is a very fair price and I am pretty firm. I will include 2 soft cases as well.

 "" The lead plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit is Chris Carter, a sheriff's deputy in Scott County Iowa who had a PT140 Millennium PRO pistol, according to a summary of the complaint in Thursday's order. He alleged that on July 29, 2013 while serving on a narcotics detail he pursued a fleeing suspect. As he ran, his pistol fell from his holster, hitting the ground and discharging a bullet that struck a nearby unoccupied vehicle. ""

Seriously not cool.

If you have one of these guns PLEASE-
Call Taurus to make sure the gun your listing here isn't possibly defective and if so, arrange to have your pistol dealt with via the warranty/recall settlement instead of trying to pawn it off on others, ok?

Pump Shotgun$459.99 plus 9.99 shipped to your FFLYou may have thought that there was nothing left to be said about the pump shotgun. That was before Benelli applied Italian engineering and style to this most American of shotgun designs and the innovative Nova Pump took the market by storm. Doubters predicted that American shooters would never accept a gun that replaced the traditional wooden buttstock and separate external receiver with a single unit that encased the steel action directly in lightweight, weather-resistant polymer. They couldn't have been more wrong! American shooters flocked to the stylish, ultramodern 12-gauge and for more than four years the Nova Pump has established an unchallenged reputation of dependability capable of handling everything from dove loads in the autumn haze to thumping waterfowl loads in driving rain. Shoot the Benelli Nova you'll never think about pump shotguns in quite the same way."

On that extra railing I have mounted a brand new Streamlight long rifle kit complete with pressure pad that is mounted securely with Streamlights secure mounting system. No tape or Velcro. I also have installed a Magpul MIAD grip as well as a Tango Down vertical grip with an American Defense quick release. The stock is a B5 Sopmod stock. It also has a Magpul BUIS. The red dot optic is the new Primary Arms model with a 6 year battery life. Just leave it on all the time and forget it. Everything in this rifle is 100% Mil-spec. The BCG is Bravo Company and I built the lower myself using Mil-Spec using Spikes Tactical stuff. A lot of neat stuff on this rifle.

It's never been used as I decided on a square table for the kitchen instead.

984,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4635984,"For Sale:  GEISSELE-13"" SUPER MODULAR RAIL MK2","Linden, Flint, Michigan",$ 225,"Listed On: Monday, February 29, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GEISSELE-13"" SUPER MODULAR RAIL MK2We are a retail stocking dealer. All products are new and in original packaging unless otherwise indicated. We do not accept any trades. All listings are for SALE ONLY. All sales are online only and can not be picked up in person. This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comThe Geissele Super Modular Rail MK2 (SMR) was designed to be a cost effective option to our SMR MK1. Our SMR MK2 is designed to fit the M4 Carbine and all mil-spec AR-15 variants. The SMR MK2 was designed to do a good job in meeting the ten design specifications for a good M4 weapon rail while being a cost effective alternative to the SMR MK1. 1. ERGONOMIC Instead of four sharp and jagged M1913 rails spaced at 90 degree intervals, the SMR MK2 only has a M1913 rail at the 12 o’clock position while at 9, 3 and 6 o’clock is a flat mounting surface for accessory rails. The flat mounting surfaces feel much better in the hand than the sharp edges of a M1913 rail. 2. SET-UP IS MODULAR AND FLEXIBLE Accessory rails in the standard M1913 (Picatinny) configuration are provided with each SMR MK2 so accessories can be mounted where the shooter desires. Two short and one long accessory rail are provided with each SMR kit. There is also a QD mount at the receiver end that accepts an industry standard QD swivel. 3. FREE FLOATING The weapon barrel is completely free floating when an SMR MK2 is mounted. No force is put into the barrel from slings or bipods that could effect point of aim. 4. STRONG The SMR MK2 is machined from a semi-billet extrusion made from aircraft grade aluminum. A semi billet extrusion is designed with extensive machining stock for 3D features that are machined directly into the rail so that the rail is one integral piece. 5. RIGID Current infantry doctrine makes extensive use of accessories that require attachment to a weapon rail. Flashlights, visible and infrared lasers, night vision and thermal sights all require a rigid weapon rail so that zero is not changed when a bipod or sling is used to support the weapon from the rail. The SMR MK2 is a rigid interface for weapon accessories due to its precisely machined proprietary barrel nut and secure rail interface and clamping arrangement. 6. LIGHTWEIGHT Use of aircraft grade aluminum and high strength steels in the SMR MK2 give the entire assembly a good strength and performance to weight ratio. The 13"" MKII Mod 1 rail weighs 16.66 ozs. with the steel barrel nut. 7. ACCESSORY RAILS EASY TO INSTALL Accessory rails are fastened to steel slide nuts instead of imbedded steel inserts like the MK1. The slide nuts are fully captured in channels configured in the rail ID. Slide nuts are much more soldier proof than inserts as a cross threaded screw can easily be repaired with the replacement of a slide nut. It takes literally seconds to install or remove an accessory rail without standing on your head to deal with non-captured plate nuts. 8. ACCESSORY RAILS ARE STRONG The SMR MK2 accessory rails have machined in shear lugs that are a close fit into the cooling slots that are machined into the rail. Any force imparted into the accessory rail is transferred directly into the rail and bypasses the mounting screws. This means that the mounting screws only need to hold the accessory rail on and not resist side loads that can make the screws loosen over time. 9. RAIL ASSEMBLY IS EASY TO INSTALL Each SMR MK2 comes with a precisely machined, 2-1/4” long alloy steel barrel nut (same as the MK1) and a combination wrench that will remove the stock barrel nut and install the Geissele one. The Geissele barrel nut needs no indexing to the gas tube so installation is a snap with just a torque value used for tightening. The rail is then slid onto the barrel nut and the precise barrel nut to rail fit precisely aligns the rail to the barrel. After indexing to the receiver rail two mounting bolts are tightened and the rail is secure. 10. RAIL IS EASY TO REMOVE Just by loosening two screws and one of the indexing screws the Geissele SMR MK2 can be slid off the barrel nut for cleaning or gas system maintenance. Even a different rail with a different accessory configuration can be mounted. As quick as it is removed the SMR MK2 is can be re-installed with the precise barrel nut to rail fit maintaining sight and accessory zero.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GEISSELE-13"" SUPER MODULAR RAIL MK2"

This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comEach year GG&G designs and brings over fifteen innovative tactical accessories to the market place. In addition to the new products, we review our long standing products and upgrade them to meet the current needs and trends of the tactical shooter. In keeping with this philosophy, we have redesigned and improved our A2 Back Up Iron Sight (AR15 BUIS) for 2008. Improvements include a more tactile and ergonomic windage knob, a counter sunk crossbolt, and more streamlined body. All of these enhanced benefits improve the A2 BUIS and are offered without any additional cost. The Improved GG&G A2 AR 15 rear site provides the operator with an easy-to-install and easy-to-operate flip up rear sight, and includes the all important locking detent. The A2 sight is always at the tactical ready once placed in the up position. The sight cannot be folded down without depressing the spring assisted detent release button located on the left side of the sight base. This totally eliminates the possibility of accidentally lowering the sight. The A2 AR-15 rear site can be used as a co-witness iron sight with most red dot sighting systems, as a stand-alone sight or in conjunction with one of our interface rails. Weighing in at just over two ounces, it features the standard military A2-style double peep aperture which allows for end user known point of impact. The sight has full windage adjustment with an improved windage knob. One click of the windage knob provides approximately 0.48 MOA change when mounted on the M16A2E4 rifle and about 0.65 MOA on the M4 carbine. Initial zero is set by adjusting the weapons front sight post. It is low profile so that when in the down position, it will clear most optics. The mount body and sight stem are manufactured from billet 6061 T6 aluminum alloy and Type III hard coat anodized in a non-reflective black mil-spec finish to provide combat durability. All steel components are black manganese phosphated per mil-spec. These are the same back up iron sights used by elite armed forces and law enforcement teams world wide.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: GG&G A2 FLIP-UP REAR BACK UP IRON SIGHT (BUIS) WITH LOCKING DETENT"
