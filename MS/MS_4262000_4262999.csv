If you're not already aware, this is the model with a threaded 20"" barrel, with 1 in 10"" twist.  The rifle is in like new condition, with fewer than 200 rounds fired.  It was carefully and properly broken in, and has only had quality ammunition run through it.  

The trigger is the X-Mark Pro, which was recently replaced by Remington after their recall.  It is adjusted to around 3 pounds, and has a crisp, clean break.  The stocks on this model are known to be less than ideal, but the action has been shimmed, which keeps it free floated even on the bipod.  

The rifle shoots very well with 168 grain Hornady A-Max factory loaded rounds.  I get sub MOA 5 round groups with it, and I'm sure that you could work up a hand load that would get it under 1/2 MOA.  The target shown is 5 rounds, shot at 100 yards, and is average for this rifle with factory A-max.  

Included with the rifle, are a Millett 6-25x56 LRS-1 scope (illuminated reticle), Millett high scope rings, Weaver Picatinny base, adjustable cheek rest, and a bipod.  This is truly a ready to fire long range precision rifle.  I am only selling because I recently fired a friend's AR-10, and now I'm trying to fund the purchase of one for myself."

This handsome rimfire rifle sports an AR-style look and is modeled after the legendary original Colt M4. A ""Tactical Rimfire"" rifle, the M4 Ops is an upgraded version of the .22 M4 Carbine. Instead of the standard forearm of the carbine, the Ops has a Rail Interface System that provides tactical railing on four sides, which allows you to mount a variety of available accessories. Additionally, the carry handle of the carbine has been replaced by a detachable rear sight to make the M4 Ops an ideal, optic-ready rimfire rifle.

In case you haven't heard or read, production of the VZ58 / VZ2008 has stopped and they aren't importing any more of these into America. They are selling for $800 to $1000 in Canada, and in a couple years or less will fetch those prices here. 
Read reviews on why the VZ2008 beats the AK if you're not sure why. Outstanding rifle!

ASK FOR MORE PICS!

I have a VZ2008 with 4 magazines, each loaded with 30 rounds (120 rounds total) and comes with a great condition ammo pouch (with belt loops and shoulder strap). 

-I removed the slant break (which should never be on a semi-auto) and put a plain thread protector on which reduced felt recoil.

-I have had the bolt-carrier tabbed, which means the shooter will never have to worry about any trigger ""gremlin"" problem popping up (although I never experienced this even before it was added). 

Want to trade for an FAL or L1A1 and can add cash.

P.S. Leather was added by me to foreguard just to look cool (give it a kind of rebel look). Can be unwrapped, I used no glue or anything like that."

I found my trade but this rifle stayed with me so I figured I'd post it once more and see if I get any offers that catch my eye. It is all original numbers matching gun that has a low round count. Looks just as good as the day I cleaned the cosmoline off her. The yugo has a couple nice features you won't find on other SKS rifles. The first is the gas block can be turned off for use with the grenade launcher or live ammo achieving higher velocities and longer range. It also has flip up three dot sites or they can be folded down for a finer site picture. The yugo also sports a blade style bayonet as opposed to the spike style found on most other makes. This rifle has never given me any problems and is more accurate than I am. I have a detachable tapco 30 round magazine that will go with it but is not currently installed. I am not desperate to make a deal so the usual low balling will simply be ignored and just because an offer is fair doesn't necessarily mean I'll be interested, so please don't curse me if I choose to pass on your offer. Amature appraisals are also unwelcome. Act like a well mannered adult and we'll get along just fine."

Its a Gen 3 model. About 300 rounds shot through it. I have a few .45s and don't really shoot this one, so i figured id try to trade or sell it to fund another project. Open to trades, guns or Harley stuff. I can add cash to the trade if your item is worth more, just let me know what you got. I like trading. 
 Pic i attached is the actual gun, it shows oil coating on it, simply i took the pic before i wiped it down. The gun has no defects or scratches, all stock. 
 Text is the best way to reach me.

Mainly looking for lighter weight AR with fixed FSB and magpul polymer handguard.

For sale is an AR-15 made up of a YHM upper, handguard, and barrel, on an Anderson lower.  It has a 16 inch barrel with a 1:8 twist, to handle a wider range of ammo.  Has a YHM bcg, properly staked and in great shape.  Shoots great, does not malfunction, and has been kept well cleaned and lubed.  The YHM quad rail is about 12 inches long, and is free floated.  The rifle weighs about 8.5 lbs unloaded.  The buffer tube and both stocks are commercial-spec.  I have fired about 400 rounds through it since I purchased it, and it works great, even eats up steel cased ammo like it's candy and asks for more.  I am not willing to split up the parts.  There is a good amount of money in parts and the lot will all be sold together.  The list of all the parts included are as follows:

Magpul XTM handstop kit (pictured)
Magpul XTM enhanced rail covers x4 (pictured)
Magpul MBUS Pro steel flip up sights (pictured)
Magpul ACS carbine stock (pictured)
Magpul 30 round Pmag (pictured)
Magpul MOE+ grip (pictured)
Allen tactical one point sling (pictured)
Ambidextrous sling attachment receiver end plate (pictured)

FDE off-brand angled foregrip (not pictured)
FDE standard AR collapsible stock (not pictured)
Brown NCSTAR red dot sight with cantilever mount (not pictured)

The off-brand angled foregrip and red dot came with the rifle when I bought it.  The previous owner had painted them brown.  On the Angled Foregrip and stock, I took paint thinner and wire brush and scrubbed 80% of the paint off leaving it about 80% FDE with about 20% brown paint I couldn't / didn't care to remove.  The red dot seems to function fine, but personally I just don't know how sturdy it is so I opted not to run it on my rifle.  The Angled Foregrip and red dot are the only two cheap pieces that comes with this rifle.  Everything else is in great shape and the iron sights are awesome!  

Text me with any offers, I am not looking to trade for other rifles / handguns / bows / fishing boats / 4 wheelers / dirtbikes / 1980 Honda Civics... Please don't waste my time, money talks.  Must be a carry permit holder willing to sign a bill of sale.  If you want more pictures I will be happy to send them.  If you're sketchy or offering me a low ball price, do not expect a text back.
