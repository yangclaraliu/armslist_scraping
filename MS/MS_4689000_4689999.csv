Here is a breakdown of what is included.

Sig Sauer 1911 C3. Originally a Crimson Trace model. I have since sold the grips and have a set of VZ grips installed. There have been roughly 300 rounds fired through the gun and they have been flawless. It has always been properly lubed and stored clean. There is a light crescent shape mark on the slide. I'm not sure how the heck that happened as I've always been careful during cleaning. Overall it's very clean however it's been fired and lightly carried. Do not expect showroom quality but it's great shape besides the idiot mark. It does have the factory Sig night sights. The gun is dated Jul 2012. Internal parts have not been modified.

8 Magazines total. 3x 7 round Sig Sauer mags (2 with rubber base plate, 1 w/o on the left), 3x 8 round Shooting Star (right 3), and 2x 8 round Wilson Combat (two in the middle).

Williams Gun leather IWB holster (lightly used) and 2 mag OWB holster (never used). This is a very comfortable set-up.

Sig retention OWB holster.

Ammo: All boxes are full
7x Remington UMC 230 grain. 350 rounds
6x Geco 230 grain. 300 rounds
2x PMC 230 grain. 100 rounds
1x Gold Dot in the box 230 grain. 50 rounds
No box on the right is; 14 rounds of Winchester JHP, 1 oddball with an ""*I*"" on it, and 35 rounds of Speer JHP. All 230 grain.
No box on the left is 20 rounds of Speer FMJ and 30 rounds of FMJ PMC. All 230 grain.

The bag on the left is someone's reloads of 45. This gun has NEVER seen a reloaded bullet. These are being thrown into the purchase as I do not wish to have them anymore. I have no idea who did them as they were part of a trade. Shooter beware. If you don't want them, let me know.

Looking to sell as a complete package for $1,300 firm. I am in no rush to sell it. Looking for a FTF in west Wichita or downtown. No shipping please. Thank you!

The pistol features the LEM V2 style trigger (easily customized with factory springs), paddle mag release, ambidextrous slide stop, 4 back strap options, 2 mags, and the original case. I adore this pistol, but someone close to me has bought a Glock, and I now simply want one as my do-it-all pistol. The finish lacks the black coating seen on most HK's, and is more of a stainless look, with the HE treatment giving the whole package a unique appearance. I love the look, myself, knowing the HE finish is completely intact, protecting from any corosion from the elements (the metal itself is treated). NOTE-  there are NO scratches or dings in the metal of the slide ay all
 This is in no way a damaged pistol. Given the finsh, I am lowering the price to account for the possibility that one may want to cerakote/duracoat the slide. The pistol round count is relatively low, bore is like new, and I've personally put about 250 rounds down the pipe without a single hangup. Will send more pictures if one is interested. Will trade for a Gen 3 or 4 Glock 19, or will accept $500 so I can go off and buy one myself. Please do not attempt to give lowball offers- this is every bit a top of the line pistol. Please text  inquiries to 513 227 eight four zero five (I'm horrible about checking emails). Thanks!"

Electric Airsoft Rifles use batteries as their power source and they shoot very fast. Some Electric Airsoft Rifles come with semi-automatic fire. That means that when you pull the trigger only 1 BB will come out at a time. Other Electric Airsoft Rifles come with full-automatic fire. This means that when you pull the trigger multiple BBs will come out at a time. The longer you hold the trigger down the more BBs come out. Check the description above to see which kind of gun this is and if it is right for you. Electric Airsoft Rifles don't require any pumping or cocking, just simply point and shoot. This is a High End Electric Airsoft Gun. Please only use .20 gram high quality BBs with this item in order to keep it in proper working order. Using anything else as ammunition for this gun will void the warranty and may cause it to jam. Also, to keep your Electric Airsoft Gun working properly, do not fire the gun when there are no BBs in it as it may cause damage to your gun"

The LazerLyte target allows you to practice your aim from any distance you can handle - simply insert the LT Pro into your firearm, and fire at the target. After you've shot ten or so times, shoot 'display' to see your hits, then hit 'reset' to reset the target. Function is clearly very simple, operates as far as you can shot. This target will save you a ton of ammo, and is a good tool for friend to practice with before their first range trip. More info and specs below. Keep in mind that there are many types of lazers available for rifles and handguns not listed below. I went with the laser that had the best fitment on handguns. 

LAZERLYTE Training Target
- Laser pistol training target that reduces need for training ammo
- Records precisely where a laser hits; ideal for professionals or instructors
- Teaches such shooting skills as unsighted fire, accuracy, grouping, and trigger control
- Provides delayed feedback, so you can focus on next shot
- Range of up to 50 yards; runs on 3 AA batteries

LT PRO Laser Pistol Trainer
- Laser pistol training aid that reduces need for training ammo
- Sound-activated switch flashes a laser dot for 100 milliseconds to simulate bullet impact

The receiver is in great shape on this rifle, it hasn't been beaten in the rear of the receiver by the bolt from being over gassed, like many of these were.

Should have a modern shooter kit installed before shooting since the original gas system was manufactured near the end of the war and quality was not the greatest.

Only 125 are being made EVER, so this is your chance to own one!  I bought it thinking I would use it but it honestly needs a better home than mine!  I can provide proof of order and I will ship it NEW IN BOX exactly as I receive it from LaRue!  Description below as per their website:

Each UDE Edition 5.56 PredatOBR rifle has UDE expertly applied to the exterior surfaces on the Upper Receiver, Lower Receiver, Handguard and both sides of the Dust Cover. A UDE LaRue A-PEG Pistol Grip and RAT Stock is factory installed. Along the handgaurd, Black LaRue GAP covers are installed, but the rifle also comes with additional UDE GAP covers and UDE IndexClips. A special-edition “UDE Owners Edition” Hat, 1 special-edition UDE 30-Rnd Lancer magazine and 1 “Smoke” 30-Rnd Lancer magazine will also be included. 

The PredatOBR 5.56 was designed for those who are searching for a hybrid cross between the standard OBR and PredatAR 5.56x45 Rifles. The most remarkable feature of the PredatOBR is its ability to be completely “broken down” and stored into the optional Rollup Bag and Toolbox. The PredatOBR handguard has a locking stainless steel QD Lever system on each side. Once the levers are released, the handguard slides off of the upper assembly in seconds. The PredatOBR's barrel can easily be removed with the supplied PredatOBR Barrel Wrench, unscrew the Barrel Nut from Receiver and pull the Barrel Assembly free from Receiver. No need to remove the gas tube, gas block or muzzle device. Reverse the process to reinstall. Hand-tighten Barrel Nut and torque approximately 1/8-turn past hand-tight (Approximately 40-50 foot pounds). Once reassembled correctly, the point of impact (POI) shift will be 0.0 to 0.5 MOA of the original.

PredatOBR barrels are chambered in 5.56x45mm, and feature rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All muzzles are threaded in 1/2 x 28. Like the OBR and PredatAR riles, LaRue has eliminated the conventional AR barrel nut and bolt the handguard directly to the proprietary upper receiver, creating a true “free-float” barrel. The handguard does not touch the barrel or barrel nut at any place. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though it has been lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. 

The PredatOBR has threaded stainless-steel hard-points over the entire length of the handguard at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. These hard-points have an integral spine built-in for structural support. Provided with the system are three 3-inch MIL-STD-1913 rail sections that can be positioned anywhere along the handguard, per operator preference. These rail sections are attachable/detachable using a supplied tool (Torx® T-15 wrench). The rail sections are CNC-machined from billet aluminum. This robust solution provides a perfect precision mounting space for aiming lasers, illumination and bipods.

The PredatOBR's Port Selector Technology™ (PST) gas block is adjustable, to aid in the optimum function when using a sound suppressor. This special gas block contains a dual port mechanism that is operated by rotating a lever from one side to another. When the lever is rotated to the right-side of the rifle, the gasses are reduced, to compensate for the extra blowback created by the suppressor. When rotated to the left side, the gasses are increased for use without a suppressor.

The LaRue Tactical 6-position Retract Action Trigger (R.A.T.) Stock comes standard with every PredatOBR. It is ergonomic, has protected control surfaces and contains a set of cleaning rods in an internal compartment. Since the height of the 12 o’clock rail is at the optimum position, there is no need for a cheek riser as part of this system. The New A-PEG grip also comes standard. This grip was designed to be ambidextrous and places the hand in the corrected position for precision shooting.

The LaRue Muzzle-Brake Adapter was designed for the new LaRue TranQuiloTM line of silencers. It is precision-machined from 17-4 PH Stainless Steel. The Adapter’s patented dual-shouldered design seats the TranQuiloTM suppressor in perfect alignment to the bore, eliminating gas from escaping to the rear of the suppressor…keeping attachment threads clean and free of carbon.

About LaRue Firearm Accuracy:
LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results."

--------------------

Back story from the previous owner:

Started life as a factory assembled PSA / FN 18"" 223 wylde upper with a 15"" Midwest Industries SS15G2 free-float rail - Magpul moe fixed riffle stock / PSA lower. A trip to Curts is where the biggest change occurred. They had a Noveske 18"" ss barrel (made when John was still with us)

As new AR-15 (round count is exactly 50 on the barrel ) total round count is under 150. PSA factory upper / lower with proper upgrades (original barrel has been sold)

Noveske 18"" Stainless Steel lightweight contour 5.56mm barrel (installed at Curts)
1 in 7"" twist, improved polygonal rifling, extended feed ramps, bead blasted finish and has the intermediate gas system. (You can shoot 223 or 5.56 ammunition).

PSA F/A bcg with BCM bolt (new bolt installed when new barrel was put on). Probably not necessary as round count was under 100 but I felt better lean on the side of caution.

Noveske (not marked) mil-spec charge handle

Troy 5.56 Medieval flash suppressor

Midwest Industries SS15G2 15"" free-float key mod rail with 4 qd sling socket mounting points (factory)

Magpul moe riffle buttstock (with Magpul qd sling socket installed)

Leupold VARI-X III 3.5x10-40 1"" scope with target turrets

Scopecoat scope cover

American Defense AD-Recon SL 20 moa qd mount

Ice Arms Nickel Boron EXO hammer (makes trigger perfect) /
original hammer included

Ics Arms Enhanced Hexagonal
trigger guard / original trigger guard included

Odin Works XMR extended magazine release

Hogue ""monogrip"" pistol grip

4 magazines (total) included -
one D&H 5 round, one D&H 10 round, one new in package Magpul 30 round pmag and one new in package Magpul 40 round capacity pmag.

One key mod rail section and no name bi-pod is included

The factory assembled PSA upper / lower are both forged per mil-spec 7075-T6 material, T marks (upper), and black hard coat anodized per mil- 8625. The upper also has M4 feed ramp cuts.
Because I started with factory assembled parts this build cost me about $2,200 dollars. One would save a couple hundred if not done this way but still would set you back much more than I'm asking for this one.

Russian ""Letter Series"" SKS. Manufactured by Tula. This is the И series which indicates 1957 Manufacture (they stopped dating the dust covers in 1956). This was the next to last year of production by the Russians of the SKS. Pretty scarce variant. Rifle is all matching, however the magazine has been lined out and lightly electropenciled to match, and the arctic birch stock is from an earlier Tula SKS but stamped to match.

I'd like to get $430 out of it but I'm open to offers/trades as long as there is at least $100 in the trade.  Thanks lowballers but I'm not desperate.  As far as I know Interarms went out of biz and rossi picked them up?  Not sure of that but it's all I could find on the net about the manufacture

The car was a project I got in a trade for a street bike an it had the internals already in. Just running stock bolt ons( stock intake, turbo, injector and ecu) then I got it drove it for a bit and started doing the bolt ons.( new intake, turbo set up, ecu, fuel support.) after getting all that on I had it on the dyno. It made 330rwhp on 18lbs of boost but I had a bad ground on my fuel pump assembly so it was hitting fuel cut and the tuner said fix it an come back, and it should be making close to 450whp. The car is 99% done. Just needs a dyno tune.  It runs and drives as is. But kinda Spudders Bc it remembers the old tune with the bad ground.

So my money loss can now become your gain!  All of my costs plus taxes were $378 total.

MSRP on these beauties are $340 and though there are the non manual safety lever models (the CPX-2) which  go for less new  than the $340 MSRP of the CPX-1, however you can enjoy the bonuses and upgrade that the others being sold here (as the CPX-2 model) don't give you nearly as much value for your hard earned dough as I do here!

Note; beware of sellers who list as a private sale but in fact are ffl dealers who must run a background check on you by law, if that matters to you.

This is a truly private sale and the only requirements are:
(1) You must be 21 or older
(2) Must be a resident of SC and
(3) Have nothing in your legal history that would otherwise 
prevent you from legally owning this firearm

Priced quite fairly for a quick sale at $300 cash and its all yours.
No trades please, thank you. 
Meet you soon!"

At the heart of the Super Vinci is the In-Line Inertia Driven® system, designed to reliably chamber light 2 3/4-inch loads up through the most powerful 3 1/2-inch Magnums.

The Super Vinci features Practical Speed Performance™ (PSP)—a matter of how fast you can shoulder the gun... acquire the target... shoot... and recover from recoil to prepare for the next shot.

Precise instruments developed by Benelli measures and creates graphs that illustrate the total recoil of the Super Vinci against its competitors. Other guns have a peak recoil that’s as much as 15 percent greater than the Super Vinci’s. But more significantly, the total felt-recoil of the competitors’ guns is as much as 22 percent more. Combine the In-Line Inertia Driven® action with superior balance, light weight, reduced recoil and minimal muzzle climb and the shooter experiences the real timeline of performance speed where the Super Vinci has no equal.

I've only had 50 rounds go through this firearm, it is in absolute mint condition.


You are getting:


Glock 23 with box and inserts, no backstraps are included.

6 standard OEM GLOCK 13 round magazines
1 OEM GLOCK 22 round extended magazine
1 Korean Military 31 round magazine (have used it with other Glocks and never had a feeding issue, an excellent magazine).

That's over $250 in magazines alone.

Also, this specific Gen4 Glock has the old style Gen 3 Tenifer finish that is vastly superior to the finish used on all new Gen4 Glocks.  I am very disappointed that Glock went away with this finish.  This is the Glock to have, do not pass this one up.  I am only selling because I am sticking to one caliber.


NOTE:  I have had several problems with interested 'buyers' who will text and e-mail me with intentions to buy not showing up, right up to where they are supposedly right on their way to the meet up spot.  Do not waste my time if you are not going to follow through.

I will ONLY meet at the Gander Mountain parking lot at West Pointe Plaza during the day, I can meet around noon M-F or daytime on weekends.  You must have an Ohio ID.  I need some kind of promise that you do intend to buy.

You can buy a Gen4 G23 brand new at most gun shops for $600-560, you are getting it for like new one with 8 magazines for less, this is a firm price.

NO TRADES, I DO NOT NEED MORE GUNS.  I WILL NOT BOTHER WITH EMAILS REGARDING TRADES. CASH ONLY."
