DSA RPD semi auto Carbine Model. 17.5"" Fluted barrel, 7.62x39mm Cal. Includes: Alloy quad rail

Item Number: RPD175CARBINE-A

Weight: 30.00

Price: $2,850.00 

The R.P.D. was the first machine gun designed to fire the 7.62x39mm cartridge.

The R.P.D. platform has been issued by many countries including the Soviet Union, China, Egypt and former Eastern Bloc countries.

The R.P.D. was also used by the U.S. SOF in Vietnam.

DSA has modernized this battlefield benchmark with features such as a newly designed 7075T6 alloy lower and proprietary rail handguard.

With these new features you can outfit your R.P.D. system with any M16 style adjustable stock, giving the end user greater versatility.

The rail handguard allows the mounting of a variety of accessories, including optics, lasers, flashlights and foregrips.

Compared to the old wooden handguards, a foregrip added to the new DSA rail handguard is extremely helpful in heat dispersion and improving overall effective operation.

In addition, the DSA barrel is fluted and shortened.

This reduces weight and helps keep the barrel cool.

A very effective, proven design flashhider has also been added.

These features have reduced the R.P.D. weight by almost 2 pounds."

This gun was manufactured in 1999 in Germany, and I bought it in 2002.  I only shot this once or twice.

After the terrorist attack at the Munich Olympics in 1972, the West German police decided to standardize on the 9mm cartridge for their service pistols.  This was an era when .32 ACP and .380 ACP handguns were commonly issued in Europe.  The SIG-Sauer P225 was adopted by the West German police as the P6.  The other two pistols adopted were the Walther P5 and the Heckler & Koch P7.  When the German police adopted the P8 (a variant of the H&K USP) in the late 1990s, along with the Walther P99, surplus P5, P6, and P7 pistols became available on the American market around 2004 - 2005.    This is not one of those surplus German police guns, and there are some minor differences between the two. Other sellers often conflate the commercial P225 and surplus P6 pistols; either knowingly or honestly out of ignorance.

The wood is almost perfect too, except for what looks like a bit of scope rash on one cheek, and a light dent on the other.  There is also an insignificant mark on the forearm, but other than that, it's pretty good.  Note how the wood grain flows through the wrist of the stock for strength; very desirable in a heavy-hitting field rifle!  The wood has some nice grain to it also.  A pad has been added to the butt to help tame the recoil a bit.  $825

Glock 27 Gen4 | G27 Gen4Glock 27 Gen4 | G27 Gen4
The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

I have up for sale a K-Var SGL-08 Saiga 12g shotgun. Less than 25rds down the tube. Stock has been upgraded with a mil-spec buffer tube, magpul STR stock, dph adj gas knob, utg side mount scope rail, 12rd stick mag, 20rd pro-mag drum, and factory stock. These are factory converted by K-var and imported by F.I.M.E. out of Las Vegas. These have been essentially banned by Obama. My asking price does not reflect ""gouging"" due to the ban. Retail on these with the lowest model is $1200+ before the importation ban. These are not your run of the mill home conversions and are considered top quality.

The upper is a PSA 16"" premium mid-length with an A2 profile (FN barrel).  BCG is a PSA premium HPT/MPI full auto with a PSA charging handle.  It has a Magpul MOE stock, Magpul BUIS and Magpul ASAP sling attachment point.  The actual attachment point as been rubber coated to keep it more silent.

Also included is a brand new, never mounted, Meprolight Tru-Dot RDS.  It has QD mounts.  Cover, box and all that came with it will go to you.

Additionally the following ammo and mags with come with it:

120 Federal XM855 62gr
120 TulAmmo 55 gr (steel case)
100 Fiocchi 55gr
40 American Eagle 50gr (varmint tip)

3 PMAG GEN M2 (dust covers included)
2 PMAG GEN M3
2 Aluminum mag
1 Tapco Intrafuse
1 Lancer 20rd

Not pictured but included will be a Midway tactical case (OD) and a Tapco Intrafuse AR tool. *UPDATE* Seems I could only post a single photo.  Please let me know if you want photos of anything.

I am willing to sell the Meprolight RDS seperately.  However, I am very firm on $300 for it.  I will also not consider any trades for the RDS by itself.

For everything above I am asking $800.  I am very motivated to get this sold.  Feel free to make a reasonable offer.  I am selling this all to help fund a trip.  An opportunity came up I did not expect, this is all just sitting around and should have a good home.

NV residents only, and we will do a bill of sale.

I may consider a partial trade for the entire package only.  Something in 9mm, 45, 357 or 38 may interest me.  There will need to be cash on your side though.  So do not be offended if I am picky about any sort of trade.  Cash is king right now, but feel free to ask."

This is as close as you will come. As promised here is another once in a lifetime opportunity to own something that is so rare! A brand new, in the box, PPK (not PPK/S), Manufactured in Germany and Proofed in Germany, No IMPORT MARKS, with all original paperwork, extra magazine, matching target, cleaning tool, rare matching black box in .380 auto/9 mm Kurz. I have a limited number of these beautiful, highly polished, brand new, PPK with NO IMPORT MARKS and some with consecutive serial numbers (please contact me). These PPK's have been stored in a warehouse by the importer for years, heavily oiled (as noted in the picture). All “German” PPK guns after WWII and until 1986 have been manufactured in France, not Germany, and proofed in Germany so they were allowed to say “Made in Germany” by European regulations. These are manufactured in ULM, Germany and Proofed in ULM, Germany. This PPK is absolutely beautiful, museum quality, with no imperfections and an amazing high polish deep bluing that only the Germans are capable of. In fact, I was hesitant to take it out of the wrapping and take the pictures. This is it Collectors. Last chance… These are the only Brand New German made PPK's in the USA that I know of that are made in Germany after the war and offered to the public."

This holster is of unbelievable quality and durability, and there is such a demand on them that the waiting time was over two months when I ordered! In-between the time I ordered it, and the time it arrived, I realized that I wasn't comfortable with the P938 Manual of Arms, and sold my new P938 because carrying ""cocked-and-locked"" just wasn't for me! That's why this holster is absolutely new, and your weapon will be the first to be holstered outside the craftsman who made and tested it for perfect fitment.


My loss is your gain, as this ambidextrous pocket holster is one of the best ever made! It is designed and hand-stitched by a retired LEO who could never find a suitable holster for his back-up weapon, so he made his own! When all of his friends and colleagues started wanting one for themselves, his business was born! This was in the '80s, and he's since made thousands and thousands of holsters completely by hand and a heavy-duty sewing machine! 

The webbing material around the holster is tacky, and keeps the holster securely inside your pocket while on the draw. The holster covers the P938's barrel, trigger guard, and both ambi-safeties, leaving easy access to the grip on the weapon. You won't find a better pocket holster at ANY price!

The price on this P938 Custom Holster is $35 CASH. I'm willing to travel a little bit around the Tampa area, but will ship it Priority Mail for $4 more. Post Office Money Order is the method of payment if shipping.

Thanks for looking, and please leave me a message.  If you send me an email address, I can send several more high resolution pics. My email address is REDACTED

PLEASE NOTE: That shiny thing in the pics is a quarter for size comparison. Also, once the weapon is inserted, the leather will make the profile much thinner than it appears in these pics...it's not even broken-in yet."

THESE DONT COME UP FOR SALE OR TRADE VERY OFTEN SO THEY ARE WHAT I SOULD SAY IS RARE.
It is used and dates to late 1978 according to S&W serial #. 
It has a rich royal blue finish with polished sides and matte finish on the top.
As you can see in the pictures it does have a few issues to the finish.
First is the left side of slide and barrel have some scratches in it.
Second would be the front of slide and barrel have surface rust on it.
Third would be the bottom left side of grip has a nicks in it where the wood chipped off. THIS IS MORE OF A SHOOTER THAN A COLLECTABLE BUT COULD BE BOTH IF TAKEN TO A GUNSMITH.

With that being said these go for $1200-1300 NEW and $900-1200 used from what I could find on line. 

The grips can be had on S&W sight for $67. Easy fix. 
As far as the slight surface rust you could use some oil and 0000 steel wool and GENTLY brush forward to get the rust off. There are U-tube videos of it.
The scratches can be sanded out by a gunsmith and re-blued. 
I would do this but I just don't have the time to deal with it. 

 I just put 50 rounds through it at Shooters World last night and it ran flawlessly.

Now for the price: I'm asking $700 OBO or EQUAL value trade for other firearms. NO SHOTGUNS OR RIFLES please. 

Shoot me your offers. The worst I can say is NO THANKS.
If you have a trade please let me know: make, model, finish and what goes with it and what your asking. 
I can do a partial trade also.


You can contact me through the ad or through TEXT any time and I will get back with you a.s.a.p.

 Thanks

*We are the only ones who offer to sell to the public. Anyone else who proclaims to sell them are not being honest with you and or are ignorant in what they are selling. Our Armor is certified, tested by the Military. Tested by us and are legitimate. We take pride in the quality of the craftsmanship of our products* The armor fit majority of plate carriers. Upon Request I will coat the plates if you want.

*Note: If you should decide to contact me please be a serious buyer and someone who is interested. You are only cheating yourself if you are someone just wasting my time. Anti-Fragmentation coating will be applied to Armor Upon Request. Not only does this help to protect against fragmentation it also reduces the impact. I have taken it out and tested it has proven to be very effective. Shot at it 20 yards with 9mm and .45 and at 50 yards with a 223/5.56 rounds it had stopped the fragmentation.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc"

It also comes with 3 sizes of palm swell (small, medium, large) for those of all hand sizes. The M&P 45 also comes with 3­dot fixed sights and a reversible magazine release button, plus 3 High Capacity Mags… The M&P 45 is an excellent choice as a combat pistol for many reasons. The M&P 45 is a double stack 45, meaning that its magazine holds 10 rounds. That’s two more than the modern 1911. Like the Glock and XD, the M&P mag well is plenty wide for quick and positive magazine changes. The M&P 45 sports forward and rear cocking serrations that aid in press checking the gun to see if it’s loaded and getting it back into battery after a slide lock reload. The M&P also comes with a factory ambidextrous slide release to help the 10 per-centers out there."

Centennial Model 1870-1970, chambered in 22 short, long and long rifle. A sheer joy to hold, shoot and own. It was special when made (one year only) and it is even more special today 45 years later. Quality made, it features a 20 inch octagon barrel, select fancy American walnut straight stock, brass forearm cap and crescent shape buttplate, take down knob with golden (24K plated, so I’ve been told but I don’t know?) engraved commemorative disc inlaid to receiver. This rifle is serial number 5410 manufactured in 1970. The bore with microgroove rifling is excellent. Really fine original condition, very lightly used, one owner rifle. This charming little carbine functions smoothly and shoots very accurately. It has very minor signs of use but all in all it is in collectable condition. It is one of the last great Marlin rifles made by the original Marlin Company, sadly gone forever. This is a true piece of Americana, one that you can pass down from generation to generation. $650 plus shipping. ($35) FFL required. There will be an extra $50 charge on top of everything if your FFL dealer insists on having my 01 FFL dealer send it to him - rather than receiving it from me directly.

When you field strip it you don't find the typical signs of cheap manufacturing like you usually do on lower cost guns: tooling marks, etching and pitting, it is as smooth as it is on the outside. The feed ramp is like glass, highly polished. It is not snappy at all, the recoil pad which I thought might be gimmicky really works. I spoke to SCCY about the warranty and they said it is a no excuse warranty, they will fix the gun no matter what including ""squib loads"" or if you drop it, etc. They are really serious about standing by their product."

No Trades. Price is Firm

I purchased this brand new and fired 40 to 50 rounds with this trigger. It's practically new and comes with the original bag, installation pin, instructions, and lube. 

Built on the chassis of the Geissele SSA, the Super Semi-Automatic Enhanced (SSA-E) provides enhanced trigger control and weapon accuracy while maintaining the robustness and reliability of our combat-proven two-stage trigger. The SSA-E’s reduced first and second stage pull weights result in a trigger with a smooth, light first stage take-up and a crisp, candy cane-like second stage break. The SSA-E is ideal for use in precision Squad Designated Marksman type rifles where weapon accuracy and reliability are critical and a non-adjustable drop in trigger is desired."

The 5.56 Carbine Tactical Evo 11.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The piston system will give you the benefits of less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 7"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own."

As far as I can tell all the numbers match from the numbers I see. I know the bayonet wasn't on the rifle when I got but I got one for it. I don't know much about it since I got it in a trade. I have only put 5 rounds through it when I traded to make sure it worked. It doesn't have a sling but does have a cleaning kit in the stock. I have 3 30 round metal magazines that go with it. I bought the magazines but have never used them because I didn't feel like taking the rifle apart since I didn't shoot it. I would say the rifle is in good condition. There some nicks in the stock and some surface rust on the factory magazine but no rust anywhere else. I don't have any pictures that I can post right now but will try to get some posted soon. I would like to get $450.00 or best offer for the rifle and magazines. Also I might throw in some wolf 7.62x39 ammo if I get the asking price or really close to it. Email me if your interested. LOCAL CASH ONLY LEGAL TRANSACTION. I DO NOT SHIP. Thanks for looking.
