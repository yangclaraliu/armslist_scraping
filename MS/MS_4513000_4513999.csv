This is a very rare & hard to acquire firearm. You will notice places like buds rarley have it, & when they do it sells out in minutes. It is the only 357 8 round mag revolver that takes moon clips and also has a full top & bottom rail that can be removed. This thing is incredibly balanced, is very light, and like any custom shop revolver is dead on accurate.Will shoot 357 magnum or .38 Special. The only reason I'm letting this go, is I would like to have another semi auto for tactical training/ speed loading & shooting on the move, and I'm not the best at that with wheel guns. I WOULD PREFER TRADES!"

It was re-barreled/re-chambered to .30-06 after the war. It’s likely a US capture since the mum was not ground off – though it was partially obscured when the receiver was later tapped for a scope. Barrel is marked “.30-06” and is in overall good condition and has a front sight different than a stock Type 99. The receiver has a Williams Peep Sight installed. The bolt is jeweled and looks really nice, cycles and locks well. The stock was cut down at some point, so I would consider this to be a ‘youth’ sized gun. Could be great for a trainer, hunting for younger/smaller folks or for a project gun to fix up or trick out. Short and lightweight, this would also make a great truck or packing/hiking gun.

Markings show it was produced in the Toyo Kogyo arsenal.

AL only allows 3 photos, so if you need to see another angle of the receiver or bolt markings, etc., I can email them to you.

***TRADE PENDING*** $120 Cash preferred, but may consider certain firearm related trades similar in value such as other inexpensive firearms or reloading equipment and components.

This listing will be shut down on August 1st if it hasn't sold/traded by then, the gun goes back in the safe.

Meeting will be FTF in the Portland Metro area around my work schedule. Current Oregon DL is required, CHL is preferred.

Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 Navy is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet's special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs."

It is full length and has not been altered from its original flintlock configuration.
The metal is smooth with a bit of very fine peppering around the breech. The N. Haven banner on the lock is a little faint, but still easily legible. The metal may have been cleaned ages ago, but it does not detract from the look of the gun, and it is developing a nice pewter patina. 
The wood is in very good condition with minor handling marks. The lock flat retains crisp edges, no cartouches are present (this variant never had any). The only detractor is a sliver of wood missing from the rear of the lock mortise. 
The gun is complete with a full length ramrod. The sling swivels are missing as is so often the case.

The other one available has a swimg out stock and 1x30 simmons red dot sight and camo-painted barrel. 

Either one comes with a soft case, 2 25-round magazines and I'll even throw in a couple hundred rounds.  Looking for $300 for either one or $550 for the pair. Willing to negotiate

The MAC-10 (Military Armament Corporation Model 10, officially the M-10) is a compact blowback operated machine pistol developed by Gordon Ingram in 1964.   It is chambered in either 45 ACP or 9mm.   A two-stage suppressor by Sonic’s was designed for the MAC-10, which not only abated the noise created, but made it easier to control on full automatic.
Military Armament Corporation (MAC), based in Powder Springs Georgia from 1970-1976 was the first company to commercially produce the MAC Model 10 (MAC-10).This is the company started by Gordon Ingram that designed and built the first MAC.    MAC marketed a number of different weapons, but the MAC-10 (chambered in 9 mm and later in.45 ACP) and the high cyclic rate (approx. 1600 rpm) MAC-11 (chambered in .380) were its mainstays.   MAC declared bankruptcy in 1976 and went out of business.
 
Military Armament Corporation in Stephenville, TX took the MAC design from the Powder Springs plant and redesigned the gun to be ""better"".  In short, they redesigned the trigger mechanism, the safety, and the stock for better fit and  reliability.

As a note: BCM® barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM™ upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistent with these quality control procedures.

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension 

M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels. 

T-Marked Upper Receiver 
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission. 

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate 
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics. 

Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel 
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber 
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a worldwide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning. 

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish 
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base. 

5.56 NATO Chambers 
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo. 

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases 
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets. 

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels 
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

(Not a Walther.)

This is the 30th anniversary of the Pocket 9, once heralded as the smallest DAO 9mm in the world.  It's cool, sleek and powerful. Made in the USA, and no longer in production.

As seen in:
- Miami Vice, where Don ""Sonny Crockett"" Johnson carried the Pocket 9 in the first season, 
- Magnum P.I., where Tom ""Magnum"" Selleck used it once, and (wait for it...),
- In The Assault of the Killer Bimbos, where Christina ""Peaches"" Whitaker and Mike ""Vinnie"" Muskat often used the Detonics. 

Note the distinctive ambidextrous safety/decocker and the recurved trigger guard, which separates it from the Walther PPK.

This pistol was carried concealed by my father, the original owner.  He was a physician, and kept his firearms meticulously clean.  This pistol performs flawlessly. 

The details of the Detonics Pocket 9 can be found at:

9mm
Double action, 3 inch barrel, 6 shot magazine, stainless soft matte sheen finish, black aluminum grips.

Serious inquiries only.  This is a fantastic weapon, but I would like to trade it for something modern (or $400 cash).  When you can find a Pocket 9 on Gun Broker.com, they sell for $500-700.  I am not greedy. Prefer to trade for concealed carry 9mm."
