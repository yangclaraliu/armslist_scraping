This is normally sold for over six hundred dollars but I am willing to part with it for $400. It saves you money because you buy the upper receiver and rail together. Email for additional pictures.

One of VLTOR’s most innovative products is the Versatile Interface Structure (VIS) upper receiver assembly. The VIS is a polylithic upper receiver assembly that ties the normally individual receiver and handguard into a single, aggregate part. This combination overcomes many problems that are associated with the traditional “two piece” design; most notably the greatly improved structural strength and repeatable accuracy. This affords the user all the benefits of a free-floating barrel and solid railed for end."

It works great and is an essential addition to your tactical shotgun.  I recently sold my shotgun and no longer have a need for the light.

Featuring two levels of tactical illumination, ambidextrous switching, a slender ergonomic design, and legendary SureFire reliability and durability, the DSF-870 is the ultimate WeaponLight for Remington 870 combat shotguns. 

This compact, lightweight system replaces the weapon’s original factory forend and features a recoil-proof LED that generates 600 lumens of blinding white light at maximum output, or 200 lumens with twice the runtime on its high setting. The LED’s light is focused by a precision reflector to create a smooth, wide beam perfect for closer-range shotgun applications typical in law enforcement and home defense—with enough reach and surround light to properly identify threats and maintain situational awareness. 

The DSF-870 features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switches on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters. Selecting the LED’s output is achieved by activating the light in constant-on mode and then pressing the output-mode selector switch until the desired output level (600 or 200 lumens) is set. The selected output can then be left in constant-on mode or switched to momentary activation, and it stays at that output level until reset. Every DSF-Series WeaponLight also features an integrated system-disable switch to prevent accidental activation during transport, storage, or stealth operations. 

A lightweight but strong aluminum module protects the optics, LED, and sophisticated electronics, minimizing length with side-by-side placement of the two lithium batteries that power the system. The module has a Mil-Spec hard anodized finish to protect against scratches, abrasion, and corrosion, while O-ring and gasket seals keep out moisture, dust, and debris. The slender forend body is made from extremely tough polymer and is textured for a secure hold and features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switching on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters. 

The DSF-870 provides unmatched power, versatility, and control, making it a must-have on Remington 870 shotguns used in combat, law enforcement, or home defense. NOTE: To see our other DSF shotgun forend models, click here.

Today I have a Ruger Mini-14 Tactical Rifle, with upgrades.  It’s a great rifle, and has done great for me, but I need some stuff for my truck, so my loss is your gain.  This rifle is chambered in .223 and 5.56 and has a standard 16 in barrel.  Some upgrades/extras include:

ATI adjusting and folding stock, in flat dark earth (I prefer the term Desert Tan)

Flash Hinder

UTG adjustable bipod

Tactical Shorty Fore grip (must be swapped for the bipod)

Barska .223 3x9 Scope with factory Ruger scope rings

Mo-Rod barrel stabilizer

6 aftermarket 30 round mags, and 1 factory 20 round mag

Soft carrying case fit to carry the rifle with scope attached

As you can see from the pictures, this rifle is very unique.  I’ve see some other Minis on the web for over $1000 with a stock factory configuration.  Don’t be silly and buy one of those when you can have this one for less, and get more.  I’m asking $850 for everything I listed above.  Contact me with reasonable offers; I’m willing to negotiate the price if you travel to me and also thrown in some ammo to sweeten the deal.

Thanks for looking!!"

The 870 Express® Slug Gun is a rugged, value-priced workhorse, specifically made for deer hunting, featuring a fully rifled barrel with rifle sights. And, the butt-stock has a Monte Carlo comb to better align the shooters eye with the rifle sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. At the heart of the ultra reliable 870 Remington is a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength, and twin action bars that prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action. The Remington Model 870 Express Pump-Action Slug Shotgun - Synthetic comes with virtually indestructible black synthetic stock and fore-end that are impervious to water, and a non-reflective matte black, bead-blasted finish on the receiver and barrel. A durable, rubber recoil pad dampens recoil and helps shooter to stay on target for faster follow up shots. All 870 Express shotguns function with either 2-3/4"" or 3"" shotgun shells interchangeably. A myriad of aftermarket Remington 870 accessories enables owners to customize the 870 Express for specific purposes."

With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Research & Development teams, developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF. The TAVOR® was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the “father of the TAVOR,” spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities – seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990’s through the early 2000’s, the TAVOR underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies around the world."

Fired exactly 50 rounds total. It's in excellent condition, but the overall rifle just doesn't fit me well, so I'm moving her on The rifle comes with an installed top rail and retractable rail just below the barrel for lights, scopes or other accessories. A rear peep sight is standard equipment.

When I bought this, it was set up to use PX4 magazines, but I wanted to use 92 mags instead, so I bought the conversion parts to swap it over to 92 mags. I'm including the insert/mag release for PX4 magazines, so you'll have what you need to run either type magazine in this carbine. Included with the rifle are (2) Beretta 30-round magazines, which will work not only in the carbine, but also in a 92 series pistol. 

This is a great home defense gun, light recoil and very easy to handle and maneuver in tight places. Also a great (and fun) range gun. 

Here is what you get:

* Beretta CX4 Carbine, 9mm, set up for 92 series magazines
* (2) Beretta 30-round magazines (92 style/series)
* Beretta PX4 magazine well adapter (to allow use of PX4 magazines, if desired)

The guns listed in this collection will be sold this Saturday in Blacklick, Ohio about 10 minutes Southeast of Columbus.  

1915 Colt hammerless .32.  This firearm is remarkable condition.  It has a 6-digit serial number which I looked up on Colt’s website and obtained the information that it is a 1915 Colt hammerless.  This gun is fully functional and I would rate it at 90%+.  Asking price $600

Winchester lever action 30-30.  This gun has a scope mount with a bushnell scope 3x8.  This firearm also has a 6-digit serial number.  On Winchester’s website it indicates the gun was manufactured in 1907.  This gun is also in remarkable condition for its age and was hard to grade because I am aware that adding the scope mount and scope actually devalued the firearm.  Asking price $575

SKS Poly Tech.  This SKS has the arsenal triangle stamp indicating that it is a type 56 military-grade weapon and is also stamped Poly Tech on the side.  This gun looks to be in unused new condition.  I would grade this gun at 95-100%.  Being a Poly Tech with an arsenal stamp, asking price $425

SKS Paratrooper.  This is the short SKS carbine rifle.  It also has the arsenal triangle stamp indicating it is a type 56 military-grade weapon.  It is in amazing condition and appears to be unfired.  Asking price $475

Ruger 1022 rifle with one 10-round magazine.  This looks to be a standard model Ruger 1022.  It is in great condition.  Asking price $175

Stevens 12ga pump shotgun mod 350 with 18in barrel.  Has ghost ring type sights and is in excellent condition.  Asking price $175

S&W 12ga shotgun mod 3000.  This gun is still in its original box.  Did some research and it is one that was made in Japan.  Researched several online websites and pricing this shotgun at $250

Mossberg 500 12ga shotgun in real tree cammo.  This gun has two barrels with it an 18in and what looks to be a 22 or 24in barrel.  This firearm is in excellent+ condition.  Asking price $300


H&R 16ga Topper with 28in barrel single-shot.  This gun shows some wear.  It appears it was a hunting shotgun but is functional.  Asking price $50

Stevens single-shot 410 shotgun with 28in barrel.  This gun is in fair condition and does appear to have been a hunting gun that shows damage to the finish and slight to the frame.  Asking price $50

I have pictures of all of these firearms.  Anyone interested in the entire collection will be offered a slight discount.  As stated before, e-mail me so we can make contact and I will provide serious buyers with pictures and the location of the sale on Saturday June 13th from 12:30-5pm.

The rifle also comes with a set of Millett M77 high profile scope rings and a 4-12x40mm Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn scope.
