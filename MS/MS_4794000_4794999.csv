This might be boring to some but please read it:   The Colt Official Police was a big seller, and in 1933 colt revolvers were adopted by the police departments of New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Kansas City, St. Louis, Portland, and Los Angeles, in addition to the state police of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and Connecticut. Sales of the Official Police on the police and civilian markets boomed, and a few years later the FBI adopted it as the agency’s standard-issue sidearm.
Just a little history I had to add....

I am only looking to trade for a .40 or .45 cal. semi auto.........
 I am not interested in selling it so please don't ask because I will not respond, Trade Only!!!!
So if you have a nice .40 or .45 you want to trade send me some pics, if I like it I'll trade..

This is the factory Glock 9mm barrel that comes stock in the Glock model 19C. It cannot be used as a compensated barrel in the 19 due to the lack of the ports in the slide. Using it to convert the 23C or 32C to shoot 9mm is not recommended and unsafe as it is not a 100% fit. This barrel will not work extended in the 26 because the ports in the barrel do not protrude from the slide.

Glock 36 45 acp that comes with three magazines.  This gun is older (gen 2 I think) but comes with night sights that are less than a year old.  Don't have the original box for this but I do have a Glock box for it. Looking to trade this for a larger 45, such as a Glock 21 or something similar. 

Not looking to sell, only trade.  Email me and I can send pictures if you really need them, but they look like all the other Glocks.  I live in the Show Low area but I'll be in the Valley of Sun for a couple of weeks around the end of October and first of November."

This shotgun is gorgeous with beautiful wood and detailing (like the jeweled bolt and gold inlay).  The asking price on the DU 390s on GunBroker are starting at $999 and going up to $1,299.  Bought it thinking I would eventually take it into the field so I had the prettiest gun.  I have decided that it is just too nice for me to to that.  I have never fired it.  Guy I bought it from got it with his dad when they used to go to the DU festivals.  He never remembered his dad firing it, but I cannot guarantee it.

Only bad is I put a small scrape on the bottom of the butt stock while pulling it out of the safe.  

Email me for more pics.

Includes original box (but my idiot movers folded it up so it is a bit on the ugly side).  However, I will include a era appropriate hard sided DU case with the shotgun if you don't haggle on pricing.  

Price dropped from $950 to $900.  Now, $850 cash."

Works for any AR15 chambered in .223, 5.56 NATO, or .300 Blackout. It is MP Tested & Marked. Meloniting/Black Nitride is not a coating, it is a treatment process, and it is a step above Nickel Boron. It is the most durable finish/treatment available, and can withstand carbon build up even beyond what Nickel Boron does. And being made by Seekins Precision it is USA Made. It is $150 straight from Seekins and the lowest it is for sale anywhere else is $142.50. I will take $130 cash (firm) for it. If you happen to need a charging handle too I also have one that I can include for another $20, for a total price of $150. You will not find a better BCG than this for the money, and you will not find this one anywhere else for this low a price, check around for yourself and see. The price is firm so please no offers of less, it is brand new and I am already selling it below what it would cost to buy the same thing directly from from them or anywhere else. Yes you can buy a cheaper one but you get what you pay for and Seekins stuff is as good as it gets. This is a great price for a complete BCG of this quality and well worth it. If interested please respond with a phone number to contact you on. If you do not include a phone number in your reply and you don't get any response from me, that is why. The price is $130 firm and cash only please. The only item I will be interested in trading for is a Verizon or AT&T or US Cellular iPhone 5 5c or 5s in nice condition, nothing else. I do not want to haggle on prices so please only reply if you want the BCG or BCG/CH combo for the listed price, thanks

Please no offers of any less, no need to waste our time, the price is $650 FIRM. There is much more than this just in the gun and parts alone, not even including any of the work done. I have never shot it once. There are a few trades I'd take that I will list below but I am mainly interested in just selling it outright for cash. So for me to trade it would need to be one of the specific items I have listed, or something worth at least what the total value represented here is (easily over $1k, not $650 - that is the ALL CASH price). The few photos shown are not even close to enough to do this gun justice. If you are interested and serious please include a phone number to contact you on. If you don't and I do not respond to you that is probably why.

This is in excellent condition with orange front Trijicon HD night sights, three 15-rd magazines, an amazingly sweet Double Action/single action trigger with decocker and paddle magazine release. 4"" Barrel with Polymer Frame. Easily one of the most comfortable grips on the market. 

Also comes with adjustable backstraps, manual, box, and fobus paddle holster. 

the P99 AS combines the advantages of the traditional Double Action System with Single Action Anti-Stress trigger. The P99 provides the shooter with a user-friendliness previously found only in hammer fired pistols.Traditional Double Action - The anti-stress trigger makes the P99 one of the world's safest firearms by preventing unintentional ""reflex"" firing in stressful situations. The decisive innovation: When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon loading, the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot; not only in the double action trigger mode, but also in the single action mode. The P99 AS is equipped with a decocking button to safely decock the striker. 

The trigger reset on this is amazing. Simply put, this is a great handgun. 

Not looking at trades. Have to make a sacrifice to clear some space. 

Must be 21 or over with MO DL and CCL to do bill of sale.  Or transfer can be done at local FFL. 

I will discuss reasonable offers. However I will not accept lowball offers as I do not need the cash desperately or even need to sell. 

Thanks for looking."

Which means it has the rail front end instead of the ""guppy"" front end.
 I am not the original owner, so the round count is unknown.
 I have shot this rifle and it runs like a champ, no malfunctions what so ever. I only shoot brass cased ammo through my expensive rifles.
 It does have minor marks on the rail where accessories had been attached, if you put on your own accessories you will not see the marks. Or if you paint or coat your gear, it's a non-issue.

 The previous owner did remove the ""wipes"" inside the mag well, now the mags will drop free, it did not hinder function at all, I just wanted to mention it, so that there are no surprises.
 Speaking of mags, if you are not familiar with the FS2000, it will only accept G.I. mags, this was not a deal breaker for me, but may be for some.

 If you are reading this ad, you probably know that these are no longer being made, I don't see them come up very often on the used market, but they do from time to time.

 Originally I was going to try and chase down all the factory accessories, it does have the factory mag, in addition to that I did manage to find an original cleaning kit with all the small tools including the sight adjustment tool and take down tools. The cleaning/tool kit is complete and the factory kit.

This is FTF in Indy, I may roll for the right deal.
Please be 18yrs or older, with a valid IN DL and a LTCH (carry permit) would be nice, but not a deal breaker.
NO INFO recorded.
I will not respond to emails, asking the following:
Is it still available? The answer is YES, if the ad is up, then yes I still have it.
Will you take my non running project car, tattoo work or airplane rides?
The answer is NO. I will not respond to silly trade offers.
The trades listed are what I'm after, I look on here daily, if I see something I don't have listed and I want it, I will shoot that person an email."

I'm looking to purchase or trade for an AR15 aftermarket trigger. NOT Looking for any Mil-Spec Polished triggers. Sorry. Only Looking to pay non-retail prices for a Geissele , Timney , RRA trigger groups. They can be the pre-assembled drop-in-type or the factory pin styled. Dont care which one and dont care if they are brand New or Used. 

*Will entertain any that are still in original shape and Not Modified or Polished.  

*Again, don't contact me if your price is close to what retail is. I can get around 25% off retail prices but want to see if anybody had anything local first. 

*This trigger's purpose is to be installed into a Fostech DefendAR bump style stock. The Mil-Spec trigger was way too heavy and rough to get the Fostech to run as designed.

*Please don't send me any links or put forth any gadgets or gizmo's that modify trigger pull, weight, etc.
Willing to meet FTF or I Can pay via Paypal and accept shipping too.

- Im throwing in the 7hp Sears (Ted Williams) outboard motor. Which worked great this spring, but I tried firing it up yesterday and was unsuccessful in getting it started. It probably just needs a carb cleaning. Like I said, the motor is a freebie to the buyer of the boat. The price does not reflect a running motor, but it's nothing that a quick carb cleaning shouldn't solve.

Prefer Local Pickup, but I will ship in the US at the buyers expense, but it is expensive (box weighs 48 lbs. 24""x 16""x 12"").
Here are the specs:
The Grand is designed for the shotgunner who demands precision shotshells. Start a hull at station 1 and insert a wad in the wad guide at station 4. All other functions are performed automatically. Once in full operation, a loaded shotshell is dispensed each time the handle is cycled through the full down and up strokes. The case-activated Powder System means that if there’s no hull in place, no powder is dropped, preventing spillage and eliminating the need to manually turn the powder on and off.

Last I checked, this is cheaper than online dealers as well as local offering with the added bonus of no sales tax / shipping charges.

Info from Hornady's website:
Designed for hunting, self-defense and law enforcement applications, the XTP® bullet demonstrates the kind of accuracy which led many competitive shooters to adopt it. Its reliable performance makes the XTP® the most popular handgun bullet for both target shooters and hunters. It's the stopping power of the XTP® bullet that has truly built its world-class reputation. From the onset, XTP® bullets were specifically designed to expand reliably at a wide range of handgun velocities to deliver deep penetration with every shot.


Features:
Precise serrations divide the XTP® into symmetrical sections, strategically weakening the jacket and initiating controlled expansion even at low velocities.
Total uniformity of core density ensures balanced expansion as well as in-flight stability
Expansion is controlled by varying jacket thickness down the length of the XTP®, providing a definite advantage over plated bullets which have a uniform jacket thickness over the entire bullet."
