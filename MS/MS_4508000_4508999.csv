It is a Stainless Steel Frame Glock. CCF Race Frames out of Richmond, VA is a company from what I understand were stood up to produces parts for a SOCOM contract, then after selling what was left of their inventory closed the doors. The frame alone weighs what an entire G17 would, so when you run the gun hard...the sights stay down and on target. Notice the backstrap, beavertail, rounded trigger guard, and HUGE internal rails. This is as close to a 1911 one could get a Glock yet keep the reliablilty and versatility of parts. When I found the frame from \\a guy who knew a guy\\ I also contacted the owner of CCF and got an extra parts kit for the frame=locking block, frame pins, take down spring, Glock style backstrap and backstrap rolled pin. It currently has the 1911 style backstrap installed. Frame still has raw castings marks and a few cratches from manufacturing because I refuse to polish it, as the raw metal is just way to sexy. I have run 500 rounds through the gun at a competition in NC with zero malfunctions and won. Its like cheating because the weight. Has a true picatiny rail and EXTREMELY aggressive checkering on the front strap that makes the gun stick in the hand.

The gun is a G17 Gen 3 with the hard to find gloss finish slide from Austria, and overall has tons of upgrades.... polished internals, ZEV spring kit, Glock OEM extended slide stop, extended mag release, recoil buffer, and fiber optic sights. The gun obviously doesn/t have a case and will come with 1 magazine.

Getting back into the long range competitions so its just sitting in the safe. The price is pretty firm as you cannot find these and are great for collectors."

I have three, 6-round, Glock-factory, G43 magazines, each with the Glock extended base plate.  These are new magazines that I purchased within the last two weeks and they’ve seen very little use.

I’d like to trade them even for Glock factory G42 magazines…the latest version with “02” at the end of the part number.  If you don’t have the “02” G42 mags, let me know how many of the earlier version mags you want to trade.

If I can’t find a trade for G42 mags, I’ll sell all three of my G43 mags as a lot for $75 cash (equivalent to $25 ea.), and I’ll also throw in a kydex Fury G43 Concealment holster for free (for which I paid $64 at www.furyholsters.com).  This is a good deal which can be verified by checking the G43 mag pricing on eBay.

I can meet face to face in east TN to trade mags.  I can also send the mags and holster by Priority Mail anywhere in the USA for an extra $10 (that would be a total of $85 for mailed mags & holster).  Since a firearm isn’t being transferred, an FFL is NOT needed.

If sending the mags by mail, I’ll accept PayPal and will mail immediately upon PayPal’s notification of receipt of funds.  I’ll also accept a personal check but will mail 7 days after being able to deposit your check to allow time for check clearing. 

If the ad’s still up, the mags are still available.  Thanks!"

DESCRIPTION: With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Blackwood: A natural stainless steel slide and black hard coat anodized alloy frame are paired with Hogue Blackwood grips."

This gun is 95%. Shows minor holster wear on the slide, and the bluing on top of the barrel shows some wear. It was taken care of by a Glock certified armorer before I bought it in March (Auburn Police Department from what I was told) and I have only taken it to the range twice. I've put less than 150 rounds down the pipe and it was cleaned after each use. 

The bore is flawless and its a straight shooter. I hate to get rid of it, but I cannot afford to feed it the ammo it needs and am opting for a 9mm platform as I'm a recent college grad just starting a career. Just plinking and carrying in the winter.

It has an 18.5 inch barrel so the length is excellent for home defense.  

This shotgun has never been fired.  The insides are mint condition.  The exterior is near mint.  No scratches and there are no dents or dings.  I bought this about 6 years ago as my second Moss500.  I never actually got around to using it though so I'm hoping there is someone out there who will give it a happy home and put it to good use.  If you want, I'll even toss in the elastic shell holder with it for free."

Used for 1500 rounds or so, then swapped out for a longer length. Only light wear in the finish. This is the original verison, before they added flats to the tube around the slots to be fully MLOK compliant. I have mounted several MLOK accessories to it it with no problems with lock up. 

One issue with the rail I bought used came with the ALG barrel nut but the previous owner had stripped out a screw in one of the mounting holes. There are 8 sets however, and the rail only attaches using three sets. Depending how the barrel nut clocks to your upper, you should easily be able to rotate the nut to a point where only good holes are showing, or use a different combination of shims to do so. 

Comes with manual, wrench, barrel shims, ALG MLOK Co-witness rail section, and bolts.

Let me know if you have any questions. If you see this ad the firearm is still for sale. Local meeting only with correct IDs. If you are looking for a great deep concealed carry this is your gun. It works great in the pocket or inside the waste band of a pair of slacks. CCW dream. 

The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.

The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.

Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.

I bought this rifle about 4 years ago from a guy that was in a tough spot and needed money. I didn’t need it or really even want it, but I wanted to help him out. It has mainly just been sitting around ever since. I have taken it to the range a few times and have put about (100) – (150) rounds through it in the process. Everything worked like it’s supposed to. I have never shot it for accuracy so I don’t know what to tell you there. It does appear to be pretty straight though.

The previous owner was hoping to find a threaded barrel under the muzzle nut so he cut the welds and removed it. Of course, as you can see, he found no threads. He had a POSP scope on the rail and there is a ding in the stock where the scope base hit it when it was being removed (Yeah, I did that that one on the night I bought the rifle). Lastly, it was given a “sweet” rattle can paint job, which he didn’t charge me any extra for. The only changes I have made were to add a Tapco G2 trigger, that I had laying around, to it and to do a custom “Tactical” polish job. Ok, so basically, I just removed the paint from the rails and cleaned up the hammer face so the bolt wouldn’t hang up on it. That did smooth it out quite a bit. I can get after pictures of that if you would like.

The rifle will come with the sling shown in the pictures and one 40-round Chinese made magazine that I received with it.

Details as follows:

Sig Sauer 556XI rifle chambered in 5.56x45. This rifle has a side folding, fixed stock with a cheek riser. The charging handle is swap-able for those that prefer a more AK like set up, but right now it is on the left side. It takes all of 20 seconds to switch and that's if you've never done it before. The hand guards are aluminum, and the rifle will come with four sections of rails that you can attach to any point on the hand guards that you want. The barrel itself is 16 inches with a 1 in 7 twist. Both the safety and magazine releases are ambidextrous, and the rifle accepts any AR15 magazines. The gas system is adjustable with Standard, Adverse, and Suppressed. Since the rifle operates on a short stroke piston, the chamber and bolt groups are kept extremely clean. I haven't actually fired this rifle yet, just got it and cleaned it, then set it in the safe. I never got around to taking it out, and I've already seen something I want a bit more. Isn't that always how it happens? The rifle will come with 1 30 round magazine and all the goodies from Sig.


Sig Sauer SP2022 pistol in 9mm. Same as the rifle, never been fired since I picked them both up at the same time, then never got to the range. Comes with everything from Sig including a holster and two additional brand new 15 round magazines still in their package. Email works best, but can do text as well at REDACTED. Phone calls are fine, but text or email me first since I do work during the day."

These are blank only guns and can not fire live ammunition. They are a great training aid for teaching new shooters as they function exactly like real firearms and they have the sound but no recoil. They are front firing so they are very realistic and would make great props for film making or theater productions. You could also use them as a trading aid for dogs to get them used to the sound of a gun since these are not as loud as a actual gun shot and you don't have to worry about where your bullets are going.

660,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4508660,"For Sale:  .458 SOCOM AR Pistol 10.5"" barrel","Metro, Tucson, Arizona",$ 1,"Listed On: Friday, July 31, 2015",Handguns,High Standard                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Single Shot                                                                                ,Pistol,"The .458 SOCOM was created, based on requirements by the Special Operations Command (SOCOM), for Task Force Ranger and some elements of Delta and Seals, that were operating in Somalia (Mogadishu) in the late 90's early 2000's. These special ops soldiers were asking for a better ""knock down, one shot, one kill"" ability because their M4's, calibred in 5.56, were not effective as a CQB take down round (they needed multiple shots to knock down and/or kill the Somali's). The requirement also required the upgraded caliber to be compatible with the current M4 platform. The end result was... (1) a .458 caliber bullet fired from a different barrel that was used in the current M4 upper receiver,...(2) development of a different bolt because of the size of the .458 round, but, maintain the same bolt carrier, and...(3) the ejection port on the current M4 upper receiver would have to be enlarged for the ejection of the larger piece of brass. These three items are the only difference between a standard AR 15 and the .458 SOCOM. The standard M16 / AR15 lower receiver is to be used with this upper, and was not changed at all. 

Place this upper receiver next to a 5.56 upper receiver and visually there is no difference. The difference becomes apparent only when you squeeze the trigger. At that time all hell breaks loose as you unleash a 300gr bullet, with a muzzle velocity of 1840 fps and 2100 ft lbs of energy towards that feral pig that has been bothering your farm animals. This round, with that much energy, will stop a 300lb feral pig in its tracks. 

***Preferably, I would like to sell this complete pistol set to a Arizona CCW holder, but, whomever the buyer is he / she must be willing to sign a bill of sale for the serial numbered lower receiver with both of our information on it, which is a ""CYA"" for the two of us***

The price for every item in picture # 1 is $1550.....I will consider all reasonable offers with the keyword being ""reasonable"". Please be respectful of the build process, prices, and, comparable brick and mortar prices for these types of pistols. Sold separately the complete SOCOM upper, with sight, no lower, is $720. The 5.56 upper, with sight, no lower, is $580. The lower is not for sale separately but if you purchase just one of the uppers and want the lower with it, add $350 to whichever upper you choose. 

***If the uppers are sold separately then the 4 mags with bullets ARE NOT a part of the sale. The mags and bullets only apply if the entire kit is purchased***

I may ship the upper receivers if requested (paypal only) but will ""ONLY"" sell the lower receiver in person, no exceptions.

***If you are interested in purchasing this pistol combination please email to receive more pictures as ArmsList only allows me 3 pictures***

Any AR 15 lower receiver will attach to, and fire, this .458 SOCOM upper, and 5.56 upper. 

For the .458 SOCOM...The upper receiver, 10.5"" barrel, bolt, gas block, gas tube, is from Tromix. The barrel shroud is from Kineti-Tech. The nickel boron bolt carrier is from SAA. The hand guard is a Yankee Hill Machine (YHM) T-6061 anodized aluminum 9.6"" diamond version quad rail, which is very strong and light weight, and this is a full floating barrel. 

For the 5.56...The upper receiver is a overrun modular build from an un-named source who requested to be anonymous for a good reason. The 11"" barrel is the same type of overrun build from the same source and is chambered in 5.56 and is chrome lined. The BCG is nickel boron and is from SAA. The firing pin is titanium, The charging handle and ejection port cover are laser engraved with the 2nd Amendment and punisher graphics (must see) The handguard is 10"" T-6061 aluminum and is very strong and lightweight which makes the barrel a full floating build. The muzzle compensator is from Kineti-tech and direct the sound and flash forward.

The holographic sight on both of these uppers are a Sightmark SM 14002g (green reticles) and are night vision compatible.

The lower receiver is a aero precision with many upgrades...
1) A hyper fire EDT (enhanced duty trigger) with the 4.5lb pull trigger spring. It also has a 5.5lb trigger spring as well. The trigger and hammer pins have anti-rotation attachments.
2) The pistol grip is a magpul with a storage compartment.
3) The trigger guard is laser etched with a waving American flag and reads ""Freedom isn't Free""
4) The front pivot pin and rear take down pins are over sized for easy grip and are laser etched with the waving American flag.
5) The safety select lever is ambidextrous.
6) The lower receiver extension is a KAK Shockwave complete forearm brace purchased from KAK industries***THIS IS NOT A SHOULDER STOCK AND IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE USED AS A SHOULDER STOCK***
7) The rear sling mount is a quick detach at the pistol grip.

These are very quality builds and they have been test fired to ensure all areas of functionality work as required.

The .458 SOCOM bullets will feed into regular AR magazines. A 30 round AR magazine will hold 10 .458 SOCOM rounds as a single stack. This pistol will come with the 4 magazines you see, loaded with 10 rounds each, as shown in the picture. The rounds are Hornady 300gr hollow points, or SBX inceptor 140gr hydro-dynamic (propeller) CQB defense round. Your choice.

From sub-zero arctic temperatures to almost unbearable desert heat, Superformance ammunition can withstand any hunting condition. Loaded with Hornady's InterLock Super Shock Tip (SST) bullet, this round combines proven Hornady performance with a higher ballistic coefficient than available with most hunting bullets. The sharp, pointed polymer tip creates a faster, flatter shooting bullet. With its one-piece core and jacket strengthened in critical areas, the SST delivers much more controlled expansion and superior weight retention than other tipped bullets. Featuring Hornady's trade mark InterLock ring system, this bullet's core and jacket remain locked solid during expansion, creating massive wound channels.

This is the newer youth model that drops from under the trigger and not on the top stock. In very nice condition considering it has been in a weather proof safe for 8 years. I am asking $200 or best offer. Sorry no lowball $100 offers, they will be turned down every time.

If your interested send me a email. My phone has been shut off and I have to pay a $677 phone bill before it will get turned back on. Was told it would never get above $150 a month so I told them to stick there phones were the sun don't shine.

I know some older folks use to find single shot 12 gauges for $75 about 10 years ago but you must understand that gun prices do rise. Especially when they stay in the same condition as they were brand new. Also you can't tell me that if I shoot it the stock will crack and bust , I know your incorrect because I just put 10 rounds in it today for the first time and I had no problem at all. Truly the crack looks like it is part of the wood but some say its not.

This is damn near perfect, with the exception of an owner's social scratched into the receiver over the chamber (was blued over probably at rebuild) which would be covered by a scope should you chose to do so.

This shotgun is 12 gauge and has a rifled barrel for shooting Sabot slugs. If you want to use it for home defense or bird hunting, just pick up another barrel and swap it out. This was my deer hunting gun last year but this year I now have a .44 Magnum rifle so I no longer need this. It functions flawlessly. It has a 24"" ported barrel for reduced muzzle rise and holds 4+1 without the plug and 2+1 with the plug installed. I have upgraded the magazine spring to a higher powered Wolff spring and upgraded the follower to a GG&G steel/aluminum follower for more reliable feeding. The barrel has an integrated cantilever scope base ready to mount a scope of your choice. The stock is a monte carlo style and is polymer. I have also added a shell holder on the stock to carry an extra 5 shells. This shotgun will shoot 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells. It has a spacer system to adjust the drop angle of the stock. It also has a quick empty button that will release all of the loaded shells with the press of the button. I have the original box, owner's manual, lock, the stock magazine spring and magazine follower, as well as an extra recoil pad and a Limbsaver recoil pad. I am also including 3 boxes of Sabot slugs to get you started. I had this out hunting 1 day last year and dropped a deer in its tracks with it at 60 yards. This is a great deer gun, I just no longer need it.
