The only thing I'm looking for is another Sub 2000 in a Glock set up. I waited so long for this one that I'm not ready to give up the gun yet. I've been wanting a Glock set up but with how hard these guns are to get I had to jump on this one when it became available. 
I would prefer another .40 in Glock mags but would consider 9mm in Glock mags. I would prefer a new rifle since mine is ""new in box"", (Unfired by me and the shop that sent it to me. They sold it to me as new.) but would consider a lightly used and well maintained used rifle. I would also be willing to toss in 50 target rounds and pay for the transfer if we use my FFL in Aurora. 
Glad I finally got a Sub2k and would happily keep this one if I can't find a Glock one but figured its worth trying.

For Sale, one excellent condition Marlin Model 60 - 

It functions perfectly, original owner managed to get a little latex paint on the stock.  Whoops.  

The iPad Mini is NOT for sale, and I was trying to use it to prop up the rifle while taking the pic.  Not entirely clever of me LOL.  

The rifle shoots very straight, has 100% function, and is a fantastic rifle for small game, plinking or serious target work, whatever you need a rimfire rifle to do.

FTF in Des Plaines IL, FOID/ 24-hr wait, bill of sale all apply.  I will ship to your FFL for the cost of actual shipping if you desire.  

If interested, please drop me a note with your name, phone, email and we will sort out the details.  Thanks for looking folks!"

The price of a new PT-22 is only about $80.00 more than what I am asking so I am reducing my price a bit, in addition ammo is the toughest thing to find these days so I am providing ammo to get started (actually it is the box that I use for this particular carry gun) anyway the new price is $175.00 and a box of ammo. all else about the listing remains the same. I just wanted to be more fair and responsive to my customers (I have plenty more guns to list and don't want to anger anyone)
The Taurus PT-22 is an excellent choice for the CCW licensee. Lightweight and compact, the pistol can be concealed easily, and is very easy to operate with its flip-top barrel design. Chambered in 22LR, the rounds are frequently available and inexpensive compared to other carry calibers. . It is very easy to conceal under a golf shirt and weighs very little when fully loaded. This gun has a fair amount of holster wear but has only been fired just over 100 or so (my records are not perfect but I think 120) rounds."

The machine will be delivered clean and ready to use in your caliber choice. for 100 bucks more, i will deliver it to your location of choosing(not in the ghetto or the like) and will instruct you on how to change calibers, parts, etc and set the machine up. I am willing to spend up to 2 hours instructing you on how to use the machine, IF YOU WANT.

While I was purchasing it, another buyer came in and bought a model 9422 in .22 magnum.  My rifle came with plain walnut wood and his (magnum) came with the laminated WinCam stock.  (WinCam): Each layer is individually stained and the pieces are glued together.  After that, they form the stock and the result is beautiful.  However, the other 9422 buyer wanted walnut and I wanted the WinCam so the gunsmith switched the wood for us.  This may very well be the only 9422 chambered in short, long, long rifle with the WinCam stock.  Collectible?  I don't know but it is really beautiful.  The pictures do not do it justice.  The rifle is in mint condition and has only been fired a few times.  Soft case displayed not included although a different soft case is.  Cash only.  I prefer to deal with someone local to avoid the hassle of shipping from my FFL to yours although arrangements could be made.  Buyer would be responsible for any transfer fees as well as shipping and insurance.  Thanks for looking."

Put a winchester 4X32AO scope on it, lot of fun to shoot. Put about 50 rounds downrange few weeks ago at 100 yards for a 5"" group.

I was running rounds through it as fast as I could, hadn't shot a rifle in 17yrs & never used a scope, not to mention shaky hands. I'd assume if the barrel stayed cool and had an experienced shooter, or even just someone with steady hands, the accuracy would be superb.

Was real fun to plink with, but I'm looking to afford an AR or AK. Have 100 rounds of winchester and 100 rounds of remmington 22LR I can throw in, I know it is a pain to get right now."

This rifle is also commonly known as the Enfield 1917.

The rifle was built in Sept 1918 by Remington and the mechanical function of this rifle is perfect.  The bore is also in excellent condition, having been kept clean and it shoots VERY straight.

The Remington 1917/ Enfield action is known for being very slick and smooth, and this rifle is no exception to this rule.  It is no surprise to anyone who's ever shot one of these that they were a favorite for conversion to a shorter sporting rifle for decades.

This rifle is a wonderful example of history meeting practical application.  It is chambered for what is perhaps the most versatile cartridge of our time, and is good for any game on the continent from moose and elk on down.  

I will take as a partial trade an XD9 Subcompact - I am not looking for any other trades at this time.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

It has the Nitrite finish and genuine Sig nite sights. It also has two magazines(a 7 and 6 capactiy). It appears to me to be unfired but I can't absolutely guarantee that.

Up for sale:

I'm selling my Ruger MKII pistol, which is a wonderfully accurate and dependable pistol, but I happen to prefer something else.

This pistol is in excellent condition, comes with the two Ruger magazines pictured, and a soft case.

I would trade it for a Ruger 22/45 as I would like to try one for a while.  

FTF in Des Plaines, 72-hr wait, FOID, bill of sale apply

I will ship it to your FFL at your cost if you like.

Please send me your name, email and phone in response, we can sort out the details easily enough.  

FYI - when I was listing this, the Armslist drop-down menus were not letting me list this as a .22 PISTOL, but if you're looking at this, you can see it is not a revolver or derringer.  Thanks for understanding this and I have notified Armslist admin folks about this glitch."

IF YOU ARE READING THIS, IT IS STILL AVAILABLE.

This is a 1965 Ford Mustang coupe. The body of the Mustang is in good condition. No major dings or and no rust. The Paint looks good, it has imperfections but it will do for now.  The Tires are Brand new and the Rims are II Crave Alloys (worth over S1000). It has power (Stainless Steel Brake Corporation) brakes and Front Disc conversion (over $1500). The Transmission, Automatic (C4) was rebuilt less than 5, 000 miles ago. The interior is nice, Not excellent but in very good condition. No rips on the seats, not really faded and pretty clean over all. Now to the serious part....

This car was originally a 6 cylinder and I bought a motor from a 94 Ford mustang (5.0 ) and had a mechanic rebuild it here in Town. We were planning on going fuel injection, instead of carburator, so the motor is set up for that application. (However if you decide to go carb, its an easy switch). The motor was rebuilt ( so you get an awesome 302 motor!) but unfoately the shop went out of business before the installation was complete. So right now... the motor is in the car... You can finish the installation either carb or fuel injection.

This car will be amazing with that motor but to be honest, I don't have the money to invest into that project.

DO NOT try to Low Ball me. I know what this car is worth and I know that once the installation is finished and it's all done this car will sell EASILY for 11 or 12 thousand. (if you go fuel injection, it will sell for ALOT more. 

Please contact me IF you plan on coming to see the car and IF you have the money. Will consider trade for awespme guns. sigs, glocks, colt, noveske, or.... Let me know what you have the worst I can say is no, thank you. looking for 3,000 cash and the rest in trade value.

Hard to find 20 gauge in this model. This gun has had very few shots put through it as it was passed down from family member to family member but was kept in a case in a closet for most of its life. The wood engraving is in good condition.  Engraving and lettering on left side is still visible with right side being a little more worn then the left. All parts are original and Serial Numbers on all parts match. Gun locks up very tight and bore is in great condition. Right side of forend under barrel has some of the wood chipped off but very minimal. Extractors work great. All in all still a great S/S made by one of the best shotgun makers of all time."

I know, that's hard to believe, what with all the ""NIB"" and ""Never been fired"" guns on armslist, but it's true, not one failure to feed, eject, or a doublefeed, ever. 

It's completely stock, I bought it brand new from my LGS and it has never been ""worked on"" by anyone. 

This is a good, honest gun that has been babied, I just don't shoot it anymore. Comes with 2 factory mags and everything that came in the box.

Ive fired about 80 rounds through this rifle (45/70 cast lead bullet over pyrodex rifle powder in a fire formed 50/90 sharps case)

comes with non-matching, gorgeous brown patina covered bayonet, very snug fit on the rifle

someone cleaned it to white a long time ago, its a dull grey now (except for under the rear sight, they must have forgotten that area)

has a repro cleaning rod from canada

The only thing with any sort of rust on this rifle is the rear sling loop, its rusted and is difficult to move.

Pretty remarkable piece of firearm history, notable of some research. 

The sling pictured is not included in the sale

I am only selling to finance my education, otherwise i would not think of getting rid of this rifle.

I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."
