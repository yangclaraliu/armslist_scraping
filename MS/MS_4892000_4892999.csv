My Marine Corps Afghanistan combat veteran is in a time of need.

His truck is in the shop, and he needs $1,000 to pay the deductible to get his truck out. He is willing to part ways with his .40 caliber Desert Eagle, everything that comes with a brand new gun purchased at a gun shop, 100 rounds many being hallow point, in order to make the transaction happen in getting his truck back in his possession. It has only had 100-150 rounds at most put through it total, and not a knick or scratch on it. Good as new. It is in perfect shape. Unfortunately it is no longer considered a brand new weapon, now considered ""used"". Therefore, this man who served his country for almost 8 years, and is still serving now as a reservist, after 4 years active duty, deployed for a year in Afghanistan. He's asking for the $1,000 firm for the pistol, which was purchased at Gander Mountain so everything is included. We are very aware that it may not be worth the asking price, but for all he's done for us, we can band together and do something for him. Please spread the word for anybody who would be willing to pay that amount (legally and documented with bill of sale might I add) for what he paid for it, in order to get back on his feet. This is basically a post to reach out and see if anyone would be willing to help him, an outstanding Marine with the biggest heart I know, in a time of need. Even though it may be only a little under retail price for what that gun costs brand new, someone out there has the heart to help out, and purchase this absolutely great pistol.Thank you for time, consideration, and understanding that we need to go above and beyond to help a struggling Marine get back on his feet. We as Americans owe it to him. Contact me if you or anyone you know has the heart and the money to be able to pack this very high grade weapon. We as citizens, service members and civilians alike, owe him a favor. Thank you for your time. I hope you know you would be helping out more than you might think. God bless America and Semper Fi!"

The gun has been a safe queen and has a round count around 300 rounds. Shoots like a dream. You can choose to believe or not but I've shot sub MOA groups with the lighter Bear ammo. It seems to like the lighter bullets as opposed to heavier match rounds. Included in this auction is a Trijicon 3-9x40 Accupoint. It has the amber dot reticle. It is mounted with a Boro quick detach mount. I'm including 8 magazines. 4 are in the original box and 3 are still in the plastic. The only one I've used is the one that came with the gun. Everything in the picture is part of the auction. The bipod is a $50 job that I picked up a my gun store--nothing fancy but it works. The foregrip is a magpul and the sling is single point quick adjust magpul sling. I love the gun but I have not shot it in over a year. Please know your state's laws. I'm not shipping where it isn't permitted. I'll ship for $50.

Also this is shorter than the MPX! It is 20"" overall and If you buy a Law Tactical folding adapter to it then it will shorten the carry length to about 15"" folded.

I have replaced this with another PDW that works better for my needs.

Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16's unique design. The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16"" Parkerized carbon steel barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory's forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A shooters have come to love and expect. If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won't let you sacrifice power, you need the SOCOM 16.

I'm interested in semiauto shotgun (Mossberg 930 SPX style), maybe some ammo(9,45,223,7.62) or whatever you may have to offer."

The styling is elegant and trim. What’s more, PPQ M2 has been updated for 2013 with a new traditional reversible mag release button. The leading edge just took another step forward.

Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16's unique design. The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16"" Parkerized carbon steel barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory's forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A shooters have come to love and expect. If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won't let you sacrifice power, you need the SOCOM 16.

The rifle is very easy to clean and maintain. 
The bolt release button is in the bolt carrier area easy to get to with a small flat head so depress the button while pulling the bolt out. 
The rifle has very minimal damage to the wooden stock but nothing huge.

Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16's unique design. The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16"" Parkerized carbon steel barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory's forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A shooters have come to love and expect. If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won't let you sacrifice power, you need the SOCOM 16.

So you were thinking of getting a Mosin Nagant right? Then you think about how a standard rifle is going for $200+ (if you can find them). Then you have $20 shipping, $25 FFL charges, buy ammo ($149 for a spam can of it), and then you can't be sure of condition.

But wait there's more.... Then you got all the labor to clean all that cosmoline grease out of it and refinish or replace the stock. Then maybe put on a scope...etc.

OR OR OR....

YOU CAN BUY MINE! This rifle has had a thorough cleaning, stock refinished, and a scope mounted. It also comes with the scope, bayonet, reproduction sling, and 100 rounds of ammo.

All you got to do is buy it and then go straight to the range!

Scope is mounted by removing original sight which exposes the Mosin dovetail mount. The guns dovetail is used to attach rail to mount scope rings on. If desired the scope can be removed and original iron sight put back on. There was no permanent modifications made.

Gun passes the one finger bolt test. See it at the end of the video.

""The Traditions Pursuit LT Black Powder Rifle is a break-open muzzleloader that is lightweight making it ideal for hunts where there will be lots of walking. The break-open action allows for easy priming, produces a tight seal for ignition in foul weather and also makes cleaning easier. The Pursuit LT also features 2 safeties making it one of the safest muzzleloaders available. The first safety is built into the hammer and blocks the firing pin from igniting the primer when the trigger has not been pulled. The second safety is a cross block trigger safety just like the ones found on many rifles and shotguns.""

The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts.tem #: JMP8D25UPC_Code: REDACTED50Description: BTA PICO 380 DAO PST INOX 6RDManufacturer: BerettaModel #: PicoType: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: Inox Slide, Black Polymer FrameStock: Black PolymerSights: FT: 1-Dot RR: 2-Dot, Adjustable for WindageBarrel Length: 2.7Overall Length: 5.1Weight: 11.5 ozCaliber: 380Capacity: 6+1Action: Double Action Only# of Mags: 2 (1-6 Round Flush & 1-6 Round with Extension) Receiver: Black PolymerFeatures: Overall Width .725Overall Height 4.0Shop Denver Colorado Beretta Pistols"

This is a rather unique gun and was designed as a competitor to the MP5. It features a unique helical drum magazine. The carbine feeds from the top-mounted drum and ejects downward, similar to the Fabrique Nationale FN P90. The safety is mounted forward of the trigger guard and is ambidextrous, which, combined with the downward ejection, makes this carbine one of the most left handed shooter friendly designs on the market. It provides completely tool less dis-assembly. It is a pre-ban gun. It runs flawlessly and is in good condition with a very low round count it has been shot very few times. Lots of information about this gun available online at www.calicolightweaponsystems.com It has a telescoping stock that works perfect with the 50 rd and 100 rd mags It has a light or accessory rail above the fore stock A sling and the original owners manual are included BUT most of important of all THREE 50 RD MAGAZINES 2 NEW 1 used FIVE 100 RD MAGAZINES 1 used and 4 Brand New 2 of which is still in the box. The 50 rd mags are $118.00 and the 100 rd mags are $141.00 from Calico if buying them separate, SO YOUR GETTING $941.00 WORTH OF MAGAZINES without paying shipping from the company, So total it up and you will see that the price i am asking is more than fair for the package This being a pre ban model it is the one that is most wanted and does not have flaws like the ones produced after the ban.

I also have for it one additional 7rd, 8rd and 9rd magazine, all factory mags for a total of 5 magazines.  It comes with a magazine holster and a Remora pocket holster as well.  From the factory it also includes interchangable backstraps and extra fiber optic inserts, red or green (red is on it from the factory).

Included in price is almost 600rds of 9mm ammo, consisting of:
280rds Speer Lawman 124gr FMJ
75rds CCI Blazer Brass 115gr FMJ
97rds Federal 9BPLE 115gr +P+ JHP
95rds Federal HST 124gr +P JHP
46rds Speer Gold Dot 115gr +P+
Total: 593 rds

I bought the gun brand new about 4 months ago and it's been shot about 40 times.  The gun functions great and is small enough to pocket carry and honestly it shoots very well, recoil isn't bad at all and it groups the bullets nice and tight if you do your part.  I'm basically consolidating calibers and I'm getting out of the 9mm.  Ammo is new too, it's not old ammo, it was bought after I got the XDS.

All of this is would be around $700 new and that doesn't include tax or shipping.  I'm asking $600 for it all OBO.  Not looking to trade right now."

Also includes (4) 10 round magazine. I have a nearly impossible to find PREBAN 17 round magazine that I could sell with it for an additional $100

Very great gun.  Very accurate and reliable. Line of work requires me to only use/carry 40 S&W so this ones gotta go."

$575 - Romanian AK74 with a Tech Sight rear peep sight installed (over $100 alone).  Wood furniture with an upgraded Hogue pistol grip, bayonet, 5 polymer mags, and sling.  No cleaning rod.  This is in great shape overall, very few rounds through it.

$600 - Bulgarian AKS-74 parts kit (numbers match) with a US receiver and barrel, side folding stock, black polymer furniture.  4 mags and sling.  This gun runs great, but it is a used parts kit rifle so if you're the type of pansy who flinches at dropping your mag on the ground, you won't appreciate this.  If you like to USE your guns, and will appreciate the history of a gun that might've seen real combat, this is the one for you.

Either gun will come with 47 rounds of ammo and a soft gun case.  I can add 200 more rounds to the purchaser of the rifle for $35 more (that's almost half of what you can buy it for anywhere else, only 17.5 cents per round!).

E-mails asking what my lowest price is, if these are still available, or offering a trade I don't want will be IGNORED.  Prices are FIRM, and are the cash-only prices.  Trade prices will be higher if you're one of those who likes to make a trade after comparing each cent of your gun's ""value"".  For all you lowballers, the parts kit alone on the Bulgarian is $600 + S&H before adding in a receiver, barrel, and build costs."

In vulnerable places this pistol can save your life, here is more than one place this pistol will save your life as well as other places especially at night when you are alone.

Like all North American Arms Mini-Revolvers they are covered by a lifetime warranty against defects in material, workmanship and repairs as long as you pay for the parts used or labor. 

I have had this pistol for for over 10 years and have only used it in my back yard shooting skunks and troublesome squirrels. It is still in excellent condition.

Safety feature: 
As with every North American Arms Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. 
Using the original half-way notch cylinder in between chambers, (See picture #two for the notches, you will also notice the firing pin which rests in the notch) the hammers firing pin may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge.

It also has a second safety feature with the hammer puled back to the first click, (see picture #one) this keeps the hammer away from the cartridge."

All steel, precision made in USA by Matrix Precision Parts"". Visit the Matrix website and watch a video showing how to remove the front sight with this special tool. I had my front sight off in less than five minutes. NO DAMAGE to the weapon or original sight! This puller is made to pull the sight off a Ruger Mini-14 pre 2005. My model is series 197. I'm going to give you some dimensions of the tool because I believe it will pull more than just a Mini sight. With the main pull screw all the way out and the puller insert installed there is 2.25"" of clearance. (see photo) If the distance between the front of your barrel and the back of the sight are 2.25"" or less the puller will fit. The ID of the puller insert is 5/8"". If your barrel OD is 5/8"" or less the puller insert will work. (see photo) The nipple at the end of the bolt is 3/16"" in diameter. If your barrel ID is 3/16"" or more the puller will fit. The OD of the nipple support is 9/16"". This part rests on the end of the barrel.  I would assume one could add a flat washer over the nipple if the barrel opening were more than 9/16"". I used this tool one time. Hex wrench is included. I found it hard to believe that my local so called gunsmiths did not have this tool in their box. They were ready to use the ""Cave Man"" method and whack away at the sight with a block of wood or they wanted to cut the original sight off with a Dremel.  ""Come on man""!! All questions welcome.  Will ship, you pay.

It has some spot rust damage that does not affect functioning (I could not take pictures of it, though I tried). This gun does not appear to have been fired much at all. It is stamped ""22LR"" and will NOT feed anything but .22 Long Rifle, though it will fire and eject other types of rounds. It jams when trying to feed Shorts and Longs but otherwise runs like a champ. It is stamped ""Interarms"" so was imported sometime before 2000 or so. It was made without any form of safety, and is a very solid little gun.
These rifles go for surprising prices on gunbroker. I am posting this ad in order to sell it with less hassle than gunbroker requires, but after a week or so I'm posting it on there at a higher price than this."
