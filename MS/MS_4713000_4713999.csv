Can Take the verse off very easily if your not into that. 700 for everything. Will consider hand gun + cash trade. Obviously I'm not gonna ask for a decent top end even used handgun plus 300 unless it's a beat to sh*t one. I'm pretty reasonable. Maybe a decent 9 or 40 even a .45 no highpoint, phoenix arms, lower brand junk. Make me an offer worst I'll say is no thanks and goodluck. Text REDACTED.

*Brand new in sealed manufacturer packaging*

*Please Note: a recent determination letter by the ATF declared that the Can Cannon could be considered an SBR or AOW if attached to a lower receiver. X-Products is currently engineering a simple workaround; however, in the meantime it is YOUR responsibility to understand what this means and how it may or may not affect you. We are not responsible for any misuse or legal issues caused by your actions.*

The Can Cannon is a patent pending launching device for soda cans and other heavy, thin walled objects. A proprietary gas ported barrel and pressure tube reduce the exposure to high pressure gasses which could destroy relatively delicate projectiles. The Can Cannon is currently configured for launching full, un-opened 12oz soda cans. When used with standard mil spec blanks and fired at an optimum angle it can reach an average distance of 105 yards!

Why launch soda cans instead of drinking them? Because you can! Projectile options are only limited by your creativity and local laws. The BATFE approved design is not considered a Destructive Device or firearm. Each unit is sold as an assembled upper with receiver, headspaced and mounted ported barrel, and pressure tube. The system is compatible with any AR-15 mil standard bolt and most piston bolts. Enjoy X Product's no-hassle lifetime warranty.

Well where do I start, here's the list of upgrades:

FAB LTD 5 setting dual adjustable bipod 
Firefield 1.5-5x adjustable scope with laser and illuminated crosshairs (red or green)
Streamlight TLR-1s solid/strobe toggle or hold weapon light
Aftermarket Muzzle Brake (can't remember the brand)
4 Translucent P-Mag Kits (NOT ASSEMBLED!)
Magpul polymer handguard

The gun is almost entirely polymer aside from it's accessories and the internals of the upper receiver, it's extremely lightweight. It is chambered in 5.56mm so .223 can be used as well. The barrel is 16"" of 4150 chrome-moly steel with a 1/9 twist rate. The rifle also has a palindrome serial number which I've always found entertaining. It's in great condition and has been well taken care of. Comes with the case and 150 rounds as well. I have more pictures of it if you would like some. Asking $900 OBO for everything.

Give me a call/text if you're interested!
