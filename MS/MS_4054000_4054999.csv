M16 Full Auto Style for increased mass and lock time. Our new BCG is precision machined from 8620 Steel with a shot peened bolt manufactured from Carpenter 158 and Magnetically Particle Inspected. The entire carrier assembly is NiB, Electroless Nickel Boron coated with the patented, advanced UTC EXO process, unlike standard NiB coatings. This offers extreme lubricity with a friction coefficent of .04 and surface hardness of 68-72 Rockwell C.
The carriers patent pending design features unique shrouded and forward facing gas ports that have also been re sized so that gas is vented differently to a standard carrier. This results in a system that runs flatter with a smoother energy pulse. In addition the system also runs cooler and cleaner, there is also less pressurization of the upper receiver when running a suppressed barrel.

The flared boss at the tail of the carrier enhances the BCG’s lock position within the upper and makes it more consistent, resulting in an accuracy improvement. All critical dimensions are hard turned / ground after heat treat and the bore of the carrier and gas key have been hard chrome lined for the best possible wear resistance.

All E-BCG’s feature the LANTAC CP-R360 patent pending domed cam pin that is machined from 17-4PH Stainless Steel and hardened to H900 condition (45RC approx). The ultra smooth head reduces wear within the upper receiver. The BCG’s 11.7oz weight helps to increase lock time and smoother operation. Gas keys are properly staked at four points and only grade 8 fasteners are used in assembly.

It has a 24 inch extra heavy, fluted, free floated barrel, Competition 2 stage trigger, Hogue grip and bipod. The ejector is tuned and will drop all your brass inside a 2 square foot area too!
 It is zeroed for 100 yards with 5.56mm 55 grain ammo ( see orange target dot) and will shoot sub MOA groups consistently as well as hit a 1 foot steel plate at 500 meters all day long using the BDC 600 reticle. The photo looking through the scope at 500 meters is not very clear. Much better looking through it with your eye.
 It has a Nikon M-223 scope mount and a Nikon M-223 4X16X42 600 BDC scope on it and it is a perfect match.

I have a model 99 Savage lever action take-down rifle in great condition.  It has an 18"" barrel, and is chambered in .22 HP,  which is still readily available at most gun shops as 5.6X52mm (it's european designation).  
The rifle is in good condition for it's age, with much of the bluing  present, but also with some blemishes (nice patina).  I believe the furniture is original and in fantastic condition, although the butt plate has been replaced. The bolt is jeweled and beautiful, and the trigger & sear were polished and accurized.  The action is quite unique on these rifles, and very robust.  There is a brass rotary magazine that holds 3, with a really neat window in the side of the receiver that shows how many rounds are left.  The Rifle was made around 1912 or 1913, judging by the serial number.  The rifling looks bright and crisp.  The lever action operates and the rifle shoots well and it quite accurate.  It also has some period extras, like  flip-up Marbles sights and a Lyman peep sight.  

The rifle also is a takedown model, so it can be broken down into three components with no tools, the longest part being 20"" long.  The joint between the barrel and receiver locks up very tight, with no play when assembled.

The .22 HP round is still quite popular in Europe, and is one of the first high-power .22's on the market in the early 1900's.  Ballistically it is superior to the .223 Remington, but less than the 22-250.  In the early days of the HP, some almost magical shot results with large game were reported, making the new round the perfect dangerous game round.  Then some hunters were eaten by their wounded quarry, and the round fell out of favor in the US.  Around the same time, some higher performance .22 caliber rounds hit the market domestically.  But the round continues to be popular in Europe, and is quite effective for game up to deer size (although keep in mind that  currently .22 caliber, no matter what the power, is not legal to hunt deer with in WA State). 

Out of state shipping is available.  For local sales, I also have about a half box of commercial ammo, and some spent brass.

For a 100+ year old rifle, it is in wonderful condition, and it ready for your collection or next hunt!

Price is firm, and I am not interested in any trades at this time.  

Thanks for looking, and have a good day."

This weapon cycles perfectly whether you run cheap, expensive, brass, steel, handload, etc. 5.56 or .223 ammo!!!

The majority of the upgrades were purchased directly from www.HKParts.net. The upgrades that have been completed to this Century Arms C93 (HK93 Clone) rifle include:

 - Duracoat in HK Grey

 - Used HK93 Retractable Stock, A3 (Latest Generation) - $199 - These are $578.95 new

 - New HK Bolt-Rollers (bolt has a very nice 0.17 Bolt Gap) - $11.95 each (2 total)

 - New HK Recoil Spring and Rod Assembly - $79.95

 - New HK ""SEF"" Trigger Housing - $99.95

 - New HK German All-Steel Bipod (NOT a knockoff or contract bipod) - $399.95 - YES, thats $399.95 from HK Parts that are now back-ordered.

 - An Original HK Bayonette that mounts up very nice and true - $99.95 for a ""new"" one, and $49.95 for a used one

 - Original HK 40 Round Aluminum Magazine - $65

 - HK U.S. Made Polymer 20 Round Magazine - $25

 - A New Aftermarket (but VERY solid) UTG optics claw-mount with Picatinny rail and inexpensive Red-Dot Optic w/ QD mount that works well - $110 for both

This is NOT a plain factory Century Arms C93, but since it's not 100% HK parts, I must list as an HK93 Clone. This weapon is built using true HK, Century Arms and military surplus parts. This features a fluted chamber for reliable cycling and a roller locked delayed blowback system. The receiver and 16.25"" 1:9 twist barrel are U.S. made and shoots very straight with the original sights mounted true and straight. Please email, call, text or contact me thru TGT for detailed photos and any further information you may require. My cell # is (919) six two seven-3776, and I'm located in the north San Antonio area.

This rifle can be purchased with or without the genuine ""HK German All Steel Bipod (for HK G3, 91, 93, 33)"". Cost for the rifle WITHOUT the bipod is as listed, and cost of the rifle WITH the bipod is $149 more...making it $999.00 total.

I'm not in a need or hurry to sell this, so please send serious inquiries only. The only trades that I will consider are AR (or other ""black-rifle"") platforms chambered in .300 AAC Blackout.



If you've ever wanted an HK93 5.56, but have never wanted to spend almost $4k on one, this is the closest you'll get for a fraction of the cost. This is a very clean and true shooting weapon sytem that won't let you down in any aspect. This weapon has been lightly used and fired (under 100 round count) and does have some very slight blemishes, but this is not far from being a ""brand-new"" weapon. 



Thank you for looking!

Trying to downsize some, moving and want to cut down on some of the costs.  I've listed the specs for each 

1) Up for sale is my Blackhawk Down clone rifle. I built this rifle over the past year, and have fired probably 60-100 rounds through it. The FA & dust cover were removed so I could finish out another project, but are ordered and should be here tomorrow. I can install them or can give to you to install if you want (buyer's preference).
Specs are as follows:
-Anderson Manufacturing lower
-DPMS lpk
-Commercial 4 position buttstock w/N-Style buttstock (Commercial as well)
-FN A2 upper (FA and dust cover not currently installed, on order and will be receiving tomorrow0
-LoneStar skinny 6 hole handguards (painted to match the buttstock and A2 pistol grip)
-Palmetto State Armory 1/7 16"" NATO MP CL marked barrel (500 rounds through it)
-PSA (Toolcraft marked) BCG & Doublestar CH
-Colt side sling swivel 
-Nylon silent sling
Can include the SureFire 6P set-up for additional cost. Sell includes one magazine

Buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale with all their pertinent information on it (I will as well). Both parties will receive a copy of the bill of sale. Asking $600 OBO

2) I have for sale one Aero Precision A2 upper with a FN marked 20"" barrel on an Aero Precision lower. Built this rifle when I was stationed out in WA, since you could find Aero Precision parts easier out there. The complete upper was bought off AR15.com EE from member out of CA, I only added the rails and switched charging handle. Previous owner only put around 600 through it, and I've maybe put 400. Just have other AR I'm shooting more so trying to downsize. 
Specs are as follows:
-Aero Precision lower
-CMMG lpk
-Damage Industries H6 buffer, spring, end plate, and receiver extension (heavier buffer to compensate for rifle length barrel)
-MagPul CTR buttstock
-Aero Precision A2 upper
-FN marked 20"" barrel 1/7 twist with A2 flash hider. Does have a yellow front sight post to allow to see better
-Double star bcg
-BCM Voltor medium charging handle
-MagPul grip
-KAC rifle length rails w/MagPul XTM hand stop and 2 KAC rail panels
-Blue Force adjustable sling

Buyer must be legal to own and possess firearms, show proper ID, and be willing to sign a bill of sale.  Asking $735 OBO.

3) I have for sale one Ruger Old Model Single Six in .22LR. Holds 6 shots, and is single action only. I am not the original owner, I received this in trade from a family friend, I would love to keep it but promised the old lady I would downsize some. The grips are not original, those were cracked many years ago and were replaced by custom made ones (I forget what type wood) prior to me getting it. Pistol does have some nicks (see pictures), but still locks up nice and tight. Just trying to most accurately represent it and be honest with potential buyers.
According to the serial number, this one was made in 1959. 
Buyer must have either NC concealed carry or valid pistol permit (I will have to keep permit), and be willing to sign a bill of sale (each party will receive a copy). This is non-negotiable, so please don't ask me otherwise. Asking $340 OBO, not interested in trades or shipping at this time.


Best way to reach me is through phone (text is the quickest) at REDACTED. If you email me, please give me some time in order to respond back because occasionally emails get routed to junk.

The action is tight and smooth, as is the trigger. It feels perfectly balanced and would make an excellent primary or backup carry gun.

This model has been in production, in one configuration or another since 1899 so, they must have done something right.

I know the price is up there but once there are banned thats it, they are gone forever. This is exactly that same price if not less than major retailers such as Cheaper Than Dirt and others. This is a reasonable price especially given the price increase for other banned rounds such as 7.62mm Chinese Steel Core, 5.45x39 Russian 7n6 or 30-06 M2 AP which goes for about $5 a round if you can find it."

Chosen by U.S. special operators as the next generation assault rifle platform, the MK 17 provides the range, reliability, accuracy, safety, ergonomics and modularity to meet any operational challenge. A selective-fire, semi- and full-auto 7.62x51mm NATO rifle using a short stroke gas piston, the MK 17 can be quickly configured by the individual operator in just minutes for close quarters combat (CQC), tactical and long-range engagements. Unlike many currently fielded 7.62x51mm rifles, controllability under recoil is a hallmark of the MK 17, allowing the operator to readily engage targets with multiple well-aimed rounds. The MK 17 has been tested and fielded with U.S. Armed Forces. It adds the same innovation, modularity and adaptability as the MK 16, only in a larger caliber.

This is the ""mid sized"" M&P that has the 4"" barrel. I have shot it a few times, and it performed flawlessly. Included are 2 - 10 round magazines, back straps, and case. The only reason that I am selling this great pistol, is the .45 is
a little more caliber than I care to shoot at my age.
Payment may be Cash, Postal Money Order, or a Bank Cashier Check. I may ship depending on your location, any shipping must be to your FFL person/dealer. Shipping costs to add approximately $25 depending on location.
Thanks

Information from High Noon on this holster:

The Split Decision is a Stocking Item and is a non molded holster. This leather gun holster is constructed of thin premium grade cowhide and allows the wearer to completely conceal a small to medium size pistol or revolver without wearing a vest or other outer garment over it. This holster is worn inside the pants for superior concealment and features combat grip accessibility, necessary for speed when drawing. The Split Decision is exactly like the Hidden Ally except for the 15 degree forward cant and the Split Decision rides higher. The recommended carry positions to wear this holster are 3,4,5. This inside the waistband holster requires only a tucked in shirt for concealment, and is designed for those who cannot consistently wear a concealing outer garment. A leather extension allows the wearer to tuck his shirt completely over the weapon and holster. The only visible part of this holster is the belt clip. Weapon access is accomplished by pulling the covering shirt up with the weak hand and drawing with the strong hand. It features a tension screw for adjustment of the draw, open muzzle design, 15 degree forward cant, and an all steel clip that locks onto the belt or most pants.The black clip against a black belt fools the eye, you can barely notice it. The leather is just thick enough to provide the right amount of padding, and thin enough that it just kind of dissapears.This is the closest thing to wearing no holster at all. Its that thin. Because of the thin leather it does not support one handed reholstering. Available in right or left hand. Black finish only"

This listing is for a Ruger 10/22 Takedown version, unfired with papers, factory mag and carry case

I purchased this new about four years ago. It has been kept in a safe, unfired since that time. The original Owner Warranty card is present and not filled in.

Right now you can buy one of these on Gunbroker for $299.00 (that’s the cheapest I can find; others are more expensive), plus pay $30 shipping, plus whatever fee your local FFL requires for the transfer and filling out Form 4473. You can go through that process, or pay at least $350 after tax at a local gunshow.

Or you can buy this one, today for $275.

You must be 18 or older, produce a CHL or TDL, be a legal owner, non-felon, and sign a Bill of Sale that I will provide.

Price is firm. If I receive no ‘I want it’ responses, then clearly I will need to lower the price if I want to sell it. I will do so if necessary. And if you see this listing, the gun is still available.

And folks, if you don't have the money and or need to ask your spouse, for the love of all that is holy, be adult enough to repress the urge to say ""I'll take it""; you'll save us both a lot of time as you dance out of your commitment for the next week.

I am really easy to deal with if you honor your commitment. But over the last month, far too many of you guys have said ""I want it - please hold it for me until Saturday""...and I've done that, only to be told Satudrday that a) your wife is unhappy, b) your daughter is in the Emergency room, c) your car engine blew up, d) well ""something came up"".

So here's the deal: If you commit, then call me Saturday morning with some weasley excuse because you don't want to drive from Katy, then I'm going to add your phone number, email and name to the top of this listing.

Do we understand?"

All specs for these pistols are still up on the Sig Sauer website although these are no longer being imported.  

From Sig: The SIG SAUER P210, the timeless pistol of the Swiss Army, is once again in production by SIG SAUER GmbH in Germany. This historic gun features the same precision and reliability as its ancestors, but also offers a number of modern improvements.

The slide, machined from solid billet stainless steel , now features a durable Nitron coating. An improved beavertail adorns the Nitron coated, heavy-style, carbon steel frame. The P210 Legend also offers an improved manual safety, internal drop safety, side magazine release, and custom wood grips.

The return of the SIG SAUER P210 Legend will now ensure that many more shooters will be able to enjoy one of the world’s most accurate and legendary firearms.

No BS - This pistol will make a great shooter out of anyone!  Trigger is light and crisp.  Slide to frame fit is precise and feels like its on ball bearings.
