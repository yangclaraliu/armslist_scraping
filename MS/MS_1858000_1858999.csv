A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

D2 STEEL

D2 is sometimes called a ""semi-stainless"". It has fairly high chrome content (12%), but not high enough to classify it as stainless. It is more stain resistant than the carbon steels however, it has excellent wear resistance. D2 is much tougher than the premium stainless steels like ATS-34, but not as tough as many of the other non-stainless steels. The combination of great wear resistance, almost-stainlessness, and good toughness make it a great choice for a number of machete & knife styles.

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

D2 STEEL

D2 is sometimes called a ""semi-stainless"". It has fairly high chrome content (12%), but not high enough to classify it as stainless. It is more stain resistant than the carbon steels however, it has excellent wear resistance. D2 is much tougher than the premium stainless steels like ATS-34, but not as tough as many of the other non-stainless steels. The combination of great wear resistance, almost-stainlessness, and good toughness make it a great choice for a number of machete & knife styles. 


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

This is very similar to the Hibben Expendables Legionnaire Bowie, I designed my knife over 2 maybe 3 years ago. Mine is larger being about 17"" overall. Mine was designed for ""real"" use as a fighting life saving knife! Yes I would stake my life on the knives I make. Like I always say if you want a wall hanger - ""SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET A DAM POSTER!"" The Hibben Expendables Legionnaire Bowie Specs for comparison;  14 3/4"" overall. 9 1/2"" 7Cr17 stainless mirror polished blade. Black micarta handle with mirror finished guard and pommel. Leather belt sheath. 

BE CAREFULL!

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.

D2 STEEL

D2 is sometimes called a ""semi-stainless"". It has fairly high chrome content (12%), but not high enough to classify it as stainless. It is more stain resistant than the carbon steels however, it has excellent wear resistance. D2 is much tougher than the premium stainless steels like ATS-34, but not as tough as many of the other non-stainless steels. The combination of great wear resistance, almost-stainlessness, and good toughness make it a great choice for a number of machete & knife styles.

Her heart is set on a 9mm/.380 and my hands have never fit a Glock the right way. Price is pretty firm because of the rarity of this color combination on the Gen 3. Installed are a set of Trijicon Night Sights(not factory Glock). Does not include factory plastic sights as they were torn up during installation of the Trijicon's. This gun is a 98% gun all day long and has seen almost no use. You can see in the pictures that the slide parts still have the Gold factory coating on the parts.

MP5 clone. Very nice. Has ambi plastic lower, paddle mag release and 3-lug barrel. Includes one magazine. I can probably swap that straight mag for a curved if you want. It's just what I had handy when I took the pic. Gun is in really great shape. The only mark on it is on the side as you can see in the pics. That happened in shipping and I never got it redone. I've put probably 200 rounds through it to break it in and test it with my SWR Trident9 suppressor and it ran great. Very nice suppressor host. My plan was to just register it as a SBR and put a collapsible stock on it but I never have. Too many things to do....

I'll throw in the American Tactical mount and NCStar red dot I had on it to play with. There may be small marks where the mount touches the receiver...but that happens on all HK type guns that use claw mounts. 

Price is $1400. It's a handgun so I'll need a permit or a CCW and a bill of sale. FTF around Charlotte but I do get around to Raleigh and other areas for work. Only trades I'm interested in are Beretta 390/391 in 20 gauge, Remington 1100/1187 in .410, 28 gauge, or 20 gauge....maybe a nicer 1911 or a Colt Defender. Some trades would require some cash."

And As Close As you Can Get To the REAL ONE THAT - DENZEL WASHINGTON (ELI) Used in The Movie.

NOTE: THESE ARE HAND MADE I ONLY HAVE 4 LEFT OUT OF 10 
I WILL DROP THIS ADD IF SOLD LOCALLY BEFORE ANY BIDS.


DESCRIPTION

MEASUREMENTS

Overall Length = 27.00 Inches

Blade Length = 20.00 Inches

Handle Length = 07.00 Inches

Blade Thickness = 1/4” FULL TANG DAMASCUS STEEL

Includes: Heavy Duty Leather Sheath 


BLADE

BLADE: HAS A VERY SHARP EDGE!
The  ¼” Damascus blade is made with 1084 steel and 15N20 Steel 
Hand forged to Beautiful Damascus steel Pattern.
Hardness of blades will be 56 to 59 HRC
Hand sharpened to an Extremely Sharp Edge. 
Blade Has Five Holes same as the one used in the movie! See Movie Pictures! 

 SHEATH  

Includes: Heavy Duty Leather Sheath with Belt Loop and (3) Loops on the back of the Sheath so you can use on your waist or shoulder (Included a 64” Belt that can be used as a Shoulder Strap)


BE CAREFULL!

Most of these machetes you see on the net are made as a Stainless Steel “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off! But when and if you need it, you  can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know you’ll still be alive if you do!


Watch Out For The Con Artist Companies Out To Make A Buck!

So many places tried to adapt what they already made or had in stock to simulate and just plain out lie that it was the same as in the movie. One of the biggest misnomers I have found is that everyone now thinks the center hole on the blade is larger! It is not – Look at the movie pictures they are all the same size! Once again trying to use what they already had in stock. The handle was not just a thin layer of leather, it was thick. Mine has wood base then leather wrapped and fits very comfortable in your hand.  Last but not least you get what you pay for. If you buy a $30 machete because “it’s Cool Looking” just remember how cool looking it was before it broke when you needed it most. And when it lets you down I hope and pray that your Life doesn’t depend on your cheap “Wall Hanger!”


A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.

Damascus can be made with performance and/or aesthetic objectives in mind. Aesthetically, the choice of materials is important. One shiny steel and one darker steel etch out to show the most striking pattern. If the maker is going more for beauty than performance, he might even go with nickel, which is bright but does not perform as well as steel for cutlery applications. The other factor affecting beauty is of course the welding pattern. 

The following steels will provide bright lines:
1.) 15N20 -- nickel content   
The following steels will provide dark lines:
2.) 1084

Damascus and Carbon Steel knives do require some extra care.
There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	Damascus is very easy to clean up if rusted but seems to be rust resistant. Sometimes Damascus gets dark with age. To brighten up the blade, sand it lengthwise with a worn piece of 600 grit sand paper. This just hits the raised portions of the etched pattern and makes the blade look brighter.

•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.

And As Close As you Can Get To the REAL ONE THAT - DENZEL WASHINGTON (ELI) Used in The Movie. 

DESCRIPTION

MEASUREMENTS

Overall Length = 27.00 Inches

Blade Length = 20.00 Inches

Handle Length = 07.00 Inches

Blade Thickness = 1/4” FULL TANG D2-STEEL

Includes: Heavy Duty Leather Sheath 


BLADE

BLADE: HAS A VERY SHARP EDGE!
The 1/4” D2 STEEL

Hardness of blades will be 56 to 59 HRC
Hand sharpened to an Extremely Sharp Edge. 

Blade Has Five Holes same as the one used in the movie! See Movie Pictures! 

 SHEATH  

Includes: Heavy Duty Leather Sheath with Belt Loop and (3) Loops on the back of the Sheath so you can use on your waist or shoulder (Included a 64” Belt that can be used as a Shoulder Strap)


BE CAREFULL!

Most of these machetes you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know you’ll still be alive if you do!


Watch Out For The Con Artist Companies Out To Make A Buck!

So many places tried to adapt what they already made or had in stock to simulate and just plain out lie that it was the same as in the movie. One of the biggest misnomers I have found is that everyone now thinks the center hole on the blade is larger! It is not – Look at the movie pictures they are all the same size! Once again trying to use what they already had in stock. The handle was not just a thin layer of leather, it was thick. Mine has wood base then leather wrapped and fits very comfortable in your hand.  Last but not least you get what you pay for. If you buy a $30 machete because “it’s Cool Looking” just remember how cool looking it was before it broke when you needed it most. And when it lets you down I hope and pray that your Life doesn’t depend on your cheap “Wall Hanger!”


D2 STEEL

D2 is sometimes called a ""semi-stainless"". It has fairly high chrome content (12%), but not high enough to classify it as stainless. It is more stain resistant than the carbon steels mentioned above, however. It has excellent wear resistance. D2 is much tougher than the premium stainless steels like ATS-34, but not as tough as many of the other non-stainless steels mentioned here. The combination of great wear resistance, almost-stainlessness, and good toughness make it a great choice for a number of machete & knife styles. Bob Dozier is one maker who uses D2-steel. Benchmade Company has begun using D2 in its Axis AFCK also.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	Damascus is very easy to clean up if rusted but seems to be rust resistant. Sometimes Damascus gets dark with age. To brighten up the blade, sand it lengthwise with a worn piece of 600 grit sand paper. This just hits the raised portions of the etched pattern and makes the blade look brighter.

•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.

BE CAREFULL!

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

The slings go over your head and one shoulder for 3 point carry and hands free positioning across your chest. They also work in normal 2 point shoulder carry for African or American carry. These slings are heavy duty 1.25 inch wide mil-spec Cordura nylon and are perfect for the weight of the rifle without being bulky.

Features:

The slings are 1.25 inch wide Mil Spec 55301 Cordura nylon strap material.

Front mounting is the sturdy HK style snap clip. Attaches to the OEM side mounted eyelet on the triple tree.

The rear mounting routes the main strap of the sling through the pin/slot in the butt stock. **Installation of this sling requires unthreading the rear buckle, routing the strap through the stock and then rethreading the strap and buckle.**

Both colors have black plastic buckles. See my other ad's for more sling models to fit your other favorite rifles

100% American made!

Please be aware, installation of this sling requires unthreading the rear buckle, routing the strap through the stock and then rethreading the strap and buckle. It will come assembled. I will include instructions, but know that there is some disassembly/reassembly work required. Adding any kind of quick release at the rear interferes with a good cheek weld and this was the best option for a quality fit.

If you buy one and like it please give me a positive feedback and I will return the favor.

Thanks for looking!! Let me know if you have any questions.

•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

BE CAREFULL!

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

This rifle was built for the price conscious user who is looking for a good quality and inexpensive AR15 style rifle for range practice and/or home defense. They were able to do so by changing some features that should NOT upset the majority of target shooting users out there. The barrel used is made in house – 16″ without m203 cuts, melanite coated inside and out, 1:8 twist rate, and 5R rifled. The 5R rifled barrel designs have been in use by Thompson Center, a S&W owned company, for a long time in order to produce an inexpensive and very accurate product. Those looking for a milspec rifle, this isn’t the one for you, but melanite has proven itself a durable, corrosion resistant, uniform coating that can be considered more accurate than chrome lining. Other differences on the Sport models include: an upper receiver lacking a dusk cover and forward assist, a lower receiver with integral enhanced trigger guard, LMT style removable rear sight and A2 style front sight, chromed gas key and bolt carrier and other standard A2 styled parts. For those budget conscious shooters out there looking for a rifle that offers good quality with a low sticker price, the M&P15 Sport rifle may be just what you’re looking for.

The rifle will come with one matching gold magazine (not the one shown in picture) with more available upon request. This gun will go to the highest offer after a week or two. These are very difficult to find. Similar rifles are selling for $5600 on gunbroker. That price is ridiculously high and I could not in good conscience sell for anywhere near that much.

I am selling one of my shooting buddies, my Savage .17 HMR. It has a heavy stainless steel barrel, a very comfortable Right Hand Thumbhole Stock, Savage's adjustable AccuTrigger, Swivel studs for a sling and a bipod, and a 5 round magazine. I polished out the floor plate around the magazine opening and the trigger guard as well because i think it made the gun look terrible. Now it looks far better than before. Other than that it is as I bought it brand new 2 years ago. it'll flip killdeer birds inside out, and it is a good snapping turtle gun when the fish aren't biting.  I used to shoot pennies at about 125 yards or so. The pennies were cheap targets. I am asking $375 for the rifle, but I will consider REASONABLE offers. Gander Mountain said if they were selling it that they would be selling it as a 95%+ condition gun. My number is REDACTED. Thanks for taking a look."

THE GOOD:
starts up every time and has over $2,000 in recent maintenance done on the car.(I have the paperwork showing maintenance) The front bushings were replaced and all 5 glow plugs have been replaced. Motor mounts and transmission mounts have been replaced
straight body
sunroof doesnt leak
no rips in leather or show of heavy use
all the lights work
windshield wipers work
all gauges work
Still gets 29 or so mpg in the city! 

THE BAD:
heater fan does not work, but heat still comes into the car once the car is in motion
sunroof does not open, 
wood trim is missing/rough in the front portion of the car
key for the door locks will not lock doors anymore, but the lock mechanism works just fine
the transmission shifts a little rough when the car is cold but once it warms up after about 5 minutes of driving it shifts fine.
its 30 years old, it has its quirks..

It breaks down in seconds without any tools and reassembles just as easily.  Broken down each piece is roughly 18” so it’s a perfect backpack or camping rifle that’s fully capable of getting the job done.  It only shoots 22lr (not 22 shorts or 22 magnums).

This rifle is NIB (New In Box) and is therefore in absolutely perfect condition.  I have 2 of these and decided to let one go.

These rifles have nice checkering on the stock and forearm with a high gloss finish and the bluing is quite nice too.  There is some light scroll work on each side of the receiver (sorry my picture is a bit blurry).

You load this gun through a loading tube in the stock (hold 11) and it ejects the empties out the bottom of the receiver. These were only imported by Interarms for a short period in the 80’s.

 This is the entry-level Stainless/Polymer Kahr 45ACP

 From the store...it comes with one magazine.

 I purchased 2 additional 7-round magazines and a Hogue Handall Grip Sleeve

 The purchase Price was $409 The Additonal Mags were $84.00 The Hogue was $9.00 And the concealment holster was $75.00

 The total on this pistol with ALL it's accessories was $577.00 PLUS TAX

 I am NOT looking to get retail! What I am looking for is a FAIR trade from another gun guy. I bought this as a backup and off-duty pistol. I put exactly 20 rounds of Remington Golden Saber ammo through the pistol. I discovered that I prefer a Glock 19 but I would take a Glock 17. (Gen 3 only)

 I will trade STRAIGHT ACROSS for a Glock 19 with 3 mags, or a Glock 17 with 3 mags. I can purchase either of those new from Glockmeister for $459.00 out the door with my LE discount (yes they have them in stock), but my wife has put a padlock on the checkbook, so I am in a position to trade rather than purchase. I am not interested in another type or brand of pistol. I specifically do not want a Glock 23 or 22. I have gone to 9mm and 45 only, and eliminated all 40 cal from my safe. I am ONLY interested in a Gen 3 Glock 19 or 17.


 This is a fair deal, neither of us are ""coming out on top"" or ""screwing the other guy"". I am not going to blow smoke up your ass and say something about this pistol is ""rare"" or ""custom"" or any other BP flipper bullshit like that. It is just a plain, functional, reliable, and accurate pistol. It's just not my preference. I thought I'd like it more than I do....that's not the gun's fault. I have BIG hands, and the Glock 19 or 17 platform just works better for my body mechanics.

 I live between Florence and Queen Creek, so I am willing to do the trade in the southeast valley.

Which despite what most think about Vulcan, they make a great poly lower (Kevlar). The people that cast poly (Kevlar) as junk. 1. Don't realize that all the pressure is handled by the STEEL barrel extension, if it wasn't, as in the the bcg didnt lock in to ""star""  the Aluminum would explode just the same as any composite component. 2. cast it as junk, but yet own something like a glock. 3. waste my time and theirs to tell me it would tear apart but have zero clue of the basic operation of an AR as well as the strength properties of composites vs aluminum...Because last time I checked Kevlar was stronger then 7075 Aluminum...What I'm saying is, if your not interested in the rifle then I'm not interested in debating with you. Thanks!

Oh and before anyone tries to argue the Kevlar statement, the lower composite structure is made of Carbon/Aramid. Aramid is Kevlar, so to be clear thats carbon fiber layered with Kevlar.

Metal finish is consistent, and free of scratches, dings, and discoloring. The bore is impeccable, sharp, and clean with strong rifling. The bolt action is solid, and the safety is tight.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

Rifle barrel is made by Walther Lother, which is a german made. Lower on rifle is a grizzly lower and has noveske internal. Buttstock on rifle is a ACE skeletal.  Rifle is tight and true and has been proven to shoot through 2 inches of steel like it was butter. Rifle has only had 10 rounds down the pipe.This rifle is for serious shooters. Barrel has been hand Lapped as well as been through a Kryo process. Lapping is a process where a gunsmith pours Lead lap into the bore and with abrasive paste and works from end to end finding tight spots and laps them smooth, this process increases accuracy of rifle. Kyro process is where they Kryogenically freeze the barrel and bring it back to room temperature slowly this process increases the strenth of the barrel and also increases its accuracy as well. Both of these processes cost me an additional $700.00 and is almost impossible to find smiths that will even attempt this work. I have reduced the sale price on the rifle and looking to make a quick sale on the rifle to fund my new rifle coming in. No trades accepted at this time.

Other info: Love this rifle, but selling it to consolidate calibers. I've shot between 500-1000 through it and cleaned it every time. The finish is a little worn (typical with the Arsenal finish), but the bore/parts are in excellent condition. With a scope, this rifle is extremely capable.

996,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1858996,For Sale/Trade:  CIVIL WAR .58 CONVERTED TO REMINGTON ROLLING BLOCK. RARE ITEM,"Matthews, Charlotte, North Carolina",$ 850,"Listed On: Saturday, September 28, 2013",Rifles,Ruger                                                                                ,357 Magnum                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"From the Great Grandson of a Civil War veteran who served with the Confederacy (I also got a signed letter from the Great Grand son to this effect along with his Great Grand fathers name so he may be located by Civil War historians). May trade for old farm tractor.

The story that has been passed down is that his Great Grandfather carried this actual gun in the Civil War and still bears the carvings of the Confederate Company he served in""A"" Company, as well as a cross for his faith.From the patina of the metal, burn marks on the stock and the fact that every mark or stamp that was ever on this rifle is totally worn off attests to the fact that rifle served this family faithfully for a long time through very rough circumstances before it was retired to family heirloom status (Great Grandson.says he has shot it though).

Since the date for a standard Remington R.B. did not match the Civil War time frame exactly my initial thoughts were that this rifle was an early production Rolling Block but I later found that the 15 to 20,000 rolling blocks issued to Union troops during the Civil War time frame were of a split breech design which this rifle is not.

I was not ready to give up though because the previous owner was 110% sure this rifle was carried by his Great Grandfather in the Civil War so a local Remington collector, who was kind enough to assist with his considerable knowledge assisted and we explored the only other option which would explain this mystery. 

After the Civil War some soldiers who survived took their original .58 caliber muskets and had them professionally converted by Remington into the fast loading and desirable Remington Rolling Blocks. By doing it this way they still retained the muskets original .58 caliber barrel ,sights, forearm and stock! It also saved them money of course. So I was instructed to get bore measurements since this would be the only way to support the family claims all these years.

When I measured the breech it initially came out to .50 cal and my heart fell, BUT after my insistence that I believed the Great Grandson did not make this up the local collector asked me to look for a sleeve that Remington would have installed into the Civil War musket modifying it from the original .58 caliber down to the cartridge type .50-70 it currently is.

I looked and YES, there is a sleeve. I got out the digital calipers and the outside diameter of the sleeve on this rifle is in fact the .58 

In light of that information that would explain why the Great Grandfather was able to say this WAS the rifle he carried in the Civil War. While at that time it was not equipped with the Rolling Block mechanism everything else including his carvings of the stock identifying his company and the cross appear to be all correct making this a very rare rifle that saw duty in the Civil War and was professionally converted by Remington while still retaining the personalization and history of the Civil War soldier who carried it.

Even without this almost lost history a basic Remington Rolling Block is a valuable and heavy hitting rifle (were used later on as Buffalo Rifles and in many many battles and wars literally all over the world) and if you research our National Historic Firearms Museum in the United States the Remington Rolling block was the very first weapon to start what is now over 5000 classic firearms.

Upon his fathers death the previous gentleman inherited the rifle and his now deceased Pastor (prior to computers) who had an extensive weapons library researched the rifle for several weeks before getting back to him. Even at collector prices back then it was valued at between $800 and $1500. I have been told that this is obviously a low value number after so many years, but as they say it is worth what someone will pay for it and I will be reasonable to a serious collector.

The Great Grandson said they have fired this ""cannon"" and that it did very well but I have no .50 cal ammo and if I keep it I doubt I will ever fire it. I can tell you the action is very strong, tight and confident feeling and while the stock is a tad loose the rolling block mechanism operates as it was intended to over 130 years ago so if you were determined I am sure you could call it back into service once again or just admire it for the piece of American history it is.

That is where we currently are on researching the rifle until I visit another expert. I really have no interest for additional muskets trades at this time(thank you for the offers I have received on those) instead preferring some higher end modern weapons (or World War II weapons) or a reasonable cash offer.

Please read this. If you do have a reasonable trade send all of it's information along with pictures. If you have trouble sending pictures please send the written information on your trade and let me know you are having problems with sending things and we can figure that out.

Also since I am not an expert and I value any information or even corrections as I work towards getting this to a qualified collector who can display it properly and enjoy it for years to come."
