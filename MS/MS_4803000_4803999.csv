This allows the unused gas to exit from the front of the gun, rather than the sides of the gas block, resulting in a more quiet operationPosition One is for normal operation with standard and some military ammunition.Position Two is for use with hotter loads such as military ammunition.Position 3 is for suppressed use when running standard ammunition.Position 4 is for suppressed use when running hotter loads.An ""X"" position allows for removal of the gas plug for annual maintenance.Smooth Recoil ImpulseA floating piston head, detachable for charging handle replacement, is attached directly to the operating rod, which in turn is securely attached to the carrier. With only one moving assembly, the PWS long-stroke piston system offers a lighter recoil impulse, while at the same time providing increased longevity and durability."

Bought this shotgun about about 6 months ago. It's only been to the range 2 and I've never brought it out into the field for a hunt. It's got about 80 rounds down the tube, so it's not even broken in. It will come with the original paperwork, the choke it came with, choke wrench and whatever else I can find.  I'm only selling it because I don't shoot it enough to keep it. As you can see I've only take it or a few times in the months that I've had it. You pay for the FFL transfer. It's a great gun and it's practically new. Cleaned every time I used it. Loaded with features and a great shooter. Shoots 2 3/4, 3 and 3 1/2 12 gauge shells. I can move around a little to help out with the transfer. The price is firm."

With the rifle comes a full box of 100 – 50 grain Proxen pellets, plus some other pellets in the tubes that came with a couple of the bullets. The #10 Percussion cap was not hot enough to reliable fire the powder pellets. 

The #10 nipple has been replaced with a #11, and there are two #11 nipples still new in pack along with a new tin of the hotter #11 Percussion caps (might be 8 or 10 missing). 
There is a real powder horn however it's just for looks. I never made it functional because I used the pellets.

I bought 3 different weight bullet and sabots. My wife's uncle has seen Elk on his farm so I have 10 – 300 grain HP.  There are 11- 250 grain copper jacketed lead HP bullets. An 12 new in pack, I beleave 200 grain, powder belt bullets, these have a plastic tip to help the bullet expand.

Other accessories include a Thompson Center black powder cleaning kit for 50 cal. There is also a new in box knife from Smokey Mount Knife Works, that has plastic handles and a fake Damascus blade.  I had thought I would replace the handles with deer horn and make a sheath from deer hide, again for looks. Ha, two years and it's still new in the box.

The rifle, cleaning kit, powder horn and knife I keep in an Allen came soft case with reinforced handles, made for a scoped rifle. The power, bullets, caps etc. I keep in a surplus mag satchel, I use for a possibles bag.

Just guessing I'd say I have $150.00 to $175.00 in the rifle (sights, etc). And probably $200.00 (more or less) in the accessories.

I bought this case used with the intentions of modifying it for my crossbow (like photo 8). Later I discovered the case was missing the arrow holders, the bow tie downs and one latch, I had to order those from the factory. 

While ordering the missing parts I also got an extra piece of foam. 
I have installed the arrow holders and two of the latches but not the bow tie downs.
Just to be honest I did not like the thoughts of having to remove the limb from my crossbow every time I put it away, so I'm trying to sale a couple of my bow cases so I can get a crossbow case. 

The Plano bow case and the extra foam, tie downs and latches are all thats for sale, all other items are just for illustration. I've seen these advertizes from $69.00 to $120.00 with out the extra foam. 

Asking $50.00

The Finns took a basic M91/30 rifle and redesigned it to maximize it's potential. The barrels are approximately 3 inches shorter than the M91/30 while being beefier and well rifled. It was engineered to maximize the 7.62x54r round efficiently utilizing the powder for maximum effectiveness while more fully stabilizing the bullet in flight. As a result these things are just accuracy personified and if you think your M91/30 rifle is accurate just wait until you pull the trigger on one of these. The sights are greatly improved, the stocks are more ergonomic and user friendly, and the triggers are enhanced. Heck even the magazine has been improved to ensure smooth and efficient feeding of the rounds up into the chamber. Condition - We are listing these rifles as Good - Very Good, and overall they are quite nice. However, whenever you deal with a group of surplus, there is always a best one in the bunch and a worst one in the bunch with all of the rest being somewhere in between. Many of the rifles will have varying degrees of bluing wear, or some mottling of the color on the metal. Also, while some of these have wood that is really nice ( with the exception of light storage marks which is common to almost all of them ) , other stocks may have dents, dings, discoloration, or even some slight cracks in the wood in either the butt stock or the hand guards.For more information or to order online click>>>finnish-m39-vkt-mfg-mosin-nagant-762x54"

The Finns took a basic M91/30 rifle and redesigned it to maximize it's potential. The barrels are approximately 3 inches shorter than the M91/30 while being beefier and well rifled. It was engineered to maximize the 7.62x54r round efficiently utilizing the powder for maximum effectiveness while more fully stabilizing the bullet in flight. As a result these things are just accuracy personified and if you think your M91/30 rifle is accurate just wait until you pull the trigger on one of these. The sights are greatly improved, the stocks are more ergonomic and user friendly, and the triggers are enhanced. Heck even the magazine has been improved to ensure smooth and efficient feeding of the rounds up into the chamber. Condition - We are listing these rifles as Good - Very Good, and overall they are quite nice. However, whenever you deal with a group of surplus, there is always a best one in the bunch and a worst one in the bunch with all of the rest being somewhere in between. Many of the rifles will have varying degrees of bluing wear, or some mottling of the color on the metal. Also, while some of these have wood that is really nice ( with the exception of light storage marks which is common to almost all of them ) , other stocks may have dents, dings, discoloration, or even some slight cracks in the wood in either the butt stock or the hand guards.For more information or to order online click>>>finnish-m39-sako-mfg-mosin-nagant-762x54"

This beautiful Combat Masterpiece has the coveted Carbonia blued finish that is  in 95% condition. Unfortunately it did not come with the diamond checkered magnas. On the plus side I dressed it with a new pair of Ahrend Mordadillo Retro finger groove grips. They have never been on this revolver when it was fired, new means new. The trigger action on this M15-2 is what has made this one of the most popular ""K"" frames in the S&W line in my opinion. A blue S&W box come with this offer

For Shipping Buyers: A flat rate $40 shipping fee for CONUS. FFL to FFL. My FFL ships USPS Priority Mail, fully insured. Your firearm will ship the day following the receipt of payment. The only means of acceptable payment is a USPS POSTAL MONEY ORDER, no exceptions. My FFL ships Mon.-Fri with a noon cut off. Your firearm will ship in a Allen gun case with a desiccant to counter any moisture related problems. This revolver comes with the original S&W blue box but no papers.

Please check out my other listings. I also have another M15-2 with the original grips not listed, target hammer in similar condition. No box or papers, but a fine revolver.



*Note: Ammo can not be applied to shipped sales. Thank You

Price:$585 FIRM, If the grips don't appeal to you I have a pair of checkered magnas, (NOT DIAMOND CHECKERED MAGNAS) as it should have been wearing when I purchased it. They are in great shape and I can send photos. With the checkered magnas the gun would sell for $525 FIRM. Thanks for looking.

Once the weapon is holstered, it ""locks"" into place, providing an extra measure of security from the standard open top holsters. A simple straight draw is possible once the ALS is de-activated by your thumb while obtaining shooting grip. IDPA approved.

Additionally it features suede lining to help protect the gun's sights and finish. Its SAFARILAMINATE structure with wraparound design provides the strongest design combination available.

Its built on a WW2 Springfield receiver, barreled with a CBI CM .308 10 twist barrel. Brand new American Black Walnut stock, semi-fancy with a hand rubbed finish. .062"" NM front sight, brand new NM op-rod, NM trigger Job and NM rear sight. All new stock hardware and fresh DGR parkerizing. Barrel has been fire-lapped as part of an extensive precision rifle barrel break-in procedure. And has since had appx 300 rounds fired. I have been out to 700 yds with it confirming rear sight adjustments, which are spot on with properly spec'd ammo.

It also has a Garand gear ported gas plug installed to protect the gas system from damage, and a proper leather M1907 1 1/4"" wide rifle sling. Would also come with a few en-bloc clips.

This rifle shoots amazingly and is completely reliable. I have the CMP certificate of authenticity on the original rifle used to build it from, as well as the DGR build sheet. 

This rifle would sell on DGRs website for $2000 or so.

Its not an original NM Garand, so its not worth Original NM Garand $ of well north of $2500. But it does shoot just as well if not a little better.

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."

This Colt is top shelf all the way...I just do not have the time to shoot it and want to sell to someone that does. It has the Colt heavy chrome lined barrel (HBAR) and  is capable of incredible accuracy. It comes with the original 10 round magazine as well as a brand new Magpul 30 rounder. Also includes a nice, sturdy bi-pod, the original manual and the thick padded case that I bought with it. The rifle is a flat top but has the removable handle with it (the A-2 sight set up) Handle can be removed easily and an optic added for better long range accuracy...has been shot less than 50 times. The barrel is a 1/9 twist rate, which can stabilize the heavier match bullets and can shoot either 223 or .556 rounds. Thanks for looking."

I do a lot more collecting & trading than I do shooting anymore.  Comes with the original box with owner's manual.  Because of the scope's matte finish, you can see some of the ring marks on the underside of the scope tube, but no dents or scratches.  Scope rings were not overtightened!  If you've dealt with me before, you know that I'm meticulous with my gear, so this scope was well taken care of.  4-plex reticle is basically a duplex.  This is a real Redfield, made in Oregon and owned by Leupold.  This is a completely different scope than the crappy Revenge line of scopes that are made in the Phillipines.  Most people would rate the scope between a Leupold VX-I and a VX-II.  This is an outstanding mid-range scope and will add a classic look to your rifle.  I can meet at Walmart or downtown Greeneville, whichever is closer.  I'm out in the boondocks of south Greeneville so I don't mind driving a little bit to keep you from having to drive way out here.

The MEPRO 21 provides instant, all-light aiming capability, without batteries. Designed through close collaboration with Israeli Special Forces, the MEPRO M21 is battle proven, simple to use accurately and totally reliable.


MEPRO 21 offers a large 30mm diameter lens which allows rapid target acquisition with both eyes open. This was the first reflex sight in the world designed for close quarter combat, and it can be ordered with optional reticles – dot, triangle, open-x and bullseye.


Illumination of the aiming point is achieved by a fiber optic collector system during the day, and by a miniature self-powered tritium light source at night. Transition between the two systems is instantaneous and automatic to assure good contrast between the aiming dot and the target area.

 

The MEPRO 21 reflex sight offers users the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open.


The MEPRO 21  is also designed to work in tandem with a magnifying scope like the

MEPRO MX3 - mounted behind it for ultimate accuracy."

Gun is clean as a whistle. I detail strip and deep clean every time I got to the range. Gun looks bright and clean as day it was purchased. 

With it you get the full Glock box: gun, 2 9 rd mags, loader, cleaning rod and brush, all ppw and test cases. 

You also get a couple extras and an upgrade. I am including a 13 rd mag for a total of three. Great back up mag for carry for a total of 23 rds on your person should shtf. 

Also you get an extended mag release and I'll include the original should you want to change it back.

Lastly, if you've ever had Glock knuckle you'll appreciate the undercut trigger guard.  Just like Hickock45 did with his personal 27! It is much more comfortable and gives you a very secure grip. I also slightly rounded the extended mag release to take off the sharp corners and make more comfortable for carry.
