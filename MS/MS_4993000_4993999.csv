It was made in 2011 by Remington to commemorate 100 years of the 1911. It is a beautiful pistol with scroll engraving on both sides, front and rear of the slide. This pistol has just under 100 flawless rounds through it. I consider it a semi-collectible gun and so mostly it just sits in my safe. I have added a nice matched pair of stag grips but I still have the custom Remington grips that came with it to include. If you Google Remington R1 Centennial you'll get all the info on this pistol. Mine is not the one with the unattractive gold banner on the slide it is the more common of the two with the engraving. It comes with original case and paperwork, unused 1911 tool, take down tool, 2 original mags (I could add mags for right trade), original custom Remington grips and Stag grips. This is a beautiful tribute to the original 1911 with a few upgrades to make it run better than the original ( lowered ejection port, match grade barrel w/polished feed ramp, brass bead front sight ) I was not considering parting with this until I saw a S&W Governer w/Crimson Trace grips on here and tried to make a trade but it didn't work out so I thought I'd see if I can trade for one like it or something else I want. I'm not selling at this time but I place a value of $1100 on it with the stag grips and $950 without the stag grips OBO. We each pay for our own background checks and transfers. Yes, I have to transfer this pistol. You can email me through armslist or text me at 3o3-9Otwo-563o Thanks for looking!"

Unfortunately he never got to use them after an unexpected cancer diagnosis just 7 short weeks before he lost that battle. 

Retail on these binoculars is $279.99 but you can frequently find them at Bass Pro Shop for $249 plus tax, and sometimes Cabela’s at $229 plus tax (see links below), so I’m pricing these at an even $200.  

I also have the Vortex 8x25 monocular, retail priced at $69 (plus tax) for sale for $50 in another listing.  You can purchase them individually, or both together for $240.

If you know optics, you know Vortex are top of the line and that they have unsurpassed customer service, including their industry leading lifetime warranty, so there is no risk to you. 

I’m in town for the holidays visiting the in-laws, so please text or call me (text preferred) at REDACTED to schedule a time to see these high quality optics for yourself. 

VORTEX DIAMONDBACK 10X42 ROOF PRISM BINOCULAR
Superior quality, high-performance hunting optics can find their way around your neck for a surprisingly affordable price. The smooth focusing 10x42 Diamondback binocular takes you to the fine details you prize. Taking its lead from the Diamondback rattlesnake, this rugged binocular is striking in how well it detects life in low light. Look for a huge field-of-view—the largest in its class— with enhanced fully multi-coated optics, phase-corrected prisms, waterproof and fogproof construction, soft tapered eyecups, and rugged rubber armor. It's all there in a Diamondback. Now you can use ""wow!"" and ""thank you"" in the same sentence.

I am selling my Connecticut Valley Arms - Bobcat in .50 caliber. As you can see in the picture the muzzle loader is a percussion cap firing style. I have only shot the gun a couple times and there was a significant delay (3 to 4) seconds between trigger pull and firing so I believe the firing system needs to be thouroughly cleaned or replaced.

An aggressive scale pattern provides the ultimate magazine grip in dirty or wet conditions. A bolstered floor plate is set flush to eliminate the BattleMag from catching on other magazines or creating unnecessary bulk when stacked or pulled from a pouch. The reinforced feed lips and anti-tilt follower do not require a clamp to keep the feed lips from spreading when kept loaded for extended periods of time. Made from improved Troy proprietary military-grade, chemical, biological and impact resistant polymer and extensively tested by Special Ops units, the Troy BattleMag outperforms all other polymer magazines in functionality and reliability. Includes a flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate lock – a $5 value. Available in Black AR-15, AR15, Magpul, Troy, Magazine, Magazines, Pmag, 223, 5.56,"

The Troy BattleMag® is the best polymer magazine in the world – hands down. The BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416® and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. An aggressive scale pattern provides the ultimate magazine grip in dirty or wet conditions. A bolstered floor plate is set flush to eliminate the BattleMag from catching on other magazines or creating unnecessary bulk when stacked or pulled from a pouch. The reinforced feed lips and anti-tilt follower do not require a clamp to keep the feed lips from spreading when kept loaded for extended periods of time. Made from improved Troy proprietary military-grade, chemical, biological and impact resistant polymer and extensively tested by Special Ops units, the Troy BattleMag outperforms all other polymer magazines in functionality and reliability. Includes a flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate lock – a $5 value. Available in Black

If you buy my pistol all you will only pay a total of $17.00 for all fees, $10 transfer and a $7 background fee = $17.00.

If you buy this pistol online you will have to pay the shipping fee before it is shipped, when arrives you will need to pay the transfer & background fees at the FFL of your choice.

Safety feature: 
As with every North American Arms Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. 

Using the original half-way notch cylinder in between chambers, (See picture #two for the notches, you will also notice the firing pin which rests in the notch) the hammers firing pin may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge even if dropped on a hard surface.

It also has a second safety feature with the hammer puled back to the first click, (see picture #one) this keeps the hammer away from the cartridge.

I have had this pistol for for over 10 years and have only used it to shoot skunks and troublesome squirrels here in my backyard.  

All North American Arms Mini-Revolvers are covered by a lifetime warranty against defects in material, workmanship and repairs as long as you pay for the parts used or labor. 

I sent it in for a new cylinder bolt, it came back to me with a new cylinder bolt and an upgraded notched cylinder with no charges to me for labor or parts."

This car was completely wrapped in cellophane for years and years and stored inside a barn in western Kansas. Has the fireball v6, I am not sure if it is the original engine or not(hopefully will find out soon). Put a battery and new alternator, distributer, it and it fired right up. The car needs a new paint job I spent about 5 hours buffing it so it looks pretty good in the pics, and there are a few areas of rust on the passenger side, but can be easily repaired. The interior is in great shape, the drivers seat has a couple minor tears along the seam making it an easy fix.  The back bench seats are in very good condition as well, their is some minor cracking on the very top. The top is in very good shape, no rips, stains, opens and latches with no problems. I believe some mice chewed through the wires because the brake lights are not working. The tires are bias ply tires and seem to be in good condition. The odometer shows 3500 miles but i'm sure it's probably rolled over although the odometer works fine right now. Overall this car would be an excellent car to restore and these do not come up that ofter. I am not a mechanic by any means, if you have any questions please ask them  and I will do my best to find out for you. If you would like me to take more pictures of something, or video please let me know.  $7000 obo"

I am not selling this ammo because I want to, I am active duty military and I’m PCS moving overseas in a couple months. I am unable to take any ammo with me and it would cost too much to ship. I can still either shoot the ammo before I leave, or leave it with friends and family. I have priced all my ammo online and it’s factory, so no low ball offers please. I am not interested in any trades at this time, cash only please. I may check for counterfeit bills. I am LE and CCW holder, I will also have backup close by. In light of recent events, if I get a bad feeling about you, I won’t be selling ammo to you PERIOD. You must be legally allowed to purchase and possess ammo to contact me."

I have TWO lifetime ambassador memberships to front sight firearms training facility. 
This is the highest level they offer on their website. Feel free to check it out here:

They retail for a pretty penny on their website, but I started low and ended up upgrading several times over the years (spending thousands of dollars per upgrade) getting all the way up to ambassador level. 
They are easily transferable into your name and can even be transfered to a third party later on if you please. 
The Ambassador membership offers all of the following classes free of charge, and is good for life! Go as little or as much as you want!

For sale is my side folding long range Ak 47 in 7.62 x 39. Bought the gun new then put close to $750 in accessories on it, then put it in safe. Maybe 500 rounds at most through it, which is why I am selling it it just simply never gets shot (my ARs always seem to make their way to the range leaving no room for this). It is in excellent condition and shoots great and was cleaned recently top to bottom. All factory parts, box, and owner's manual included, so it could be converted back to factory stock configuration in minutes.  It is a model CenturyArms GP 1975 Sporter.

The Bone Steel Arms M4 style stock assembly is awesome (150 dollars by its self) and the magpul ctr with cheek riser and enhanced rubber butt pad (100 dollar value by itself) really makes this a nice unique AK 47 which has a rock solid adjustable stock. The stock locks to the left side so it can be shot with the stock folded. To buy everything needed new today would cost close to $1200 (see the breakdown below) and who knows a year from now maybe double that. 

I am asking $750.00 for the package including factory box, manual, all factory parts, and all aftermarket parts. I will require a bill of sale be filled out and signed at the time of transfer. Additionally an FFL transfer will be required preferrably at Guns Priced Right in Dravosburg (about 20 min from from downtown Pittsburgh), but I will meet the buyer at any FFL within 45 minutes of Pittsburgh (or maybe further depending on location as i travel for work), as long as such FFL is willing to do a long gun transfer between individuals. Therefore, the buyer will be required to pass a background check, and the buyer will be responsible for the $25 dollar transfer fee at guns priced right or the fee required at any other agreed upon FFL. If the background check/FFL transfer is an issue please do not inquire in to purchasing (I am a lawyer and know full well this is not required under PA or federal law, however, I will not sell a gun without the an FFL doing the transfer for liability reasons).

No doubt about it. This gun is a dynamic full-sized 9mm handgun capable of extraordinary accuracy known for its proven dependability. The P226 is in service with numerous agencies and is currently used by the Navy SEALS. SIG makes numerous versions of the P226, but this one, in my considered opinion, is the best. The P226 Tactical Operations (TacOps) is a typical P226, with a couple of significant upgrades. The result is a gun that’s functionally ergonomic, fast out of the holster, and faster on target. And when it does run dry–after you’ve run through the 20 rounds in the magazine, the mag-well makes it that much easier to feed. Includes 3ea 20 rd mags and holster."

The design takes the operating system of the Armalite AR-18 and moves the pistol grip forward in a manner similar to the British SA80. Instead of the sheet metal receiver of the AR18 and SA80, the Bushmaster M17S uses an extruded 7075-T6 aluminum receiver that serves as the stock and foregrip as well.

Operation is a short-stroke fixed piston system that is self-compensating. The rifle is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO and accepts standard M16/AR15 magazines.  Bushmaster discontinued production of the M17S in 2005.  

Even though discontinued, parts and accessories can be obtained from K & M Arms.

This model has already been modified to a low profile for optics rail and easier charging handle access."

The M11-A1 is a compact version of the Sig P-226, just 7.1 inches long and only 1.5 inches wide. The Navy SEALs and Special Boat Teams consider it a favorite, and use it as their standard carry pistol as it is small, light, durable, accurate and easy to conceal. The M11 is a recoil-operated, semi-automatic pistol that fires a 9mm NATO round in both single- and double-action modes. Upgraded with a stainless steel slide and a Short Reset Trigger, the M11-A1 variant features the same phosphate coated internals, SIGLITE® night sights and MIL-STD UID label of the standard-issue M11.

Produced to the exact same specifications as those which have been the official sidearm of the Navy SEALs since 1986."
