Info below from http://www.keltecweapons.com/our-guns/pistols/pf-9/

The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from Kel-Tec's highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

Here is the description from the products website:

When the situation demands fast shooting, a big scope with a narrow field of view just won't cut it—choose the StrikeFire red dot and shoot with both eyes open. With unlimited field of view and eye relief, nothing gets you on target faster than this tough, compact red dot scope.

Optic has option for both RED/Green Dots.

Red or Green light option lets you switch colors, and adjust the dot intensity (diameter of 4 MOA), according to the surroundings and viewing conditions.

Unlimited eye relief allows for quick target acquisition.

Parallax Free Past 50 Yards.

Optical 2x doubler provides for more detailed viewing.

Waterproof and fog proof with nitrogen purging for reliable work in harsh weather.

High recoil caliber rating—tested with .375 H&H Magnum for 1000 rounds.

Asking $650 obo, but have no idea what its worth. Prefer cash, but will consider trades for something different. Nice 12ga, rifle, pistols - what do you have (no junk)? Also would trade for USA Gibson or Fender guitar + cash if necessary (no Epiphones or Squires)  

Note:  Rifle was given to my friend to commemorate earning his Eagle Scout award. HIs dad embedded an engraved brass plate (you can no longer read) which pretty much ruins the rifle for collection purposes. He sold it to me back in '89 (I think) for college tuition. See pictures.

Currently, I cover it with a a custom leather sheath - makes it look pretty cool. I've only put about 15 rounds through it in all these years.  Am entertaining all reasonable offers.

I have plenty of ammo for it, but really only wanting to trade right now, if I have to sell, then it will be $39 per 100 new brass rounds, and .75cents each for any of the hollow points.  If cash offer is at the $550 mark, I will toss in 50 rounds of good brass FMJ ammo.

Package value is nearing the $700 mark towards trades, and am OK with a straight trade, depending on what it is. Also open to cash offers, no LESS than $550 WITH EVERYTHING as I am not listing this for profit like many folks that list here; nothing at all wrong with the XD, just wanting a G23 for uniformity (I may be a little bit type ""A"")."

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

This load is flash suppressed, so firing it in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo in the loadings whenever possible as over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20D utilizes a very hard cast 150gr. WAD CUTTER bullet. The bullet is made hard, so it won't deform or mushroom. It cuts/crushes a ""cookie cutter"", full diameter hole in human flesh just like it does on a paper target. It penetrates deeply (roughly 14 to 16 inches in human tissue) and its full diameter profile maximizes blood loss as it cuts and crushes (not slips or slides) its way through tissue. Although I've never been shot with a full profile wad cutter bullet, I must assume that the initial impact of that wide flat nosed bullet, is crushingly formidable. As a teenager, I took to the woods on a regular basis and killed many a critter with heavily loaded 38SPL wad cutters'. The effect of a full profile wad cutter on small game was obvious and amazing, compared to regular round nosed bullets. That flat nose, literally hammers living things. These bullets are hard and properly lubed and will NOT lead your barrel. Note my velocities from real world ""over the counter"" revolver s- NOT TEST BARRELS!

The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

Modeled after the FNP-45 service pistol introduced in 2007 under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol with highly enhanced ergonomics. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX™-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

Very low miles and in excellent working condition.  This not a DRMO piece of junk.  All service records included and it's road ready and titled as a classic in WA.  NO CDL required!  Insurance is less than $100 per year!

I purchased this years ago off of ebay and have had it completely restored and gone through by professional mechanics who use to work on them in the military.  I have had this on a two 1400 mile road trips and have used the winch to resover a stranded school bus which was sliding off the side of the road.  Since it's a 1971, I had it licensed as a classic so you won't have to renew tabs or pay taxes ever year.  

Cover, slats and cover are all in excellent condition.  You will not need to invest a penny into this rig.

I also have ammunition for sale along with the firearm for extra costs if you need. It took me forever to find ammo for these guns but I do have ammo available IF you purchase my firearms. Thank you.

The guns im selling have a lifetime warranty through Gander Mountain, but im not sure if its transferable. 

PS: DO NOT contact me if you do not have a NYS Pistol permit. I do not care how much money you will give me or if its cash, I will not sell ANYONE a firearm without the proper licenses. IF you are OUTSIDE of NY State and want to purchase the gun then there will be a $75 extra fee which is what Gander Mountain is charging to have it shipped to a FFA dealer... These are the only options so please don't ask for anything else!"

The Taurus JUDGE is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their personal protection. Capable of chambering both 2-1/2"" 410 shells as well as 45 Long Colt Ammunition, this amazing combination gun is ideal for short distances, where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the 45LC ammo. It has finely tuned rifling to quickly spread the shot pattern in close quarters or to guide the 45 Caliber bullet straight to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, Red fiber optic front sights, and Taurus Ribber Grips, the JUDGE is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

The guns im selling have a lifetime warranty through Gander Mountain, but im not sure if its transferable. 

PS: DO NOT contact me if you do not have a NYS Pistol permit. I do not care how much money you will give me or if its cash, I will not sell ANYONE a firearm without the proper licenses.

The gen 4 is an awesome firearm with interchangeable backstraps to fit your hand as you wish and the new double spring slide action is surprising on how much it does reduce the recoil and the action of rechambering a round brings you back on target with a lot more comfort and ease. 500 for the gun-550 with 100 rounds of ammo
I will consider trades in 40, 9 and 45 or a nice .357 Da/SA only...not interested in cowboy action and 3 inch barrel preffered on a revolver. Also would consider a governor, 410 revolver. Check my other listings as I do have a brand new unfired gen 3 19 as well for sale for 500.
The new grips feel great with the stipling, the larger mag release is nice to have as it feels like you can drop the mag from most angled grips and easily push it in. I put 35 rounds through this with the 3 15 round mags it comes with, as well as box, manual and 4 backstraps to change grip size. Not a single issue in the 3/4 box of ammo through the gun so far. I shot this after shooting my gen 2 and even with my hands damp from the heat outside the new grip felt like it was glued to them from the factory stipling  and did not budge. I can only imagine how great it will feel once broken in after how nice it is new. Check my other listings as I have a brand new unfired gen 3 19 up for sale as well.

I just have been shooting my gen 2 for years and put thousands of rounds through it and it is what I am used to and obviously could not ask nearly as much for it. It is also a gun that has become close to me with never failing through all of those rounds"

Expected turn around time is 2-4 weeks depending on size of order. We are willing to do rush orders as an Upgrade to our Standard Services.

NON ap, incendiary and NO destructive devices-- regular ammunition only.

I have the entire business built and a customer base waiting for products.

All load developments are in place, all processes are defined and repeatable.

Multiple product lines are developed to the point of needing packaging and a shelf to sell from.
retail sales may be possible from this location, but not likely as wholesale accounts will account for 90% of sales before anything is even built.

Start time for this enterprise is 6 months until first production run. All inspections and licenses must be in place including insurance coverage before sales can proceed.

please contact me if you would like to be involved in this project.

I have laid all the appropriate groundwork-- I only need a location to start producing.

The space i currently have is not big enough to move forward and I need a landlord who is interested in having this type of business existing on their property.

Would you like to have access to a facility that makes ammunition all day long?"

Reason for the new motor, the early triton motor has aluminum heads and had shallow threads for the spark plugs. They were known for ejecting spark plugs out of heads while driving. Ford never did a recall on the early motor, however in their later models the fixed the problem. Well, my original motor did just that, the spark plug ejected at 70mph on the highway. Instead of fixing the cylinder and risking it happening again on a different cylinder, I opted to purchase a new motor where the issue was resolved with all the cylinders. This motor was built by the same company who builds the for ford and summit. It came with a 3year 100,000 miles warranty. It has a couple more months on warranty. This is a strong running motor, plenty of power. Has been filled with Amsoil signature synthetic since new. Changed ever 4-5k miles. Trans has roughly 35k miles since rebuild, also filled with Amsoil. All fluids are Amsoil and xhanged regularly. It is a limited so it is loaded, leather, , tow package with traiker brake,3rd row, heated seats, heated mirrors, cd with disc changer ,  after market exhaust with flowmasters, weathertech floor mats, bug deflector window visors .

Will consider trades for motorhome, smaller truck, truck/ rv combo, truck/boat combo , atv, or?"

We can think of a million reasons to add this highly regarded pistol to your belt, but for time's sake we'll just highlight our favorites. Like remarkable versatility. Non-stop performance. And your choice of models including: 9mm (12+1), .40 caliber (10+1), or .45 ACP (10+1 or 6+1 in a slimmer grip, single stack magazine sub-compact .45 at under 21 ounces). The Millennium PRO"" also features the same revolutionary Single Action/Double Action trigger and matching serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel as the 24/7 PRO, Heinie ""Straight Eight"" sights, an ergonomic grip design, enhanced finger indexing Ambidextrous Index Memory Pads"" and posi-traction slide serrations. Light, powerful and technically advanced, the Millennium PRO is the choice for concealment and back-up carry. Taurus Security System (TSS)s Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Loaded Chamber Indicator Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms. Heinie Sights Features the famous and genuine Richard Heinie ""Straight Eight"" Sight, using the rapid and accurate dot over the dot system Accessory Rail Features the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessories New Unique SA/DA Trigger System The PT24/7 Pro Trigger system solves the double action/single action dilemma once and for all. Figure 1 shows the trigger at full rest. When a round is chambered, the trigger sets in single action mode with the trigger traveling freely to the crisp break point shown in figure 2. The trigger resets to DA mode until another round is chambered.

Excellent- Like new condition, no blemishes can be seen.  May have something very slight.
Great-  Firearm looks overall great.  May have some light wear from holster use or slide use, a very small ding or two you have to look for to find, or hardly noticeable scratch.
Good-  Light wear and some visible scratches and wear.  Nothing usually alarming.
Fair-  Noticeable wear and bluing fading in some parts.  Scratches and dings are apparent but in overall working condition.
Poor-  Heavy wear, scratches, and dings from heavy use, may have some pitting and light rust.  Still in working condition but needs a gunsmith to check safe operation.
Junk-  Gunsmiths work items.

Quick Overview
The SP BAR Quad Rail offers a larger inside diameter designed to accommodate your suppressor or for those that like the feel of a full sized quad rail. At 1.8” inside diameter your suppressor easily fits inside and the cutouts on the rail aid in rapid cooling. The SP-BAR Features anti-rotation tabs, built in non-rotating QD sling mounts, scalloped rails that allow you to run without rail covers, hard anodize coating and super looks. The BAR is available in four different lengths, 7”(10.3oz), 9”(13.1oz), 12”(16.8oz) and 13”(18.6oz). Installation is a breeze using the standard USGI barrel nut wrench and ships with all mounting hardware.

I have a gen 3 g26 in flat dark earth.  Looking to trade for a FDE glock in either 19, 17 or 34 in gen 3 or gen 4.  If yours isn't FDE just let you know what you have.

Or possibly other gen 3 or gen 4 glock 19, 17 or 34 if it is a good deal.  I am NOT selling this for cash, only trading it.

The 26 had 25 rounds down range.  I am the original owner.  I only fired it to know that it works then put it back in the safe.  Which means it is in perfect condition.

It comes with everything from the factory.

I can send pictures via email or text.  I would like to see pics of your FDE glock as well.

Thanks,"
