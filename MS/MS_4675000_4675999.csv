Mine is brand new never fired…fully converted with all the bells and whistles and I’m only asking $1400. 4 years ago I almost spent twice that having it converted, if you love Russian guns especially in 308 don't let it slip by cuz this rifle is fine. I will ship too to your FFL if need be.
Just to address this question 
Because a low baller who was
Trying to get this for nothing had
The nerve to say that I botched this build because I pinned and welded the barrel.lol well I did that because I shorted the barrel down to the gas block than added the flash hider so I had a legal length of 17 inches for the barrel. Also I don't have enough room in the picture section so if you want more pics lmk but the stock folds as well.

Other than that this thing is ready to roll on just about anything. Has everything from the factory, mounts, screws, etc. except the scope caps.

I did at one point in time have this rattlecanned, I've since cleaned off about 98% of the paint. Regardless, the optic still works flawlessly and is waiting to be put on anything"

This Jeep has a yoke slip eliminator and the joints have been upgraded from ball joints to U joints. Aftermarket Smittybilt front and rear bumper with shackles. High-lift jack with hood mount.

It has a brand new Duralast Gold battery less than a month old with 5 year warranty (I taped the receipt to it so I don't forget I have warranty when it comes time). Upgraded all aluminum radiator. Brand new steering gears. This Jeep Wrangler has a Rampage frameless soft top with matching half door uppers. The interior has been completely redone the upholstery front and rear seats as well as floor carpeting. It has a soundbar, all 4 speakers are Rockford Fosgates and has a Pioneer deck with USB. It has a CB radio put in with a Firestik antenna and spring. This Jeep also has AC and blows cold! Heater also works. Window wipers were also replaced a few months ago. I will also throw in two 5gal Jerry gas cans.

If you are looking for something that feels like a Bentley this is not the vehicle for you. It feels like it's a lifted Jeep on off-road tires. That being said, if you are looking for something reliable that will take you literally anywhere your heart desires then this is the vehicle for you. Now for the bad. It has small scratches along the side of the body from bushes, and the paint on the hood and tailgate has oxidation. It has a very small golf ball sized dent near the grill. The rear main seal drips. This is a common issue on these year Jeeps, mechanic quoted 600 for parts and install. Mechanic also suggested new fuel injectors quoted 400 for parts and labor. These are the only ""issues"". Just had tune up so all spark plugs, cables, distributor cap, and air filter are brand new. The title is CLEAN and clear. Like I said this is my daily driver, and I take it on the highway it will do 80mph no problem, NO death wobbles. It is an off-road BEAST four wheel drive works perfect and gets into 4lo with ease!

The Kelly Blue Book lists the value of this as $5,481 in ""fair"" condition not including extras. I am asking $7,000 and think that is more than fair. I have priced this Jeep to sell and will not entertain low ball offers. If you text me with ""what is the lowest you will take"" before you even look at it do not expect a response from me. CASH ONLY no trades, no payments, no joy rides. Easiest way to reach me is text, number is show contact info and my name is Tim"

I have a VERY VERY nice sks with a ton of extras that you cannot pass on.  

I am interested in trades of all shapes and sizes!

I am open to trades - email pictures and the offer to me at REDACTED or text them to REDACTED

This is a Norinco SKS is very good condition.  The original wood stock pictured is in very good to fine shape with no carving or wear beyond light use.

This rifle was unused for 10 years - in a closet just going unmolested :)  It shoots straight and is very accurate.  The scope is mounted perfectly for good eye relief and is good enough for out to 200 yards - yes - it is accurate at 100 yards and more with a more skiled shooter than me behind it.  It has the pictured muzzle brake to cut down on muzzle jump and allow for faster follow up shots.  It also has a gas tube heat grill with the attached shell ejector to make sure the spent cases are not hitting the scope.  The length of pull is the same as other sks - which is to say a little short.  There is a PERFECT butt pad for $10 on Amazon.com I will point you towards unless you change it into the included Timbersmith stock that is already longer and has a built in recoil pad.  The Timbersmith stock is BRAND NEW and cost $145 - I even have the box!

I have:

1) the original 20 round internal magazine (less common than the internal 10 round magazine)

2) the original spike bayonet

3) the original bipod

None of these are installed right now and they are all included plus the mounting hardware for them.

It also comes with over $200 of aftermarket magazines.

(4) 20 round metal magazines

(3) 30 round metal magazines

(1) 40 round polymer magazines

When these are available they are $21-$30 depending on the website - they are sold out at cheaperthandirt.com which is the least expensive place to get them.

The rifle needs nothing to take it right to the range.

Before you write the sks off as not accurate pop over to youtube and watch this video 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c7ZTcNTC5s

Where he shoots targets with Russian steel cased ammo at FOUR HUNDRED YARDS!!

The rifle can shoot as fast and accurately as you can that's for sure.

There are pictures of the SKS Timbersmith black stock so that you can see how awesome this stock/weapon combo is - I have installed this stock and it looks and shoots so much better with it.

I have also purchased another $100 of Tapco magazines - all also included.
I have mush more than the asking price into this rifle and all of the accesories, magazines and stock so no crazy offers please.

Trades? I want firearms, bulk ammo or a nice android tablet in full or partial trade.

If it were up to me I would not be selling but the time has come and I need something with four doors. It is my daily driver and extremely off-road capable.

It has the 4.0 inline 6 motor with 186k on it (these engines are notoriously bullet proof and has plenty of life left). Automatic transmission. Both the front and rear axles have been upgraded to Dana 44's. This Jeep Wrangler has been lifted 4 inches and sits on 33x12.50x15 Goodyear Duratracs less than 6 months old. Wheels are Dick Cepek with offset. Also comes with matching spare. It has a spring/shock conversion (Savvy springs and Bilstein 5100 shocks), it has Rough Country control arms, Rancho steering stabilizer, quick disconnect sway bar and skid plates for everything underneath. This Jeep has a yoke slip eliminator and the joints have been upgraded from ball joints to U joints. Aftermarket Smittybilt front and rear bumper with shackles. High-lift jack with hood mount.

It has a brand new Duralast Gold battery less than a month old with 5 year warranty (I taped the receipt to it so I don't forget I have warranty when it comes time). Upgraded all aluminum radiator. Brand new steering gears. This Jeep Wrangler has a Rampage frameless soft top with matching half door uppers. The interior has been completely redone the upholstery front and rear seats as well as floor carpeting. It has a soundbar, all 4 speakers are Rockford Fosgates and has a Pioneer deck with USB. It has a CB radio put in with a Firestik antenna and spring. This Jeep also has AC and blows cold! Heater also works. Window wipers were also replaced a few months ago. I will also throw in two 5gal Jerry gas cans.

If you are looking for something that feels like a Bentley this is not the vehicle for you. It feels like it's a lifted Jeep on off-road tires. That being said, if you are looking for something reliable that will take you literally anywhere your heart desires then this is the vehicle for you. Now for the bad. It has small scratches along the side of the body from bushes, and the paint on the hood and tailgate has oxidation. It has a very small golf ball sized dent near the grill. The rear main seal drips. This is a common issue on these year Jeeps, mechanic quoted 600 for parts and install. Mechanic also suggested new fuel injectors quoted 400 for parts and labor. These are the only ""issues"". Just had tune up so all spark plugs, cables, distributor cap, and air filter are brand new. The title is CLEAN and clear. Like I said this is my daily driver, and I take it on the highway it will do 80mph no problem, NO death wobbles. It is an off-road BEAST four wheel drive works perfect and gets into 4lo with ease!

The Kelly Blue Book lists the value of this as $5,481 in ""fair"" condition not including extras. I am asking $7,000 and think that is more than fair. I have priced this Jeep to sell and will not entertain low ball offers. If you text me with ""what is the lowest you will take"" before you even look at it do not expect a response from me. CASH ONLY no trades, no payments, no joy rides. Easiest way to reach me is text, number is REDACTED and my name is Tim"

This over/under retails for $8000 so take advantage of this significant discount on a brand new shotgun! Original premium case, chokes and choke wrench included.

687 EELL Classic: Premium Looks and Performance:
The 687 EELL Classic is the top of the line of Beretta’s 680-series over-under shotguns. It features sideplates that act as extra canvas for the lavish hand-chased engraving, as well as a specially-selected walnut stock that gives it a true heirloom quality. But while it certainly figures well while on display, the Classic’s worth as a game gun is equally striking. Weighing about 7 lbs (12-ga version), and with the point of balance right at the hinge-pin, it is a shotgun that comes up naturally to the shoulder while still having enough of a lively feeling forward of the supporting hand. This is an over-under with the feel and allure of a classic, for the discriminating hunter who appreciates all the finer points of a perfectly-made gun.

Premium Hand-Chased Engraving, Stock:
The full sideplates of the 687 EELL feature a super-fine classic game scene, and are enhanced by intricately detailed motifs of branches, leaves and flowers which extend to the trigger plate, trigger guard and fore-end iron lever. The proportions of the engraving blend wonderfully with the dimensions of the shotgun, giving you the sense of a work of art within a work of art. The stock is a classic semi-beavertail, with premium-quality European walnut and a newly designed fine-line checkering. An oval brass shield, inlaid on the stock, will allow you to personalize your gun with initials or a family crest, while the handsome and durable carrying case will protect the shotgun for generations to come.

A Classic Choice for Hunting:
This shotgun will shine in any hunting situation. This is because it is built on a receiver that is equally strong and low-profile. The 687 action has two conical locking lugs at mid-height, meaning that it will always lock up strongly and positively while not requiring the extra bulk and weight for a top locking lever. This further means that when you bring it up to the shoulder, the vertical distance between your eye and your supporting hand is minimized: this shotgun will follow your sight easily and instinctively. And in spite of its beauty, the 687 action is noted for its strength, so this is a shotgun that you can confidently pass down to the next generation of hunters."

Parting with my favorite gun safe queen to pay for expensive auto repair. The extremely compact HK P7M13 can be drawn, cocked, and fired accurately, faster than any other pistol. With an overall length and width close to many .380 pocket pistols, the full-power 9mm P7M13 has a full-length four-inch barrel enclosed in its low profile steel slide.

The unique HK cocking lever allows the P7M13 to be carried safely with a round in the chamber, yet it is ready to fire by the intentional squeezing of the fingers around the grip. Releasing the cocking lever decocks the P7M13 immediately and renders it completely safe.

The P7M13 gas system retards the movement of the recoiling slide during firing and eliminates the need for a conventional locking mechanism or heavy slide. The low profile slide contributes to the balanced center of gravity and compact size of the P7M13.

Made of high-grade steel, the low profile slide keeps the recoiling mass as small as possible. Combined with the optimal grip angle of 110°, the result is a compact, accurate, and low recoil pistol well suited to civilian and law enforcement users.

Features: • Polygonal rifling for increased barrel life • Fluted chamber aids in extraction • All steel construction • Extractor also doubles as a loaded chamber indicator • Fixed barrel ensures accuracy • Trigger guard heatshield • Ambidextrous magazine release • Cocking lever control means complete ambidextrous function • Blued finish

 Now when doing research on this I was getting conflicting information on barrel length and rate of twist. I also have found that some are selling these claiming to be a DMR when they are not. All DMR's had the MAGPUL PRS stock - see large pic - if it does not have this stock it is not a DMR - per sig service.

 I am NOT looking for trades at this time, just wanting to thin out some of my rifles that I never fired and probably never will. If you are going to TRY and offer a trade, it will have to be an upgrade or trade and cash. but still will have to be an upgrade as I will have to turn around and try and sell what you have not been able to

 If you want the Sig soft case - that is an extra $100

 Don't insult me and I won't return the favor - price is FIRM - Just the piston system Upper with a 20 inch bull barrel is going to cost you $1600 alone - I looked it up - I do not need the money and I am in no hurry to sell ANY of my firearms."

From website:
EOTech's most popular holographic weapons sight, the Model 512 is perfect for people who want the best in close-quarters-combat speed and versatility but don't need night vision. The Model 512 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.

The Model 512 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. Other features include a 65 MOA circle reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 20 brightness settings. The Model 512 is compatible with 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails.

I bought it 3 years ago from Sportsman's Warehouse for use as a goose gun. I've taken it out for probably 5 hunts and shot maybe 200 clays with it total for it's entire life. Since I've hardly used it, it's in great shape.

I'm just not quite big enough to use it effectively - I'm 5'6"". Because the recoil reducer in the stock, I can't cut it down to my size. Shims are available for you to change the length, but I've already removed them all and it's still too long.
