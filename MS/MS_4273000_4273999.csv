From left to right:

1. Custom Shop Remington 700- Chambered in 300 Rem Ultra Mag, this rifle was made to order by Remington's custom shop.  It is not one of their pre-made custom rifles, this was made a few years ago when they would custom build an individual rifle.  Its one of a kind.  28 inch fluted, polished, stainless barrel, seamless muzzle brake, custom spiral fluted bolt, HS Precision aluminum bedded stock, all stainless surfaces are custom polished, custom trigger, the rifle alone was $3000 to order.  And it is topped with SWFA 20x SS MRAD scope with sunshade and killflash.  This is an amazing long range set up.  The 300 RUM is the most powerful 30 cal cartridge.  It will come with  RCBS reloading dies, 60 pieces of brass, an unopened lb of reloading powder, and half a box of nosler ammo.  I will sell the whole setup for $2700

2.  Springfield Model 1898 Krag Jorgensen- This is an all orignal Krag rifle and it will come with 85 rds of 30-40 Krag ammo.  Bore is very good, excellent shooter, a true piece of military history.  Has a small chip in upper handguard but it is still very solid.  I have a replacement handguard for it but I never put it on bc the chip is very minor.  $800 for gun and ammo

3. Remington 700 Tactical- 308, hogue overmolded stock, custom trigger, SWFA 16x SS MRAD Scope with sunshade and killflash. Barrel is threaded and it comes with a muzzle brake. I have regulary shot .5 MOA with this setup.  $1000 for the whole rig.

4. CZ 550 Mannlicher Stock- Brand new in box within the last 2 months.  Perfect condition.  Scope not included but will come with nice CZ steel rings.  Chambered in the very accurate 6.5x55 Swedish.  Comes with 80 rds of good ammo.  Has the fancy Bavarian Mannlicher stock.  Gun and ammo $800

5. Ruger 10-22 Mannlicher basketweave stock- Brand new just a couple weeks with box.  Only fired to sight in brand new bushnell 4x scope.  I just paid $400 for all of it.  Yours for $325.- includes scope

6. Pre-ban Colt Sporter Lightweight AR 15- This is a pre ban Colt lightweight.  Very hard to find and true mil spec quality.  Gun has less than 200 rds through it in its life.  Has original Colt 20 rd mag with steel follower.  Excellent shooter and very light.  Chambered in 223/556
$1400

I added it up and I spent over $7400 on all this within the past year including optics and ammo.  I would sell everything in a one time sale for $6400.  Call or text REDACTED or email is fine too.  I will drive or ship if needed."

I will personally draft and customize your N.F.A.firearms trust for purchasing such Class 3 items. A Gun Trust is a revocable trust, which you may revoke, or amend whenever you wish. No additional charge for up to an hour in-office, or telephone, consultation. As I will not simply be inserting names into a template, the usual turnaround time for completition is four (4) business days.  If circumstances require, for no additional charge, I probably would be able expedite the process to as little as 24 hrs.   Owners of Class 3 items should avoid relying on boilerplate forms, trust software, or trusts that are not drafted by an attorney, because they may not comply with the unique issues involving suppressors, silencers, fully automatic rifles, SBRs, and other Title 2, or Class 3 weapons regulated by the National Firearms Act (NFA). A N.F.A.Trust will allow you to: avoid Chief Law Enforcement officer sign offs; Avoid having to get finger printed; Avoid having to get photographs taken; Have the capability to file electronically; Allow more than 1 person to LEGALLY take possession and use your N.F.A.devices;and Streamline inheritance, and passing down of firearms to future generations. The majority of Gun Trusts are prepared for a total price of $250.00. Sure you can probably find an online $29.99 form, but having a trained chimp lawyer wannabee prepare your N.F.A. Gun Trust, if done improperly, can result in your firearms being confiscated by the ATF, a $250,000.00 fine, and your potential exposure to felony violations of the National Firearms Act. “Intent” is not a requirement for being convicted of a violation under the National Firearms Act. Contact Elliot Goldstein, Esq./J.& G.

Up for trade is a very nice colt 1991A1. I got this in trade from the orginal owner. It's in very good shape an comes as you see it pictured. The mags are 1 colt and 2 cmc mags, and 59 rounds of ball ammo. This finish is tough to photograph but you won't be disappointed. I would say the finish is %95 consecutively. Very little wear. 

As far as trades I am open but below are a few specifics. 

Ak-47 or ak-74 must be a good quality gun. A wasr is fine but I'll need cash with it. 

H&k VP9 depending on what yours comes with I'll likely need some cash.

S&W 357 or 44 mag revolvers (no rugers unless it's a clean security six, service six) 

M&p shield 9mm plus cash.

The glass is very clear and bright, fogproof and has hand-turnable adjustments. Held zero like a champ although it was only on a .22. Selling because I was not able to find mounts for another firearm and do not need such a nice scope on .22. The bdc is interesting if you use nikon's spot on app, just enter cartidge and bullet information and it will give distances for each dot in the reticle. Asking 100 because do not have the box any longer. Still have the lens cover and will throw in scope rings either grooved receiver or millet style. Feel free to email me if you require more pictures, or text seventhreefour 660 3163. Will not go any lower on price, sorry"

I would ideally like to trade for an entry level carbine AR 15 or an Auto Ordinance M1 carbine. 

The m44 is all matching serial numbers with correct wartime stock and sling. Blueing is 90%+. Barrel looks in good shape. Not quite mirror bright but not dark and no visible frosting or rust. I've never shot the rifle so it should shine up with a bit of cleaning and use.

The SKS is an all matching sino soviet except for the stock. The stock is the blond chu wood and is in nice shape. This is way nicer than the sino soviets being imported now with rust and cracked stocks. 

I value the m44 at $275 (that's what Aim Surplus was selling their last batch at)

The sks is valued at $375 (a very fair price considering folks want 500 for their tapco abominations)

Only trade I will consider is a Master Custom Carry in 5"" but may be swayed with a 4"" model.

Crimson Carry II: Practically NIB. I have only put roughly 50-100 rounds through it. Previous owner sent it to kimber to get the slide and recoil spring replaced because they rusted and have not had any issues since. Has the factory case and all the goods with 2 stainless Kimber mags. I may hold on to one for my next Kimber but will most likely include both just let me know if you want both included. Laser trace grips as well that are in perfect shape, laser is still bright. I have seen these going for anywhere between $900-$1200 so looking at $950 obo. Pretty firm on price but may be somewhat flexible.

Pro CDP II: Practically NIB as well. I have also only put about 50-100 through this one as well. This one does not have the factory case but still has a nice hard case. Not sure what came with it factory but I have a black non-kimber mag. This does not have the factory Rosewood double diamond grips but it does have a set of black hogue grips on it that imo actually may be better as they help to reduce the recoil on this gun. I have 2 Kimber pro tac mags that may be included as well if I get the full amount I want on it. Asking $900 for this one and pretty firm on this price.

Would like to keep it pretty close to Camby. Need to see DL and LTCH but no info recorded. Thanks."

Les Baer's Premier II© has become the industry standard to which all other factory or custom built 1911s are compared. The 5"" long Government Model (pictured above) is the best single stack duty, defense or competition pistol you'll find in America -- the best quality, the best value and the best performance. No wonder so many of them show up at IPSC Limited Class matches. The Premier II© is even guaranteed to shoot 1.5"" groups at 50 yards! We've sold so many in the USA and abroad, the Premier II© has become the flagship of our line. It performs like a million bucks but it costs a whole lot less.

Only 40 rounds fired through it.

For those desiring the ultimate in long range (1000 yard plus) accuracy and precision, with extreme requirements for strength and durability, the Chandler M40 Long Range Precision Rifle is in a class with very few peers. Many rifles can hold one minute of Angle (MOA) accuracy at 100, 200, or 300 yards. The Chandler Rifle has been designed with the purpose of achieving that level of performance at distances out to 1000 yards, day after day, week after week, even under the most miserable and demanding field conditions. It is a hardened field rifle that will hold zero through the worst of any situation.

The recognized standard of performance in long range military sniper rifles was the USMC M40A1. All other rifles strive to meet its level of performance and ruggedness. The Chandler Sniper is a custom rifle built to exceed the USMC specifications. All Chandler rifles are made by select USMC RTE armorers who realize that only by paying attention to the smallest detail will their products perform as required.

Starting with a Remington 700 Action, the Chandler Rifle also incorporates a McMillan stock, Hart barrel, high quality Leupold tactical scope with Mil-dot reticle, Iron Brigade Armory one-piece scope mount, Badger Ordnance M4 steel one-piece steel trigger guard, and all required accessories. The Chandler Sniper Rifle is chambered as a standard in .308 Winchester for the Sierra 168 or 175 grain Matchking bullet."

Mfg. 1943-44. This is a shooter, not a collector grade firearm.
The firearm is consigned to my shop and I have not fired it. It's a Blue Sky re-import and appears to be plenty serviceable with good bore and finish. The Cartouches have been removed from the stock.
The stock has a split under the receiver on the left side that has been repaired and pinned. You can see the former crack in the photos. There is a small bit of rust on the left side of the front sight. Otherwise it's a fine looking firearm. I had a local WWII firearms expert evaluate her and received a good report. Not all the parts are Springfield, but that shouldn't bother one who's looking for a shooter like Dad or Granddad carried in the ""Big One"". No, I'm not flowering up this add. I'd rather the buyer be pleased with his purchase than upset that gun was overrated. Personally, Id like to keep it, but I'm supposed to be retailer, not a keeper. Besides, I can't keep them all.

This pig slaying, nail driver is the bell of the ball on any hog hunt.  I built three total and this is my favorite combination.  My personal model has Troy pop up battle sights and a ACOG.  The key with this build is the heavy barrel with the offset of the B5 Bravo buttstock.  It has a nice front leaning weight which helps with recoil control for the second and third round. This is a perfect nail driver.

Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.     Key Features:  Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life Patented HK recoil reduction system One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel Corrosion resistant “hostile environment” blued finish Ambidextrous slide levers and Ambidextrous magazine release magazine Patented lock-out safety device Bobbed hammer (LEM models) Automatic hammer and firing pin safeties"

Excerpt taken from article: ""Most notable on the Centurion is the use of a machined receiver. That’s right AK fans, this a solid piece of machined steel—not your typical rolled sheet metal version. To commemorate this fact, a U.S. Flag is engraved into the receiver itself.""

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver."

Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""Zero-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a stainless steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine, and real windage adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. a steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, five pound DAO trigger pull.  
The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever.

This is basically brand new with approx 40 rounds through the barrel. I have everything it came with including Backstraps and 3 12 round magazines plus a Glock brand tactical light that mounts in front of the trigger guard and has an easy to reach on/off switch. This is my second Glock, but I am more fond of the SA XD's and want to sell this to fund my next purchase. Like I said, this is basically brand new and very clean with 0 scratches and has never been holstered. I would like to sell the Handgun and light together as I can't use the light on the XD's and will price accordingly. Taking reasonable offers. Full price offers include an unused 50 round box of Remington .45 ACP

General George Patton called the M1 Garand ""the greatest battle implement ever devised"" and this receiver was manufactured by Springfield Armory in 1943, so it probably saw action during the war.

Details for the rifle components are as follows: 

SA Barrel dated 1963
Muzzle Erosion 2
Throat Erosion 2
HRA Bolt
HRA Operating Rod
IHC trigger group

Stock shows wear in a couple areas on left side. Arsenal Number painted on butt of stock, Arsenal repair on the foremost handguard.  Receiver shows some minor pitting, and there is pitting on the barrel bands which are easily replaced if you want newly parkerized pieces. 

This is not a pristine rifle to hang on a wall, but is an excellent shooter with a very nice trigger pull. I buy all my guns as shooters and that is my foremost concern.  This rifle is a pleasure to fire and produces close groups.  

Please bear in mind that when these images were taken before I had the opportunity to do any cleaning of the rifle other than just a quick wipe down with a dry rag, so there's some dust and dirt in places like the edges of the barrel bands. it has since been almost fully disassembled, cleaned, and lubricated.

I am selling a 12 GA minishell prototype shotgun. This is not a shotgun based on another manufacturer’s action; it was built from the ground up and fires minishells ONLY.

BELOW IS COPY OF A 2002 ARTICLE WRITTEN BY A GUNS & AMMO EDITOR FROM THE ""PROOF HOUSE"" SECTION TESTING THE MINISHELL PROTOTYPE SHOTGUN.

Serial number is 22 but very few were imported into the U.S. years ago, two of which were Class III. Lower serial numbers were likely given to other shotguns built and used by the manufacturer for testing purposes and probably destroyed, before sending in a few working samples.

This shotgun was NOT used to test minishells; they were built with the intention of selling them as any other shotgun. This particular one has less than 50 rounds put through it.

OAL is 37”, the receiver is under 7” and the barrel length 18.5”.

Magazine holds six shells plus one in the chamber. This means that a fully loaded shotgun plus a full side saddle will bring the total ammo available by simply carrying the shotgun alone, to 17 shells!!

IMPORTANT: I am selling the shotgun only, WITHOUT any ammunition. I do have ammunition for sale"

The open post sights of the PPQ are designed for rapid aiming and target acquisition.

hands.
The PPQ features a loaded chamber indicator, along with a trigger safety and automatic internal safeties. The frame is made from high-strength polymer and has a MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) accessory mounting rail for lights, lasers or other tactical devices.
