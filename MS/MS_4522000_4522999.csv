This is a Collector Grade weapon, it has not been fired. It will come with everything pictured in the ad.

The completely adjustable P30 grip feature consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.
And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HKs enhanced double action only â€œLaw Enforcement Modification (LEM).
Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.
Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot.

It is formally known as the Samozaryadnyi Karabin sistemi Simonova, 1945 (Self-loading Carbine, Simonov's system, 1945), or SKS 45. It was originally planned to serve as the new standard issue weapon for the Soviet military forces, alongside Mikhail Kalashnikov' new AK-47 design to replace the Mosin-Nagant series of bolt-action rifles and carbines that had been in service since 1891. As mass production of AK-pattern rifles increased, the SKS carbine was soon phased out of service. The carbine was quickly replaced by the AK-47, but it remained in second-line service for decades afterwards, and remains a ceremonial arm today. It was widely exported and produced by the former Eastern Bloc nations, as well as China. It is today popular on the civilian surplus market in many countries.

The carbine was chambered for the then-new 7.62 x 39 mm M1943 round, an intermediate cartridge which went on to become a standard for the subsequent AK-pattern rifles. 


The Rifle is a 1945 Mosin-Nagant M44

The .38 Largo is also known as the .38 Long and the .38 Long Colt.  This gun will chamber the .38 Special and .38 Short rounds, but it is not safe to fire a modern smokeless powder .38 Special or .38 Short cartridge in this gun.  It can cock and the cylinder revolves, but may not line up with the barrel.  It was made in the 1910 to 1931 timeframe in the Eibar area of Spain, and these guns were typically low quality guns.  It is a near perfect copy of the Smith and Wesson Military and Police Model.  It’s an inexpensive made, low quality revolver, intended for low pressure black powder loads, not modern day smokeless powder loads.  I bought it as a tinkering project about a year ago, and after removing some crud on the barrel, discovered it was a black powder gun, and have not fooled with it since. Since it’s a near perfect copy of the S&W M&P Model, I’m selling it as a good conversation piece and as an antiquity, and the purchaser must agree to not fire it.  Local sale only – I won’t ship.  I prefer a cash sale, but would be interested in an even trade for a project gun that needs repair.  I would prefer a pistol of any caliber, but would be open to a .22 rifle or a shotgun, but no black powder guns.

Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery ,providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling. 

The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you''ll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot. The gun is a clone of the CZ 75.

Nice 9mm carbine, great fun and low cost to shoot.  It’s been pretty much a safe queen since I bought it.  Uses Marlin or S&W magazines, comes with 2 mags.   It's a pre-ban gun, made in 1989.  It’s in great shape.  Metal is about 95%, wood is probably 85%with wear on the top of the comb behind the receiver, wear on the left front stock edge, a half dozen or so minor finish dings in the varnish, no dents extending into the wood - see photos.   The gun is no longer made and is becoming rarer each day – folks that own these just love them and rarely sell them.  I’m selling it only because I want me an AR. NOTE: Check out this gun on the Gunbroker.com completed auctions website - this gun in this condition has been selling for $550-$650 plus shipping and FFL transfer fee (another $70 add-on).  TERMS: Cash (US Postal Money Order) only for out of town sale, will trade locally only for a .223/5.56 AR.  Will not trade out of town.  Local sale requires bill of sale and photo ID, buyer to sign receipt acknowledging purchase, NO EXCEPTIONS.  Shipping is $35 direct to your FFL, $60 if he requires the gun to be shipped from another FFL (not a BATF requirement).  For a local sale I’ll meet with you during daylight hours only, in a public area, within a 20 mile radius of the Mobile, AL airport.  I’ll answer all e-mails except lowball offers, but I don’t do texts.  If the ad is still up, it's still available, but I’ll be advertising the gun on Gunbroker.com soon, and once I have a bid, I’ll remove it from ARMSLIST.  $550 Very Firm.  I won’t bother responding to lowball offers."

This would make a great gun to leave in your car, or maybe a nightstand gun for a wife/girlfriend who doesn't need the latest high speed / high dollar toy. Especially being a 380, these heavier guns really have no recoil and have nice thick grips to make them actually pretty comfortable to shoot... 

Bad for carry, great to leave sitting on a night stand for the recoil sensitive shooter.

This comes with lots of extras too - Mossy oak grips (installed) and the standard black grips, 3 magazines, ghost ring sights (if you dot like the factory 3 dot sights), hard case, and all associated manuals/papers/locks/etc.

Have some target ammo I could sell with it for cheap as well.

I have some other firearms and ammo to trade as well if you have something nicer (which you more than likely do), or can add cash if you have something I'm looking for."

$980 firm in cash or better in trade.

I prefer cash right now since I don't need anything, but I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested.  If wanting to trade, please be specific on what you are offering exactly, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.   

Trades considered:

Top of list would be an AR-10 or Sig 556R 7.62x39 Gen 2 only or the newest model, maybe the new converted U.S. Saiga AK-47 and a couple hundred in cash, since they are $750 new right now.  Could use a quality stripped AR-10 lower.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice FCG etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

This FACTORY NEW M&P is equipped with the best site laser in the industry: Crimson Trace. This laser isn’t just an add-on like you see in so many places. Instead, the laser site is built into the grip. Naturally hold and raise the gun, and instantly a red dot is on your target. You know exactly where the bullet is going. No need to waste time with the sites in a critical situation. Just point the pistol and you’re ready to defend.
This pistol is chambered in 9mm, and has 3-dot White Sites, adjustable backstraps, and 2 17-round magazines. This is an awesome pistol! It comes with everything, just you like you bought it from your favorite gun store - only it costs less.

These pistols sell brand new for at least $650 before taxes, shipping, and FFL fees. I'm working on another project so I will sell it for less. 

If this ad is posted, then this pistol is still available, so don’t ask. Copy of NCDL and CCW or original purchase permit along with Bill of Sale required.... you know the rules and all laws followed.

It has flip up sights and a""MagPul plus"" (which you will love) pistol grip and MagPul ACS-L adjustable stock with the custom LimbSaver recoil pad (not shown in thise old photos) for a nice extended length-of-pull for those of us with monkey arms.            Also not shown in the pics are the anti-rotation pins for the trigger and hammer.       I wasn't going for 'tacticool' looks; I just shoot left handed and I wanted to get the longest adjustable stock I could afford, and I was afraid of the 'kick'.     After my son-in-law's experience with his AR-10, I think the anti-rotation pins are crucial. I have fired about 20 rounds through this rifle, and it is just fine. I guess with the mid-length gas system, the Fortis muzzle brake and the LimbSaver recoil pad, I can shoot this rifle all day. Two MagPul magazines and the fancy tactical soft rifle case are included.        The price of $1695 is pretty firm. If you want to negotiate, be thinking of what extras you don't need on the rifle, and maybe I'll pull them off and put them on my other gun.        I will trade for quality gold or silver, but I'm not very interested in other guns. This listing is an effort to reduce my collection. This listing will go down when the gun is no longer available. Thanks"

This is a very nice hunting rifle and it does come with the cammo case and Simmons 3x9 optic. I have seen this rifle in fair condition priced anywhere between 400.00-500.00. I'm only selling because I need money for my next handgun. The price is negotiable but I won't sell to low-ballers. Throw a fair price my way and we'll see what we can work out.

It is a carry gun and I fire it every chance I get. I have somewhere around 700-800 flawless rounds through it. Zero failures of any kind or I would not carry it. This is the work horse of the .45acp world. I have several nice handguns but if the need should arise this is the one I would reach for over all others because I know it will not fail me.

The PX4 Storm SD .45 ACP semiauto pistol was developed to meet the very demanding requirements issued by the US Special Forces Command (SOCOM) for their Joint Combat Pistol. They called for superior weather resistance, three magazines (one 9-round flush and two 10-round extended), dark earth frame, extended barrel for threading, tactical case and additional accessories. Beretta answered the call successfuly, not just by merely rechambering the PX4 Storm to .45 ACP--but rather by redesigning its internal components to meet and exceed all these requirements. The result is a pistol that satisfies not only SOCOM's requirements, but the most demanding shooter looking for the absolute best and most reliable for personal defense, competition or carry.
Special Duty (SD) Tactical Pistol
The “SD” denomination of this handgun stands for “Special Duty.” That means a pistol that will be reliable in the toughest and most demanding conditions. Military trials for the PX4 Storm SD have proven that it will keep performing in spite of salt, mud, water, rain, snow, sand or anything else you can throw at it. This is because every internal component was engineered, produced and treated to function in such extreme environments.
Low-Recoil, Powerful Super-Accurate
The PX4 Storm SD features a rotating barrel system. This means that under recoil, the barrel rotates, thereby dissipating momentum radially, which translates in much lower felt recoil and muzzle jump, even with hotter .45 ACP rounds. Furthermore, the extended cold-hammer forged barrel is 4.5” long and allows the power of the .45 to fully develop before exiting the muzzle. And the out-of-the-box accuracy of this handgun is as good as it gets in a tactical pistol.
Packed with Tactical Features The reversible mag-release, ambidextrous safety, drop-free magazine, commander-style hammer and easy-on-target 3-dot sights are only some of the tactical features of this Beretta .45. An integral Picatinny rail forward of the trigger guard enables easy mounting of tactical lights, laser aiming devices or other accessories. And like all best-quality military arms the PX4 Storm SD takes mere seconds to disassemble without any tools. When the impossible is expected, the PX4 Storm SD is the absolute best companion to have at hand."

The PX4 Storm SD .45 ACP semiauto pistol was developed to meet the very demanding requirements issued by the US Special Forces Command (SOCOM) for their Joint Combat Pistol. They called for superior weather resistance, three magazines (one 9-round flush and two 10-round extended), dark earth frame, extended barrel for threading, tactical case and additional accessories. Beretta answered the call successfuly, not just by merely rechambering the PX4 Storm to .45 ACP--but rather by redesigning its internal components to meet and exceed all these requirements. The result is a pistol that satisfies not only SOCOM's requirements, but the most demanding shooter looking for the absolute best and most reliable for personal defense, competition or carry.
Special Duty (SD) Tactical Pistol
The “SD” denomination of this handgun stands for “Special Duty.” That means a pistol that will be reliable in the toughest and most demanding conditions. Military trials for the PX4 Storm SD have proven that it will keep performing in spite of salt, mud, water, rain, snow, sand or anything else you can throw at it. This is because every internal component was engineered, produced and treated to function in such extreme environments.
Low-Recoil, Powerful Super-Accurate
The PX4 Storm SD features a rotating barrel system. This means that under recoil, the barrel rotates, thereby dissipating momentum radially, which translates in much lower felt recoil and muzzle jump, even with hotter .45 ACP rounds. Furthermore, the extended cold-hammer forged barrel is 4.5” long and allows the power of the .45 to fully develop before exiting the muzzle. And the out-of-the-box accuracy of this handgun is as good as it gets in a tactical pistol.
Packed with Tactical Features The reversible mag-release, ambidextrous safety, drop-free magazine, commander-style hammer and easy-on-target 3-dot sights are only some of the tactical features of this Beretta .45. An integral Picatinny rail forward of the trigger guard enables easy mounting of tactical lights, laser aiming devices or other accessories. And like all best-quality military arms the PX4 Storm SD takes mere seconds to disassemble without any tools. When the impossible is expected, the PX4 Storm SD is the absolute best companion to have at hand."

Be aware this gun uses 7.63x25, that's 7.6[THREE]x25, NOT 7.62x25 Tokarev. The Tokarev ammunition is way too high-pressure for broomhandles and will blow them up. 

This particular 900 is in refurbished condition. The stock has been lost and the bore is dark and worn. However, it's not as bad as it sounds! The benefit of a refurbished gun over a collector's item is that you can shoot it guilt-free! Turning heads at the range is a blast with this gun and you wont have to worry about damaging a showpiece. The serials on this gun all match, even those below the grips, the crown is crisp, and a because it was re-blued the finish is impeccable. The action, slide, and safety all work properly and all in all this is a great gun for people whose collections don't have room for space-wasting safe queens who are afraid to be shot once in a while."
