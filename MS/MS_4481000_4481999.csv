This shotgun is 12 gauge and has a rifled barrel for shooting Sabot slugs.  If you want to use it for home defense or bird hunting, just pick up another barrel and swap it out.  This was my deer hunting gun last year but this year I now have a .44 Magnum rifle so I no longer need this.  It functions flawlessly.  It has a 24"" ported barrel for reduced muzzle rise and holds 4+1 without the plug and 2+1 with the plug installed.  I have upgraded the magazine spring to a higher powered Wolff spring and upgraded the follower to a GG&G steel/aluminum follower for more reliable feeding.  The barrel has an integrated cantilever scope base ready to mount a scope of your choice.  The stock is a monte carlo style and is polymer.  I have also added a shell holder on the stock to carry an extra 5 shells.  This shotgun will shoot 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells.  It has a spacer system to adjust the drop angle of the stock.  It also has a quick empty button that will release all of the loaded shells with the press of the button.  I have the original box, owner's manual, lock, the stock magazine spring and magazine follower, as well as an extra recoil pad and a Limbsaver recoil pad.  I am also including 3 boxes of Sabot slugs to get you started.  I had this out hunting 1 day last year and dropped a deer in its tracks with it at 60 yards.  This is a great deer gun, I just no longer need it.

Asking $500 for everything.  Located in the Dublin/Hilliard area of Northwest Columbus.  NOT interested in trades at this time.  Thanks for looking."

Gander Mtn. Savage Model 93 R17 BTVS Rimfire Rifle http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?i=GM416262

Comes with a box plus of ammo


REVIEW ChuckHawk Review The Savage Arms Model 93R series represents the Savage bolt action entry in the great rimfire rifle sweepstakes. The 93R17 series is chambered exclusively for the .17 HMR cartridge. These rifles represent the pinnacle of rimfire performance as interpreted by Savage Arms.

I have written extensively about the .17 HMR cartridge elsewhere on the Rimfire Guns and Ammo Page, so I will not repeat the whole story here. It is sufficient to say that with a 17 grain Hornady V-MAX bullet at a MV of 2550 fps, the .17 HMR is the flattest shooting, longest range rimfire cartridge on the market. It is the most accurate (factory loaded) small game and varmint cartridge I can remember testing. A good shot with a good rifle can usually shoot groups around 1.0 MOA at 100 yards. The precision with which .17 HMR ammo is manufactured is incredible!

The Savage 93R17 line of rifles is an extensive one. Included are models offering standard contour and heavy (varmint) barrels, and stocks of hardwood, laminated wood, black synthetic, and camo synthetic. Regardless of material, 93R17 series stocks come with detachable sling swivel bases.

All Model 93R17 rifles share the same basic Savage 93 action. This rear locking, cock on opening design features dual extractors and a fixed blade ejector. Cartridges are fed from a removable 5-round box magazine. The two-position safety (push forward for ""fire"") is located immediately behind the bolt handle at the right rear of the action. The ""bottom iron"" is blued sheet metal, and the trigger guard is plastic.

From 2006 onward all Savage Model 93R17 rifles have come with the Savage Accu-Trigger. This is the best rimfire rifle trigger that you will find short of the Olympics, and nothing else in the 93R17's price class even comes close."

One appears to be a Brazilian Brevet Nagant revolver that looks to have been re-chambered from its original caliber  to what appears to be maybe .22 caliber ??? Or maybe it came that way originally as some kind of training pistol or something, I don't know. It has matching numbers frame and barrel. It does not seem to fire currently, but the action, hammer, and trigger work. If nothing else, it should make a great parts gun.

The second is a Rohm RG14 .22LR. It works sometimes. Shoots decently when it does decide to work. Probably a pretty simple fix for someone that knows what to look for.

The third is in pretty rough shape. The timing would certainly need some work. A good bit of the finish is gone and it's friendly with the rust in some places. It says ""U.S. Revolver Co."" and ""Made In USA"" on it. Aside from the serial number I don't see any other markings on it. No idea of caliber, maybe .32 ??? Personally, I would not attempt to fire it in it's current condition. That said, you do what you want."

The WASP surface is harder than tradition Chrome Lined barrels.  

This is a Gas Piston Upper (NOT Direct Impingement) which means much less cleaning of the bolt carrier group. It also has a Quad Rail with the Knights Armament Vertical Grip, and a MOE soft hand grip  

There is an under rail mounted folding bi-pod, and Nikon Prostaff 3x9 x40 scope. It would come exactly as you see it in the picture. 

It's super clean, and looks brand new inside and out.  It's been in my safe for years and I'm just trying to thin the herd.

Please don't email asking ""Do you still have it""  If this ad is up then it's still for sale.

Thanks!"

It sat on his shelf for quite some time and he gave it to me last year since he never got around to fixing it.  I sent it back to Taurus and they replaced the firing pin and it works great now.  Unfortunately it's is too heavy for me to carry and I already have a full-sized pistol for home defense so I don't really have a use for it.  It is mechanically sound, and cosmetically in very good condition.  I would advise that if you want to practice dry firing you will need to buy snap-caps. With this older style of firing pin on the hammer you can break the tip off if you dry fire with nothing in the chamber.  That is probably what happened when it broke. You can see that hasn't seen much use, the bore is clean and shiny. It spent most of it's life in a safe.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Have a happy 4th of July and God bless.

I was going to give it a shot, but lost interest and just want to get something back for it. Everything you could ever need to build is included, tools, 992r parts, accessories, everything. I did a lot of research on what the best methods are to use, and bought the best tooling and jigs available. Everything is new. Here's what's included:


Parts Kit:

-All matching 1988 Polish AKMS underfolder parts set. Every single part bears matching serial number ""1801"". Surface finish is excellent, with some wear in high contact areas. Overall, it's got a lot of character, and I don't think a refinish is necessary. The barrel is a new US made Chrome Lined 7.62x39 barrel, headspaced appropriately by AK-builder. It came to me already pressed into the trunnion, which I removed with my barrel removal tool. That's the only work I've done to it. Wood is in awesome shape, no dings, scratches, or gouges. Kit came with a polish sling, CA magazine lock by Solar Tactical, and a blocked 10/30 magazine.


Build Parts:

-AK-Builder 80% Pre-Bent Polish Receiver with Lower Rails and Center support.
-Tapco G2 Single Hook trigger group (original surplus included).
-AK-Builder rivet set.
-Red Star Arms FCG Retaining plate (shepherd's hook replacement).


Tools:
-Toth Tools Barrel Removal/Install set.
-Toth Tools short rivet crushing jaws w/ Harbor Freight 24"" bolt cutters.
-AK-Builder 80% Receiver Drilling jig.
-AK-Builder lower rail alignment jig.
-A can of Brownell's GunKote for finishing.


Ammo:
280 rounds Russian Made 123 grn FMJ, zinc plated case.




I've invested well over $1,100 with everything included, but have determined I just won't be making the time to build it. Everything you'll need is here, minus a few basic shop tools. These builds are so rewarding and a very fun undertaking. I'm looking to get $700 for everything. I may consider a trade for a 20"" AR15 A2 or A4 style upper + some cash on your end. I'm in Murrieta, CA, but could ship for the right offer. Thanks!"

It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.      The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

The reason the C3 is so popular is because of its super lightweight profile.  Weighing in at just 5.5 lbs, the C3 is the ideal AR for a hike into the woods, teaching a small-statured shooter to use an AR, or anyone who has to carry an AR for a living.  It features a 9″ Samson Evolution handguard with the ability to add sections of rail anywhere along the system, a 16″ “Pencil” profile barrel (.675 at the gas port), and an Ace Ultra Light Entry stock.  The core of the C3 remains the same high quality military grade upper and lower receiver and internals, no polymer.  With a retail price at just $1,349.99, the C3 is an ideal carbine for everyone.

The majority of AR companies use offshore parts, cast or millett, DoubleStar uses only forged parts, made in Bluegrass and carry a lifetime warranty

It goes without saying that these are becoming more and more rare by the day, and it’s clear that sanctions won’t be lifted anytime soon (or possibly ever). This quintessential AK is a beauty and would be a wonderful addition to any collection.

Please let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks for looking!

I have a

$25 Simmonds - Army and late Air Force contract 20 round. Circa 1966 to 1971. Dull alloy followers. Central Industries -marked ""Simmonds"" on floor plate. This  is the same company that contracted and made Colt magazines. They are identical (trust me I had two I sold) except the floor plate! This magazine based on the spot weld is comparable to a late 68/69 colt mag I had. The wear on this is all natural, no chemical or forced wear and only comes with 50 years of regular use. This is the best mag for that ""aged"" look!

$25 Adventure Line - Army and late Air Force contract 20 round. Circa 1966 to 1971. Dull alloy followers. Colt contract marked ""Adventure Line"" on floorplate. Various sources say this was made for colt but branded as Adventure Line for the civilian market. Very early production due to quality of spot welds. Adventure Line was known to use a thicker anodizing and a thicker molly coating which lead to longer life and appearance as is visible in this This is the best condition mag, definitely a collector if you want a retro build that looks ""new""! This has almost all the original finish (some wear by the mag catch).


The prices on these are fairly fixed as they either are on the market or not available at all. I am willing to discuss discounts if you want to buy both!

Please email me with any questions, I am located in the NW Valley near Norterra! I will not drive to meet you other than 5-10minutes. I will not ship nor accept trades."

As can be seen in the pictures, this pistol is basically new.  From what I understand, it has a box (or less) through it at the range, meaning the round count is likely below 50.  I say likely as I purchased this used, with the intent of it being a basic campsite pistol.  However, I’ve decided to go a different direction and sell the SD.  

The pistol has standard sights, comes with two magazines, and the original box/accessories, as seen in the picture.

I am not interested in trades, with the exception of AK’s featuring combloc receivers and CHF, chrome lined barrels (cash to be added on either end depending on value of items being traded).

I am most interested in a face to face sale, which would take place in the southwestern suburbs.  Cash is the best form of payment.  Although I’m willing to ship, all associated costs would be on the buyers end, and I’d require either a USPS or Walmart money order before shipping to an FFL.

Although I am not requiring an FFL transfer for a face to face deal, I do reserve the right to use one if I see it as necessary.  In the event I ask for an FFL transfer, I would pay the full cost without increasing the purchase price (ie, I’ll foot the bill for it).  Having sold a few items through Armslist/GB, I’ve encountered situations where I’d feel more comfortable with an FFL performing a formal transfer.  It’s nothing personal, and very unlikely that I’d request this – after all, it will cost me money and time."

Has about 550 rounds through it. It has a stippled grip and an Apex trigger assembly installed. The trigger is very crisp and feels almost like a single-action trigger. I am the first owner, so boxes and paperwork are included. I will send more pics upon request. I will throw in the holsters with the shown price. No, the price doesn't go down if you don't want the holsters, I just won't need them anymore. Both are Galco brand iwb holsters (a simple leather one and a King Tuck). I also have lots of extra magazines that I will sell with it for a very reasonable price. Those are Taran Tactical extensions on those magazines. Extensions alone are worth $41 each brand new, plus the $35 for the magazine. $1100+ total value when brand new. I will trade all for a new or like-new Glock 21, will trade gun, 3 compact mags, and holsters for a Glock 43; or I will sell everything for $625; or just the gun with holsters and 3 compact mags for $375. If you just want the 8 magazines, let me know and we'll work something out. The extended ones are 23-rounders. Everything works flawlessly. Don't be afraid to send any other offers. Worst I will say is 'no thanks'."
