Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-manual price and with no additional shipping. Here are factory Sig instruction manuals that came into the United States with a good many Sig P6 West German Police Pistols between 2006 and 2008. We know that pistol as the P225, of course, the original Sig Compact. All these manuals are in excellent condition, their only detractions come from more than a decade of storage with the Bundespolizei, the German Federal Police. Parent pistols bore date codes ranging all the way from 1977 up until the mid 1990s. Note that these manuals are the early type that sometimes came in the blue plastic boxes with the P-6 Pistols. We estimate that these manuals were printed in the early 1980s. They are printed in Switzerland and so marked. Total content is approximately 40 pages, in four languages – English, German, French, and Spanish. Out of only two dozen or so we originally had, only 3 of them were perforated for plastic back binders, and we will offer them first come first served. These manuals are applicable, and parts are similar enough to render them useful, for owners of any traditional Sig Pistol, not only the P225, but also models P220, P226, P228, P229, and P239. Any shoppers wanting a manual for safety and information purposes only can easily download one off of Sig Arms’s home page. Our interest in these, and many of our Sig owners’ interest, lies in their collectability. If a person has a nice Sig pistol with a box, but no factory manual, here is one solution. These are definitely not readily available in the United States. We’re offering these factory manuals each for only $ 19.00. Shipping.Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 USPS Priority Mail with Adult Signature, total shipping no matter how many a person buys. A responsible adult will have to sign for the package! $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico.

This is for when the regular Accu Shadow is not quite accurate enough for you.
CZC 75 SP01 ACCU Shadow #91735 USPSA Production Approved!
Features: *CZC Fitted Match Barrel *CZC Stainless steel barrel bushing. *CZC Stainless steel reverse plug. *CZC SHORT reset trigger system “CZC SRTS” *CZC Competition Fixed rear sight.
These modifications have been added to the already customized CZ Custom SP01 Shadow Pistol. #91029
What's the difference between the regular Accu Shadow #91730 and this one?
CZ Custom has hand fitted the ""Made in the USA"" CZC Match Grade Barrel, tighter fit and tolerance then standard factory barrel. The new barrel bushing is threaded into the slide; the bushing is fitted to the barrel creating far less play than the current bushing system. The bushing also retains the new stainless steel guide plug. The bushing keeps the front sight in the slide so no pin is necessary or needed (fitting the pin will damage the bushing threads.)
Ransom Rest testing at 50 yards with Fiocchi 125 JHP (A ZERO bullet) has proved group of less than 3” compared with a factory new gun at about 5.0”. At 25 yards the groups were around 1.2” a one-hole group.
What’s new and very exciting is the CZC SHRT reset trigger system. People have been asking for a shorter faster reset without the trigger swinging all the way forward in SA mode, now we have it. CZC has taken almost all of the forward movement out of the single action position with the trigger moving on average less than a 1/16 (0.0625”) before stopping. They have basically created a 1911 single action on a double action gun.We buy guns and layaway is available! Sorry, no trades and all state and local laws apply. We are an FFL dealer so you must be able to pass a background check. 3% credit card fee. We can also ship this gun to other FFLs if needed."

It has night sights installed; they are bright and function as they should. The dealer (GAT guns) said it has a ""trigger job"" on it. Honestly, the pull is lighter than any 1911 I've owned/shot, but I cannot confirm the trigger details. it has a light, smooth and consistent pull when fired. I bought it nearly new condition. At that point, the gun was not broken in yet; it's nearly there with around 400 rounds fired through it. Originally bought it as a CCW, but I got a lighter polymer pistol instead. 

The gun looks, acts and feels like it should. I will include a leather IWB holster, the original mag, a kimpro mag, and a wilson combat mag. All of the magazines are 7 round capacity and all are fully functioning. I could include a couple boxes of 45acp too.

From the Springfield Armory Website:
If you want a competition grade 1911 that conceals better than a full-sized pistol, the Range Officer® Compact from Springfield Armory® offers finely tuned performance in a smaller package. The Range Officer® Compact brings the precision of a competition pistol in a small and straightforward configuration.

The Range Officer® Compact has the same quality forged national match frame and slide as the Trophy Match™ and TRP™ 1911s. It gets the same precision fit as these pistols, too. Add in the same match grade steel barrel, and you have a pistol that shoots well beyond its price tag. The Range Officer® Compact is topped with a fiber optic front sight and a low profile combat rear sight, so you have maximum visibility. The beavertail grip safety, extended lightweight trigger and flat mainspring housing allow the pistol to sit in your hand comfortably for long periods of time at the range. The single-sided thumb safety keeps things simple and functional. It all adds up to a pistol that will let you seriously compete in a variety of matches.

The Range Officer® Compact means that your favorite range pistol is now easier to carry. Are You Ready?™

This top rated mace brand pepper spray gun is powerful, lightweight (8.7 oz.) and can be easily and legally carried in hostler, pocket or purse. Unlike a traditional pepper spray bottle it shoots an easy to aim strong narrow stream of pepper spray that travels 185 mph! This strong narrow stream is not only much easier to aim and no matter the conditions will not blow back at you or others around you, but also has a much larger range. This allows you to stop and defend yourself attackers well before they are within dangerous range. Once your assailants take a breath complete incapacitation takes place immediately and lasts 30 to 45 minutes. During this time your attackers will be wheezing, coughing and blinded from the powerful pepper spray giving you plenty of time to escape the scene and calll 911"

 Military issue POSP (PSO) series is modified for Energiser 2L76 3V battery. Compact and solidly built, the scope has magnesium alloy body, which is finished in black. The reticules are illuminated in red, making the contrasting reticule line free of glow, which allows it to be used in dusk conditions.  All models are nitrogen-filled to prevent lens fogging, waterproof and come with 400m or 1000m rangefinding reticules. Since the range calibrations on both AK (7.62x39) and SVD (7.62x54) are measured in equal amounts of MOA, the reticules can be used for both calibers"

It's a Norinco SKS with a polymer stock, and a leapers 1.5-4 scope. Works great but does have some cosmetic issues, first the previous owner attempted to paint it flat black and it has flaked off or been removed in a few places, also it appears he tried to cut the brake off of it, he didn't damage anything and it doesn't effect anything there is just a slit in the break. It also comes with 10 stripper clips and I have ammo you can buy as well.

The Blade Show is the world's largest cutlery showcase and is the cutlery industry's premier event. This award is judged by fellow manufacturers and is the highest honor and most sought after award in the cutlery industry.
 
The Emerson Commander is a 21st century combination of design, materials, performance, and razor sharpness. This knife along with other Emerson Knives, sets the new standard for the cutlery industry and continues to push the design and performance envelope for cutting tools well into the 21st century.
 
The Commander knife-battle tested and proven-incorporates some of the most advanced ergonomics ever featured on a folding knife. The knife, already in use with elite armed forces, European Military strike teams and NATO Counter-Terrorist units throughout the world was chosen by the U.S. Navy SEAL teams for issue to special units within the Naval Special Forces Units. Because of its ruggedness, it has become a favorite of hunters, outdoorsmen and adventurers the world over. It features the patented ""wave shaped opening feature"" with Dragon's Teeth™ serrations.
 
I sent my knife back to Emerson a year or so ago to have it refurbished and sharpened.  As you can see from the photos, my Commander is in great shape.  It could honestly use a good sharpening, but it's an awesome knife in great shape and will provide many more years of solid performance. 
 
The incredible Emerson Commander costs $255 new.  I'm asking only $189, so here's your chance to save a bundle on an amazing knife.  If you have any questions, please let me know!

The Blade Show is the world's largest cutlery showcase and is the cutlery industry's premier event. This award is judged by fellow manufacturers and is the highest honor and most sought after award in the cutlery industry.
 
The Emerson Commander is a 21st century combination of design, materials, performance, and razor sharpness. This knife along with other Emerson Knives, sets the new standard for the cutlery industry and continues to push the design and performance envelope for cutting tools well into the 21st century.
 
The Commander knife-battle tested and proven-incorporates some of the most advanced ergonomics ever featured on a folding knife. The knife, already in use with elite armed forces, European Military strike teams and NATO Counter-Terrorist units throughout the world was chosen by the U.S. Navy SEAL teams for issue to special units within the Naval Special Forces Units. Because of its ruggedness, it has become a favorite of hunters, outdoorsmen and adventurers the world over. It features the patented ""wave shaped opening feature"" with Dragon's Teeth™ serrations.
 
I sent my knife back to Emerson a year or so ago to have it refurbished and sharpened.  As you can see from the photos, my Commander is in great shape.  It could honestly use a good sharpening, but it's an awesome knife in great shape and will provide many more years of solid performance. 
 
The incredible Emerson Commander costs $255 new.  I'm asking only $189, so here's your chance to save a bundle on an amazing knife.  If you have any questions, please let me know!

Text me or email me only at first, if it sounds interesting then we can chat on phone.  Thanks.

Im second owner.  It was $1500 new built by professional.  I prefer to sell together but will seperate if I sell upper first for the right price.  Im happy to send several pics before we meet if you would like to show you condition.

Rifle is in very good condition.  Per the original owner, the upper is bravo with carbine length 5.56 barrel and 10"" rail with bcg and charging handle from Bravo (I say it that way as I dont see the traditional bravo markings on it, but the I double checked with the builder on it and because of his job, I felt it is bravo, but I dont know how else to prove it) and the Lower is Spikes Multi Caliber Spider, (LPK, buffer tube, spring) etc with either a Rogers Super Stock black or Magpul ACS stock in Green and Magpul grip in green as well as green magpul flip up sights and 2 green magpul mags.  Also has sling holder which has some minor wear from connecting and a magpul sling.  Bipod in pic not included.  I can send you several pics to show you any scuffs but again its in very good cond overall and low round count.

Asking $1225 cash or trade,  cash deal will get best price  ......... Otherwise mainly interested in Glocks plus cash but will consider other guns modern handguns plus cash like Sig, Kimber, Colt, Springfield, Remington, Ruger, Smith or similar in new to like new condition only and prefer common calibers only.  Only other interest might be an AK pistol or Rifle plus cash or a factory built AR in .308 only but under $1600 in value and I can add a gun or ammo to make up difference, I really can't add cash at this time.    

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, old military, vintage, builds No high points, or junk guns please.

I am very open to offers, but Please dont waste time with low ball offers.

I can only meet local to clermont due to family health stuff. So within 10-15 miles of here.  Please google it if you dont know where Clermont is.

My email and text number are below for questions or additional pics.



*******Must meet publically in or very near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Davenport. I rarely go to Orlando and occasionally Apopka, Leesburg or North Lakeland but we can always talk.   I know I keep saying this but I really can't meet in Miami or Jacksonville or half way between, sorry.*******



Please tell me what you have with your offer and what your offer is when you email or text me with at least one pic and offer.

I need to see what you have and condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. I'm a private seller and just do this as a hobby.

Suppressor Description: The worlds most effective 5.56mm silencer just got better. AAC's M4-2000 Mod 08 features the patent pending fast-attach Ratchet-Mount to provide precision accuracy with minimal and repeatable zero-shift. Users have the ability to INSTALL or remove the silencer from the Blackout™ flash hider/muzzle brake, or the BRAKEOUT compensator, in seconds. The compact size and light weight have minimal affect on maneuverability. The M4-2000 Mod 08s extreme durability is maximized by CNC automated fusion welding of every high-temperature aerospace alloy component used in its construction- making 100% suppressed full-auto fire possible on barrels as short as 10 inches. The back-pressure lowering design of the silencer aids in shooter comfort, reduces weapon fouling, and minimizes cyclic rate increase. As a final STEP, tapered-bore EDM technology is utilized to ensure precise bore alignment resulting in enhanced accuracy and maximum performance. By eliminating approximately 97% of the muzzle report, the M4-2000 Mod 08 preserves the hearing of the shooter and nearby support personnel. Eliminating muzzle flash in the harshest of environments.

The Revolver comes with a DeSantis pocket holster, 2 quick strip reloading strips, the original box and paperwork, and the Ruger gun zippered case that comes with it brand new. It also comes with 15 rounds of SD ammo, and a box of Remington .38 range ammo. I have put 5 rounds thru this thing, but the tiny revolver just isn't for me. 

I'm selling this to put the cash down on a smaller semi-auto like the XDs in .45, or possibly 9mm, so if you have one of those and want to work on some sort of deal, I'm willing to talk. (I prefer .45 ACP) Otherwise it's going towards a 1911.

Must have an Oregon ID (it's still legal to sell privately for about 84 days, then you lose your rights because Portland libs exist) I'd prefer a CHL, but it isn't necessary.
