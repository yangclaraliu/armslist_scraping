For a complete listing of my current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****  
Our incredibly popular 527 Carbine now has a youth variant. Though the action and barrel stay the same, the Turkish Walnut stock has been shrunk in nearly every dimension. With a 12.75” length of pull, smaller pistol grip with tighter radius and a thinner forend, the Youth Carbine makes an ideal first deer rifle. Chambered in .223 and 7.62×39, both cartridges are more than capable of taking deer-sized game and deliver little felt recoil compared to many youth offerings on the market. Paired with our smooth micro-Mauser action and single set trigger, a standard Carbine stock can be added as the shooter grows, so its small size won’t relegate it to the back of the safe a few years down the road.
Built to CIP specifications, our 7.62×39 chambers are ideal for shooting steel-cased surplus ammo. Designed to shoot .311 bullets, some American brass ammo may not perform as well as the imported steel-cased variety because of SAAMI brass dimensions and varying bullet diameters.
   We have 3 in stock, and have them priced to sell quickly for just $659 each.

Built as a tactical trainer for those who don’t require the precision of the Manners Composite stock, the Tacticool has a number of ergonomic features that make it a joy to shoot. The stock has ambidextrous palm swells on its pistol grip and an especially high Monte Carlo to accommodate larger scopes. The beavertail forend is great for riding bags or affixing a bipod for precision shooting in the field, with a gentle butt hook to provide excellent control.
In addition to the advantages gained by the interchangeable barrel system of the 455 platform, the 455 Varmint features a heavier, stiffer barrel than its predecessors in the 452 and 453 lines. The 16 long .866 diameter cylindrical barrel gives the 455 varmint an accuracy advantage across the wide variety of rimfire loads available today, and features a threaded muzzle for easy attachment of a variety of muzzle-end devices (suppressors, muzzle breaks, etc). Any of the accessory barrels available for the 455 platform, including the American and Lux (open sights), as well as other varmint weight barrels in .22LR, .22 WMR or .17HMR, can be easily swapped out due to the larger universal barrel channel of the Varmint model.

The .22lr AK-47 manufactured by GSG represents much more than a small caliber “knock-off” of a famous rifle. The GSG-AK47 is a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate. The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, and the look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. From the first time it is handled and shouldered, the heavy wood and comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle. The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential was surprisingly well. Whether it is for los-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun, we think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection.

Originally this was a wet sander that had a water tank which the belt ran through and was used to sand glass.  The tank has been removed, the rubber contact wheel has been removed (which I still have) and a flat platen with a tool rest has been installed.  I used this for knife grinding up until recently but I build a 2x72 knife grinder so I have no more use for it.  

The sander uses 4""X106"" belts.  I believe the motor is a 1.5 horse but I'm not 100% sure.  The motor has a brake and runs on 120V single phase power.  I also added castors  to the base so it can roll easily around the shop.  It does have tracking adjustment.  I have roughly 20 belts of which about half are brand new and half are used.  They vary in grits but most of them are 50 or 80 grit.  Included is the original contact wheel and arm.

I've made about 10 knives with this sander and it worked really well.  I also used if for sanding wood blocks, aluminum and all sorts of steel.  I'm running out of workspace room in my shop and would like to see what I can get for an offer on it."

These are also the reasons that the MaTech flip up rear sight has been the US Military standard for almost a decade.

Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor.

The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twist gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability.

The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones.

It's older than most of your underwear and has less rust also. No skid marks on this puppy and free of any gouges on the wood, unlike yours. Bluing is 95% or better which is much better than your chances of finding a better specimen from 1968 like this. It does not have a safety bar and the Caliber is 30-30 and I'm asking only $525. Wait a minute, that's a huge price drop from the original $600 I had it originally listed at and then lower than the $550 that it's currently listed at. Like your first lover, you'd be hard pressed to find another quite like this. Take a gander, don't bitch about the price. Once it's gone it's gone and I know you're a dealer and you don't pay retail but I'm not a store and you don't have this...I do! Neener neener. Thanks for the laughs but seriously, if you'd like to take a look let me know once you're done laughing."

No????....Me neither. 

But wouldn't you like the assurance of knowing you could? Well then, I have something for you. A Remington 1100 wing-master magnum modified with a 18"" factory barrel including screw in chokes. The fore end and stock are lightweight composite creating a very balanced yet lightweight weapon. Although the weight is significantly different than your grand pappies shotgun....the gas system of the 1100 is known to be reliable (assuming you do your part and clean it). 

On the side is a strip of velcro allowing the shooter to attach elastic shotgun cards (available on ebay for around $15-20 shipped) that allow the shooter to reload from the side until depletion of the card, once depleted the shooter simply replaces the card with a fresh card staying in the fight. 

The name tag on the stock helps identify your weapon from the rest of the lesser shotguns out there.....(Infidel patch included, no other morale patches included). 

Package includes:
Remi 1100 wing-,master 3"" magnum, 3 choke tubes. aftermarket stock and fore end
7 Rounds of 12ga 2 3/4"" 00 Buck
7 Rounds of 12ga 2 3/4"" Slug

For sale is my Colt 380 Gov.   I am not the original owner but the pistol is registered to me.  I bought it off of the Gun Broker website many moons ago.  I've put around 500 rounds through it.  For $700 I'd do a face to face deal with a legal Oregon gun owner.  You would get the Colt 380 pistol and one clip.   

This pistol will fire every time (and very fast) as long as its clean.  Put one box of cheap ammo through it and it will start to jam a bit.  If you use hollow points rounds the first round will hang up a bit if you try and use the slide like a man.   But to solve that I just use a FMJ round as my first round.  It always feeds properly and the following hollow points will to.  

This is a pretty much all metal gun.  Except the guide rod and grips.  Its a excellent pistol for the safe.  The value should be going only one direction.  I would take partial trade for silver or gold.  The Colt 380 is probably a better investment though"

This gun will hold 2 3/4"", 3"", and 3 1/2"" shells. It comes with a 28"" accu-choke Vent rib and ported barrel and a Modified choke. Keep in mind this barrel is not meant for rifled slugs of any kind, they can tumble in the barrel due to the porting on the receiver end so if you do want to shoot any type of slug you need a rifled slug barrel or a cylinder bore barrel from a Mossberg 590 6 shot (You will loose the 3 1/2"" capability but honestly a 3"" slug is already more than enough power)

The furniture is in very good shape with a nice dark stain to it and the bluing is like new. The bore is still really good with not many rounds down the tube. The action is smooth like all Mossbergs should be. The receiver is drilled and tapped for a rail and the mag tube will accept 590 style mag tube extensions. My initial intentions for this gun were to turn it into a potential competition shotgun (3 gun matches) but lost interest in the idea and figured some of the guns need to go, plus I have a wedding coming up later in the year (need funds).

This gun would make a great Turkey, Goose, or duck gun and with a rifled barrel a very capable deer gun. Brand new these retail for $530 in this exact configuration from Mossberg. I am looking for $400. My lose is your gain and I hope it does find a good home soon. With Turkey season starting in a few weeks this would be a great piece to hunt with or just go shoot some clays. Either way you won't be disappointed."

This Nemesis/Faida has the classic black (Testudo) finish and textured handle. The textured handle has the feel of a very fine finishing sandpaper. About the same as 4000 to 6000 grit sandpaper. Comes with two hex keys (Allen wrenches) so you can fine tune it to suit yourself.
BLADE: The blade has ambidextrous thumb studs and an upper guard to protect your hand. Sharp right out of the box. Classic shape. Flat grind. There is a short jimping section near the guard; just the right size to give you extra control with a thumb or a forefinger
HANDLE: The Nemesis/Faida has a generous handle. At the end of the handle there is a tempered steel protrusion shaped so you can use it to break glass. It has a lanyard hole incorporated on the butt end of the handle. It has a side-to-side reversible clip with a tip up carry. Ergonomically designed to provide you with a comfortable grip.
LOCK: The lock is a back lock. This locking system is safe and has been well-tested. For an additional level of safety, the Nemesis/Faida also has a manual safety lock effectively giving this folder the stability of a fixed blade. Be advised that the heavy-duty lock on the Nemesis/Faida requires substantial pressure to release it.

Product Description
The CZ 75D PCR is identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, but thanks to its forged aluminum alloy frame it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

With decades of reliable performance to its credit, the J-frame line offers models capable of firing .22 LR, .22 Magnum®, .38 S&W Special and the more powerful .357 Magnum® loads. Smith & Wesson offers these revolvers from our production, M&P, Pro Series, and Classics lines in three diverse hammer designs; internal, exposed and shrouded.

We’re asking people to comment on the announcement anyway, and to share those comments with elected officials.

Comments may be submitted via email to REDACTED.

In your comments, point out that M855/SS109 does not have a core made entirely of steel, and that it does not penetrate police-style body armor any better than other common 5.56 ammunition. Tell them that removing M855/SS109 from the market will cause great disruption to the hundreds of thousands of people who buy and shoot millions of rounds of this ammunition every year, and that this massive consumption of this ammunition – with extremely rare use in any criminal activity – clearly demonstrates that it is primarily used for sporting purposes. The proposed ban on manufacture, importation and distribution of this ammunition serves no legal or officer safety function and should be tabled permanently.

The message need not be long or detailed, but we need as many comments against this proposal as possible, and we need them immediately. The window for comments closes on March 16. Once you submit your comment, please forward a copy to each of your U.S. senators and your representative, and ask them to sign on to Rep. Bob Goodlatte’s, R-Va., letter to BATF.

Swager Description: Until now, reusing military brass, with its crimped primer pockets, has been a tedious task. The Dillon solution is a remarkably simple device that bolts to your bench and allows you to swage the primer pockets with speed and ease. The case is supported from the inside, so you won't be tearing the rims off the brass. A tool steel, hardened swage rod (easy to change from large to small primers) simply rolls the crimp away. No reaming is necessary. Our unique compound cam leverage system assures not only ease of operation, but perfect alignment with each and every round. Sound simple? It is and it works. What's more, it's inexpensive. The Super Swage 600 comes with large and small swage rods, .22 and .30 caliber backup rods"

A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.
Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.
Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.
