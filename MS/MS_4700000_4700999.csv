Iâve cycled Wolf 55G HP/SP 60G FMJ, Tula 60G FMJ, Red Army 69G FMJ, Silver Beare 60G FMJ, and Hornady VMAX. Iâve also cycled ~60 rounds of 7n6 to see where the rounds dropped at 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 yards using the BDC reticle. The gun is in super condition and shoots like a dream. The rifle is proteced with KG Gunkote and was done by Troy at InRange. The process was ~$200 itself and looks great. The rifle will comes with your choice of black 10 or 21 magazine. Thank you. Please email me for more detailed pics. Scope and side mount not included."

The brand new bullpup-rifle from IWI that's taking the world of modern semi-auto rifles by storm. After more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVORÂ® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVORÂ® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situationsâ¦or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the usersâ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVORÂ® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines â but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Stock # MMH282003. Serial # 429xx. This is a 9MM Swedish Model m40 9mm semi-auto pistol, sometimes referred to as a âLahtiâ Pistol. Made in Sweden by Husqvarna, this was the standard Swedish Military sidearm from the 1940âs to Post-WWII. The Lahti is a unique semi-auto pistol, in that the trigger has an accellerator in it that allows the pistol to be fired in sub-zero conditions. The pistol has a blue factory finish and brown plastic checkered factory grips with the Hsqvarna logo. There are faint importers markings on the right front of the receiver, the Husqvarna markings are crisp and legible. The magazine is not marked. The pistol has heavy holster wear, wear on the grip straps, service marks, and there is a large spot of discoloration on top of the slide. The grips show minimal wear. The pistol has a nice, crisp bore, good rifling, and a smooth trigger pull. We only have one mail, holster, or any other accessories for this gun.

The brand new bullpup-rifle from IWI that's taking the world of modern semi-auto rifles by storm. After more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVORÂ® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVORÂ® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situationsâ¦or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the usersâ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVORÂ® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines â but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Bullpup configuration; short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy

Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles

Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies

The weapon has a drilled and tapped scope mount $150
The weapon has a PROSUPPLIES -- AIM SPORTSÂ® Mosin Nagant 2-7x42 Long Eye Relief Scope $99
The weapon has an eight port muzzle brake $65
The rifle has a bipod $40 (I thought bipods would be cheaper and there just aren'y any less expensive.
The rifle comes with $15 of ammo = 20 rounds of 7.62x54r
It is installed in the stock and converted to magazines instead of the top loading integrated magazine.
It comes with 2 ten round magazines $20 each
1 5 round magazine $16.

The price is $???
No reasonable offer refused.
Keep in mind that a lot has gone into getting this rifle to this point.  The 7.62x54r is a BEAST of a round hitting harder than anything any AR platform can throw out (with the exclusion of that frankenstein 1 shot 50cal bmg abomination).  It isn't even like you buy a weapon and you buy a stock and take it to someone or put it together yourself.  When it goes into the stock it needs to be fit and filed and fit and filed so it sits just right. So lets no have any offers too low for words...ok?

1 full box of ammo is included the value of that alone is $15 so you are down another $15 for the gun itself minus $125 for the weaver scope mount - that is down another $125 for the gun. $175 for the stock.  The conversion to magazine fed, the 3 magazines, the muzzle brake, the bipod and on and on and on.

I will trade this for a 9mm Glock 34 preferably.

I will trade this for any AK47 style rifle firing 7.62x39 rounds that shoots (almost any).

I will trade this for a nice large caliber lever action rifle or bolt action rifle with toys like this in 308 or less.

I will trade this for an MVP Predator in 223 with the AR magazines.

I am interested in almost anything.

No I do not want a lawnmower or a laptop.

Please text or email pictures of what you are interested in trading.  All trades are contingent upon me agreeing to a specific trade/ specific item or items.

I will trade for 22lr weapons maybe 2 to 1 - I love that little Walther PPQ 22lr. Do you have one and some cash?

text REDACTED
email REDACTED

if you text me an offer I am not going to be mean to you. I hate it when I text someone an offer and they are pissed off at me because I offered something lower than they believe is ""right"" for the weapon. So I will not flip out. What I will not do is answer questions that are already answered in this add. If you text or email me something that is in the add I will refer you to the add.

If you have a trade please send a picture of it via text or email - I will want to see everything before I can consider it.

I live in North Port, Fl 34286

I will 1) Require ID when you make the purchase or trade
2) Only meet for a sale or a trade in my home - no longer will I meet in a parking lot to do a gun deal - that is unsafe for us both. At least if you are coming to my home you can tell someone exactly where you will be instead of ""in the Home Depot parking lot near the dumpster"".
3) We will both sigh a bill of sale - I will not ever sell a weapon without documenting it again. I sold a rifle recently to someone who really unsettled me after the sale and I simply will not go through that again.

These three conditions are for honesty and safety for BOTH of us.

Thanks for looking.

$396 and you use your own optic
$450 and you get the scope too

It seems that there is an odd type of people who I have never encountered before. When I put something up for sale I usually get people who are interested (they make offers) and people who are not interested - (they do not make offers because the item is not up to their standards). However, there is no sense in telling me what is wrong with my item AND THEN offering to buy it. That is just like saying the food is not good and the servings are too small!

These are better prices than the 3/8"" thick target you will normally

available I might be able to offer a package price.

Targets are ready to hang with 1/2"" carriage bolts (grade 5 
recommended).

Email or text is the best way to reach me.  Thanks for looking.

Basic guidelines:
1. Always wear eye protection/safety glasses.
2. Never shoot at the flat face of a steel target, recommended tilt 
angle is 20 - 30 degrees so the bullet is directed toward the ground and
 not up or back towards the firing line.
3. Maintain a safe distance: 10+ yards for pistol calibers & 25 - 
100 yards for rifle calibers.  The more powerful the more distance 
required for safety.
4. Hang targets (still at an angle) with chain, rubber or nylon belting 
(versus rigid mount to a board) to allow targets to dissipate more of 
the bullets energy and direct more of the splatter to the ground.  There
 are a lot of examples online of safe and inexpensive to build target 
hangers.  This will also improve the sound of the ""ring"" when you hit 
the target.

Notice:  You are responsible for the safe and proper use of these 
targets.  If you have not shot at steel targets or do not understand the
 risks and hazards of ricochets and bullet splatter, please ask someone 
for guidance and/or investigate online before firing your first shot at 
steel."

The barrel is 16"", with a mid-length gas system and rifle length sight radius/handguards. Bolt and carrier are all mil-spec. Chrome-lined bore, chambered in 5.56 so will handle .223 as well. The mid-length gas system makes for really soft shooting and the rifle-length sight radius gives a much better sight picture than carbine length.

The stock is a B5 systems SOPMOD stock with battery storage and includes a quick detach sling swivel. The handguard is a Midwest Industries Gen 2 quad rail - a really nice, lightweight rail. The rail covers are Larue Tactical Index Clips, which are great - each one takes up a single slot so you can use them to mark where your optic mount goes if you need to remove it. Easily the lowest profile rail covers I've used. The grip on it right now is a standard M4/M16 style grip. The rear backup iron sight is a Magpul MBUS Pro - all-steel construction and lies perfectly flat at the very rear of your rifle. Don't notice it until you need it. Includes the vertical foregrip pictured. Includes two GI magazines.

This is a really great shooting AR and I wish I didn't have to sell it off. It's accurate and reliable, I've never had any issues at all with it. It hasn't gone on any carbine courses or anything that would constitute as hard use - just to the range and back. It hasn't reached the 1000rd mark yet, so it has tons of life left in it.

NO CATAGORY FOR STONER.....NOT A COLT...NOT A COLT... I HAD TO PICK ONE FROM THE LIST AND SIMPLY CHOSE THE ONE THAT I HAVE OTHERS IN. NO OTHER REASON......NOW, ON TO THE AD...........This is a very nice AR15 by Stoner. Full T7075 receivers that are so tight you can not see light between them unlike my 3500 dollar Colt or 3700 dollar Noveske !! Stainless 16 inch mid weight barrel. BULS Tactical stock by MFT. MOE grip. VLTOR BCM Gunfighter charging handle with over sized latch. Ambi sling atachment. 8 inch free floated quad rail. Quad rail gas block. MOE flip up battle sights. Brand spanking new Nikon P-300 BDC scope and correct P-Series mount/ring combo for a rock solid mount. 4 correct aluminum mags. Custom paint throughout. Bulldog backpack drag bag. 130 or so rounds of NWA ammo and another 60 rounds of Remington Supersonic in factory boxes.  These rifles are 1300 dollars new before all the upgrades. To replace this package at todays prices would set you back 2180 dollars plus assorted fees. I am asking just 1450 for the whole package. This rifle runs like a clock. I have nearly 500 flawless rounds through it with ZERO issues of failures of any kind. The scope is not sighted in yet as it is brand spanking new. I had the same exact one on it and it got broken in a gun avalanche out at the range thanks to teenagers playing grabass at the one place you would think this wouldn't happen. I sent it in and received a brand new, not refurbed, one directly from Nikon. Their customer service was professional and perfect and I will continue to buy their products. I listed this once before and got flooded with trade offers but it seems that Armslist is becoming the new Craigslist and filled with flakes. It didn't used to be that way and I believe it is due to SB941 having everyone running scared. I am a 50 plus year resident of Oregon, have a valid ODL and current CHL that I have maintained since 1985 and would prefer to deal with like individuals. This rifle is papered to me via a 4473. I am looking mainly for cash to recoup part of the 2 grand I just spent on a campout with the family and all the grand kids, nieces and nephews. Boy can those little buggers eat lol....I will look at trades but my taste in weapons runs pretty much one sided. I realize that this is a lot of money and most folks don't want to be in them as deep as I typically go. I am interested in trading for multiple guns as long as the value is there.

The frame is OD green, everything else is blued. The hammer is a Wilson to replace the locking mechanism that comes on Taurus 1911s. Several working parts have had the flats polished so they ride a bit smoother but there has been no work to lighten the trigger or alter the sear engagement. The grips are VZ grips and this includes 3 Chip McCormick magazines. Also included is a stamped leather holster and a blackhawk holster with paddle, belt loop and molle attachments. This pistol has only been to the range and back, so virtually no wear and with only 500 rounds through it it's barely started. A really nice pistol I'll miss when it's gone. Will include one box of Speer ammo.

This one is in very good condition with nice patina on the brass parts. It has been hanging on my living room wall over a gas fireplace for about 15 years or so. It is a fully functional rifle and has taken many deer, antelope, coyote etc. Miroku makes very nice replicas and also builds barrels for Browning and a few others so you know the quality is there. This is not one of the 2 piece welded barrels of the 70s. This is a nice, one piece full octagon barrel. I will also include two very old and authentic POWDER HORNS in this sale. I do not know the history of one of them buy I bought the other 20 some odd years ago from a 90 year old neighbor who received it used from his father way back in the day. Very cool item. I am pricing this entire package at just 250 and no, I am not going to dicker on the price. I am only looking for cash on this one due to the obvious fact that a 250 gun trade is not something that interests me. If you have something worth 350 or more and want to trade please send me detail and pics. Thank you for reading my ad.

This is a modern replica of the Cold Single Action Army and is a really good quality copy of it (in a modern caliber of course). The frame is color case hardened with a blued barrel/cylinder, brass trigger guard and walnut grips. I've had it for about 6 or 7 months and just don't use it as much as I anticipated. I've only shot one box of .357 through it and a couple hundred .38 specials so it's got a long life ahead of it. It has pretty much no wear on it, it's basically been locked away except when at the range. Included is a leather holster based on a historical one I saw, holster includes hammer thong. Will also give the buyer the box of .357 mag ammo I have, reloading dies, brass and a few hundred lead semi-wadcutters. Would be an excellent gun for Cowboy Action shooting with .38 loads and the reloading supplies will help get you set up for that too.

I'm at college right now, but before putting this rifle away for storage I thoroughly cleaned it (so OCD that I wear gloves while putting my rifles away as to not get potentially damaging fingerprints on their finishes... lol). Can't take pics as I'm in upstate NY until October 9th for fall break, so you'd have to wait until then to pick up your rifle. I cannot stress how, both cosmetically and functionally, this rifle is in mint condition. Comes with 2 Tapco magazines (blocked @ 15 rounds) and original box/literature/manual. Feel free to send a message with questions. A COE private party transfer is fine with me as long as buyer has NJ driver's license and FID. Thanks."

DMPS AR15. I built it up as a compact/lightweight rifle for new and smaller shooters. The upper is a factory DPMS 1/9 chambered in 5.56 with a shaved front sight post.

The rifle is in good condition as it only saw minimal range time and served primarily as a back up gun.

BNIB, as usual, with warranty and receipt. 

Thats a $350 gun on the second hand market, all day, and thats being generous.

Taxes and fees are what people pay when they buy a gun at an FFL, who will issue you a receipt for returns and the gun usually is also backed by a factory warranty. 
Otherwise, your taking your chances with someone else's gun and the thin guarantee of the sellers word. 
Unless the manufacturer honors warranties when the piece is sold second hand, which most do not, the new owner of your gun must pay out of pocket if it needs repair.

Your prices should reflect this.

Thats sort of the risk we all take when we buy a second hand gun on the second hand market, your prices should reflect that, and thats what makes this market unique and worthwhile- people can find deals here, but with the prices I'm seeing some of you asking, we might as well go to the nearest FFL. (and we'd STILL likely pay less, even AFTER the taxes lol).

I don't think alot of folks here seem to understand this.

Its like a car, the moment you drive it off the lot, its USED, and selling it after that does not command retail prices, let alone even MORE then retail. 

All this ""its like new in box I never fired it once I swear"" or ""its only had 20 rounds down range I promise"" is NOT a substitute for a receipt and factory warranty.

If you really wanna sell your gun offer people a reasonable deal, and that means you need to START at the used price end, not what you paid or what it goes for BNIB.

Is there any wonder why some listings just languish on the list for months on end?"

Buttstock length of pull is 13 1/4 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 3/4 inch recoil pad. Forend and buttstock have blued steel sling swivels. Buttstock has a 3/4 inch right hand cant, so this rifle is not altogether southpaw friendly. Weight empty is 6 pounds 9.5 ounces, with center of gravity at the receiverâs pivot pin. Overall length is a relatively compact 36 1/2 inches. Each R243 comes in its factory box with protective papers, instruction manual, safety flyers, two keys for its hammer lock, and factory registration card. Its size is about the same as competitor H&R, but a pound lighter. From our local shootersâ experience, the Rossi outshoots the H&R. Dealer cost on H&R Handi Rifles is $200 or more.

It has a 4150 nitrided barrel on an American made stamped receiver and was professionally built by an expert AK gunsmith using a virgin parts kit with matching serial numbers. It also has a beautiful KG Gun Kote finish, side rail, and a polished G2 FCG. Trust me, it runs very smooth and flawlessly. No canted sights or other issues whatsoever.
As much as I'd like to keep it, I haven't used it much and could use some cash right now...so it's up for grabs. It's literally only had a couple hundred rds through it, which is nothing for an AK with this type of barrel, and also comes with a steel 10rd mag/CA bullet button for compliance. You won't find a more reasonably priced AK with the same specs and quality without paying a grand or so.

The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armoryâs forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1Aâ¢ shooters have come to love and expect."
