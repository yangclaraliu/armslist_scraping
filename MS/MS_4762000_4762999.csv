Some fine speckling on the strap and here and there on the rest of the frame and cylinder. Red Head Holster is also quite nice although the snap is loose in the strap. Probably shouldnt be closed.
The pistol belonged to W.J. Alford, Maj USAA (ret) deceased. 
Maj Alford flew bombers in WW2 and was awarded the Air Medal along with other decorations. I believe he was on the Berlin raid in 1944. He was also one of the first 125 Master Aviators in the US Army, qualified in both fixed and rotary wing, single and multi-engine aircraft. Must have been one helluva pilot!

He carried this pistol as his personal sidearm when he was a pilot with MAAG [Military Assistance Advisory Group] during the mid 50's in Viet Nam.

I have a Letter of Authenticity and Provenance from Maj Alford's son attesting to all of the above. 

An excellent addition to any collection or a dang fine shooter. Serious offers considered and I am willing to trade. What do you have?

                     done correctly. Collectors do not want a rifle altered in any way from
                     original specifications. This is why Counter Boring has a bad rap.

I'm updating the listing as the deal scheduled fell through.  This is the Gen 2 model and is almost two years old.  It is a piston AR, with four position gas regulator, and functions flawlessly. There are multiple varieties of ARs on the market today but the 516 is definitely one of the best and on the high end. The original pistol grip and stock have been replaced with Daniel Defense furniture but the originals will be included. The rifle has had less than 200 rounds through it and comes with the original box (the serial numbers on the box and rifle match, as you would expect). The number of magazines included is negotiable. Please feel free to ask any questions. I prefer to sell the rifle outright but I will entertain partial trades on the items below."

Mint condition 1911 from Browning in .380 auto, awesome carry gun because this is a true 1911 built at 85% scale, just right for carry, your hands, and for .380. I've only put two boxes of 50 rounds through it.
See their site for full details: http://www.browning.com/products/interactive/firearms/1911-380/


This one comes with an extra 8-round mag (total of 2), which retail at $40, as well as a custom-fitted leather IWB touchable holster, the Pro TL (Thin-Line) from HBE Leatherworks. He is a master holster maker, and this one is perfect for the slim profile you're looking for since the clip is offset from the body of the firearm. The holster cost me $115.

Make me an offer! This is a beautiful piece and everyone who sees it totally swoons. Feel free to come check it out in person, if you're in the area.
Face to face only; buyer must have good guy IDs and be willing to sign a bill of sale.

Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?The XD-S Single Stack from Springfield Armory has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you're used to in the XD and XD(M) lines can be packed in the shockingly slim XD-S Single Stack - pistol that packs so easily you'll forget it's there.The XD-S is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.The strengths of the XD-S 3.3 Inch Single Stack doesn't stop there. Try it with an X-Tension magazine (7 rounds), and you'll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics - complete with two interchangeable backstraps - allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, grip safety, loaded chamber indication, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD pistols safe and easy to use.Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn't have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don't have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don't have to carry a gun to the store that you'd rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S 3.3 Inch Single Stack in your hand today, and you'll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you'll find that it's noticeably unnoticeable.SpecificationsCaliber.45 ACPRecoil SystemDual Spring with Full Length Guide RodSightsFiber Optic Front and Dovetail Rear (Steel)Weight (With Empty Magazine)21.5 ouncesHeight4.4 Inches with Compact Magazine5 Inches with Mid-Mag X-TensionSlideForged SteelMelonite FinishBarrel3.3 inch Hammer Forged / SteelMelonite / 1:16 TwistLength6.3 inchesGrip Width.9 inchesFrameBlack PolymerMagazines1-5 Round Flush Fitting1-6 Round with Mid-Mag X-TensionStainless Steel"

The Ultra Dual Shot Pro Spec Night Vision QD Reflex Sight from Sightmark® delivers not one, but two ways to dial in with pinpoint accuracy. Featuring a side-mounted red laser for quick target acquisition, the shooter can fire quickly in close-quarter situations such as tactical training situations and three-gun matches. When sighting through the dual-pane glass, users can customize their view with one of the four illuminated reticle patterns. The Ultra Dual Shot is equipped with a night vision mode, allowing shooters to mount the device in front of a night vision monocular and create a co-witnessed riflescope set up. Its featured double-pane glass lens system eliminates parallax and retains accuracy when Fired from the periphery of the lens. Users can quickly and effectively adapt their firearm to the situation at hand with the included quick-detach mount. Its Interlok™ internal locking system of the Ultra Dual Shot holds zero extremely well, so the shooter does not have to continually re-adjust the sight in the field. The all-aluminum construction enhances durability, making it operable in various environments and situations."

1979 Pre-ban Cobray SM10 SAC
(not SAP...this is stamped ""C"" for carbine!!! VERY RARE!)

made by RPB industries.

This is a very rare open bolt design as well!! In the short run that these were made before the ban, 250 were produced in each caliber (the sM11 in .380, and the sM10 in both 9mm, and .45acp). Ive been told many were destroyed, and are extremely hard to find especially in .45
This gun is extremely solid! One hell of a tank of a gun!
Comes with 2 30 round .45 magazines **note - Stock is fixed, not collapsible.

DONT MISS OUT ON THIS EXTREMELY RARE PIECE!! YOU WONT SEE ANOTHER ONE!!
***DONT BE FOOLED BY OTHER M10 ""CARBINES"" THAT ARE STILL MARKED ""SAP""...THIS IS THE REAL DEAL ""SAC"" CARBINE STRAIGHT FROM RPB INDUSTRIES***

RPB (which has been rumored to stand for Rape, Pillage, and Burn... but actually stands for the initials of the company founders) manufactured the only semi auto open bolt variety of the M10 ever made

In 1979, Wayne Daniel manufactured a semi auto only version and somehow (miraculously, I still don't know how he pulled it off) was able to get the BATFE to approve it as a Title 1 firearm i.e. a 'Regular' gun. The open bolt semi auto M10 pistol manufactured by RPB were initially made using surplus SMG parts bought from Military Armaments Corporation when they went out of buisness in 1978.

The period of manufacture was short lived however as in 1982 - the BATFE reversed its decision on approving the open bolt semi auto guns when it was found that they were easily converted to full auto. Effective June 21st 1982, any new M10's made as open bolt pistols were to be considered Title 2 firearms (i.e. machine guns)...

These were produced for less than 3 years and can never be made again.

In case you don't believe that there is any way this can be legal please read the following text of the ATF decision rule 82-2 which banned any more of these from being made but (luckily for you) allowed the ones already in circulation to be grandfathered.

ATF Rul. 82-8 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has reexamined firearms identified as SM10 pistols, SM11A1 pistols, and SAC carbines. The SM10 is a 9 millimeter or .45ACP caliber, semiautomatic firearm; the SM11A1 is a .380ACP caliber, semiautomatic firearm; and the SAC carbine is a 9 millimeter or .45ACP caliber, semiautomatic firearm. The weapons are blowback operated, fire from the open bolt position with the bolt incorporating a fixed firing pin, and the barrels of the pistols are threaded to accept a silencer. In addition, component parts of the weapons are a disconnector and a trip which prevent more than one shot being fired with a single function of the trigger. The disconnector and trip are designed in the SM10 and SM11A1 pistols and in the SAC carbine (firearms) in such a way that a simple modification to them, such as cutting, filing, or grinding, allows the firearms to operate automatically. Thus, this simple modification to the disconnector or trip, together with the configuration of the above design features (blowback operating, firing from the open bolt position, and fixed firing pin) in the SM10 and SM11A1 pistols and in the SAC carbine, permits the firearms to shoot automatically, more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. The above combination of design features as employed in the SM10 and SM11A1 pistols and the SAC carbine are normally not found in typical sporting firearms. The National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C. § 5845(b), defines a machinegun to include any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. The ""shoots automatically"" definition covers weapons that will function automatically. The ""readily restorable"" definition defines weapons which previously could shoot automatically but will not in their present condition. The ""designed"" definition includes those weapons which have not previously functioned as machineguns but possess design features which facilitate full automatic fire by a simple modification or elimination of existing component parts. Held: The SM10 and SM11A1 pistols and the SAC carbine are designed to shoot automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. Consequently, the SM10 and SM11A1 pistols and SAC carbines are machineguns as defined in Section 5845(b) of the Act. With respect to the machinegun classification of the SM10 and SM11A1 pistols and SAC carbines, under the National Firearms Act, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 7805(b), this ruling will not be applied to SM10 and SM11A1 pistols and SAC carbines manufactured or assembled before June 21, 1982. Accordingly, SM10 and SM11A1 pistols and SAC carbines, manufactured or assembled on or after June 21, 1982, will be subject to all the provisions of the National Firearms Act and 27 C.F.R. Part 179.

Up for sale is a BRAND NEW Vulcan Armament V-50. The V50SS-300 rifle features a massive SAE 4150 receiver and a three lug bolt with a 60-degree bolt throw, cock on opening action, a shell holder type extractor for absolutely positive extraction, and a machined aircraft grade aluminum stock. The barrel is machined from ordnance grade, chrome moly, high vanadium steel hardened to Rc 28-32. The barrel is 30” long, has 8 grooves, 1-15” right hand twist and features a SAAMI spec chamber which will allow the use of any SAAMI spec ammo. The barrel and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished for long lasting good looks and corrosion protection. The V50SS utilizes the time proven standard, '98 Mauser trigger system for absolute safety. This rifle also features a high efficiency ""shark fin"" muzzle break, machined from solid bar stock and threaded on to the muzzle of the barrel with 1-12 TPI threads. This muzzle break is designed to reduce felt recoil to that of a 12 ga. Shotgun. The muzzle break can be “Tuned” to the barrel by altering the length via the long thread shank. This feature allows the operator to find the “sweet spot” for the break that gives the best accuracy. An M1913 Picatinny scope rail is attached via oversized grade 8 allen screws for easy mounting of optics. The oversized recoil shoulder distributes the recoil over a large surface area affording rock solid mounting to the stock. The bolt has three huge locking surfaces and a 60 degree throw. It features a “primary extraction” cam for positive extraction of the case. The receiver is machined from bar stock SAE 4150 steel and features pressure release vents for BOTH case separation and primer pierce, making this one of the strongest, safest actions available. We have tested these actions and bolts to pressures exceeding 100,000 psi with no evidence of failure. The stock is machined from aircraft aluminum bar stock. This stock is made to machine tool tolerances and is completely impervious to climate and temperature. It is attached to an aluminum buttstock with a shock absorbing recoil to further reduce felt recoil and allow the shooter to comfortably shoot all day. A bipod mounting rod is threaded into the stock, securing the oversized recoil shoulder and locking the recoil shoulder to the stock for increased accuracy. The Specs on the rifle are: Overall Length: 52"" / 1321mm
Barrel Length: 30” / 762mm
Barrel Twist: 1-15"" / 1/381mm, RH, 8 groove
Weight: 30.0 Lbs / 13.6 kg
Recoil: 19 ft/lbs / 2.62 kg/m / 25.7 Joules No scope or bi-pod... Will sell for $1500 and have 200 rounds of ball ammo for additional $... Trades of Saiga 12 shotguns, or PSL-54c rifles considered... REDACTED"

Benelli's SuperNova Tactical embodies a modular design concept in a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. At the heart of this pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the SuperNova Tactical super-light, super-strong, and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova Tactical isn't just tough on the outside. Dual-action bars and a two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel ensures that the SuperNova Tactical is rock solid to the core and capable of handling everything from 2-3/4"" light loads to 3-1/2"" Magnums.

This SuperNova Tactical comes with newly designed, military-style ghost-ring sights (the harder to find version, sold out just about everywhere). The rear sight is click-adjustable for both windage and elevation. A magazine cut-off on the forearm allows for safe carry with a full magazine and empty chamber. The top of the SuperNova's receiver is drilled and tapped to accommodate easy attachment of military-style optics.


Benelli’s SuperNova Tactical is a modular concept pump action shotgun, that can be configured to fit any defense or tactical situation. The ComforTech stock absorbs nearly 48% of felt recoil to dampen the recoil of heavy buck shot loads. In addition to taming recoil, the ComforTech system minimizes barrel climb, putting you back on target twice as fast as other comparable shotguns. For tight quarters when clearing buildings or in a patrol vehicle nothing beats the compact versatility of the SuperNova.

This Benelli Supernova Tactical (20155) is a pump action shotgun that fires the 12 gauge shell. It has an 18.5” cylinder chrome lined barrel, overall 40"" length, 2-3/4"", 3"", & 3.5"" chamber, with a matte black finish. 7.8 lbs unloaded. This is a brand new shotgun that holds 5 shells (4+1 capacity) and comes complete with a Comfortech stock, receiver, barrel, ghost ring sights, stock shims, etc., manual, warranty card, and a box. Complete! All Mint, NIB. Many options available.

The Benelli SuperNova embodies a modular design concept in a pump action shotgun. It’s like having several Benelli shotguns in one.

With a quick draw in mind, the Glock 81 comes with a matching kydex sheath, the same durable polymer used in Glock pistols.

Glock knives were developed in close cooperation with the special forces of the Austrian Army. Glock Field Knives are known for their outstanding ruggedness which offers a wide range of applications - starting from a ""First Aid"" knife inside the car to a bone crushing knife for hunters. The cross bar protects the hand from injuries and can be used as a thumb rest and as a bottle opener. In addition, Glock knives are sturdy enough to break windows and ammunition boxes, requirements by Armed Forces. 

Made in Austria and perfectly balanced for throwing and sturdy enough to dig in rocky soil, the Glock 81 with it's sawbuck feature is designed to be used to dig and cut through roots as well as saw small to medium tree branches. This is an amazing knife for the money. Don't go hunting without one!! Email here at CL for more info. Thanks!"
