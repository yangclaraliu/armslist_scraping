Numbers matching 1944 Finnish Mosin Nagant VKT(Valmet) Manufacture. 

Beautiful rifle, no rust, cosmoline free, well oiled, smooth bolt, very accurate. The rifling is very strong and the bore is in great condition, I will send you a picture of the bore upon your request.

This rifle has a VKT barrel, which is regarded as a nearly match grade quality barrel, my groups at 100 yards with this rifle can attest to that. This rifle also bears AZF markings on the receiver, indicating that the receiver was originally Austrio-hungarian. A true collectors piece, yet a highly accurate and reliable firearm.

The M39 was the Finnish rendition of the Mosin Nagant in WWII. The Finns kept the hex receiver, magazine and bolt from a Russian model 91 Mosin and replaced everything else. 

The Finn upgrades included: a heavier stock, new heavier barrel bands, upgraded sights, crisp two stage trigger, a cleaning rod unique to the M39 and the ability to mount a sling under the rifle in a traditional manner or on the side in a cavalry/ski troop method.

There was no option for DDI (Destructive Devices Industries) as the manufacturer so I chose Saiga. This is not a Saiga. It is made in the US by DDI in Knoxville, TN. I purchased this milled receiver AK47 in early December 2015 and then found a Soviet made one that I wanted all along. My good luck is also your good luck. I spent two weeks refinishing the wood to a more traditional darker color and replaced the Bakelite (plastic) handle with a real wood handle. This gun looks amazing now. I added an AKML style flash suppressor. You will get the bakelite handle and the original muzzle brake. Here is the description from Atlantic Firearms where I purchased this DDI (Destructive Devices Industries) built AK47. You can see the pictures of the lighter wood that the gun had before I stained it. DDI Hammer Forged Milled AK-47 Wood Fixed Stock, 7.62x39mm These new AK-47's from DDI are the cream of the crop: built on a new hammer forged milled receiver sporting a heavy profile chrome-lined Green Mountain barrel (14x1LH w/slant brake) providing for exceptional performance in both accuracy and reliability. Coated in a sleek black KG Gunkote finish and topped off with Polish wood stock and handguards, these rifles look incredible and are built to last. Includes one 30rd magazine. I registered the gun with DDI for their 3 year warranty. What I paid: AK47 with one 15 round magazine - $979 + $30 shipping, Plano 42” case - $85, 75 round drum - $90, Soviet cleaning kit that fits in butt stock - $7, wood pistol grip handle - $17, side mount for top rail to mount sight - $28, AIM Sports red and green reticle Reflex Sight with 2 batteries - $52, AKML style flash suppressor - $43, Padlock for case - $16, my time to refinish the wood - priceless. Total that I paid - $1,347 Your price - $1,200.  No trades.  I spent 3 weeks and a lot of time buying all of this and you get to purchase it all with next to no time invested. FFL transfer only. You pay $35 shipping if outside of Columbus, OH. This sale will require transfer of ownership through an FFL gun dealer."

No excessive wear/flame cut tops trap/etc. I am selling since I upgraded to a 460 smith x frame.  In case your wondering the recoil really isn't that bad due to the weight of the gun. I will throw in 14 rounds of 45colt ammo and 6 rounds of 454 ammo.  I would entertain trades for a BFR revolver or lever gun."
