Bent Bolt
Drilled and tapped optic rail. Weaver/Picatiny rail installed
Strong and visible rifling in the barrel.
2- Gun comes with two 10 rounds magazines and a 5 rounds one. The magazine are the updated ones. Promag exchanged the first generation mags that originally came with the stock.  
- No scope. 
This gun is fun to shoot.  People always ask me after they hear the first shot what gun is it and what caliber ammo I'm shooting.  If you do your part with good optics,  hitting a target at up to 1000 yards is not hard at all. Check YouTube videos for yourself.  

Scope and bipod not included. 
P.S: The mosin and it's ammo are getting harder and harder to come across due to the U.S ban on Russian import.  
The nagant (9130), if you can find one cost around $200, the 10 rounds magazines are $25 each,  Gunsmithing Work (Bent Bolt and the custom scope mount) cost more than $200, the promag Tactical stock cost $150 to $175. Do the math!

This gun was made by a very good private GunSmith, utilizing all quality parts. The gun was fitted with an (oldschool spot-on) point of aim shooting American Military Colt/Springfield National Match team barrel with the 7791193 number rollmark. I am not a history perfectionist about the 779 NM barrels, but I did research the net like crazy to conclude this as factual. The National Match numbers are shown on the barrel hood in the photos and match the time line of the U.S. Military's 1960's production barrels (sometime around or before 1963). This barrel is hard as the dickens and was RC hardness tested by my GunSmith to prove it. He schooled me on the fascinating history of military barrels and all the great stories behind them. It is configured and fit to shoot fast and on target. This entire 1911 gun has a dark Parkerized type color, which is a PolyKote/duracoat Baked on type finish. Please stop to look at the great condition and nice looking 45 Gold Cup style 1911. It has a really nice flat top and serrations, Gold Cup Style like the Colt Gold Cup. Please also review the photos to see the Gun's set up and well put together configuration. This very well balanced and professionally fitted combo, sports a full size 5 inch 7791193 Match/Military barrel. The Slide to frame fit was well executed and the gun is filled with good parts. This oldschool Goldcup Style 1911 was outfitted with a real nicely lined up sight combination with a front night sight shown in the photos, that blows away the 10 Ring on targets. I personally test fired it with my local GunSmith Steve Fischer who is a well known GunSmith here in Florida. We were impressed by the old National Match barrel. The rear sight is really nicely lined up to the GoldCup style flat top serrations, making it a nice aesthetic combination. The gun was neatly fit overall and has functioning a Match grade extractor and ejector fitted to it. The hammer is a Chip McKormick Kimber style hammer. The Caspian frame also has a high ride Chip McKormick grip safety fitted to it for a high hold grip so you can line up a nice point of aim shot. This full size metal monster has a great Magwell and Kimber grip set, which provides a positive purchase grip when held. This nice grip it has also helps to blast your target's bullseye away. The frame Magwell and high hold allows fast magazine reloads. It has an ingenious Caspain integral MagWell that really does make a real difference when reloading. As you can see in the photos, it also has a race extended Magazine thumb release for super speedy reloading action. It was coated very nicely, as shown in the pictures and sports some nice and neat Kimber full size magazine-well grips. This gun is a nice treat to take to the range or to your local 1911 gun shooting competition. It has a very low round count, which were fired during the professional test fire my GunSmith performed. I got to shoot a couple magazines worth while he test fired it and I was impressed with the GoldCup style flat top sight plain, and it's sight line up. I am pricing this one lower than my other high end auctions, for what should be an easy and quick sale. It handles more like shooting a 6 inch or 7 inch length barrel 1911, because this gun is solid steel throughout the entire gun. It is filled with quality american parts. I will hate to see this gun go but I need the money. It's another 1911 work of art I photographed with a high quality and high resolution digital camera with 14 megapixels. So what you see is what you get, and is without a doubt quite the shooter for race competition or home defense. This 1911 comes with one Colt magazine that was tuned to the gun by Professional Master GunSmith Steve Fischer, from here in Sunny South Florida. Happy bidding and good luck. Thank you for looking at my auctions. There will be more to come so keep in tune. Before we move on to the rules and payment section of the description... Please allow me to take this time to expand on Fischer's background and facts, as a true Master GunSmith. Steve Fischer is an old buddy of the world famous Wayne Novak, whom I have had the pleasure of meeting. They went to GunSmith School together in the same Class in Colorado over three decades ago, and they graduated from the GunSmith school together. Both men graduating from the same class set out to be partners and legends. They started their careers together working for Armand Swenson. Swenson stole the first idea on Dovetail sights that Wayne Novak firstly invented back then. After a confrontation in regards to this fall out with Swenson... Novak and Fischer quit. Both acclaimed men told me the story along the lines of that in addition to Wayne's idea and first sight design being robbed of him... they both told me the story with a smile, that the Armand parts were out of spec all the time and so hard to work with. They both claim and explained, they ""made one gun in the time they could have made 4 if they were using better parts."" So they learned a hard lesson and broke free, quitting Swenson's ""sweatshop"" and workbench. They left the mediocre Armand Swenson outfit and assembly line, to begin their personal rise above the rest of the 1911 world at the time. They began expanding their explosive careers as GunSmiths, and the rest as you know is history. We all know Wayne Novak for his sights and great gunwork. Steve Fischer, Novak's old colleague went on to work for Colt as one of the lead GunSmiths. From there Steve Fischer went onward to open his own successful GunSmith operation, which has stayed open in sunny south Florida for over 3 decades. Steve is also a champ competition shooter, and he still wins Shotgun matches held yearly in Minneapolis to this day. Additionally Steve is so Old-School, he even knows how to shoot from the hip and smokes the competition in whatever style of shooting he chooses. He looks like a battle troll when I go shooting with him. It is a strange unexpected and powerful metamorphosis to see this 71 year old man go from a regular guy into shooting mode. It almost looks like an ora glows around him and he transforms into like some kind of troll or a stalky looking battle dwarf-thing from Lord of the Rings. A real treat to learn from and have as a friend. I have seen the old battle hound at work and it is no joke. Fischer is also the first GunSmith to make a compensated 40 caliber 1911, shown in an old 80's Gun News Gun Magazine back in the year 1980. Steve worked and built up the gun shown in the photos, helping to make it a real master piece in gun mechanics. In addition to the work Fischer did on this gun for me to tune it up, Fischer tuned a nice magazine up to be mated to this speedy and highly responsive race gun... What Fischer did was he timed and tested the innards of the mag in mention, utilizing a CobraMag spring for this gun's Colt Magazine. F.y.i. CobraMag and CobrMag parts are made by the ever famous 2010 American PistolSmith Guild's award winner. Whose CobraMag from Trippreasearch dot com, holds the world record of the only 1911 magazine to pass a 55,000 (sick and grueling) round test without failure. That's right, astounding and out of this world! You heard/read it right... 55,000 rounds blasting off without a hiccup, jam, or hitch. Damn that is a nasty record my friends!!! So in other words this gun including the magazine has been tuned to run superbly for your enjoyment at the range, shooting tactical course, or save your bacon in a self defense situation when the chips are down with your a** on the line. Please take a good look at this gun, it is frikkin' awesome! The trigger on this gun and trigger job is superb. Check it out in the photos. Picture 4 & 9 shows the almost unnoticeable small blemish between the word ""automatic"" and the number ""45"" on the slide, it is minor and the finish is intact. If I remember correctly the Trigger is either a new old stock Chip McKormick or is a N.O.S. Dan Wesson trigger. To all you decent and classy GunBroker users, don't miss out on this bargain priced RaceGun 1911. Go ahead start bidding. It takes quite a bit of money to produce this gun. If you know about the 1911 game, you have already realized this. So do not question or belittle the bargain price this one of a kind gun is offered at. ** ** ** The next section of this ad is for payment purposes and the rules of this auction. It emphasizes my requirements to participate with positive and decent minded responsible Gunbroker users.

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns â¦ and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

The easily concealable Springfield XD(M) has a 3.8"" match-grade barrel. Its compact nature and easy-to-grip handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant MeloniteÂ® finish. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger Systemâ¢ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XDM gear package. Includes: interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit, a holster, a double-magazine carrier, two magazines, magazine loader and a black hard case."

Only this one comes with a threaded barrel, front cocking serrations on the slide, and the SRT Trigger System. The SRT (Short Reset Trigger) is designed to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent characteristics of the P239 are the result of âperformance engineeringâ and itâs one of the keys to all SIG SAUERÂ® pistols. The P239 tactical is available in 9mm.

While popularly priced, it offers the aesthetics and materials of the premium over-unders. The frame has extensive, but refined, floral and scroll decoration that will make this shotgun a source of pride for years to come. The oil-finished stock is select walnut finish. It has the same dual-conical locking mechanism that lets Beretta over-unders stand up to years of constant shooting and to be passed on from generation to generation. Placing the locks between the barrels allows a low frame profile that gives Beretta over-unders an unmatched lively feel and natural pointability.

Les Baer Description:

http://lesbaer.com/boss45-2.html

A fitting tribute to the high performance 1970s muscle car that inspired it. Les Baer is still the king of custom built 1911 pistols in addition to being a well known aficionado of high performance American muscle cars. Thatâs why Les named his newest 1911 model after the Boss 429 Mustangs he admires above all other cars. Like our entire pistol line, our newest .45 is based on our popular Premier II, but it has enough thoughtful extra touches to really make it the new Boss of custom .45s. As with our other pistols, the new Boss is guaranteed to shoot 3â groups at 50 yards. Special 
features include:

â¢ Rear cocking serrations on the slide â¢ Baer fiber optic front sight (red) â¢ Flat mainspring housing, checkered at 20 lpi â¢ Extended combat safety â¢ Special tactical package â¢ Chromed complete lower â¢ Blued slide â¢ (2) 8-round premium magazines

Silver coins are the most dynamic form of silver in that they serve as both a type of bullion investment and as a collectible. Though some coins are more expensive than others, virtually all of them are going to be sold at a fair amount over the spot price of silver per ounce.
The reason that coins cost more than a round or bar of comparable weight is found in their scarcity and, in return, their demand. Coins have a much higher secondary market demand than any other piece of silver because they canât simply be replicated at will. A bar, round, or other piece of raw silver can be minted by any company. A coin, on the other hand, is usually produced in liamited quantities and is only made by one particular mint. In the end, coins are very popular among collectors, and when you combine that with the value of silver you will end up with an expensive item."

The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolmanâs Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel). The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a âbirdcageâ type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon.Â  Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling. The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. The A3 Type Patrolmanâs Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage). Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiverâs integral Picatinny rail.

Hi All. As Pictured is a Very Nice ""Arsenal Factory 26"" T53 T-53 Mosin Nagant CARBINE for Sale! Own a nice piece of history as these haven't been made in awhile & the Market is Drying Up really fast. These are the mirrored copy of a Russian M44. The Soviet Union sent RailCars filled with newly mfr.'d Mosin M44 parts to China after WW2. The Bolts, Barrels, Triggers etc.,all have Russian markings on the T53's. Only thing Chinese about them is the Chinese Lettering Stamped on the parts and some Wood Stocks that were fitted to them. Look it up! Very Facinating!

-A Very smooth bolt action. Smoothest I've ever handled for a Mosin -loaded or not. Actually, smoother than most modern bolt actions I've handled! I Have Snap Caps (dummy rounds) so you can test it in person.
-This T53 has absolutely NO Trigger Play, No Trigger Creep and No Trigger Holdup. This Trigger is light, crisp and Smooth.
-Matching Serial No.'s almost everywhere -the Receiver, the Magazine Box, Trigger Area, & the Bolt. 
-The bore still has good rifling and has an outstanding Crown as well.,
-Comes with the Appropriate Sling in great collector's condition. (pictured)
-RARE 1955 Manufacturer Date. Search & Read online forums.
