Up for trade is a beautiful ruger security six, 4"" heavy barrel stainless version. This revolver comes with the original Box, paperwork, hogue grip and the orginal factory wood grips. From what I can find it was made in 1980. It's in very good shape. I just picked this up in trade an figures I would see if I can find something else I was looking for before I decided to hang onto it. It was part of the personal collection of a local gun store owner. Trades are listed below. 

Quality mountain bike with 19""-20"" frame. 29'er preferred but will consider 26"" tires as well. Must have disc breaks, and front suspension. Not interested in Walmart bikes. Looking for something that can handle some abuse. Trek, cannondale, Gary fisher, specialized, etc. I don't mind if it has some scratches but it must be 100% mechanically. 

Honda Yamaha Suzuki 4 stroke 65-100cc dirt bike. I can add some
223 ammo if need be.

This fantastic shooting pistol has a Match Grade ramped barrel and skeletonized Match Grade trigger and hammer.  It is one of the most accurate pistols I have ever shot, and can shoot one ragged hole out of the center of the target at 15 yards standing off-hand.  This pistol comes tricked out from the Para factory for shooting competition, and it is ready to go to work right out of the box.  Bright green Fiber Optic front sight leaps out at you for quick and easy target acquisition, adjustable rear target sight.  Very smooth and even trigger pull.  FTF Sale or trade to a Kentucky Resident ONLY with valid photo ID or DL. KCCDW permit holder strongly preferred.  Gun is for sale in the Lexington area.  MSRP is almost $1500, get this one for almost half that and it is impossible to tell it from a brand new one.  Comes with everything just as if you bought it brand new yourself, including 2 mags that hold 18 rounds each.  VZ Operator G10 grips are standard.  Perfect pistol for IDPA, or IPSC, USPSA shooting competitions, or if you just want a great shooting 1911 that uses MUCH cheaper ammo.

Perfect for those who have a hard time racking a slide. Would make an awsome back up weapon. This weapon can also be chambered by pulling the slide like a typical semi auto.

The Firepower of the “Spencer” Carbines was apparent in the action at Parker’s Store in the densely wooded area of the Wilderness on the morning on May 5, 1864.The 500 members of the Fifth New York Cavalry dismounted and formed a loose skirmish line, and there they were attacked by a division of Confederate infantry. For three hours the men of the Fifth held off the Southern attacks until they started to run out of ammunition for their Spencers, which forced the Federals to pull back. The Confederates opposing them believed that they had been fighting an entire brigade. The Fifth New York suffered about 80 casualties in the action.
The field reports from 10 officers of the Fourth U.S. Cavalry rated the Spencer carbine the best arm in cavalry service. Brevet Maj. Gen. James Wilson felt that the Spencers were the best firearms ever put into the hands of the soldier. He stated that the Spencer “excels all others in use in durability, rapidity of fire, and general effectiveness.”
Model 1865 Spencer Carbines
The fall of 1864 and the early months of 1865 saw three major changes to the Spencer carbines being delivered on existing Army contracts, resulting in a nomenclature change to the Model 1865. In November 1864, the Ordnance Dept. directed that the carbines be chambered for the new standard rimfire round, .56-50, replacing the .56-56. The new .56-50 ammunition could chamber in the older M1860 carbines, but the earlier .56-56 would not chamber in the new carbines. The .56-50-chambered guns were stamped on the receiver “Model 1865,” and the barrel length was shortened to 20 inches.
One final improvement was the March 1865 incorporation of the Stabler cut-off attachment, which was invented by Edward Stabler of Sandy Springs, Md. It allowed the carbine to be fired as a single-shot with the seven cartridges in the magazine being held in reserve. Stabler was paid a royalty of 25 cents for each carbine fabricated with his magazine cut-off device.

Removable Novak sights. I replaced the original case with an upgraded Beretta handgun case. Excellent condition, like new. No exterior signs of wear. I bought it new in box in 2008 (still have papers) and have shot only about 200-300 rounds through the gun. Since then, it’s been stored in its case in my home. The only signs of slight wear are on the exterior of the magazines which is to be expected. According to my research, the Elite II model was only made from 2001 – 2006 and then it was discontinued. It’s a truly unique handgun! The Elite II Brigadier model features a stainless steel slide that is 60g heavier and wider to improve control when firing multiple shots in quick succession or when using +P ammunition. The frame is aluminum and the grips are the original factory non-slip grips. The 96G was designed mainly for law enforcement or competition applications and thus does NOT have a safety. The de-cocking lever safely releases the trigger to a safe carrying position. Once de-cocked, a double action trigger pull is required to fire the gun. As with other Berettas, this gun has an internal firing pin safety so the gun cannot be fired without pulling the trigger."

Cash only please and no shipping.  As you can see I am not looking to get rich on any of this so my prices are firm although I would entertain a small discount if one buyer takes all.  They are already at or below market value and that is IF you could find any of them in stock.
Also always interested in interesting trades.  Let me know what you have.
Thank you"

I haven't had it for very long, a year or less.  This is an older gun, I looked up the first three digits of the serial number and it looks like this one was manufactured in June of 92.  The basics of this gun are easily available online so I'll stick to the specifics of this one.  It has an adjustable rear sight.  The barrel has been replaced so the serial number doesn't match whats on the frame.  The serial numbers on the frame and slide do match.  Very little finish wear.  Inside looks just as good as my 2 year old Gen 3 Glock 26. Its accurate and reliable and seems to perform better when being shot rapid fire.  Comes with two magazines (10 round), speed loader, case, some factory paperwork and a thumb drive with an owners manual I downloaded. There is nothing wrong with this pistol its just a little wide for me.  It would probably feel better for a bigger guy, I'm 5' 5"" so my hands don't wrap around this thing as good as my 1911.  Most women would not like this gun. I'd rather trade for a smaller semi auto pistol but I'd sell it as well.  We could add a little money on either side depending on value.
