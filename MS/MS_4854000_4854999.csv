If you're not familiar with Lucid read up on them a bit. It's a great red dot, built to withstand a serious beating. I've had it on my Rock River AR10 for about 120 rounds, dot never budged since sighted in. I've been debating selling for a while, and reluctantly am only to fund a scope purchase for some longer range fun. I paid over $400 plus tax for them, asking $250 or a reasonable offer.

This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. The action of the M6A2 rifle is coated in a proprietary nickel coating that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. All M6A2 rifles come standard with the Enhanced Fire Control Group. The M6A2 rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and these M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design. *****ACOG w/kill flash, in box with tan molle pouch & lens pen & manual,Trijicon TA31RCO-M4CP ACOG 4x32 Scope with BAC USMC Rifle Optic (RCO) for M4 incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. The Trijicon TA31RCO-M4 ACOG 4x32 USMC M4 Tactical Scope includes the Tritium that illuminates the aiming point in total darkness and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. *****BETA Mag 100 round drum with speed loader and molle carrying case, BetaCo's 100 round drums are the ultimate high capacity magazines. These magazines are made from tough polymer with steel and aluminum internals. BetaCo's magazines can be loaded and stored indefinitely, and still deliver 1,500 rounds per minute! Each magazine comes with a black carrying pouch, graphite lube, technical manual, and speed loading tool. *****10/ 30 round magazines MIL-SPEC, Flip up iron sights, SureFire features white-light and infrared primary-illumination *****Grip Pod LE, Forend Automatic Bipod & Vertical

It was re-chambered to 7mm STW by Bob Laus of Precision Guns, near Oshkosh, WI.  The bolt is the controlled round feed (Mauser) style.  The rifle is fitted with a Leupold, two piece base and rings (matte finish).  I fired 324 rounds through this rifle.  My hunting loads print into 1.75 inches at 200 yards.  The rifle is in excellent condition.  The rate of firing of ammunition was always carefully controlled to avoid excessive barrel heating.  I have RCBS dies and brass (fired and new) available for this rifle.

This is an AK-47 (AKM) rifle made in Romania and imported to the U.S. during the mid-1990s. It’s generally considered higher quality than the WASR-10s as it’s built on a mil-spec AKM (stamped) receiver accepting all high capacity AK magazines, versus the WASR-10 which was a single-stack receiver “modified” to accept high capacity magazines.

I purchased this rifle new in the 90s from one of the Shotgun News distributors. I’ve fired it approximately 3 times with a total of maybe 120 rounds. All ammo was quality brass case and non-corrosive, and I thoroughly cleaned rifle immediately after shooting each time (Marine Corps Q-tip style); thusly the rifle is basically like new. It comes with a scope mount which attaches to the factory side rail and a Leapers scope (scope is nothing special, consider it a freebee), the sling (new in packaging), the original low-cap magazine (if you want to hunt with it), 4 East German surplus 30 round magazines, 1 East German canvas magazine pouch, and the owner’s manual. No box.

Original PE sniper rifle. I had the bolt turned down to original configuration. Original scope mount holes were plugged but are still visible. Overall good shape, NOT counter-bored. I added a ""smith-sights"" front sight, which is a reworked original sight with an adjustable post rather than the fixed post, which helps more easily solve the elevation issues with the iron sights. Also has a slightly ""modified"" trigger which is just a thin washer added to the trigger spring screw, and an additional spring added to remove some of the slop from the trigger. These additions make it lighter and give it a ""2 stage feel"".   It also has a rubber recoil pad, I have the original metal plate as well.

Info regarding rifle:
Kel-Tec CMR-30 Rifle is chambered for the .22WMR cartridge (22 Magnum). The design is a rifle version of the popular Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol. The same 30 round magazines are used. The single action trigger mechanism, bolt stop, ambidextrous safety levers, and mag catch are also identical. The CMR-30 rifle includes a collapsible stock and the 16” barrel is threaded 1/2”-28 to accept many different muzzle attachments. The multi-position collapsible stock allows for a short overall length of 22.7” with the stock collapsed, and 30.6” when extended. The long top picatinny rail will accept a multitude of different optics, and the removable under picatinny rail is included. The ambidextrous operating handles are non-reciprocating and latch in the forward position. The stock latch lever is also ambidextrous and located just in front of the trigger guard. An integral sling loop is included near the rear of the grip, on both sides.

The CMR-30 is constructed of hard-coat anodized aluminum for the upper assembly and rails and houses the steel barrel. The collapsible stock is made with aluminum stock rods, and a nylon butt plate. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum. The bolt assembly houses a captive recoil spring assembly. Magpul® flip-up sights included.

The extensive use of aluminum, and a lock time lower than most bolt action rifles makes the CMR-30 a very accurate rifle.

Custom Machined from solid Bar Stock of Chrome-Moly Steel Hardened to 26-32 RC Spec and then Cryogenically Stress relieved and nitride/melonite finish for prolonged accuracy under heavy use/competition.  NITRIDE TREATED:READ ABOUT THIS PROCESS BEING BETTER THAN CHROME LINED BORES The 6.8 SPC round has the same energy at 250 yards as the M855 (5.56 GREEN TIP) has at the muzzle. At 600 yards it has the same energy as a 7.62mm M43 at 275 yards, M193 at 250 yards and M855 at 375 yards. Since the 6.8mm is of a larger calibre and greater sectional density than the 5.56mm, it will use this energy more effectively when producing terminal damage. Performance can be increased slightly by using 110gr ammunition, giving you more velocity and less bullet drop over range. The lower velocity of the 115gr ammunition combined with more kinetic energy makes this round less susceptible to deflection from soft cover such as foliage, shooting through glass (in the case of vehicle interdictions) and chest rigs. 6.8mm upper receivers will fit AR lowers, but you will need to change the bolt though and use specific 6.8 mags. You can try regular pmags.. but the tolerances inside the 5.56 mag are quite tight because the 6.8 cartridge is bigger in diameter. Although the calibre is larger, the difference in recoil is hardly evident and is quite controllable when engaged in rapid fire.   PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT: Our Socomm 6.8SPC Barrel is capable of 1/2""-3/4""  MOA 5 shot group at 325 Yards.

The Original Instructor Belt was developed in 1983 and has been refined ever since, now offering higher quality and more options than ever. It is a very strong belt with a specially designed carbon steel V-ring buckle coated with non-glare black *Roguard, a tough milspec finish which is highly corrosion-resistant and will not chip like cheaper coatings. The belt was originally designed to clip into a secure system while ""instructing"" others in high places during mountain rescue training, although they can be used for emergency rappelling with proper training. Our belts have also proven to be a fantastic everyday pants belt for casual or outdoor use, as well as concealed-carry. Will ship to lower 48 for $10.00"

Introducing the most consistent and reliable barrier ammo on the market.
1) FLEXLOCK® BULLET incorporates two revolutionary Hornady features: the patented Flex Tip® that initiates consistent expansion every single time while preventing any clogging, and the heavy duty InterLock® band that locks the jacket and core together.
2) CANNELURED BULLET WITH CRIMPED CASE ensures no bullet setback during feeding.

3) INTERLOCK® BAND works to keep the bullet and core from separating for maximum weight retention and proven terminal performance through all FBI test barriers.
4) CORE is made of high-antimony lead making it extremely tough, delivering controlled expansion for unparalleled terminal performance consistency through all FBI test barriers. It’s also more economical than similar bonded bullets.
5) NICKEL-PLATED CASES resist corrosion and greatly enhance low-light chamber checks.
