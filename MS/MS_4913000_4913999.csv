I know what I can buy a new one for, so I want to buy one from someone who wants to sell one, not off someone acting as a dealer to make bid money. I am buying it for my personal use not to re-sale, so I have no problem going through your FFL dealer, but I do have Ohio CCW and will show ID Thanks"

The seams in the baffles are not sewn-through, much like a high-quality sleeping bag. This means there is no true separation of the insulation at the seams, so you stay warmer and more comfortable, without the cold spots common in sewn-through down garments. The hood is detachable, and the fleece-lined collar and hand pockets keep you extra comfortable. An interior mesh water-bottle pocket is super handy for backcountry excursions, and of course, Mountain Hardwear's quality is legendary

The Daniel Defense Modular Float Rail (MFR) 9.0 is a Mid Length Customizable AR-15 Handguard that is CNC machined from Aircraft-Grade 6061-T6 Aluminum for superior strength and light weight. The MFR features a Continuous Top Rail and provisions to mount additional M1913 Picatinny-Spec Rail Sections anywhere along the Free Floating Tube's body. The handguard's 9"" Length is ideal for use with Mid Length gas systems, while also being fully compatible with a Carbine Length gas system when a low profile gas block is installed. The MFR's slim tube profile is comfortable to grasp with the support hand, enhancing a shooter's ease of handling and overall control of the rifle. The handguard sacrifices nothing in terms of versatility, allowing for the addition of accessories where needed while eliminating all extraneous unused rail space for a lightweight, trim package that won't snag on gear or abrade the hands. Includes 9"" MFR Handguard, 3 Detachable Modular Rail Sections, Barrel Nut Wrench, Barrel Nut, 4 Set Screws with Nylon Locking Patch, 2 Allen Wrenches and Installation Instructions.

The Magpul Hunter X-22 stock for the Ruger 10/22 has been designed incredibly similar to the likes of the Remington‚Äôs stock, with available spacers in order to change the length of pull and an adjustable cheek rest. The grip is straight from the shotgun stocks that Magpul offer, which is incredibly comfortable for a traditional grip style and also handles exceptionally well. The forend of the Hunter X-22 stock has been specifically lined with slots for the use of M-LOK accessories, and is fitted especially for the use of Uncle Mike‚Äôs sling swivels.
The Hunter X-22 stock features a wide variety of tactical styling and adjustable ergonomics that many enthusiasts will enjoy. Much like the Magpul‚Äôs Hunter 700 stock for the Remington 700, the new brand new Hunter X-22 stock offers plenty for its user. To ensure full compatibility with all types of Ruger 10/22s, the Magpul Hunter X-22 stock features an innovative variety of features, such as mentioning that the stock is fully convertible. Not only will your regular barrel weight 10/22 barrels fit into the stock, but you can also rotate the barrel insert around in order to fit bull barrel 10/22 barrels as well.
The Hunter X-22 stock from Magpul is also designed to fit standard Ruger 10/22 .22 LR pattern rifles without the use of any form of gunsmithing. It also comes with a reversible barrel tray in order to allow for correct fitting with heavy bull barrels as well as factory pencil profile"

If you agree to list price, then I will also throw in a box of 9mm ammo.

I have enjoyed shooting this from the day I bought it, but I have rethought my concealment options and I don't have a need for this in my toolbox anymore.  This gun is a real shooter and has never had a single malfunction.  I'm culling the herd, so I'm not interested in any trades at this time."

The trigger has been lighten and polished, with just over a 3.25 LB as measured on my Timmey Trigger gauge which brakes cleanly and crisp without over travel. However, it does have take up before engagement. Pistol has been gently used and never abused; relatively low round count as it still functions with the original recoil spring. The barrel is bright and crisp; this Taurus is a shooter. I am selling to raise cash for health expenses. This 1911 include 5‚Äù stainless steel barrel, adjustable ventilated trigger, oversized flared ejection port, beavertail grip safety, Hogue finger grips plus the polymer grips and two 9-round magazines. Also available at additional expense are 6 Wilson Combat stainless steel magazines."
