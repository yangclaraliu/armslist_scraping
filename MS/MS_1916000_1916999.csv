These were made in Spain and designed to mechanically function just like a Smith & Wesson Combat Magnum (model 19). Has pinned barrel, and recessed cylinder.

I listed this the other day and had to change my ad. Here's why I'm selling so low now. I haven't shot the gun in months and this afternoon was cleaning it and dry firing and found out there is a major timing issue causing the cylinder to not turn all the way between fires. It had functioned well and never did this before in the past. I've been wondering if some of the heavy magnum loads caused it. I'm going to take it to Hyatt's gunsmith this weekend and see if it's something they can repair, or you can get it for $60 and see if it's something you can fix yourself. I did take the sideplate off and looked inside to see if anything looked out of place. Didn't touch any of the internals, but if you know a good gunsmith maybe they can have a better look at it.

It's still a hand gun so according to law you must have a North Carolina CCW license or a pistol purchase permit. No exceptions. We'll both sign a bill of sale of which I will provide. If there are any questions, contact me. 

If ad is up it means it's still for sale."

The Springfield Armory GI Micro Compact 1911 isn't actually a replica of the WWI and WWII pistols, as 1911 pistols this small weren't produced until late in the 1990's. However, the Micro Compact is an excellent carry pistol that also has a nostalgic feel to it.

The Micro Compact G.I. has a 3"" barrel and a framer that's smaller than an Officer's size frame, giving it a weight of just 33 ounces, and making it ideal for carry.

The frame and slide are forged steel, and are parkerized. The 3"" bull barrel is fully supported and ramped, and is also parkerized. Parkerizing gives the pistol a finish that's much tougher than anodizing.

The reddish-brown hardwood grips are stamped ""U.S."", and contrast attractively with the black parkerized pistol.

The sights on the pistol are original G.I. style, with a low profile notched rear sight and low rounded front sight blade.

The grip safety is flat, just like the old G.I. 1911's, as is the trigger. Trigger pull on the Micro Compact G.I. is five to six pounds, which is a good pull weight for a carry pistol.

The Micro Compact G.I. 1911 is a pistol with a lot of character, and one that can fit in the palm of your hand. It comes with a lifetime warranty that's good even if you're not the original purchaser.

This rifle was manufactured by Izhmash in Russia which is the same plant that developed and mass produced the famous Kalashnikov series of rifles for the Russian military. Mikhail Kalashnikov, the rifle's designer, still works at this same factory.  RIP (died 12/23/13 at age 94)

From what I understand, the only Saiga rifles that are legal for the U.S. market are those in sporter configuration which means no pistol grip and they use a low capacity plastic Saiga mag. This Saiga was imported by RWC Group LLC in Tullytown, PA (which is Izhmash's exclusive US importer) and was converted to have a pistol grip and use regular capacity AK mags.  There is no wobble in the mags, no misfeeds etc.

It has a tight tolerance quad rail, 150 lumen light/laser combo, slide fire stock IN FIRST PIC (as much fun as you can have with your pants on, Google it if you're unfamiliar with slide fire stocks), slanted Russian steel 75rd drum mag (worth $$$),  tapco t6 collapsible stock (IN SECOND PIC),  hogue grip, one point tactical sling.

The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2"" to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is available in 9 mm Luger or .40 S&W calibers.

This collapsible .40 cal pistol grip carbine is accurate at 150 yards!! It is lightweight,
concealable, and incomparable! 

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools!

The .40 SUB-2000 can be configured in the following magazine types: GLK22, GLK23, BERETTA96, S&W4006, SIG226.

This carbine can also be fully customized with different rails, optics, stocks, you name it! This is a great gun that you do not want to pass up on!!"

This pistol is in excellent condition.  It only has wear marks where the slide, guide rod, and barrel rub against each other as the action cycles.

Some argue the best .22lr rifle ever produced.  Made from the early 70's to early 80's.  This one and scope are from the mid 70's.  Has factory engraving and bluing is as from the factory, perfect.  Stock has a few small handling marks.  The butt-plate has been scuffed but is not cracked.  It comes with the Tasco 6x24x44 scope.  Trigger is about a pound or a little lighter.  How does it shoot?  Do your part with decent ammo and it will stay in the X ring always.  It became so routine that smaller things were targeted, like twigs at a 100 yards.  No kidding but my Dad shot the head off a grasshopper that landed on the target at 100 yards.  We found the body.  This gun shoots!  Have a 5 and 10 round mag for it.  I'll throw in a box of quality target ammo also.  Mike REDACTED."

 PI9128LP “RANGE OFFICER” 
Springfield Armory® has just introduced a new 1911 designed for 
 people interested in shooting competitively. It is called— The RO™, 
“Range Officer™”. The RO™ is designed to give the shooter 
 exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to 
 create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of 
 shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he 
 likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy 
 Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result 
 in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model, 
 at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs.

 Hard Plastic form fitted carry case

I bought this air pistol to shoot next to my suppressed pistols just to see the noise difference. Now that I've done that I don't think I'll use it much anymore. It's a fun pistol and has a real hefty feel to it. I've shot four CO2 cylinders through it. I bought it at the Cabela's bargain cave so it has their ""XXX"" mark in front of the trigger to denote that. It's the only real blemish on the pistol. Please see the photos.

You can see a video of shooting it next to a suppressed .22LR Ruger MKII pistol at

The pistol will include:
- The original box. It's pretty beaten up but the pistol is nice.
- The original tool for removing/installing CO2 cylinders
- One factory 8-round magazine (the little circular thing)
- The original instructions
- The original picatinny rail installed on in front of the trigger guard
- The remaining pellets. I don't know how many are left but there's a lot.

I always wanted this for my 2007 300c and so finally when I found a company that would sell it to me without being law enforcement, I ordered it. well I just got it in the mail... its too bad I totaled my car 3 days ago. its made by progard im selling it for 400.00 firm. that's exactly what I paid. it fits across the head liner of the 2005-2010 charger, I measured and the 300 4 door is the same! the car cannot have side airbags. and its a single ar15/m4 mount, its awesome. it really sucks that this happened. you wire a button to this mount and when you push the button, it unlocks itself electronicly for 8-sec on a timer. if you don't pull it out, it relocks. also this mounts without bolts etc... so its not permanent.  thanks someone please buy! or it will sit in my garage forever.  also it has a vending style key system for back up purposes. p.s. this is completely legal in Nevada (as long as there is not a round in the chamber!) thanks greg REDACTED"

THIS WAS AMAZINGLY FUN AMMUNITION TO FIRE OFF AT THE RANGE!!!!!

I have only ONE box available.  I started with 4 boxes and these things sold like crazy and I'm down to this last box.  $90 for the box.  I'm sorry, but my price is firm.

This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable nickel-plated brass cases. This is top of the line, American-made defense ammo designed for Law Enforcement and now available here! It doesn't get any better than this for personal protection.

Winchester made the ""Black Talons"" that were labeled ""cop killer"" bullets and a FURY of media backlash resulted.  

Winchester Ranger 9mm T-Series 127grain +P+ Hollow Points. This is the *MOST* powerful 9mm ammo you can buy! If you thought 9mm was hard to find right now, these are nearly impossible. 

The T-Series (Talon) is designed to be one of Winchester's highest performing loads with it's nickel plated case, reverse taper jacket design, and reliable expansion through a variety of barriers.  Winchester has set the world standard in superior handgun ammunition performance and innovation for more than a century.

Has slight cylinder ring and ever so light blueing loss on right side of muzzle. Other than that this gun is Mint. Perfect bore and cylinders, no scratches or handling marks. Grips are perfect and all screw heads are perfect. Transitional Smiths have that non-luster dull blueing finish to them. Has the over-size cylinder release button. If you are a serious collector you know how often this gun comes out on the market. NEVER. Don't let this one get away. I try to describe it thoroughly so there are no questions, serious inquiries only if you must. Serial Number 577245 Sorry no box. Transitional Smith & Wessons have a distinct blueing on the barrel and cylinder, and a different distinct blueing on the frame, and yet another distinct blueing on the cylinder release button. These are suptle differences in the blueing."

The only reason I'm considering parting with it, is because all of my other pistols are chambered in 9mm & 45 and want to consolidate my ammo. Priced at $375 picked up in Hartford. I'm very tired of time wasting inquiries. Please email only if you plan on buying.

This high velocity 45 acp+P load offers numerous tactical advantages for anyone using their 45 acp pistol for anti-personnel purposes. First, this load is operating at velocities of normal +P 9MM 115gr. ammo, yet it is a 45 caliber, 160gr. bullet. Second, this load will penetrate roughly 15 to 18 inches of penetration in flesh and bone, depending on which bones are hit. Third, this load generates relatively low recoil because of the light weight bullet, which assists in fast follow-up shots. Fourth, we are as per usual, using a low flash powder, so the shooter is not blinded by his own gunfire should he be required to drop the hammer in low light, when the criminal element is most active.

This 45 ACP +P load is safe for use in ALL 45 ACP pistols that are in normal operating condition."
