Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Amazing round 
This pistol cartridge packs a real punch. Surplus ammunition can have velocities ranging from 1450 fps up to 1650 fps from pistols and Sub-guns/rifles can have velocities higher than that do to longer barrels. I’ll get into that further down with my Chrono data. Shooting 85 grn projectiles in the surplus ammunition gives an energy level of 397 ft lbs up to 514 ft lbs of energy from a pistol. To give you a comparison using new Winchester ammunition:

7.62x25  85grn       velocity: 1647 fps   energy: 512 ft lbs.
9mm     115grn       velocity: 1190 fps   energy: 361 ft lbs.  
40S&W  165grn       velocity: 1060 fps   energy: 411 ft lbs.
45acp    230grn       velocity:   880 fps   energy: 396 ft lbs

This powerful little bottle-necked cartridge is a direct relation of and an improvement on the 7.63x25 Mauser cartridge. They are so close the you may use the 7.63x25 Mauser ammunition in firearms chambered for the Tokarev round."

We are proud to offer the very best Parkerizing Tanks in the industry. They are cut and formed out of pure 304 stainless steel. Handles are formed right into the ends. All edges of these tanks are hemmed, so there are no exposed sharp edges. Feel free to handle these tank with your bare hands! 

The tanks are TIG welded using supreme skill and elaborate tooling. The outside of the welds are treated and polished to reveal the beauty of the stainless steel and show the excellence of the weld. We maintain complete passivation inside the weld during manufacturing. Please look at the last picture taken of the inside of the weld, you will see that it remains brilliant and shiny. If you see a weld in stainless steel that is black or rust colored inside this means that proper provisions were not taken and rust and breakdown will start immediately when your liquid is applied."

It is OD Green and is their top of the line model with the Hard Chrome Finish. Straight from Kel Tec's website, the MSRP is $390 for this version. I've put about $60 worth up upgrades into. This includes a metal guide rod and new guide rod springs (pictured), a new striker spring, a new trigger spring which lightened the trigger 1.5lbs and I also have a Hoge Jr grip and ""clip draw"" style clip to conceal without a holster. 

This is one of the lightest and smallest guns for the price. You can look on Kel Tec's website to see the specifics but fully loaded this gun comes out under 20oz! 

There have been issues with the PF9 in the past when they were first introduced, as with all new models of guns. However those have been worked out and you can check serial numbers of ""theKTOG.org"" as well as look at what changes have happened to the outside of the gun, namely: metal magazine change switch, polymer that comes up near the switch, etc. 

If no trade, the selling price will be $300. Remember MSRP and upgrades, I am going beneath those prices. I'm not trying to make any money, just be fair."

""The handgun had an issue that was resolved with the manufacturer, since Sig Sauer has a lifetime warranty, that's not even a concern. ""All"" firearms can have or come w a manufactures defect, wrong part, etc no handgun is 100% ""perfect.""But that's not the reason for me wanting to sell it, trade it or move into a different direction if that's what your trying to inquire about.  This handgun is flawless, works perfectly, no issues or hesitation to go boom. Lastly, why would I want to sell something that is bad, doesn't work or maybe it's mechanically defective? Wrong guy Sir.Disregard sending me any pictures or doing any business.  I wish not continue wasting each others time. This item cost me exactly $1,162.69! I'm letting it for $850 firm or reasonable trade, losing $312+ already.  This is not a polymer base pistol but a 1911 and a Sig Sauer at that.."

This is a 3rd Gen G19 with the kinda rare Austrian proof marks.

This gun was completely manufactured and assembled in Austria, not Smyrna Georgia. No box or papers, and only one magazine included. Has standard sights. The Austrian Glocks have a metal front sight crimped in instead of a plastic one, that is about the only physical difference between the Austrian and US made guns.

This is one of the lightest and smallest guns for the price. You can look on Kel Tec's website to see the specifics but fully loaded this gun comes out under 20oz! 

There have been issues with the PF9 in the past when they were first introduced, as with all new models of guns. However those have been worked out and you can check serial numbers of ""theKTOG.org"" as well as look at what changes have happened to the outside of the gun, namely: metal magazine change switch, polymer that comes up near the switch, etc. 

If no trade, the selling price will be $350. Remember MSRP and upgrades, I am going beneath those prices. I'm not trying to make any money, just be fair."

I am happy to do face-to-face in the RDU area if you have a DL and a CCL, else we can do this at a FFL. I will ship to your FFL once the ""method of payment"" clears.

Condition - excellent mechanical condition, has definitely been shot and is not a safe queen. I would probably rate it between good and fair, with a hard lean towards fair.

I am not interested in swapping for other firearms, magic beans, or Western Union credit orders for a few dollars more than the selling price."

The gun is completely original and has all matching numbers, except the mag. The inside looks brand new. Again, the gun is in EXCELLENT shape. Looks newer than some of my modern firearms. The stock is wooden along with the tip of the mag. Had the gun appraised and he was very impressed. Has been sitting in my grandpas safe for decades. Awesome piece of history that is extremely rare. Most of these Lugers were destroyed after the war. After 1916 the quality of Lugers were never the same. Beautifully engineered by the Germans. Email me for more photos of the markings and info on the gun.

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT: 
ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK OEM sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 
LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.
INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the 10 round conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.
This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.

ONE YEAR FACTORY DIRECT WARRANTY
Warranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship. (Excluding S&H Charges).

FACT: You will have paid for your ADVANTAGE ARMS, INC. conversion kit after shooting 1000 rounds of .22LR.

Why buy an ""Advantage Arms"" .22LR Conversion Kit?
•It allows you to shoot inexpensive .22 Long Rifle ammunition so that you can shoot longer and more often.
•Turns your Glock or 1911 into an ideal pistol for first time shooters.
•Makes a great tool for teaching women and young adults how to safely shoot a pistol without the intimidation of larger calibers.

-Manufacture Description-
Developed to improve precision and accuracy with any style or caliber of weapon, the Trijicon RMR (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) is designed to be as durable as the legendary ACOG. The RM06 is an LED sight powered by a standard CR2032 battery. Housed in rugged forged aluminum, the RMR is extremely tough yet lightweight. New easy-to-use adjusters with audible clicks allow for quick windage and elevation adjustments. 

With eight available brightness settings, the reticle can be manually adjusted by pressing the plus or minus buttons on either side of the unit. To switch to auto adjust mode simply press both buttons simultaneously and release. To save battery life turn the optic off by pressing both buttons simultaneously and holding for 3 seconds.

The Trijicon RMR is tougher than any alternative and suitable for military, law enforcement and hunting applications."
