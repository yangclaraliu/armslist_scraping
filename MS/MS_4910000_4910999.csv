Pistol is Sold!!!! Snatch The Other Before It's Gone 


Both of these guns are like new with about 100 rounds through each. The Uzi pistol is basically flawless and the rifle has just a couple tiny nicks on the front of faux suppressor. 

The Rifle is heavy! I'd guess somewhere around 8lbs, comes equipped with the fancy folding stock, and the faux suppressor. It is not a can and does not unscrew they use the suppressor to achieve the 16"" barrel. Comes with one 20 round magazine, no case. Price Drop!!! $350 Firm Wont Last Long

I have 5kids and I have been a father since I was 16y/o. Me and my wife have been together since high school and she is the mother of all my kids. I don't have many freinds anymore mainly because they don't feel the same way I do about my god given right to protect my wife and children against criminals that don't want to work for what they want and would rather rob,steal or kill someone to get it. I am a law abiding tax payer and I believe I should not have to ask permission from the state to carry a concealed firearm. With that being said I'm also not stupid and know that things can't always be the way I think they should so with my freedom in mind I applied for my florida cwp years ago and got permission to be able to protect my loved ones. My wife doesn't understand why I choose to carry a gun everday eveywhere I am legally allowed to. She trys to see the good in everyone and so do I but if I am forced to protect my loved ones I will . Most of my family don't agree with me and say that it's stupid to carry a gun and most of them don't know i do because they try to talk down about people who put there family's safety in there own hands . I respect police but most of the time they are 5to15 mins away and I'm pretty sure a criminal is not going to wait for the police to come before they kill or hurt you to take something that you have worked hard for! I just recently lost my job and I am doing any and everything I can to stay above water . The 1ST of this month my rent was due and I was short and I had to put my family first and I sold my s&w m&p45c to a gun shop so i could pay my rent and my family would not be homeless. I don't have alot of money but I am a hard worker and I love my wife and kids very much. I'm hoping that someone reads this post and would find it in their heart to let me do work for them to earn extra money to get another firearm or we can work out a trade. I am a waterproofer by trade but I also do decarotive concrete. I can do alot of different things and would be willing to do almost anything to have the peace of mind knowing that if my family is put in a life or death situation I can be there and have the tools to protect them . I don't have many people that I can count on in my life but my wife and kids count on me to protect them and god willing hopefully somone in the gun community will be able to help me in any way. I am not asking for anything free and if nothing else maybe I can find a gun buddy  that feels the same way about the 2nd ammendment that I do and get together and go to the range or fishing. I have a valid fl cwp not a felon and Im 32. God bless REDACTED email or text.Thank you very much and thank you for taking the time to read my post."

Only has around 50 rounds through it, and is EXTREMELY clean.  I got this gun as a ""backup/run-to-the-store/gym clothes"" gun, but just don't carry or shoot it enough to justify keeping it.  It would make a great little pocket or purse gun.

$350 firm for the gun, all factory paperwork, a speed loader, a handful of self defense rounds, and maybe a holster (if I can find it). Please, no trade offers.  

Buyer MUST HAVE a NC Concealed Weapons Permit or NC Pistol Purchase Permit, and a photo ID that matches.  ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS. A bill of sale will also be completed to document the transaction.  I prefer to do face-to-face and can meet anywhere in the greater Fayetteville area. If you have any questions message me on here or text to: Nine 1 Zero - Eight Four 9 - Zero One 6 Five.

Here is the opportunity to purchase a deluxe autoloader with all the features you need to have a reliable, 
successful day in the field. Its semi-humpback design, which refers to the pistol grip and rear of the receiver area, allows a sure grip for smaller hands. Additionally, the lightweight profile barrel helps pick up the ivory front sight bead very quickly. 
Shouldering, the grip, sight plane and weight are all critical factors when selecting any shotgun, either for youth and ladies or 

for adults. The Silver Hunter Micro Midas becomes the only real choice because of its compact and lightweight handling. The 

finely cut checkering on the grip and forearm also help to better control the gun."

This is a commercial P225--kind of a rare bird.

If you're a regular viewer of Kentucky Armslist... 

This is the same P225 offered for sale a little over a week ago. I bought it as a possible replacement for my P239--decided I'd just keep the P239. So I am asking the same price--just looking to get out what I put in

I put 75 rounds through the pistol... including a few HPs... no issues whatsover. Great pistol. Just don't need this and a P239.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72 bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZs corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the CZ 75 Compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beaver tail to protect shooters strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry with checkering in key areas on the front and back straps combined with the redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decreases the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transitions.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

The coolest thing about this weapon and round it delivers is that the .222 is the father of the .223 we are all too familiar with. I received this weapon in a trade and I am looking to sell or trade it out for something different. Serial number is 108,XXX. The barrel date codes are ""KL"" which means it was manufactured in either 1942, 1964, or 1991. However, noting the pressed checkering design in the stock eliminates the 1991 year of manufacture as the design changed some time in the 70's. The model 700 line wasn't put into production until 1962 which rules out its date of 1942. To solidify its date of manufacture this weapon has a square shaped thumb safety. The 700's thumb safety was originally a square shape then changing it to a more rounded shape in 1969 making this rifle a 1964 year model 700 chambered in .222 MAG with a 23.5"" barrel (rare). 

To note the BDL series this weapon has the traditional ""trap door"" style internal magazine, Blackened fore-end tip. blackened pistol grip butt plate, and blackened shoulder butt plate. Rifle also has the original leather sling with quick disconnects still in good shape. 

I would put this weapon at 90% due to a couple very minor dings on the butt stock and that the finish is vaguely cloudy in a few areas. This weapon has had minimal use, has a clean bore and appears to have been kept in a climate controlled area. 

Attached to the weapon is the original Bushnell Scope Chief which has clear glass and almost perfect finish. 

I work in Fredericksburg and live in Hampton Roads. I can meet almost anywhere but will need a couple days to get my affairs in order. 

Cash price is contingent upon your homework and offer. Will accept partial trades and cash combination. Can ship to FFL for an out of state purchase.

The gun is in great shape and works like all other Glocks. 

The only issue with the gun is that the rear sight is loose. I've got it set in place with superglue (you can see some of the residue in the photos, I can scrape it off). I think it would be better to hit it with some loctite once you get it sighted in, or maybe just get some night sights. I'm not sure why it is loose (I can't find any screws or anything that would hold it in place). It is a Hienie rear sight and those are supposed to be good. I e-mailed them about it and never heard back.

Original manufactured from Glock. Most are G3 as best as I can tell. SEE BELOW for further description. I have 7 Glock 19 (9mm) magazines, $20 each. All are in excellent shape, many have never been used. I will make a deal on multiple purchases and shipping! Shoot me and email and we'll work out a deal PLEASE READ BELOW: All multiple purchases will be combined shipping to save costs. Most will be shipped by USPS 2/3 day Priority for $6.80. I have a Paypal account and prefer transactions take place through them. I usually ship upon receipt of payment, except for Sundays & holidays. DISCLAIMER: I am not a business and do not pretend to know all of the high capacity laws for each state. I no longer own a 19, so these are the spares I purchased a while back. BUYER assumes all legal responsibility for adhering to their municipal, local, and state laws. Any questions please ask or inquire at your local gun shop or friendly police department. I have included below what I found on internet. If this has changed, buyer again needs to be aware of state laws where they reside. Thank you. [SEE BELOW: Six states and the District of Columbia (D.C.) currently ban or restrict large capacity magazines. Maryland defines a âlarge capacity magazineâ as a magazine capable of accepting more than 20 rounds. New Jersey defines it as one capable of accepting more than 15 rounds, and California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, and D.C. define it as a magazine capable of accepting more than 10 rounds. (On January 15, 2013, the NY Legislature amended its law. Beginning March 16, the law defines high capacity magazines as magazines capable of firing more than seven rounds.) In five states (California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York) and D.C., the ban applies to large capacity ammunition magazines used with any firearm. The Hawaii ban applies only to such magazines used with handguns. The Massachusetts ban exempts magazines lawfully possessed on September 13, 1994 (the date the federal ban took effect). New Jersey bans the possession, manufacture, transfer, and transportation of large capacity magazines, including pre- and post-ban magazines. New York bans these same activities and, beginning March 16, the ban will apply to all large capacity magazines, including ones previously grandfathered. (California effectively grandfathers the possession of pre-ban large capacity magazines by not outlawing possession of such magazines.) Thank you for looking."

The scope is a second generation Vari-X 2 1/2-8X32. The first one didn't make it. The barrel is 10"" long with a KEEPER EDMed port which reduces recoil about 50%. It has the rosewood grips, also.

The second one is a Premier Grade without rosewood grips. It has been fired less than 100 times. The barrel is about 7 1/2"" long. It comes with two front sights. When getting ready to go to Alaska I checked to see which one allowed me to get on target the quickest. This one did. But in order for the 300 grainer to hit where I was aiming I installed the factory fiber optic front sight. I fired a 1 1/2"" five shot groupslow fired at 25 yards offhand with 300 grain bullets.

This is considered the ""compact"" model, which is slightly smaller than the full-size. I say ""slightly"" because this is definitely not a youth-only size rifle. The barrel is 2' shorter, while the whole rifle is 3' shorter than the full size (20 inch barrel, 39.5 inch total length) This is a perfect size for smaller shooters, and comes with an attachment to lengthen the stock. Without the lengthening attachment, the stock is about an inch shorter than the full-size, while the attachment will bring the stock to a very similar size to comparable rifles in this category.

Bonus: comes with a box of ammo!

This is a really sweet pistol with a very nice O.D. Green Cerakote job(slide and controls, goes great with the grips) that comes with night sights(rear are bright, front is pretty much out), Smith & Alexander Mag Guide with beveled mag well, grips are VZ Dirty Olive G10(they grip you back), 4-8rd. Kimber mags with J&J bumpers and a carry bag, no other box or ppwk included.  Kimber specs:  http://palmettostatearmory.com/catalog/pro duct/view/id/12143/  

This model Kimber model will run you over $1,200 online after any shipping and FFL fees, S&A mag guide/beveled magwell $90, VZ grips $65, two extra mags $50, carry bag $25 and Cerakote job was around $125, so if purchased new you would be looking in the area of $1,500-$1,600 after and shipping/taxes/fees.

$1,200 firm in cash or better in trade, no hurry to sell/trade this one.  Only selling because I have accumulated several .45's recently, so need to thin some out to get another AR-10.  I have more pics I can send to serious buyers.

If wanting to trade, please be specific on what exactly you are offering, straight trade, trade +/- cash and how much, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  If the trade is not a good deal, I will pass.

Trades considered:

About the only thing I want right now is another AR-10, something like the DPMS Recon G2 AR-10, they sell new for around $1,200($1,000 if you got the Black Friday Deal, dang it), so I would straight trade on that one if it includes some extra mags, ammo, optic or other to even out a bit.  Maybe interested in the DPMS 3G1 or MK12 18"" models too or might take in another Armalite AR-10T or other, just let me know.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice trigger groups etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.
