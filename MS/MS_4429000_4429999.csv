 The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.
When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.

 The G43 is our new single stack, 9mm pistol the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols.
 When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.

Ruger Vaquero, this is the ""old model"" aka the original ""large frame"" Vaquero that was discontinued after 2005 IIRC. Literally one of the strongest .357's out there. This has a birdshead grip and 4 5/8"" barrel. This is a pretty rare configuration in .357 mag, I've never seen another for sale (and I look). Practically no wear, super minor amount of blue missing at the end of the ejector rod housing (holster wear) and then the turn line that you see. 

Currently the gun has a super blackhawk hammer, but also includes the original which switches out in a few minutes.

I also have a barely worn left handed Triple K Cheyenne holster and Wyoming belt for this, or other similarly sized single actions. Large size belt (they say waist size 38-43, I'm a 34 and wear this comfortably over a regular belt with room to spare). These retail for $70 each at Cabelas. 

$600 for the gun, box, paperwork, and all that jazz included. $100 for belt/holster alone, or I'll let it go for $75 with the gun. 

The only trades I'm interested in are as follows:
Talo Ruger Vaquero Birdshead in .45ACP - Even Trade
Smith and Wesson M66 (current production) - Can add some cash if necessary.

The Fastfire is one accurate and durable Red Dot (it owns everything the light touches). I have 3 brand new boxes of Hornady Leverevolution 44 mag ammo and 35 Ultramax lead roundnose in 44 mag. Armslist and Guns America both have these used in the $650 - $700 range, Burris is $189 used $250 new, 3 full boxes of ammo will run you $80 anywhere plus the 35 LRN. Looking for reasonable trades, must have Permit or CCW, willing to trade for right items up or down. Prefer to trade but cash offer is always welcome. If you don't want the Fastfire, I will keep and leave mount rail for your optic of choice and adjust accordingly on trade or price. Gun shoots wonderful and would keep but I have switched back to bow hunting so I would rather have a handgun I can carry for CCW. If you reload I already sold the dies but I have a lot of 1 fired brass too I will toss in if you want it."

I started with a stock Extar EXP 5.56 because I wanted the shortest and lightest PDW possible. I wanted high capacity and the ability to choose between readily available bullet types and weights.
I changed out the grip because my fingers did not fit it well. I added an angled foregrip because it got pretty warm after a few magazines were run through it. I added a single point sling in the rear, but it was not comfortable to carry and it did not stabilize the weapon the way I wanted. I switched to a dual point sling and it felt perfect. I confirmed this at the range. It carries well and transitions to target beautifully. 
It is small enough to slip into a small pack and get tossed in the car for drives.
This is not a weapon to be used to put holes in paper. It is designed to be there for you in case you find yourself surrounded by the next angry mob of protesters. This PDW will give you the chance you need to get you and your family out of the worst crap this disgusting community can throw at you.
You get the modified EXP, the bag and 2 30 round Troy battle mags.
I have numerous pics I can send.

- Barely used, it was only mounted for a few range sessions before I got a scope for longer distance shooting. These are metal sights and not cheap plastic ones that have a tendency to damage easy. 

- Folding Sights - It will fold down and lay flat on your rail so you can have a set of these mounted on your AR AND still have a scope mounted. Great backup sights if your scope fails out in the field or if your scope is very high powered and you need iron sights for shorter distances, anything less than 100-200 yards perhaps. Although lots of people enjoy shooting iron sights at very long distances and still be very accurate. 

This typically runs $100 brand new.

943,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4429943,For Sale/Trade:  JBL Studio L Series 7.1 Surround Sound System - Price Reduced,"Ottawa, IL, La Salle, Illinois","$ 1,200","Listed On: Monday, June 29, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I realize this is not exactly armslist.com ""material"", however I have used this site with great success and hope you are either interested in purchasing the equipment with cash or trading with weapons/ammo.  If you are, that's great and I hope to hear from you.

I am selling my like new JBL Studio L Series 7.1 sound equipment. Included in this listing is the LC2 center channel, a pair of L820 front bookshelf speakers, 2 pair of L810 surrounds and the L8400P 12"" 600 watt-RMS (1200 Peak) powered subwoofer. If you want to know all the specs, I recommend you check out JBL's website because I can't list all the features. These are JBL's top of the line residential speakers and I guarantee they will not disappoint you. I had everything connected to a Harman/Kardon AVR3600 and the sound quality was outstanding. Watching action films with explosions or chase scenes would shake the house. All the speakers match with cherry wood cabinetry, which is hard to find these days since JBL is now primarily manufacturing black cabinets.

I purchased the set new about 4 years ago, broke them in properly, used them appropriately (no block parties), then got married and had a son. The speakers and amp took up too much space, my boy always wanted to play with the amp's buttons and the system overall was too loud to watch TV while he was sleeping. So everything was disconnected and neatly stored about a year and a half ago. I recently hooked everything up for a sound check and they are still amazing. 

My price is less than half of MSRP and I feel is fair for the condition the speakers are in. I am open to cash and trade offers, as long as you are reasonable and have something I'm willing to trade for. As mentioned above, I am very open to trades for guns and ammo.  I am not particularly open to piecing the set out because they get harder to sell as things have been picked through. If you agree to purchase all the speakers at the price I am advertising, I'll give you the Harman/Kardon AVR3600 for nothing additional.  The equipment is really heavy so I'm not willing to ship it.  I am willing to exchange anywhere within a 40 mile radius of Ottawa. If you have any questions regarding the equipment or would like me to send you more photos, please feel free to contact me.  Thanks for looking.

It had a completely chromed bolt and piston, square fixed stock rear trunnion and theaded comp. The gun still even has the factory grease in it. I'm going to clean all that off and use a nice lubricant to set it up as I know I hate cleaning grease out. It's a nice gun but my only issue is it does not take the furniture I want to use. I'm looking at the magpul zhukov furniture and this won't take it. It takes some aftermarket rails and it has really nice wood option available. I am looking for a standard ak47 configuration for trade. I will sell this rifle as well. If someone wants to buy, I'll take 550 for it. I would prefer to trade. I'm being slightly picky about trades as I intend this to be my go to rifle for anything I need it for so junkers aren't desirable. I will accept converted saiga 7.62x39mm, DDI stamped 47s, century arms c39 version 2 (parts compatibility), and I will accept century wasr 10 as long as they're good models without obviously canted sights and function properly. Like I said, it's a nice gun just not what I need functionally. If trading, I'll assume you have mags, so just trading guns no mags is preferred. It came with one mag and if you buy it, you'll get mag obviously. I'd prefer to even trade without using an ffl as getting this, money has become tight. Can't really afford to ffl swap or ship again."

Automatic transmission. Some minor to moderate body damage but nothing that would require a shop (some paint issues, a little bit of rust by back driver wheel well, a couple small dents) runs and drives strong. Primary problem is that the floater in the carb is needing replaced, or at least that is what I have been told. The part was quoted to me as $20m but I have no time to replace it. Because this floater piece is bad, it will occasionally flood when going up steep hills. It wont turn off unless you floor it. Other than that, the rear hydraulics on the hatchback need replaced ($40 for both) and a new headlight motor ($75) I have the headlights locked up to circumvent this problem. It also needs a new bulb in the back driver running light. The following parts have been replaced in the last year by a professional mechanic, because I am not mechanically inclined at all:
Upper and lower radiator hoses, with an added quick flush system, spark plugs, coils, and wires, flywheel, starter, fuel pump, water pump, all filters are at the most six months old, battery is new enough the warranty receipt hasn't faded yet. T-tops only leak a little bit, and then only during heavy rain if you take a sharp turn. Tires are decent. No cracks on windshield or rear window, or on T-tops for that matter. 146,xxx miles. Would be interested in partial trade for a firearm, or ammo in 9mm, 5.56, 7.62x39, 7.62x54R, 7.62x38R, .45ACP and .380ACP. Thank you for your time.
I could probably negotiate on the price a bit, if you can convince me you'll take good care of her. I don't want to get rid of her, but between me and the old lady, we have too many cars, so a couple of the projects have to go."
