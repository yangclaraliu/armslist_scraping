Light and easy to carry and certainly avoids the significant recoil of a 12ga.  Because it uses either 2 3/4"" or 3"" slugs and has a Hastings rifled/ported barrel it works well for man, woman or younger hunter.  Can be even more versatile if you purchase a smooth bore barrel which is much easier to find than the quality Hastings rifled/ported barrel currently installed.  I added a Bushnell 1.75 - 4 variable scope from my collection of used scopes last week but I have not sighted it in.  Gun is in good condition no major nicks, scrapes or scratches.  If you want more pics just let me know.  Not interested in trades...sorry.  Personal sale no credit cards.  Prefer to sell locally but if necessary could ship (at your expense of course)."

THIS IS A DEAL THAT DOES NOT COME BY OFTEN
This is a WELL TUNED competition pistol. Upgrades to this CZ 75 SP -01 include:
 - competition hammer
 - as on all Shadows - slide comes with firing pin safety removed
 - the slide is cut in order to accommodate the 'low sitting' fully adjustable Target rear sight (height as well as windage) 
 - front sight is Fiber optic 
 - thin aluminum competition grips
 - custom tuned and fully polished trigger (cca < 3 lbs).

The pistol was used in competition so it comes with much newer barrel. The finish in the front of the frame and slide shows some signs of holster wear but IMO this adds to the character and looks just fine. There are no deep scratches or gauges in the metal and the wear is pretty much only in the coating so if desired, it can be re-finished to like new condition.

 - EXCEPTIONALLY accurate and smooth (MUCH better trigger than a regular $880 basic Shadow  that does NOT have a custom trigger job, or competition hammer or cut slide for fully adjustable rear sight)
 - included 2 original CZ 18-rd magazines and Original CZ box
This is a very special gun (Close to $1500 in gun + upgrades. Get it here at a BARGAIN PRICE !!). Selling it only because I upgraded to CZ Shadow ACCU.

My price is ONLY $895 !! Price is A B S O L U T E L Y  FIRM at $895, so please save your or my time – NO OFFERS OR TRADES, PLEASE. Thanks for your understanding. Only ‘face-to-face cash deals anywhere in greater Tampa Bay area.

Traditional bolt action accuracy with detachable magazine.  Shoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells. Because it is a fairly heavy gun and I've had a recoil reducer installed in the stock the recoil is very manageable.  Very nice shape and as you can see in the pics it has no noticeable dings or scratches but the recoil pad has some wear from installing the recoil reducer (by a gunsmith).  I've added a Bushnell 1.75 - 4 scope from my collection of used scopes but have not sighted it in.  Sling Swivels installed.  Prefer to sell locally and not looking for trades.  No credit cards.  May consider shipping to an FFL but at your expense.  Feel free to ask questions or request more pics.  Don't miss this classic beauty.  Thanks..."

I am asking $1700 or best offer on this gun. This gun comes with 120 rounds of Remington Core-Lokt 150 grain SP. This gun shoots a 1 inch group with this ammo at 200 yards. With the comp the recoil is less than a 243 CAL. The barrel was cut for the length for perfect balance in the stock for a counter point. I have shot 80 rounds through this gun of all different types of ammo it all shoots 1 inch group at 100 yards, its 200-300 yards where you have to do the ammo test. It has the factory trigger which is the Savage Ultra Trigger which had custom work done and is set at 2 pounds. The receiver action is very smooth and tight. If you are not interested in the scope or rings, the gun can be sold separate. I have well over $2000 into this gun, thank you for looking. If you have any questions you can call REDACTED."
