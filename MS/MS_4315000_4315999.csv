These are used by the US military, but are in excellent shape. Many have handwritten things on them in black marker by soldiers, usually designating the ""second"" thing that went into the cans. For instance, it might be a can that originally held 1,140 rounds of 5.56, but the GI wrote ""loaded 9mm mags"" or ""empty M4 mags""or ""1000 loose rounds 5.56""* etc.. Overall, I'm pleased to say that these are mostly in nice shape. Many look brand new. Plenty of them are a little dusty from the Sand Box, but that will clean right off.  At very worst some may have some small rust spots, but these are cosmetic and in no way affect performance. I put some pictures below to show you common examples of what you should likely expect.

(Tango grip was too inexpensive to be the real $100.00 Tango, so is probably a knockoff). Anyone that has experience with these knows that generally the scope mount is an integral (built-in) part of the rear receiver cover, which is loose, moves and cannot be depended on. My SKS is drilled and tapped with 6 separate bolt holes, holding on the scope mount (The scope mount is the longer of the two available for drill and tap for the  SKS; Pro-Tec or Pro-Mag brand, I think it is. The longer scope mount enables the use of full-size scopes, versus red-dots and similar). Anyway, it is mounted with 6 bolts and is going nowhere, forever I imagine...but can be unbolted with allen wrenches. The scope mount sits just high enough that the rear receiver cover can be removed for cleaning, without removing the mount or scope. It has a $100.00 UTG EZ Tap 36 color reticle Bug Buster scope on it. New and never been outside. I imagine the box is still here that I can give you. It has the shell deflector to keep the shells from battering the bottom of the scope. I have upgraded the lower stock Tapco picatinny rail from hard plastic to aluminum (The rail that the fore grip mounts to). It has a cheek riser and Tapco rubber butt-pad. I also have 3 appropriately colored Tapco magazines. It has an olive green and leather Mosin Nagant strap on it. This was my keeper and I had no intention of ever selling.

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

Ship scene on cylender is at about 35-40%, I  have not cleaned it as I was told not to.
I just looked up similar on Gunbroker going for $600-1000 in mint condition, mine like I said is not mint but I think that it adds to the character, hoping to trade for a ccw. or $400 cash...Here is a little history I have found on it.

The Colt Army Model 1860 is a muzzle-loaded cap & ball .44-caliber revolver used during the American Civil War made by Colt's Manufacturing Company. It was used as a side arm by cavalry, infantry, artillery troops, and naval forces.

The Colt 1860 Army uses the same size frame as the .36 caliber 1851 Navy revolver. The frame is relieved to allow the use of a rebated cylinder that enables the Army to be chambered in .44 caliber. Also, the barrel on the 1860 Army has a forcing cone that is visibly shorter than that of the 1851 Navy, allowing the Army revolver to have a longer cylinder. Another distinguishing feature of the Colt 1860 Army, first introduced on the Colt 1855 Sidehammer Revolver, is the ""creeping"" loading lever.

More than 200,000 were manufactured from 1860 through 1873. Colt's biggest customer was the US Government with no less than 129,730[1] units being purchased and issued to the troops. The weapon was a single-action, six-shot weapon accurate up to 75 to 100 yards, where the fixed sights were typically set when manufactured. The rear sight was a notch in the hammer, clearly visible only when the revolver was cocked.

The Colt .44-caliber “Army"" Model was the most widely used revolver of the Civil War. It had a six-shot, rotating cylinder, and fired a 0.454-inch-diameter (11.5 mm) round lead ball, or a conical projectile, that was propelled by a 30-grain charge of black powder ignited by a copper percussion cap that contained a volatile charge of fulminate of mercury (a substance that explodes upon impact). The percussion cap, when struck by the hammer, ignited the powder charge. When fired, balls had a muzzle velocity of about 900 feet per second (274 meters/second).

""The cylinder was a 'rebated cylinder,' meaning that the rear of the cylinder was turned to a smaller diameter than the front. The barrel was rounded and smoothed into the frame, as was the Navy Model. The frame, hammer, and rammer lever were case-hardened, the remainder blued; grips were of one-piece walnut; and the trigger guard and front grip strap were of brass while the backstrap was blued."""

SIMILAR TO ULTIMAK,"Downtown / Midtown, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 120,"Listed On: Friday, May 8, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is the new Troy top rail with integrated gas tube. It's similar to an Ultimak top rail/piston tube. However, unlike an Ultimak or other AK top rail systems, it does not need to be clamped or bolted down to the barrel or bottom rail. 

It uses a unique adjustable castle nut retention type method for retaining tension. This allows this to fit on just about every type of AK variant rifle or clone out there.

This one is brand new in box. I ordered this and the Troy long AK bottom rail, only to find that their long bottom rails don't fit certain AKs with the Bulgarian style FSB. Returned the bottom rail and kept this top rail, but deciding to sell it since I've decided to stick with the original Arsenal handguards for the time being due to not running any optics with the AK.

I installed the gas tube rail for fitting and then removed it. Has not had any rounds through it or even had the gas piston cycled through it. It's new in box.

This will fit with just about any lower handguard or rail. This is pretty much a railed gas tube like an Ultimak.

Asking $120 bottom dollar. Prefer face to face exchange in OKC area. Comes in original packaging new.  Add $10 if shipping.

The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is the smallest of the XD(M)® line, but it’s by no means the least. It boasts the same superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make larger XD(M)®s easy and intuitive to use in a slightly abbreviated package.

Lifetime warranty right? Maybe not. 

The wind-age adjustment knob FELL OFF my scope, I called Tasco and the rep said no problem, the scope has lifetime warranty. I package it up and spend $15 to ship it. A few weeks later I receive the message that the scope would cost more to fix than to replace it.  

Tasco's only offer is to sell me a different scope at half price, well fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me!

Personally, I will never buy a product with the brand name Tasco ever again.

Shoots smooth and very very accurate.. Precision 1970's era Japanese works. They still make these, but arguably these older ones were the best. Wood has some nicks, but nothing deep or scarring badly. Metal scrollwork has some handling wear, but barrels are bright and shiny and action and hinging is crisp and tight. Fiber sights and original included. These sell in rough condition every day for over $1000. The gun even has the selector switch to choose which barrel fires first, very cool. I am in no hurry to sell, but I am giving up on trap shooting due to busy life. Seeing if there are any serious interested parties out there. Do some research on these and you will find new @ $2500 , used from this era are a great deal and perform as well or better. 
Only meet ftf and in public with Ohio ID. Mature ccw holder here. Only letting me upload the one pic, so I picked the closeup of the works. You have to handle this gun to see and appreciate it anyway. I work in Columbus near OSU, can travel within reason. Cash price is somewhat negotiable,but be fair.

The Ruger Marksman Adjustable trigger offers a crisp release with a pull weight that is adjustable between 3 and 5 pounds, allowing shooters to make the perfect shot. The ergonomic, lightweight stock is designed for quick and easy handling, and the receiver is drilled and tapped. Scope bases and sling swivel studs are included.

This unique 9mm pistol is the perfect small defense handgun that meets the demands of today's law enforcement professionals as a backup duty gun, and responsible citizens as a conceal carry gun. To our poor knowledge, this is the very smallest subcompact that Sig makes in 9mm, while the venerable 239 was just not quite small enough. Like its lesser Ruger and Kel-Tec competitors, it is still quite a handful when the operator pulls the trigger. Manufacturer is Sig Sauer of Exeter, NH. Type is double action only, hammer fired, locked breech semi automatic sub compact pistol. Construction is Nitron® finished stainless slide, steel barrel, trigger, and internal parts, all built into a high impact steel reinforced polymer frame. Overall length is only 5 3/8 inches from the muzzle to the back of the grip frame; 4 1/8 inches from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the butt; and thinness of only .945 inches not counting the slide release lever. Barrel is 2.9 inch flared muzzle, 6 groove right hand 1:9.84 rifling. Weight is only 20.5 ounces empty. The P290’s .350 smooth faced trigger pulls at a steady 9 pounds, with 1 inch of travel. Sights are classic dovetailed Sig White Dot Front and white bar notched rear. This Sig P-290 comes with One factory stainless bodied factory magazines made by Mec-Gar for Sig, a flush fit 6 rounder. Extended factory magazines are readily available. Replacement pricing on these pistols ranges $500 apiece or more in our area. We’re offering the Sig P-290 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only $ 339.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California or Massachusetts.
