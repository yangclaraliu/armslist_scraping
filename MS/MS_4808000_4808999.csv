Serial number research shows it was born in 1993 and was a US import. Bought it from an estate sale, had it to the range, put 100 rounds down it and it shoots like it’s supposed to without any FTFs or FTEs. It’s just a little too much gun for my arthritis. 

It came with only one 13-round magazine and the original case and that’s what I’m selling it with. As the pictures show, it seems to have been well cared for and we gave it a super detailed cleaning before we took it to the range and a maintenance cleaning after the range."

The PMAG 40 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

The RYG Phantom trigger is engineered with innovative features conveniently housed within the trigger pad, for the ultimate performance experience, in a sleek, seamless design. 

This unique fully adjustable (drop-in) trigger is CNC machined from billet 6061 T6 aluminum and hard anodized to withstand the affects of environmental stress and chemical exposure. 

The Phantom Trigger offers both pre-travel take-up and over-travel engagement adjustments, thus providing the user with optimal control and customizability. Tuning action is achieved by two opposing, conveniently located 2/56 inch adjustment screws. This quality allows the user to precisely tune the feel of the trigger to his or her preferred specifications, including fore and aft travel distance. 

The Phantom Trigger utilizes a distinctive, spring loaded, anatomical engagement safety, which maintains full responsiveness and reliability without ever sacrificing safety. The Phantom Trigger's precision-machined trigger bar boasts mirror polishing on all engagement and contact surfaces. This element greatly increases the sensitivity and overall performance of the trigger. 

The Phantom Trigger is compatible with all Glock calibers and size formats, and is easily installed by the consumer. The dynamic features of the Phantom Trigger allow the user to transform their stock factory Glock trigger into a highly accurate, dynamic and reliable trigger system. 

Features: 
Set screws in front and back of the trigger to adjust over travel and pre travel. 
All aluminum trigger milled out of solid billet aluminum. 
Wide ergonomic trigger safety is completely flush when depressed. 
Very short trigger reset. 
All Glock safeties fully functional. 
Instructions and allen key included."

I have a very accurate Swedish Mauser that was modified by Kimber in the 1990's. 

It has weaver bases, built in muzzlebrake, enhanced bolt, synthetic stock, and matte finish. Nice crisp 2-stage trigger. I recall all numbers match also.

VERY ACCURATE and 6.5x55 Swedish ammo can be bought online from $15-20 a box. In fact, the Prvi Partisan 140 Grain Soft Point shoots very, very well in this gun and is reloadeable and can be bought for $15 a box...cheap.

Patented BDC reticle: The BDC reticle allows hunters to hold 'dead-on' at ranges exceeding those previously thought possible. The BDC's unique see-through ballistic circles offer an incredible advantage for long range shooting, yet allow a normal sight picture for shorter-range shots where the crosshair itself is the aiming point.

Extremely bright sight picture: Allows for high-resolution images even when hunting in the least desirable conditions.

Versatile magnification range: Offers the flexibility needed for any type of hunting situation, from heavy timber to the open prairies.

Waterproof, fogproof, shockproof: Nitrogen filled and O-ring sealed.



Multicoated optical system: Multicoated lenses boost light transmission up to 98%—unheard of in similarly priced scopes.

Generous, consistent eye relief: Keeps your brow safe—even with the heaviest recoiling cartridges, lightweight rifles, and severe shooting angles.

Hello;

This gun is I recall a 1999 mfr Winchester 70 Featherweight and has the pre-64 mauser claw extractor.

The unusual aspect of this gun is the Featherweight stock has NO CHECKING and looks great with a dark brown\reddish tint. It actually feels really nice. And the bolt looks to be chromed. The trigger is FANTASTIC, about 2.5 pounds and very crisp. There obviously has been some custom work done on this gun.

The bluing is 90+ percent, the wood is also the same, maybe even 95%.

I last shot it about 5 years ago and it shot great.

The scope and rings are not included, but the Leupold bases are ($25 value alone).

$750 FTF or $800 shipped CONUS.

NO TRADES PLEASE.

Thanks.

Bought this gun new about a year ago for my wife. She has decided she does not like it. It has had about 200 rounds run through it and also Armalaser exchanged the original TR-10 for one that was more sensitive to touch. This is a good carry gun for someone who is looking for a good used gun Have 220 rounds of Ammo also. GA residents only within 100 miles of Cleveland GA must have a carry permit for this transaction. Paid 445.00 new, asking 375.00 or trade for a NIB Ruger LCP factory custom."

I collect and am only interested in Rem 788's at this time,  I might be interested in other calibers,  like maybe a .243 for the right price.

I will be using a custom stock, so it doesn't matter if it comes with one - you can sell yours on ebay and make another $75

I'll pay up to $400 cash for one in great shape with an upgraded Timney trigger,  - but most of the 788's I've seen are in the $300 to $350 range. All transactions will be made with proper paperwork through a FFL.     I can travel  for the right deal,  but I deduct mileage from the price I'll pay. 

If you're out of the area -  Don't waste my time or yours -  you'll have to ship the rifle to a local FFL dealer here so I can examine it here before I send you a penny.

This XDM is in excellent condition, only showing normal wear on the barrel. It was not used frequently for carry, so there isn't any holster wear. I estimate about 1000 rounds, maybe 1200 tops through it. This pistol is the real deal and will serve you well beside your bed or in a holster. 

The pistol comes with the original case, which includes a mag loader, mag pouch, and factory holster. Only the magazine loader was ever used. In addition, there is a N82 Tactical Pro IWB holster (most comfortable holster ever) and a leather OWB holster. Both holsters are perfect for this pistol and will be what you need to concealed carry. There are five (yes, five!) magazines included with this package deal. Three of the magazines are the extended 19 rounds magazines. These extended magazines have the medium back strap piece (different sizes can be ordered via SA). Two of the magazines are the compact 12 round magazines for easier concealed carry. Per online research this pistol, alone, is valued at over $400 well used. Add the extra magazines and holsters and you have a great deal. The holsters are also in great shape.

The terms - I am willing to meet anyone interested in purchasing this pistol at the FFL of my choice (in VA Beach). We will go inside to meet where you can inspect and subsequently purchase the firearm. If you decide to purchase the firearm I will only sell it via the FFL, who charges $20. You will be responsible for paying the $20 transfer fee. This means that you can have all of this for $520. I understand VA law does not require the use of an FFL, but I prefer to use one. 

If you live out of the area and are interested in purchasing this, we can work out a way to get it to you. My FFL will ship it to your FFL. The pistol is not legal in California or states that have magazine restrictions. You will pay the price plus actual shipping charges (my FFL will calculate - should be less than $20 ground). No Paypal, they're a bunch of commies. 

Please let me know if you have any questions! This is an AWESOME pistol. I've never had a single failure."

Standard magazines, for instance, can also be used for backup weapons. Compact and subcompact Glock pistol model magazines can be loaded with a convincing number of rounds - i.e. Glock 26: up to 33 rounds. The innovative polymer frame of the Glock pistol does not require grip shells. As a result, it has considerably more space for the magazine body and enables double-row staggered cartridge configuration. For this reason, Glock pistols are superior in firepower to conventional pistol models of the same size. Glock magazines have a stiff metal tube encased in the proven Glock high tech polymer. This resists deformation - even when dropped from great height or exposed to extreme environment conditions.

The Sig Sauer SP2022 Two-Tone 40S&W is an exclusive version of their popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system.

The Sig Sauer polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded Sig Sauer a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols.
