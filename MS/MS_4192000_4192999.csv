This is Brand new and comes with a new BSA 6-24x44mm Tactical Mil-Dot Rifle Scope and a adjustable Bi-pod. I would love to shoot it but I don't really have access to outdoor shooting and I prefer Handguns. This is a perfect caliber for everything from squirrels at 500 yards or a deer (Experienced Hunters) @ 400 yards. It also comes with 40 rounds of PPU 100gr sp, 20 rounds of Hornady 117 gr (Whitetail interlock) and a Very nice Aluminum rifle case that holds 2 rifles and extras. It will probably need to be Zeroed because I haven't done it since installing the scope. Must sign a Bill of sale and show a ptp/ptc and a MN id.

Serial # G18628xx This rifle shoots great, looks great, I tried to find some dents in the wood but could not. I am sure if you look long enough you will find one or two tiny ones maybe. The wood is beautiful. Though there are a couple tiny scratches on the end of the barrel. But they are on the outside and are not on the crown, so accuracy is not effected. Comes with Redfield Lo Pro 3-9 Scope. Looks like weaver all steel Mounts. Jaeger Quick Release sling swivels and Uncle Mike's Leather sling. In a plain hard plastic case. 
This rifle was Made between 1987 and 1988 according to the serial numbers.
That was the time when they made them as good as the pre-64 or even better!  Price dropped for quick sale. If it does not sell in the next couple days, I'll just hang on to it a few more years.

Of course shipping is on the buyer. Will send more pics & reply to serious inquiry emails with contact number. No picture collectors Please!

It just doesn't fit my hand very well.  Not what you generally hear about CZ, but I just didn't bond with it.  So I'm selling it to try something else.  I have shot through it: 115 gr Perfecta, 115 gr Winchester, 115 gr Federal, 124 gr Hornady XTP, 147 gr Hydra Shok.  All shot without a hitch; this pistol gave me zero malfunctions.  Great shooter...just didn't fit me.

This is a CZ 75; you can read all about the history of this fine firearm online.  This particular one was made in 2013.  The 'B' denotes the firing pin block, which has been on all CZ 75s for many years now.  The 'D' denotes the decocker, allowing the user to drop the hammer safely on a loaded chamber.  The 'POLICE' brings along with it some things not found on other 75 BDs, including: checkering on front and backstraps, serrations on the trigger for increased grip, and a lanyard loop on the bottom of the mainspring housing.  There are no magazine brakes or magazine disconnects in this gun.  There are no safeties at all: the decocker is the safety, along with the matter between your ears!  It's a great combat handgun.

Condition: 10/10.  As noted, I fired about 10 magazines though it.  There is not a single scratch on the gun.  I have never holstered it and it's sat in my safe.  The polycoat finish is perfect and the barrel is beautiful.  Just a very, very nice condition POLICE model for someone looking for this somewhat hard-to-find version of the BD.

Asking price is $500 or best offer.  I paid $550 at Damascus Gun Shop (a premier online CZ dealer) in December.  Looks like it's still $550 on their homepage.  So this represents a $50 savings over new and, as stated, this gun is truly Like New In Box.  I have all of the original paperwork, the box, the target sheet that you get with CZs, and the warranty card that I did not send in.  It's truly like buying a new gun.  For $500, I'll even fill the magazines with the 147 gr. Hydra Shok so you're ready to go with it.

A beautiful gun at a great price (and bonus JHP rounds in the magazines).  Don't pass this one up!

This gun was designed for home defense or a gun fight - not for shooting birds.

The heat shield above the barrel of the M5 12 guage shotgun allows for quick cool down and rapid fire.

The M5 12 guage shotgun carries 5 rounds in the magazine, while holding 1 in the chamber (5+1) making it perfect for home defense. This Armscor/Rock Island Armory M5 12 guage pump is heavy duty, strong, and very reliable.

This shotgun also has a super trigger pull.

The barrel length itself is 20"", and the overall length of the shotgun measures at 40"".

This shotgun has a 3"" chamber which allows it to use both 3"" and 2 3/4"" shells.

Here are some specs below about general information on the 60-14 2"" Model.

thanks, Ed 

Here is the State-of-the-Art, Fourteenth Engineering Change variant of the Chief's Special Stainless that was originally introduced in 1965. This one has, as the photos show, Smith & Wesson's internal lock. Barrel length is 2 1/8 inch full lug, up from the original old 1 7/8 inch. Weight empty is 22.5 oz, up from the original 19 oz for the older .38 Special variants, a change that came about in 1996 with the introduction of the J Magnum frame. The Model 60 classifies as a traditional double action revolver; that is, it can fire simply by a long trigger pull in double action from a resting position hammer, or by cocking the hammer and firing single action. All Smith & Wesson revolvers, of course, have internal transfer bar safeties that prevent the hammer from moving the firing pin forward except when the trigger is pulled all the way. The 60-14 has MIM, Metal-injected-molded trigger and hammer. It operates with a floating firing pin instead of the older hammer nose type firing pin."

This truck has locking hubs and runs strong. It has a rear main seal leak and it can't be driven far so it will need to be towed. This is an easy fix for someone who knows what they are doing. I don't want to put the time or money into doing it so the first $1000 or reasonable trade or offer gets it. These trucks with no tranny or motor are being sold on CL for $1,500 just for the body. My wife just had a new baby and now we have two children and can not fit everyone in the truck any more. Once fixed this truck is worth an easy $2,500. I have had four mechanics look at the truck and they all say the same thing. I have gotten my use out of this truck and I am not a mechanic. I would fix it if I knew how and I don't want to pay out of pocket to get the job done. Please no low ballers I know what this truck is worth and NO I DO NOT NEED HELP SELLING IT. If I don't get any decent offers I will just take it to the junk yard and that would be sad to see a perfectly good body, transmission, new mud tires, new battery, a good interior, and a beast 302 motor go to be scrapped. Btw the a/c and heat both work. The truck has duel tanks and the back one needs to be drained due to old gas. I never filled both tanks I always used the front one but the back one does work. It is just sitting here in my yard and we need a bigger family vehicle so that is what I am going to be using the money towards. Offer away all I can say is no thanks. -Will"

The PMR-30 is a lightweight, full size pistol (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blow back/locked-breech system, allowing for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a flush fit, 30-round double stack Zytel nylon magazine with round count ports. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over travel stop. It has a thumb-activated ambidextrous safety lever. The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The slide and barrel are 4140 steel, the frame is 7075 aluminum. The grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, urethane recoil buffer, and captive coaxial recoil springs.

Hell, if it were a woman, I’d marry it.

If you like shooting skeet, then this is the gun for you.

This winchester is made specifically for skeet shooting.

The wide angle skeet choke allows you to hit those fast moving clays with ease.

The semi-auto action not only lets you shoot quick repeating shots, but also helps reduce the felt recoil.

The vented rib is awesome!!! It not only assists in your aiming, but it keeps the heat from your barrel from blurring your vision, giving you clear shots.

The 2-3/4″ 12 gauge chamber gives you just enough power, without too much recoil.

The engraved receiver, the expertly jeweled bolt, and the checkered wood on the forearm and stock make for a beautiful gun as well. So, not only is this gun functional, but it’s pretty too.

So like I said,” If it were a girl, I’d marry it.”"

You must stop the downward spiral that is causing irreparable damage to your marriage. Profmaliki′s Save My Marriage spell is an important step in re-instituting laughter, trust and compatibility back to what you once had. This Spell can help as it has countless others who have found themselves in the same painful situation facing the loss of their marriage and the loss of a lifetime partner.

How Does This “Save My Marriage” Spell Work?
This Spell works by filling your husband or wife’s head with nothing but positive and good memories of your marriage and relationship. At the same time, it erases the negative feelings that started the entire Divorce plan in the first place.

When both forces work together, the Divorce slowly becomes a non issue. Your spouse begins to see all the great things about your marriage and the love you share. The problems that created the Divorce will be over shadowed and dwarfed in comparison to the Love and Happiness of your marriage!

This fantastic Spell also contains very strong BINDING ENERGIES. These powerful energies act as emotional magnets between a married couple. The desire to desert you marriage again, is never felt by either of you, keeping you both happy and in love.

I got this from a relative. I took it out last Friday to make sure that it runs properly. I put 4 clips of GI ball, and 1 clip of commercial Winchester soft point through it. It functioned perfectly. I found it to be very accurate. Much more so than my AR with open sights. I don't know if this was due to the nice GI peep sight, the weight of the rifle compared to the Ar, or just its inherent accuracy, but I was amazed.

This rifle has a replacement .308 barrel with a nice clean bore. Trigger group has (as far as I can tell) all Springfield Armory GI parts in excellent condition. Bold has the correct drawing number for the receiver. (A8)

I know that the T37 flash hider isn't quite correct, but it appears that Arlington Ordnance included it on a few of their rifles. (I have only found one other example.)

Here is what my research has indicated. Be aware that this might not be perfectly accurate, as there is a lot of controversy, misinformation and myth surrounding this gun. It's hard to know who knows what they are talking about and who doesn't.

The ""Tanker"" has an interesting history.  The Government built 150 of them, and Springfield Armory built two in the US. and only one is known to survive. Judging from the specimen at the Springfield Armory Museum, they were real chop-jobs with a lot of crude filing and hand fitting.

Later in the 60's some companies found that they could sell a Garand for more if they shortened it and called it a Tanker. Some were good, some were horrible.

In the interest of any potential buyers I felt that I needed to take this one out and test it. It functions perfectly. I noticed that the charging handle takes a slight forward nudge to allow the bolt to close after the clip is inserted, but this is very common for even the nicest unmodified Garands.

Feel free to do a search for M1 Garand Tanker and see what you find. You might start with this:

http://ww2.rediscov.com/spring/VFPCGI.exe?IDCFile=/spring/DETAILS.IDC,SPECIFIC=10553,DATABASE=64434061

905,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4192905,For Sale/Trade:  94 MUSTANGE CONVERTIBLE,"Old Magnolia, Houston, Texas","$ 1,000","Listed On: Monday, March 30, 2015",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hello and thanks for looking today I have a running project for sale. Its a 1994 Mustang convertible auto with the 3.8L V-6 its white with two tone black and red interior. The good is limited and the bad is extensive that's why its a project. Good is awesome gas mileage in a sports car. it has a newer convertible motor, it has aftermarket clear taillights, and a nice cd deck. its lights, horn, blinkers all, cruse control, wipers etc. all work. runs highway speeds and drives straight. has great tires 90%+ tread life BUT BEST OF ALL ITS A MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE FOR 1000$!!! Then there is the bad... title history is clear, but you will have to get a bonded title. the last owner had a suspended license and signed the title when he bought it, but since he had a suspended license he could not transfer it to his name, and since the title is signed by him it cant be transferred to anyone else without going through the bonding process. from what I've read its 100-150$ process that's just paperwork and a little time consuming. you can get temp tags online though to drive it legally while you wait. I have the actual title, bill of sale to me and history tracing it back. the windows don't roll up or down. the driver side ""clicks"" eagerly but is probably just off track, the passenger motor is worn out. the driver side door has a bad sag to it that you have to lift up the door and slam for it to close it needs replacement door bushings. top goes up and down no problem, however it did have a big square cut out when I bought it, I have since patched it. it leaks very slightly but serves its purpose. does not have back seat belts, front seats are out of a different car and the passenger side needs to be bolted down better (it wobbles). It has a tendency to run hot but has never over heated. spedo and tach work, but odom is swtuck at 138K. and per my mechanic it needs a new throttle body and or sensor. someone in the past rebuilt the current one, but it has a miss and backfires at low speeds, but it goes away at street and highway speeds. This is a good project for someone that has a teen about to turn 16, someone that just likes to turn wrenches casually on weekends, a fun weekend cruiser. etc. I got it as a project to tinker with, but with school, work and a newborn baby its sat for 3 months without me doing a thing to it. its dirty and could use a good wash. and a good home I would rate exterior as 6.5/10 and interior as 5.5/10. I love Trades. if you have an old jeep XJ (Cherokee (non grand)). motorcycles, and GUNS. I Love partial, full, and Multi Gun deals, ak, ar,sks, milsurps, 1911s, glocks, Whatcha got???"

Why set up a NFA Gun Trust?

 Avoid the intrusion and hassle of being photographed, fingerprinted, and obtaining chief law enforcement officer (CLEO) sign off

 Legally allow others to use your NFA firearm--without a NFA Gun Trust, you cannot let a friend shoot your NFA firearm at the range

 Legally allow others to possess your NFA Firearm--without a NFA Gun Trust, your spouse or roommate cannot have access to your NFA firearm, meaning Your NFA firearm must be locked up in a safe or other secure location which your spouse or roommate cannot access.
