A basic google search will confirm that this is one of the best shooting 9mms in existence. It is on nearly every top 10 list for 9mms, see below:

It is also tied with the Beretta as the lightest weight double/single action pistol in those lists, being around 6oz less than the CZ, Baby Eagle, and EAA Witness Elite Match. The Taurus is a little heavier than the Beretta (less than 1oz) because it has a longer barrel, but costs several hundred dollars less."

I bought this out of a neighbor's yard a year and a half ago, see the last picture. It ran well enough to ride it home, but it needed a lot of love. It was supposed to be a re-learning bike for my girl, but she lost interest and would rather just ride behind on the big bike. We are moving away, far away, and space is limited in the trailer. 

The original twin sideways Hitachi carbs were worn out and leaky, and it also had that weird Yamaha YICS system. That system is complicated and fussy, so I put a single carb conversion on it. It has a Keihn 40mm Harley carb now. It runs, it sounds better than any 500 I've ever heard before, but it needs a little carb tuning that I don't have the time or skills to do. This is the same carb body that HD used on the Buell Blast 500, so it shouldn't be too difficult. 

The list:
NEW Dunlop D404 tires front and rear. Fresh new tires from Donelson's, not 5 year old bargains.
New fork seals
New MAC staggered dual slashcut exhaust. Why it sounds so good.
New seat cover.
New paint.
New grips
New front brake pads
New battery
Fuse box rewired with blade fuses to replace old glass ones.
Fresh oil change, filter, and new gear lube in rear drive.
Clear title in my name.
It passed inspection last year at Rich's Cycles, but I never registered it or rode it except over to his shop. 

I have a tub of parts that are from a parts bike that came with this. Complete wiring harness, gauges, signals, rear fender, etc.

Hate to sell the little guy, but it needs a home where it will be rode and loved. Come take a look!"

All though the slide looks cool it also offers a better functionality making the pistol a lot lighter and easier to handle.

Right now I do not currently have any vests however I will soon.
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

NOTE: I have six test shot plates if interested to use them for target practice I am selling them for $20.00 Each let me know if you want them thanks."

I would trade for a stainless 1911 or a quality or a nice revolver--really looking for a three screw flat top Ruger blackhawk, also another .17 centerfire, something in .220 swift or a high en air rifle, seecamp .380. I am open to,most interesting guns as I don't have a need for the ruger any more. However, it is a nearly new gun that I paid a bunch of money for, so a trade needs to be equal value. it seems that they sell for the 700 range so I will say that a trade should be around that value. I can add money for the right deal. pics available by email, but it is like new.  It also has an extra 30 rounder."

Come pick up a load or I can deliver for a small fee of ammo or gas money. Text me and we'll go from there. Not putting my address up here for all to see. REDACTED

- Don't text me at 11:30pm and ask me if it's still available. If this post is up here, it is and I go to bed when the O'Reilly Factor is over (9pm)
- Don't ask me to send pictures to you of the firewood I'M GIVING AWAY
-This is really easy. Either you want to come and pick up a load of free wood or you don't
- I don't have time to have a 20 minute conversation about what kind of wood it is, how it is cut and how much there is. I'm clearing a decent size piece of property in Eastern North Carolina about 10 minutes from the Air Station so there are all trees common to this area cut in various (shorter) links comparable to ""fire wood size"" hence the name of the post - FREE FIRE WOOD.

I sold my Glock with all my mags and this one was left in one of my cars....a nice cheap aftermarket .45 caliber ten-rounder.
If I recall, it's hard to get apart but can be disassembled, and I ran ammo through it a couple times and it feeds fine.....it has a blued steel liner inside so it's not a total POS, just a good cheap-ass magazine that'll work well for your car gun, and if you lose it you won't be out a lot of dough.

The article below is an interesting read on how the Taurus PT-92 came to existence after they purchased Beretta's manufacturing facility where the storied 92F was manufactured. While many would still prefer to pay more to have Beretta on the gun, there are a good many PT-92 enthusiasts who prefer what Taurus did with the design changes. These are excellent full size firearms designed for service duty.

I called around town, checked a number of online sites and went to a few local gun stores. The PT-92 AF runs about $499 just about everywhere except Bass Pro Shops (they were asking a whopping $579). I'm sure places like GrabAGun and PalmettoState probably run specials from time to time, but the sweet spot seems to be $499 new. Asking $450 Price is negotiable within reason.

The front tires have medium wear and the back tires are almost brand new, These tires have ALOT more miles to go. The title says that the truck is a LGT CONVTNL 'F which I believe means that it comes with some things that aren't standard but I am not sure what those things are. This truck was used for hauling horse and cow feed and been in the pasture herding cows and horses. This truck was driven daily to go and get farm supplies. It has locking front hubs that work perfect but the truck pulls so good that I have not needed to use it. The motor and transmission are strong. The truck may need a tune up and valve cover gaskets but that is all and very easy to do yourself if you are a handy man. The truck was teal green but was painted white somewhere along it's lifetime. One of the headlights needs to be replaced but that is just cosmetic, everything else other than the tune up and valve gaskets are cosmetic. I only drove it during the day so I had no need to fix it. The tires are Kenda Radial and are made for the mud and any type of terrain. The interior is in good condition the head liner has been removed. This is a work truck and is meant to be banged and beaten up. It was built Ford Tough FOR SURE and will make an awesome work truck or first truck. I am willing to work with anyone with a reasonable offer. I do not want to sale this truck to someone who just wants to make money off of me.  I am also willing to trade for one of equal value as long as it runs as good as my truck does. Thanks for your time and interest. NO LOWBALLERS please and NO I DO NOT need help selling this truck."

CZ 75d pistol with two 10+1 mags
This pistol is in great shape. Round count is right around 700. Aluminum alloy frame, rubber grips, single/double action, decocker, and chambered round indicator. Not one single piece of plastic in this pistol. Trigger is every bit as crisp and clean as any 1911 I've ever fired. Used by military, police and competition shooters all over the world. It is also the most cloned pistol worldwide. Many gunsmiths and firearm experts claim that the CZ 75 is the best combat handgun ever made. This is a lifetime gun!!!
