This is NOT a reproduction. this is a 166 year old civil war era Colt revolver. This is a FIRST model, martially marked on left side ""Colt's Patent U.S."" . First model is identified by the oval notches on the cylinder and square back trigger guard. production was about 7,000 between 1848-1850 only. I believe this pistol made in 1848 based on serial number. Has all the Sam Colt markings, and inspection markings such as ""K"" and ""T"" around trigger area, and matching early serial number #7480 on ALL the parts. Grips in descent shape, overall great patina. Scene almost all gone, can barely see one word and partial picture of horse on cylinder. A well used gun; most 1st model dragoons saw lots of service. I have not attempted to clean anything on this gun, it is as I got it.  Function is very smooth. The barrel looks to have maybe been shortened. it measures approx 4"". My research shows only 7.5"" barrels on the .44 dragoon.( baby dragoon shorter but smaller caliber); I showed to a friend who is a knowledgable collector, he says whatever was done it was a LONG time ago. the patina on the barrel is same as gun. our thoughts were that a gun smith from possible late century or turn, did modifications, or may have been altered soon after manufacturer. I read that people wanted a shorter barrel, which is why Colt introduced the smaller baby dragoon later. someone maybe wanted the .44 cal still but shorter barrel. Workmanship is very good. Most unknowing people would not realize shorter barrel. It also has broken little rod that activates the cylinder ""plunger"". it still works but not much to grab on to. My neighbor is an avid percussion gun user and thinks this gun will fire. Bore in barrel looks good as well. Any additional opinions or knowledge from anyone please email or call. This was passed to grandfather to grandson. Has been in family at least 60 years. Previous history unknown. this is a rare civil war era piece. Early dragoons are hard to find. Chance to buy one reasonably. Asking $1,500. Taking offers. I can email many more detailed pictures to intersted parties. Thank you. REDACTED."

Bore is excellent, wood if very good, most metal is good, magazine tube and barrel bands are fair. Pitting ranges from light to moderate (see pics). Looks great from a couple of feet away, but not a beauty queen. Function is flawless.

All in all, it came out nice and is a very good hunting piece for wet weather or second rifle for a friend to use.

Email me for a pic of magazine tube, which is the worst of the pitting. Replace it and the barrel bands and it would be very good cosmetically."

Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.

With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.

None of the old 20 rounds down the pipe crap with me. It is a gun, which is a tool. I use my tools as often as finances allow. Meticulously cleaned and maintained as only us old guys tend to do lol.

 Fitted to the Task-And The Shooter

 The two overriding questions that must be asked when purchasing a pistol are: How is it going to be used? and By whom? 

 The P250 makes those questions much less critical by being adaptable to a variety of tasks and a variety of shooters. It has the ability to be configured in everything from full sized range pistol to a deep concealment weapon, in any of four calibers. And, the selection of grip modules, coupled with a standard or short trigger, means it can be fitted to a wide range of hand sizes.

If you don't know what the ARAK-21 is, its basically the best features of the AK and AR combined into one rifle. You are basically shooting an AK with AR controls. Very versatile system because you can easily and quickly swap out different barrel lengths and also Calibers!! You can purchase 7.62 and 300 blackout barrels and recoil springs thru Faxon if that interests you. The upper features a long stroke piston system similar to AK's. There are adjustable gas settings for shooting different powered loads and suppressed--settings are Hi, med, low, and gas shut off. The 4 hand guard 1913 rails can be individually removed if you prefer. The top rail is one piece monolithic. The forward charging handle can be switched to either side of the upper for left or right handed shooters and also folds down and out of the way completely and is non-reciprocating. The upper is right hand ejection only. The lower is a San Tan Tactical STT-15 full ambi lower cerakoted in FDE. It has ambidextrous mag release, bolt release, Safety (V7 weapon system 57 Degree levers), and rear QD swivel connection points. It has a magpul CTR stock with extended buttpad and .50"" cheek riser for perfect view of the Primary Arms PAC 4x scope (ACSS bullet drop reticle) that is mounted by the quick detach American Defense ACOG mount. The trigger is the Geissele G2S trigger. Grip is the Magpul K2. The rifle has only about 60 rounds thru it. I Have shot Tula, xm193, and xm855 thru it and it eats it all no problem just like an AK. There are some minor scratches on one side of the upper from when I drove home and it was in the bed of my truck. No scratches on the lower though. There is absolutely zero slop between the upper and lower. Recoil system is built into the uppper like an AK so it can be shot without a stock or if you added a folding stock mechanism. This is a serious rifle. Here are the specs and everything included. ARAK-21 upper - comes with one 16"" barrel in .223/5.56 1/7twist. Barrel has Faxon brake that is removable. - Angled foregrip (not magpul) - Primary Arms PAC 4x Scope on American Defense QD ACOG mount (I have the box for it too if that matters to you) STT-15 Lower - Full Ambi lower cerakoted in FDE - Magpul CTR stock (milspec) with extended buttpad and .50"" cheek riser (FDE) - V7 Weapon Systems 57 Degree ambi safety - Geissele G2S trigger - Magpul K2 Grip I have the Box the upper came in with manual and also the box for scope and lower."

This rifle utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock. The underfolding stock locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, the stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness.

 It uses dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

 It uses dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

The finished is blue and in great condition - several magazines included.  Also included is the original box from August Armory as well as the certificate from the Armory.  I also have a box of vintage .45 military ammo (but have been advised not to fire it).  The barrel is clean with no pitting - nice and shinny.  Finish, hammer and slide are all correct for the year (Colt horse is in the middle of the slide, slide stop is square not rounded and hammer is Colt).  

Pistol has been appraised at $1,500 without the paperwork.  That will send price up - and it gets more valuable every year.

A great piece of United States history - well cared for.  It has been in my family for the past 30 years.

The finished is blue and in great condition - several magazines included.  Also included is the original box from August Armory as well as the certificate from the Armory.  I also have a box of vintage .45 military ammo (but have been advised not to fire it).  The barrel is clean with no pitting - nice and shinny.  Finish, hammer and slide are all correct for the year (Colt horse is in the middle of the slide, slide stop is square not rounded and hammer is Colt).  

Pistol has been appraised at $1,500 without the paperwork.  That will send price up - and it gets more valuable every year.

A great piece of United States history - well cared for.  It has been in my family for the past 30 years.

I also have a box of vintage .45 military ammo (but have been advised not to fire it). The barrel is clean with no pitting - nice and shinny. Finish, hammer and slide are all correct for the year (Colt horse is in the middle of the slide, slide stop is square not rounded and hammer is Colt). 

Pistol has been appraised at $1,500 without the paperwork. That will send price up - and it gets more valuable every year.

The SIG Granite Series was awarded the 2004 Handgun of the Year Award by the Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence.[1] It is entirely made in the USA, from American parts.
Description

Chambered for the .45 ACP round, some GSR models have an accessory rail that can be used to mount a variety of different tactical lights, lasers, or just about anything that can accommodate a Picatinny rail. Standard models have a 5"" barrel and 4.5-pound single-action trigger. The GSR is reported to have produced range results of a 1.5"" group at 25 meters and has various sight options available.

The SIG GSR is a first-class effort, featuring Novak sights and magazines (two per gun), extended beavertail, Commander-style hammer, match-grade barrel (obviously) and a long external extractor. It’s hand-lapped for frame-to-slide fit and is extremely smooth and tight. It’s got a (by now almost obligatory) rail for lights and lasers, which, I feel, increases utility at the expense of aesthetics. Speaking of looks, I sort of prefer the wood grips on the matte stainless version"

I am taking offers and can consider trades. As stated above, I am looking to start a 338 build, and would like to use a Savage 111 LRH as a base.

This model was made in 1973 and is one of the highly sought after Pinned and Recessed models (Pinned Barrel and Recessed Cylinder). It is also the Target “T” model with the wider target trigger and hammer which are also both color case hardened (hard to tell from the pic). I purchased this revolver in 1998 from a guy who took the original grips off and put Hogue rubber grips on wanting to have a more tactical model… Wow… Anyway… the guy dumped the original box too and just had no idea what he had. Luckily he did not shoot the gun much and took care of it the way it deserved. It was in pristine “NEW IN BOX” condition. Seriously, not one single scratch and the finish is just the way it was when it left the factory. Since the original grips were numbered and replacing them would make little difference to the value I put a set of Hogue cocobolo wood mono-grips on as I think they look awesome and have a great feel.

This revolver is still in perfect condition. Not one single scratch and the finish is so glossy it looks like it’s wet. I have put maybe a box and a half of rounds through it in the last 17 years and all rounds have been the 158 grain loads. I know some say it does not matter and the forcing cone can handle the faster 125 grain loads but I did not take the chance.

This revolver has sat in my safe for many years without even being touched. I am selling it now as I really want to fund another project. I am not in a great hurry to sell it so silly lowball offers are not necessary. I will keep it before I give it away. If you are interested in this gun I am willing to meet and let you take a good look at it. The pictures do not do it justice. It is a beautiful handgun. I also have a custom case for it with the Smith & Wesson logo embroidered on it that I will throw in.

I will only sell this gun to someone who has a valid CCW permit and NC License. If you do not have that then I will be fine with an FFL transfer at a gun store. Most only charge $20 for this and those are the only two options I am willing to do. I will not compromise on that so please don’t ask. If you are interested, I travel for a living across most of NC so if you want to meet and take a look at it please let me know and I’m sure we can work something out. Thanks for looking."
