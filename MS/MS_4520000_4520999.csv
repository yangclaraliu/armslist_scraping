This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel.  This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ TechnologyIt allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round.Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols.Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot.""We are a company that works to get you the best prices on handguns, rifles, shotguns.

Bought it on a whim and now I kinda wish I had gotten something a bit smaller. As mentioned this is almost new and has only had 150 rounds through it. Comes with its case and all the stuff it came with, including two 18 round mags. Excellent trigger as most of the excellent reviews on this gun mention, I'd say better than a VP9 and comparable to the PPQ I had.
Would like to trade for a Glock 42, M&P Shield in 9mm, XDs 9mm essential, or a Ruger SR9c or SR40c. Would also look at S&W J frames in 38 special. Would consider other 9mm or 40 handguns, but no rifles, shotguns, Taurus or Kel Tec please, I'd be willing to add some cash depending on what you have.

	I have available for trade/sale a used but great little Carry pistol. This is a Kel-tec P3AT chambered in 380 ACP. This is a great shooting little gun that would be perfect for a girl or smaller frame person. The size is so small that it is hard to believe it shoots a centerfire round that large. This gun shows a lot of carry wear on the edges of the bluing, but shot perfect when i shot it and mainly just needs a deep cleaning. I bought this for my girl to shoot, but she doesn’t like it as much as the LCP. This will come with the pinky rest magazine plate and the flush plate. I also have ammo I could include for the right trade/price.
	Trade wise, I am somewhat open as long as it is for firearm items. No 22s, blackpowders, or shotguns unless it is heavily in my favor though. To make an offer or for any questions, shoot me a text at REDACTED. Need to meet in Norman."

From what I've read, it requires the extra charge due to the long barrel and gas system. When it shoots, it's extremely accurate with the right scope but it can get expensive with the ammo. Or maybe it's something that can be fixed but not by me. I am keeping the BCG and charging handle. The barrel alone is worth the price. Price is firm. REDACTED. Call or text."

The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® redefines what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition.  

The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M)®, which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XD(M)® features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place.

797,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4520797,For Sale:  NIB-.32 ACP +P Ammo - Buffalo Bore 32 ACP 75 gr. Hardcast F.N. (1150fps/ M.E. 220 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box,"Pacific, St. Louis, Missouri",$ 21,"Listed On: Sunday, October 25, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The 32 ACP auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society as a defensive cartridge, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 32 ACP suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and examined nearly all available 32 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.Here's the problem. The current 32 ACP frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks sufficient penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face, with modern, frangible 32 ACP ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek. I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the pain, as that frangible bullet would have stopped somewhere in my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible bullet and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and won't know that part of his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So, whatever 32 ACP ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 32 ACP is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down instantly. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your loved ones, is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed this 32 ACP+P load to keep you and yours alive under the worst of scenarios.This 32 ACP+P ammo will better all American made 32 ACP+P ammo by 110 fps to 150 fps with a heavier bullet than any other American made 32 ACP ammo.Item 30A/20 is a 75gr. HARD cast bullet with a flat nose. It is traveling over 1,000 fps out of my 3.4 inch Beretta Mod. 70. We've used a flash suppressed powder so that you won't be blinded by your own gunfire in the dark. This is significant as well over 90% of all civilian shootings in America occur in low light when the criminal element is out and about. Also, this flat nosed, nonexpanding, hard cast, bullet will penetrate deeply and will do much more damage than the typical round nosed FMJ bullet. Round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through living tissue, doing little damage as opposed to a flat nosed bullet. The flat nose not only wounds much more than a round nosed bullet, but it actually keeps the penetration straight and thus deeper. Notice the below velocities from my personal 32 ACP pistols. These are real world guns and thus the speeds are realistic and not the exaggerated speeds you'll see produced from laboratory test barrels. What you see with Buffalo Bore Ammo advertising, is truly what you get in the ""real world"" where it matters. You can expect 20+ inches of straight line penetration in flesh and bone with this load. If you are worried about over-penetration with this load, DON'T! You chose to carry a tiny under-powered 32 ACP pistol and the trade off is that now you are going to have to stay alive using this pistol and over-penetration will be the least of your worries if you end up needing this gun to save yourself or your family.A. Berretta Mod. 70, 3 inch bbl.- 1001 fpsB. Kel Tek, 2.5 inch bbl - 910 fpsC. Seecamp, 2 inch bbl. - 856 fpsThe above bullet speeds are 110 fps to 150 fps faster than the Winchester 71 gr. FMJ ammo on the American market. Not only is our bullet heavier than any other American made 32 ACP ammo, but it is moving about 15% to 20% faster - with that heavier bullet!

It's really a beautiful piece. These were discontinued by Smith and Wesson a little while back so they are very rare. I am wlling to drive a little to meet up with you. Make an offer, reasonable of course. Worst I can say is no!

725$ obo or trade for 1911 with ambi safety. Can add cash on my end if yours if of higher value.

This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user. And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm.

From Salient Arms:
The Tier 1 package is our top-of-the-line offering. Virtually no expense is spared in crafting this very special gun. Every aspect of the Glock pistol is refined to the degree it can hardly be called a Glock. The reliability and duration that we hallmarks of the Glock design are retained while any shortcomings are addressed as fully as the design allows. It’s light, it’s accurate, you will be impressed. The L+R side relief cuts are reduced in length to make way for windows cut into the slide. The “lined” up relief cut on top of the slide in front of the ejection port is eliminated in lieu of a window cut through the slide (these cuts dramatically reduce slide weight resulting in an easier to carry pistol with shorter shot-to-shot times as well as faster target-to-target transitions.)  The standard Tier 1 slide features angled front slide serrations, angled side-of-slide parallelogram window cuts to match and a rectangular top-of-slide window (this slide is referred to as the “A” or “Alpha” slide profile) Grip -Grip is identical to Tier 2 & Tier 3 Trigger-Our Tier 1 trigger package is standard on the tier models and includes every conceivable* tweak possible on the Glock trigger design and provides a very crisp and very light trigger pull. The trigger package is fitted with our non-adjustable aluminum trigger, and includes the connector, full spring kit, lightened striker and other proprietary modifications not available anywhere else.  For the Tier 1 we employ a high-end, rich black s-bond DLC coating, the leader in the application of DLC/PVD coating to firearm in the industry. 

Slide:
-Window cuts
-Vertical front cocking serrations added. 
-Small 45° bevel on bottom edges of slide to limit sharpness

Not Sporterized in any way! I went over all 6 pages of Arisakas listed on the biggest gun website as well as ARMSLIST and I can honestly tell you that there is NO other NON-Last ditch (cruder finish, fixed rear site, no chromed bore and more..) Type 99 with a Mum that is close to this price. There are a couple that seem close, but take a closer look and you will see missing rear site parts, cleaning rod and a buttplate on one ($75 to replace), altered stocks on several and though this one is no beautiful deep blue, it is not corroded like others here. Some are missing the top piece of wood too. Narrow down those that are complete, then that are all numbers matching and then have a MUM. You are down to a few listings on ALL of the gun websites, and this is a LOT less $$. Be careful for sporterized guns with cut stocks as they lose almost all collector value. Make sure you are not looking at a Last Ditch model as well, as they are a different gun than this one.  I am beginning this listing before the replacement (original parts) screws arrive from Numrich. A few of the screws had buggered slots and I am replacing any that are not nice.(the photo of the front end shows this, as those and the rear band screw are coming) Tested to be the strongest action after WW2 and continues to be the basis for custom guns of any caliber, this is the rifle that was the basis of the Japanese army in their quest for 1/2 the world. This one may not be the finest bluing as the color has faded a lot at the barrel end (the receiver is nice) but it is super clean steel with no corrosion. Some have that rough and mottled surface but this one is fine except for the faded front end. The receiver is much better with 50-60% original dark finish in front to 80% towards the rear. This is NOT from hard use either, as the inside parts show very little use. The bottom metal pieces are a more even mottled gray which seems to be the average on these. (I considered replacing the bottom magazine cover and trigger guard as it is only $30 to get a nicer finished one and these are not numbered parts)This rifle is the only one of the 9 I have had that has matching numbers on the bolt as well as any parts that have numbers. The firing pin matches, the bayonet lug in front matches, the safety matches...it is a full numbers matching gun. About the firing pin and bolt, they appear close to new. There is little to no wear on the sear surface from firing and the original deep black color that is on the pin and alot of the bolt rubs off quickly to shiny metal from use. (I have had 9 of these) The firing pin is nicer than a brand new replacement one I had ordered for another and this one has the matching serial number. The bore is clean as all were chrome lined, and the bullet test passes. (I will provide a photo of a .311 bullet stuck in the bore)The MUM has not been defaced or even lined out or rubbed. These are a lot harder to find, and I can not find any import marks either. All Type 99s turned in to US forces should have MUMs removed so this may be a vet bring back. Looking at all Type 99s for sale on all sites, a little less than 5% have the MUM which was the symbol of the emperor's property. One of the best features is the rear site, as it is the Anti-Aircraft design and all original parts are there (another hard to find quality) including both arms. They made these to allow for lead when firing at low flying planes. I have seen some people use these on shotguns for skeet! The wood is in good shape for Type 99s, as I have very rarely seen one with super wood, and those went for over $800 on Gunbroker. The ones that sold for over $800 were just like this one, but they had beautiful dark metal and wood. This will not be even close to half of that price. Oh, the original cleaning rod is present and the locking button works too. That saves you $35 to have one shipped from Ebay. The rifle is not complete without the rod as it changes the profile. The ONLY original option that is not present is the folding monopod, and I have only seen 3 or 4 that had that (the $800 ones). They make a perfect modern one for $30 if you want to make this complete and it is also not a numbered part. The rear band has the mounting part already. I also have an original bayonet that has a blade that was never sharpened and when I got it, it was layered in yellow dried grease which I was told was the original preservative. The blade has been in and out of the metal scabbard which is also very nice condition. I have no idea if the bayonet was polished or rubbed as some are blued but some are also silver like this. The bayonet is NOT included with the rifle but will be available for a discounted price if purchased with the rifle. The number on the bayonet is not matching. The bayonet will be $75 additional and if you look up these bayonets, the only ones around that price range are pretty beat up, if there are ones at that price.  I listed photos of the wood and scabbard as this is a very fine condition bayonet with the hooked quillon. The metal on the bottom of the rifle is all patina and a darker gray as the blue has changed over the decades as is the buttplate. The buttplate and bottom pieces are not satin smooth either but no corrosion. Just long term storage and these were not made for long term anything. These were a wartime product but even so, they took great care in making them super reliable and super strong. Only at the end of the war when defeat was around the corner, did they make the ""LAst Ditch"" versions with greatly simplified design and much cruder and rougher finishing.  75 years have passed since this was made in wartime. I am listing this Type 99 at $325 and I will also be looking up the armory and date of production which I will have when the screws arrive. I am only posting basic photos until I have the parts and it is all put together. Shipping is $35 to your FFL and C+R is fine. The bayonet, if bought with the rifle ships with it, saving another $12 or so. Your FFL must accept items from individuals and I will send all necessary ID. If you are local to the state of Florida, we can make other arrangements which MAY save a little for you. Paypal is fine but it MUST be discrete (no guns mentioned) and unless sent in a way that avoids fees, it will have an additional $10 which is only a PART of their fees. You are getting a great collector and shooter here. All numbers and the MUM and rear sites are awesome to find on the same gun, and if you look at what is offered for $100 more than this, this is a great deal. With the bayonet it is $400 for a complete package. MESSAGE ME for another 8 photos and I will have the new screws and complete rifle photos within the week"

Complete Saiga 12 Performance Tactical conversion professionally done by FFL 07 manufacturer,USC 922(r) compliant(as of date of listing) with compliance letter. Sorry for the quality of my photos I have a Gunsmith shop and build firearms not photography. 

Features include: Magpul SRT stock. This is the AR model on an AR15 aluminum buffer tube(stock can be used on AR's). DPH Vertical Extended Bolt Handle, Tapco G2 modified Trigger group, New billet aluminum Triggerguard with AR pistol grip. AR grip stock gives this Saiga 12 the quick AR feel. Factory mainspring replaced with JTE Performance mainspring, hammer interface polished. Bolt/bolt carrier and hammer custom radiused and polished. Fully Cerakoted in 2 dual colors; Graphite Black and Sniper Grey.   Remember the most important thing with any Saiga 12 is quality workmanship and reliability in the action and gas system which my Saiga's are known for; you can always change furniture or add accessories but the heart is on the inside. Compare; some lower price version just have the screw-on Tapco Saiga stock/pistol grip combo without the trigger group/guard work and or the factory fore-grip without rails, cheap mag, cut-down factory trigger-guard, etc. But the action is not correctly radiused and polished if at all. With over 400 sold with nothing but compliments when you buy one of my Saiga's you are getting the best performance that you can get out of a Saiga. 

 Includes: 1- 10rd SGM magazine, 3- Factory 5rd magazine, Raptor Claw Barrel Shroud plus original factory items (cleaning kit, oil bottle).
