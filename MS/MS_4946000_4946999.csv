Price is less than current market.  You can pick up at my house or have the gun shipped to you by a licensed dealer.  You would pay all ACTUAL UPS, FedEx and dealer handling fees.  I think the local dealer here in Santa Fe charges about a $25 handling fee.

I have not fired a single bullet through the gun after purchase. The item has been inspected over and should shoot without issue. For its age the rifling looks great. If you are an avid hunter this would make a well tool. If you are a collector on the other hand this is not a recommended item, unless you are not looking for a pristine piece. This gun does have its cosmetics issues that are clear to see. The left side of the stock has two horizontal holes that may have been utilized for a cheek pad during use. There are also six Holes of equal spacing in a set of two rows (three holes per row) on the top portion of the (for lack of a better word) dust cover. These may have been used for a rail attachment, but I am uncertain of such. The serial number (20137) dates the rifle to being manufactured near the end of 1909. The rifle has also been stamped with EA3, this means the rifle was sent to Remington for repair October, 1932. The ammo for this rifle has been discontinued in 1964. The ammo is scarce to come by, but there are places online that re-manufacture the ammo for a reasonable price; it is even comparable to the price of the still manufactured .35 Remington. I am selling with the rifle one box of twenty (20) rounds of unfired pre-1964 .32 Remington ammo in original packaging. I am primarily looking for cash, but might consider a trade. I do have more images available upon request. Due to law constraints I will not accept handguns. This is not as to myself being in disorderly conduct or a manner there-of, but rather not meeting the age requirement to purchase such.
