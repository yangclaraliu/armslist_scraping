It is a semi- auto 12 gauge shotgun. It is in good condition, around 100 shells through it. The gun has been cerakoted with just simple black. If you are unfamiliar with cerakoted, it is just a protective coating that is professionally sprayed in the gun. Again, this was done in a simple black to keep the original look. Had a fiber optic front sight. Awesome gun to shoot, just need money for vacation coming up.

The subcompact model of the renowned P30 handgun, P30SK (SubKompact) series has all of the sought-after characteristics of the larger frame P30 and P30L pistols but in a more concealable design.The completely adjustable P30 grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm.Manufacturer: Heckler & KochModel #: P30SK (V3)Type: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: Blue Hostile EnviromentStock: Interchangable Backstraps and Lateral PlatesSights: FT: 1-Dot RR: 2-DotBarrel Length: 3.27Overall Length: 6.42Weight: 23.99 ozCaliber: 9MMCapacity: 10+1Action: Double Action# of Mags: 2Receiver: Black Polymer Frame with Picatinny RailFeatures: De-Cocking Button, DA/SA V3, Luminous 3-Dot SightsAmbidextrous Slide Levers and Magazine ReleaseMSRP: $719 on sale for $585"

I have only seen a couple of these over the years but none have come close to the fit and finish on this one. Whoever the gunsmith was that built this one sure went the extra mile. The finish on the stainless looks wet anyway you turn it and the double and single action trigger pull are as smooth or smoother than any gun the PC turns out today. Comes with all front sight blades it left S&W with plus certificate and case locking key still in factory envelope all housed in a beautiful Mahogany Case that's in mint condition as well.

Russian bakelite magazine not included (pictured with the gun). Already sold. Shot less than 100 rounds through the gun according to the previous owner.

Plus, it has a KAK Industry muzzle brake installed (supposed to reduce the recoil).

Final reduction price. No low ball please. Low ball offers will be ignored or will not get a reply. I have way over $500 invested on the gun. No shipping. Local, face to face deals only.

Was purchased from Fin Fur Feather new by me. The original trigger and springs will be included. It has been cleaned each time it was shot, just indoor paper target shooting.

Upgrades are as follows: tapco slotted muzzle brake, tapco pin retaining plate, UTG aluminum quad rail, Magpul AFG2, Magpul moe+ grip and a Bushnell TRS-25 red dot. Also included are two Yugo metal bolt hold open mags, cleaning rod, stock slant brake and hand guard. Round count is between 1k-1,200 so it's just now breaking in. Yes the rifle is painted and can easily be removed. Really looking to sell since I already have something in mind, but being a gun nut I may be open to trades."

PLEASE make sure your reply has a phone number in it or it gets deleted. Phone calls work best discussing deals for me ( not email / text tag )


This is the some of best self defense ammo / hottest round available to Law Enforcement - yes I can legally sell this private sale to non LEO.

 Very hard to find LE ammo. If you can even find this in stock some dealers may require Law Enforcement credentials to sell this to you ( I do not require that as a private party ).

 I am looking to sell at $40ea box ( 50 rnds per box ). 

 Buy 1-2-3 or more boxes. I have 2 cases ( 40 boxes for sale - 50 rounds per box ). Buy 10 or more boxes and I will give you a FREE box. Price is $40ea - private sale so no sales tax. Good luck finding a local gun store that would sell to you at this price. Cabelas has the same ammo in 20 round boxes they are selling for near my price and I am selling 50 round boxes !!

 If you are interested ... please make sure your reply has a phone number in it or it gets deleted. I may ask for a CCW conceal carry permit or a WAC badge or a WA DL. if you cannot legally buy or own this ammo ... DO NOT contact me.

Offering a beautiful 4 inch Smith & Wesson Model 29-2 nickel revolver in its original factory walnut presentation case. This revolver bears serial # N425281. This revolver features the color cased target trigger, target hammer, red ramp with white outline rear adjustable sight. The revolver has beautiful walnut grips, though there is a very small non distracting chip in one edge as seen in the 3rd pic.   There is only the faintest of cylinder rings on the revolvers cylinder, the bore is bright and flawless as are the chambers. The cylinder face is clean and looks as if it wasn’t ever shot but I cannot positively declare this to be true. The breech face of the frame is also spotless so maybe unfired? This revolver was manufactured prior to Smith going cheap on its production processes. The cylinder is recessed and the barrel is pinned. They simply and truly don’t make them like this anymore and likely never will. The interior of the presentation case has lost the felt in the cutout or impressed area. This a relatively easy fix. The top of the box retains its foam and liner but the liner has faded somewhat."

I also have 5 10 round SGM tactical magazines, the factory 5 round, and two 25 round drums, however these will not be included unless a reasonable offer is reached. Hardly any rounds through her, probably 50 max. Pictures coming soon. 

I've decided I may want to keep this, sense every time I pick it up I realize how BadA** of a weapon it is. I am bumping it one final time to see what offers/trades I get, and if I don't get anything good this time around I'll pull the ad down.

Comes with the factory case and all the back straps. Approximately 300 rounds put through it with zero problems. The only imperfection against it is a mark near the back of the slide that came from one of my holsters.

Comes with three 15 rounds mags, one of which is brand new in the plastic. It also comes with two Alien Gear holsters. One has a leather backing and the other is a neoprene composite material. Both are fitted perfectly for the VP9 with Kydex shells. 

The holsters have about 3 weeks of use where they were consistently alternated to break them both in evenly. If you do not want the holsters, then that will drop the price down a bit. These are very nice holsters and can't really beat the value. 

No trades.
