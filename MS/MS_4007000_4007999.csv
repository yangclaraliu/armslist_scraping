I have all the parts - just bring your DPMS or Spikes tactical 308 lower and you've got a complete rifle.

I bought all the parts for the upper separately and had it put together at Virginia Arms in Manassas.  

Upper includes - 18"" DPMS 308 SASS fluted barrel, Troy claymore muzzle break, Troy 13.8"" battle rail free floating handguard, mid-length gas tube, low profile gas block, DPMS upper,  DPMS BCG, BCM gunfighter charging handle.  I'm asking $1350 cash (or $1500 value in trade) for the upper. 

I also have one Magpul 308 Pmag Gen 3 window

 I haven't ever fired the rifle, only assembled it.  There are two scratches on the connection on the upper where the pins connect to the lower.  When assembled they do not show.  Everything fits so tight that they slightly scratched.  I've shown them in the pictures.

This is a bargain compared with Midway asking $1540 (just for the upper) because with me you get a mag, and bcg.  I'm selling everything at a substantial discount.

Compare with:

Doesn't affect the sights but it's there and in the interest of full disclosure, I'm mentioning it. Bore is bright and shiny with strong rifling and no rust or mechanical issues anywhere. Current sights are approximately 8 years old and are starting to fade some, hence the new ones being included. Sale will include a Fobus-brand paddle holster as well as a Gould & Goodrich leather shoulder holster with magazine carrier as well as a Dosko Sport pistol case. I don't have the original box or owners manual to include. Gun has been well taken care of and shot very little. Slide is stamped ""Made in West Germany"" and serial number prefix is B 14* ***. 

Would like to sell outright but I would consider trading for a Gen 3 Glock 19 with at least two magazines + cash; I'd prefer night sights but not a deal breaker if not. Would need to see LTCH and proof of Indiana residency (DL); not recording any info, just want to keep things legal. I can also arrange to complete a transfer through my dealer if that's preferred.

 I owned it over 4 years and have a pile of receipts for parts in it, previous owner bought it with bad motor and tranny and swapped in working ones with supposedly 50k less then the body. I have the slip to at least prove he bought it that way

 Since iv owned it replaced battery, intake gaskets, temp sensor, both front upper and lower ball joints, all 4 brakes and rotors, brand new cooper at3's fuel filter, plugs, wires, axle seals, rear dif fluid, alternator, both exhaust manifolds, transmission, serpentine belt, tensioner pretty sure I am missing some stuff but that gives you an idea of new parts

 Full disclosure It has some issues: hot heat and cold ac but it only works on high?, driver window doesn't roll down, thermostat housing has some seepage, power steering worked fine until a few weeks ago and now its difficult to turn, driver power seat doesn't work, muffler rusted off of it last month so it just has a elbow to turn the exhaust down, somewhere it drips a drop of tranny fluid every so often, the rear glass popper broke on me but hatch still opens, the overhead display stop working last year sometime, body isn't perfect has rust, driver unlock doesn't work, passenger lock doesn't work

 It runs and drives solid just needs a little love and its a great truck, 4WD works awesome in the snow

Looking to sell my Taurus 85 .38 Special snub nosed revolver. I am the first and original owner. This is the ULTRA LIGHT model, and it is chambered for the +P calibers as well.

This gun is great. NEVER misfires (of course, it's a revolver) and it's pretty light. The trigger pull is nice. I've never had a problem with it, and kept it clean. 

Included:
- All original paper work and box.
- Both Taurus Security keys.
- N82 tactical tuckable IWB holster  
- Paddle holster
- Belt holster 
All items are pictured. The holsters alone ran me $30-60 a piece each, so that's already like $120 in holsters. 
I've shot probably about 100 rounds down range and kept it clean. 

Asking $350 for EVERYTHING or best offer. You must have a CHP or Pistol Permit filled out already. Preferable a CHP.

I've got over $800 into this gun. Rock Island is to the 1911, as Glock is to polymer pistols...they're not expensive, but damn they are crazy reliable and shoot excellent.

$500 firm...firm...
Did I mention firm?

Its a MKIV Series 80 model and its in decent shape.  When I first got it, it had some problems with the recoil spring guide and slide stop - neither were fit to the gun properly - and so I had Nelson Ford (The Gunsmith) take a look.  He fixed it up for me and this pistol hasn't had an issue since.

Great gun, steel frame, solid as all get out.  Its got a couple of beauty marks on it, but its overall in good shape. The barrel is 4.25"" long and the frame is a standard full size (8 rounds).  Good balance to it, and it'd make a great base for a race gun.

The grips are aftermarket VZs made from G10.

“New”, unopened in sealed plastic clamshell packaging

I bought several of these as Christmas presents in 2003, and this is one that wasn’t given away.

Back in my day, “tactical” flashlights used a high-power xenon bulb.  They are bright, but went through batteries quickly.  And this was back when the 123A batteries were not common, and a lot more expensive.  

The Streamlight Twin-Task gave the user the option of using a xenon light when a bright light was needed, or switching into LED mode when power conservation was important.  It was a good idea, and I carried one for years, but the 100+ lumen LED flashlights of today have made it kind of obsolete, at least as a primary light.    

But they’re still as good today as they were back then, and are perfect as spares to keep around (say, in the glove compartment), which is what I do with mine.  This model has been discontinued by the manufacturer, but they’re still available on Amazon for nearly $50 (for the titanium version, see below).

This is made from aluminium, and feels very solid in the hand.  Try hitting somebody on the head with one of today's plastic flash lights, and you'll appreciate the difference.  Now get off of my lawn.

note:  the batteries that are included are nearing the end of, if not past, their expected shelf life.  I have no idea if they work or not, because the package is sealed.

It had nothing to do with cops, or killing anybody, just a reason to ban the import of it. There are many stories about it, communist plots to disrupt America, black helicopters, etc. The fact is, China had a lot of steel, not so much lead. They made steel cores, lightly coated in lead, then copper jacketed. They shoot straight, hit hard, are non-corrosive, and are much higher quality than the Russian stuff on the market now. I've got a couple of wood crates of this ammo, one of 1100 rounds in SKS stripper clips, one of 1300 rounds in 20rd boxes, and some loose stuff. Will sell cheaper in large quantity. 30 cents/round, will trade for 9mm, 45ACP, 22LR."

This Rifle is as new as I've had it... It has a Great, Tight action. Long extractor. Buckhorn rear sights. Banded front sight with brass bead. Even the Remington marked checkered buttplate has all the blue with only the minimal wear from human-hands over the last Century ! It's Never been drilled and tapped and has all Vivid markings. There is One small blemish in the curved portion of the stocks finish on top of wrist. It has the Factory Sling Swivel Studs. This is in Extroadinary condition for the Most commonly used caliber in a 30 Express with the deluxe checkering. Other than someone having one out there that's new in the Box this is as good as it gets.My price is firm, so if you don't quite understand why, then please read my diatribe below………. I see it as 99.9% ,…. But just to play it safe I'll call it 99 1/2% $1,650 

As I cleaned the MINT Bore I thought to myself; The last time I had a Remington 30 Express, Deluxe 30-06 caliber that was All Original and in this Minty of condition was 30 or 40 years ago. I recalled seeing them ""This Good"", on occasion back when there was no Gunlist Magazine. And Only the Shotgun News magazine was available. That was in the early 1970's. Later on in the Early 1980's I only saw a few more ( = They were Ususally on a Gun-Dealers Display-Table, along with a lot of other Great Remingtons in Hopes of winning the Best Display at the GunShow. ). 
I'm not sure when I actually owned one of these Remington 30 Express Deluxe Checkered Rifles in this condition that was all original and had this amount of Blue still on the Bolt and didn't have a Peep-sight or something else; Or even that wasn't Tapped on the Receiver for that matter; But I will have to say that it was somewhere back in perhaps the late 1980's Era. I suppose My Point is that it would take a Long Long time to find another that was this GREAT ! And in All Original condition."

The barrel has also been cut down toto eliminate barrel vibration and also reduce weight on the pivot point for the free floated barrel.the end of the barrel was really crowned and also threaded 5/8"" x24 with a AAC 300 blackout flash suppressor work a T10 ratchet mount for a simple twist and lock for a silencer. Has a Timney adjustable trigger. A timney trigger shoe to fit the pad of your fingertip perfectly for a clean easy pull. This trigger is absolutely amazing. Has a free-floating Archangel stock that was custom fitted to the barrel itself by my gunsmith. The original bolt handle has been cut off with a bent bolt rewelded andpolished. The bolt handle is threaded which I then attached a steel tactical bolt knob with a spiral pattern. Also has a rock solid industries stainless steel firing pin spring for a faster trigger reset. It also has a very nice sling. This is a legitimate 1000 yard rifle. Just needs a nice scope and your ready to go.

The bluing is starting to turn a nice patina has a small amount of bluing wear at the tip of the muzzle.. The Bolt is bright and clean and the sights are original. The bore and rifling look great and the stock is rock solid with not gouges or cracks. The butt pad is original and undamaged. It has the correct walnut stock for this short barreled gun.

I did not do a complete take down cleaning the last 2 x I shot it .
Yes I did do a complete take down cleaning prior to that (did not remove gas port from barrel) .   
Locking lugs look real good & have most of the blueing still on them. 
I’ve had this gun about  2 years & really have not shot it a lot . 
I’ve had no problems with this gun . 
It has a 4 round mag.
I’ve had several 740s & 742s over the years. I love them & think they are one of the greatest dear guns around ( 30-06 cal.) 

barrel date code is KNF  I think that means produced month of May 1966 

has delux wood and fore arm is ADL model  

Currently the only weak part of the gun is the scope its week power & old glass only reason its on the gun is the scope has collector value in itself 
I have a barska scope you can swap out for $25.00 more. Personally I wouldn’t do the swap , I’d sell the weaver scope + buy better glass.    

I live out in the country & you can try before you buy 
Only shells I have are reloads so if you want to try factory loads bring them with you 

The gun is a great deal. 
The only way you will be wasting your time is driving out here and thinking I’ll go down in price 

The price is firm on this gun

The gun had some gunsmith enhancements during it's brief life of usage including some feed enhancement.  When last fired, it gobbled up every type of ammunition the previous owner fed it.

This well-loved piece is looking for a new home.  Local face-to-face buyers only - must be willing to meet me in or around central Kane County, Illinois.  Valid Illinois FOID card and waiting period apply.  Gun is sold as-is, has not been fired in decades but has been examined by several appraisers and is in working order."
