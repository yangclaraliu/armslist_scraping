The 725 was only produced four years, from 1958 to 1961 with only 7,700 chambered in .06.  They were discontinued at the end of '61 and replaced by the now legendary model 700. The 725 was the predecessor to the 700 and share many of the same features, including their rock solid ""3 Rings of Steel"" action. Basically the only difference in the two is the unique three position safety featured on the 725. It is equipped with a hinged floorplate, checkered walnut stock and decorative pistol grip cap. The original adjustable sights are still intact. Barrel code dates it as a January 1960 production. 

This beauty was obviously well taken care of. Looks as if the stock was refinished, but the original blueing is still deep and in excellent condition. The bore is bright and shiny, and this one is a real fine shooter. I put 20 rounds through it and was very impressed with its accuracy. This one would be perfect for the collector or the guy that wants to stand out in deer camp. Not too many of these rifles out there.

Mounted to the rifle is a top quality 2 year old 6X42 Leupold FXIII. The scope has a gloss finish and hand adjustable adjustments. Vintage Weaver off-set rings lock it place. Scope alone runs close to $500 new and like all FXIII/VXIII scopes, it has amazing glass and carries a full lifetime warranty. May separate from rifle for the right money. 

I know what these rifles bring and I'm not hard up for money, so I'm in no big hurry to sell. Open to trades for other quality firearms, especially centerfire rifles."

I have added range results from today's (9/30/2015) test firing of this rifle in my photo album.  Muzzle Wear is 3.5 and throat is a 2 as per my gauges. Bore is bright and shiny with no rust or pitting. There is the remnants of a very faint boxed NPM/FJM stamp and smaller ordie wheel on the right side of the stock. Sadly there is a gash right through the middle of it, but in the right light at the right angle, you can still see it. There is a TN marking in the sling well. It's an excellent shooter, but I recently acquired a nicer example of an NPM and decided to let this one go. 

I will let the pics do the talking. Copy and paste this link into your browser:  http://imgur.com/a/q2sK6

As you can see, lots of NPM parts, but I am no expert so I am not sure if they are correct to this serial number range.

1301 Comp: Ready to Go for 3-Gun Matches, Practical Shooting
The Beretta 1301 Comp semiauto shotgun is designed to win tactical competitions right out of the box.
1301-Comp-intro
Combining the technology of Beretta’s best sporting shotguns with the requirements of the most demanding tactical shooters, it cycles faster than the competition, handles like a dream and has oversized controls for super-easy operation. It is available in two barrel lengths (21” and 24”) and its receiver is drilled and tapped for rail mounts, so that it can be equipped with optics or tactical aiming devices without any gunsmithing. And thanks to its Optimabore HP interchangeable choke system, it can also be adapted for other uses and will always perform like a Beretta.
Lightning-Fast-ShootingLightning-Fast Shooting, Easy Operation
The 1301 Comp features Beretta’s proprietary Blink gas-operating system, which enables it to shoot 4 shots in less than 1 second--that is, 36% faster than any other brand. But even with this tremendous advantage, Beretta’s engineers did not stop there. The controls are supersized so that the 1301 can be operated quickly and easily when seconds count: the cocking handle, bolt-release lever as well as the loading and ejection ports are oversized for simple and intuitive use under the heat of competition.
Ultra-Durable Steelium BarrelSteelium-Barrel
The barrel of the 1301 Comp is made of Steelium, Beretta’s own steel blend designed to give premium performance even after tens of thousands of rounds. It features a stepped, wide sporting rib that minimizes mirage, and it has both a mid-bead and front fiberoptic sight for instinctive pointing under most lighting conditions. And thanks to the Optimabore HP choke system, the 1301 offers unmatched ballistic performance, with constant patterns regardless of load used.
Best-in-Class-Tactical-StockBest-in-Class Tactical Stock
Having worked with military and police forces all around the world, Beretta offers you decades of experience building firearms that meet the strictest demands of professional shooters. The 1301 embodies this experience, with its short stock with aggressive non-slip checkering for positive handling under the stress of competition. Also, the length of pull is user-adjustable so that this shotgun will give you the best fit and the most natural pointing regardless of your shooting style, thickness of clothing or body size."

These are steel casings, brass polished, steel tip, 147 grains (I think). It's getting hard to find these online anymore, when they are used up they will never be found again.

It features a rock solid mounting device with a large tension knob that only requires 2 positive rotations to ensure that the optic is mounted securely. There is plenty of info about this optic online that can go into greater detail than I could here. It is a great value but you won't find a brand new one in the box for the price I'm asking. I would also consider trades for eotech XPS2-0 or similar plus cash.Thanks"

Glock 19 Gen 3
Glock 21 SF Gen 3
Springfield XD Full size 9mm
Beretta PX4 Storm Compact in 9mm

All four guns have exactly one box of ammo through them.  All shot on one range visit.  All guns perform flawlessly.  I took the Beretta to a gunsmith after a fail to feed on the first clip.  He polished the ramp and feed muzzle and I took it back to the range the same day.  No problems.

Here's the deal.  You pick two guns and have an electric guitar for even trade.  The following is what I'm looking for:

American or Japanese guitar preferred.  Two humbucking pickups with fixed bridge (no tremolo).  Guitar must be of same trade value as guns (roughly $1100).  The guitar must be in near new condition, as are the guns.

I will consider all guitars of equal value to the guns.  If it's something I'm not interested in I will politely decline, but it never hurts to try.

The trade of the guns must take place at an FFL and I will split the cost of the transfer if the guitar is something I'm looking for.  

All four guns come with factory boxes and the clips that came with them.  The Springfield XD does not have the holsters and XD equipment you can get with some of them.  I don't use Kydex equipment.  Also, the Springfield will come with 2 disassembled 17 round parts kits for clips.

All CO laws apply.

Thanks for looking."

I am interested in all sorts of firearms, but not looking for any hunting rifles or shotguns at this time.

I have a Colt New Frontier in 22LR with the very handy 4 5/8"" barrel. Frame is case-hardened steel with a blued barrel and cylinder. 

This is NOT an aluminum or zinc frame.

It is not a collector's piece but more of a very well-kept shooter.  I think of it like this:  It's not pretty enough to be a safe queen, there is some blueing wear at the muzzle.  But, the rest of the blueing and case hardening is gorgeous so it is almost too pretty to shoot.   So I am making room for something I don't feel bad about shooting.

Serial number marks it born in 1974 according to Colt web site.

I can send more pictures if you would like.  The one picture I have here is for my inventory and does not do the blue and case hardening justice.  I have added a picture of the muzzle blue wear.

You must be able to legally own a handgun in TX and can meet in the Austin-ish area.

If you can still see this ad, it is available.  I respond to all emails I get, even if it is a polite ""no thank you"".

Please do not email me and ask for me to call/text or ask what I want for it.  If you think you have something you would like to trade for it, send a picture of what you would like to trade and if you think one of us needs to add money etc."

I originally bought it from a builder in Clarksville, TN. Never Enough Guns, NEG. It was built with matching parts. Everything besides the lower receiver has been GUNKOTED. It has the triangle folding stock unlike the folding full stock. It has the side mount rail too. It has a 12.5 inch barrel, but it has been pinned with an extended US muzzle device to meet the 16"" legal requirement. It can be removed if you want to go through SBR paperwork and process. 5.45 x 39 / 5.45x39mm ak74 ak 75 ak105   I have put less than 200 rounds through the rifle. None of it was corrosive. It is clean and well maintained, safe queen. It has multiple US parts including the tapco double hook trigger. I textured the original black composite furniture before I replaced it. I added meprolite night sights also. It has a CAA magazine release and internal buffer. I have a Ultimak optic mount/ gas tube for the rifle, but I replaced it with a Troy mount. I also added a Troy squid rail. I added the rubber inserts and short rail also. The new US Palm grip has been textured as well. I will include all of the original parts too. I am not including the Inforce light or Primary Arms red dot, but they can be purchased. I will include one 30 round mag, but I do have more for sale. I also have quite a bit of Wolf and 7N6 ammo that can be bought as well. I used the 7N6 with my old m10. This is an amazing rifle. One of the few true 105 kits with matching parts. I have an AR upper and some pistols for sale also.       Thanks"

Once fired, the barbs, or electrodes, are launched up to 15 feet towards your subject.  The barbs can penetrate up to 1"" thick of clothing.  Once penetrated, either clothing or skin, the wires deliver the electric current to the subject.  While the voltage and amperage of a TASER Gun are lower than those of direct contact stun guns, the current is much more effective.  This is because TASER uses their patented Neuro-Muscular Incapacitation technology in their electrical current.  What this means is that the current the TASER Gun generates mimics that of the human body.  So, once the electrical current is delivered into the human body, the body's brain and central nervous system cannot discern what's going on and ""freaks out"".  The brain and nervous system doesn't know what to do.  Further, the M26C can also be used as a direct contact stun gun in a close encounter situation.  Simply pop out the cartridge and its ready for use as a stun gun."

I purchased this EOTech new from Optics Planet on March 4, 2015 for a CQBR Block II clone build. Model 553 is officially discontinued, but as verified with EOTech, 553s are covered under warranty for two years from the purchase date. That means this particular unit is covered until March 4, 2017. Note that this sight has a very recent manufacture date of December 2014 and the box has an inspection sticker marked 12/4/14. 

This EOTech 553 is in excellent, like-new condition. Glass is perfect. A.R.M.S. levers clamp down tight and have no wobble. Unit is clean and free of dings and scratches throughout the housing. There is only faint wear on the underside where the picatinny rail sections made contact with the unit when mounted. This is normal. Two trips to the range and less than 200 rounds fired on it. Spent most of the last 6 months mounted on an SBR stored in a gun case, indoors, and in a smoke free home. Babied. Not in any hurry to sell. The price is $520 shipped and insured or FTF local pickup. Out-of-state payment needs to be PayPal ""send money to friends or family"" (gift) option. No trade offers or offers for less money. These sights retailed for $699 new.

Features:

The milled gas block is located at a carbine length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low glare surface.
The handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.
The front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A-2 Style F-Height allows co-witness with many optics. The Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability and is a solid, reliable aiming system when coupled with the elevation adjustable front sight. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics but can be instantly redeployed if needed.
The six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.
The 16.1 inch medium contour barrel is cold hammer-forged providing ultra-precise rifling for exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8 twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided and the ½""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.
The ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow for gloved shooting.
The chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.

Paired with our smooth micro-Mauser action and single set trigger, a standard Carbine stock can be added as the shooter grows.

Its built to CIP specifications, CZ's .223s will happily eat 5.56, since CIP doesn’t differentiate between the two cartridges and just has the higher pressure as its standard. So this rifle will shoot everything from the cheapest Russian steel to match .223 brass ammo.

 Description
The EXPS2 offers true 2-eyes-open shooting and provides an unparalleled targeting experience.  The all-purpose EXPS2 features easy-to-adjust side buttons and a quick-detach lever. It has a transversely-mounted lithium 123 battery. The increased height of the EXPS provides iron sight co-witness access in the lower third of the viewing window.

Whether you're using the sight for law enforcement or hunting, the EXPS series sights are the premier optics in the line.

I carried this gun daily but have switched to a different gun and really don't use the Ruger much anymore. It has some blemishes from carrying it all the time. I always called this Ruger ""Tank"" as it is built like one. What it comes with: the factory box it came in, Blackhawk leather IWB holster, 2 speed loaders and 4 speed strips, Hogue monogrip and the factory grip, Wolff spring kit. I currently have the 9 lb hammer spring and 8 lb trigger return spring installed and it makes a sweet trigger and never had any issues of light strikes. Also comes with all the ammo pictured. The closed boxes of ammo are full and the open boxes are partials to show what is left in the boxes. The partial American Eagle box has some Remington 38 special +p Golden Sabers in it. I bought the Barnes Vor-tx not knowing they were hunting rounds. So I never used them. I thought maybe someday I'd shoot them for fun but never did. You could use the Barnes for personal defense but they will more than likely over penetrate someone as I seen a video demonstrate the ammo into ballistic gel with a snubbie and it was impressive. The Speer gold dot short barrel ammo is what I liked to carry. I'm asking $500 for everything. A great CCW.
