It is with great regret I am having to part ways with my favorite rifle- my Israel Weapons Industry Tavor. This is literally the perfect rifle and I am incredibly sad to be selling it. The rifle has been my baby and it has been treated as such. Unfortunately, I went and had an actual baby which I have learned I am not allowed to sell without being visited by unwanted guests. 

All Joking aside (Please don't send me weird messages) my Tavor is in near perfect condition having only had about 200 rounds through it. I never even got a chance to stretch out her legs. I added and am including a Manticore Arms top rail to it which alone is $105, a cheap Amazon muzzle device, a UTG pressure activated light (works extremely well- never will understand why people drop hundreds on Streamlights), 8 brand new magazines, a Magpul foregrip and all of the items that came with the rifle from the factory minus the box (cleaning kit, IWI magazine, original top rail, original A2 muzzle device, sight tool, owner's manual etc.). I am also throwing in a near new Aimpoint Pro ($400 retail) for an additional $200. 

I won't get into the general specifics of Tavor rifles as anyone serious about buying knows the pedigree this top of the line rifle- there's a reason it is the main battle rifle of the IDF. I am the original owner of the rifle and it is 100% clean. I'm not trying to BS anyone or be BS'd and I would appreciate having serious inquiries only. I am not interested in payments or trades so please have the required cash available. I'd be more than happy to provide more info or pics to anyone seriously interested in purchasing my baby- as in my Tavor (again, no actual babies are for sale- I really really wish I didn't have to specify that but: internet.). 

If you are serious and would like to see, or even fire, the rifle we can meet at a Calibers so we are in a safe and neutral place and you have the option of putting rounds through the Tavor before you spend your hard earned money. I have absolutely nothing to hide and am only interested in an honest transaction. 

Thank you for taking the time to read and I hope to hear from all serious  potential buyers."

The gun functions flawlessly; if I remember correctly, the serial dated the gun to around 1903. The receiver and BOTH barrels are all matching. One barrel is modified choke and the other is full choke. 

The pump foregrips are original, but unfortunately the stock has been replaced by a previous owner. It also has a pachmayr buttpad installed, which makes it much more enjoyable to shoot. 

If you're not familiar, this is one of the few shotguns that can ""slam-fire"" by holding down the trigger. This makes it extremely fast at competitions and has been used in both WWI and WWII to great effect. 

Asking $400, and that's it!

It does have Nazi proofing marks that coincides with that time period and the 4th variation of this pistol. Research also indicates there were approx. 10,000 pieces produced of this variation and a total of 50,000 of this particular model. Again, this is what I found in my research. There are no import markings or other indicators that I could draw from. It's in very good condition given the age. There are no major areas of rust or pitting and it still has the original grips in good shape. Also included is 1 magazine and a holster that looks original and period correct but I can't confirm that. Price is $500 firm"

Have a look at the photos for exact condition, I took nice HD ones for this sale so there would be no suprises.  Unfortunatly I don't have the box, but you will get a hardcase with the gun.  I've never shot the pistol, I don't suspect the gun has ever been fired either since there are no cylinder burn marks.  

Price is 700$ (plus shipping if you're not local, I don't mind shipping if you cover the cost), I think this is fair given the superb condition of the pistol.  You will not find a nicer Mod. 10, so if you're a S&W collector... this is the one.  You must have a CHP or a PPP with a valid NC DL for purchase, shipments must go to an FFL."

This enclosed hammer double action revolver is ideal for tucking in a waistband, under a shirt or in a jacket pocket because the enclosed hammer will never snag on clothing at absolutely the wrong time.

If you are looking at this you know what it is and that there aren't many out there. I recently picked this up and have been ""feeling it out"". Haven't fired it yet, but don't particularly care for the weight/balance.  I think the weight/balance will help when shooting but I don't need the ""help"" so to speak and would prefer to shave a little weight instead.  It is lightly used and does not come with a box.  I do have a nice soft pistol case for it and one Wilson Combat or Chip McCormick 8-round magazine for it.  The only wear I see is on the guide rod shroud and safety plunger tube and a touch on the rail where a light was installed by the prior owner.  

Please email me with questions.  Also, please, if you are sending an offer lower than asking price, send information that backs up your offer.  That will save both of us some time.  Have a great day.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers 9mm.

Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

This top of the line take-down rifle comes with 3 different barrels, (1-270 Winchester, 2-300 Winchester magnum and 3-416 Remington magnum). With this setup you are covered for anything from long range light skinned game all the way to heavy African hunting. The first 2 barrel each have their own 3-12 x 50 D Swarovski scopes with Ballistic turret attachment. The 416 barrel has iron sights and a muzzle break. There are 2 complete bolts, one for the 270 and one for the magnums. The 416 barrel also has it's own forearm for the heaver barrel contour. The stock has a “kick-stop” recoil reducer. The Blaser R93 Luxus is a top of the line straight pull bolt action hunting rifle from Germany. The locking system of the R93 bolts in a straight line without rotational movement in the barrel. When repeating, the body movement is minimized. The process is faster than with conventional actions, allowing more time to aim and re-aim for subsequent shots. This is a particular advantage on drive and big game hunts. The safety system is also very advanced in that the firing pin is not cocked when on safe. Immediately prior to firing a shot, the firing pin spring is cocked by pushing the safety slide forward. This movement is virtually silent and will not alert game to your presence. If no shot is fired, simply return the safety slide to its original position for maximum safety. An FFL is required for shipment."

I've purchased a 6 inch model 27 for hunting, so this fine revolver needs a new home.  I am not flexible on pricing at this time.

This 627-5 has been professionally fit with a 4 inch PERFORMANCE CENTER barrel.  As far as my extensive searching has shown, this is a one of a kind.  As you may already know, PC's are fitted with 5 inch barrels and Pro Series with 4"".  PERFORMANCE CENTER and .357 - 8 TIMES are stamped on either side of the barrel.  The main frame S&W stamp includes the Performance Center designation.

It is in great, but not perfect condition, so don't be afraid to buy this as a range gun or to carry into the woods.  This revolver needs to be held and dry shot with my snap caps to be appreciated.  I've never felt a better double OR single action trigger.

I have fired only a few rounds through it and the parts are in good working order including a functional blade-type bayonet.

There are a few spots close to the gas tube with minor pitting that have been cleared up and the bolt assembly has been polished. Everything has been thoroughly cleaned and lubricated with Frog Lube (amazing product, I highly recommend it) and the stock has been re-stained. 

The gas tube hand guard is the original wood and stain and looks shabby compared to the rest of the gun (although functional), and I have a nice black metal ventilated hand guard I've been wanting to replace it with, but haven't had time to lately. The new hand guard would come with the gun.

Nothing is wrong with the rifle that makes me want to sell it, however lately I've been wanting to invest my time and money in other areas so I am parting with this gun. 

I don't have pictures yet but I will upload some as soon as possible (or send some to whoever is interested). Surplus SKSs on AimSurplus run for around $350 at the lowest, not including FFL dealer fee and tax. I am selling mine for $375 with items included. Price is negotiable and I may be convinced to trade depending on the offer. Several things are included: four (4) 20rd boxes of TulAmmo 7.62x39, black metal ventilated hand guard, blade bayonet, original gun cleaning kit which fits conveniently into the rifle stock, and is pre-cleaned-and-lubricated with Frog Lube.

912,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4494912,For Sale:  antique Iver Johnson 5 shot revolver in .32 SW (with ammo),"North Nashua, Nashua, New Hampshire",$ 120,"Listed On: Friday, July 24, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"antique Iver Johnson  5 shot revolver in .32 SW short

This seems to be the same model that was used by Leon Czolgosz to shoot President William McKinley with in 1901. The gun is in nicer shape then the pictures show.  It also still shoots very well. This comes with a bag of 50 .32 S&W Short bullets appropriate for this gun.

The Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works (yes, makers of handguns and fine bicycles), was started back in 1871 by a 30-year old Norwegian born inventor of the same name. Truth be told, it started as the Johnson and Bye Company, but eventually Johnson bought out Bye and went at it alone. The Fitchburg, Massachusetts based factory concentrated more on its bicycles than its firearms and employed many Scandinavian immigrants.
Just before Iver died in 1895, his company began to produce a new revolver that the late engineer had perfected late in life known as the Safety Automatic.

Design of the Safety Automatic

The Iver Johnson Safety Automatic neither has a manual safety, nor is it automatic. It’s a revolver. Its a double-action top break revolver similar in layout to the Smith and Wesson hinge frames of the 1860s era. What made the Iver different from the Smiths was in the fact that it had an internal transfer bar safety. This safety consisted of a bar that rested between the hammer and the rear of the cartridge in the cylinder/chamber. The bar prevented the gun from discharging if dropped and only fell away when the trigger was depressed all the way.

The VG6 EPSILON 556 is the pinnacle of AR15 muzzle devices. The EPSILON 556 just outperforms everything on the market. Designed for the discriminating shooter and professional end-users, VG6 Precision's EPSILON 556 affords you the best muzzle control and recoil mitigation the industry has to offer. This is a true combination muzzle brake / compensator / flash hider. Its performance is matched only by the amazing look of this device.
The VG6 Epsilon556 carries many of the same characteristics as the Gamma556 with a few exceptions. Extended flash hiding prongs and no ports at the 12 o’clock positions allow uninhibited view from flash through optics or sights. The difference in porting is also noticed on the underside of the device where it has 6 valve holes to allow the fastest gasses reaching the second chamber to exit. This creates very soft low energy recoil that allows for absolute control. The VG6 Epsilon556 carries all these specs and is priced well below our competitors."
