It has some light scratches/holster wear but is in great shape mechanically. Timing is good and locks up tight. This is the last model without the internal ""lawyer lock"".

The Model 66 is generally considered to have a better trigger/action and better looks, while the Ruger's thicker frame is supposed to stand up better to a constant diet of heavy magnum loads. I reload and plan to shoot full-power loads exclusively, so the Ruger's looks don't matter to me as much as frame strength. I've shot both guns and the S&W looks and feels much more refined.

I'm mainly only interested in trading for a stainless steel 4"" Security Six. For equivalent condition, I'm asking for an additional $50 cash, but I will consider a straight trade if yours has less wear. It would take $100+ cash for me to consider a blued model in good condition. Not interested in any trades besides a 4"" Security Six."

The brand new bullpup-rifle from IWI that's taking the world of modern semi-auto rifles by storm. After more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

This comes with 6x factory magazines (4x 30, 2x 42), pelican case, and bushnell red dot (see pictures).

The rifle is nearly brand new - I bought it new in July 2014. It's one of the newer production models with a VLTOR receiver. It has made one trip to the range between then and now, and I fired 60 rounds of brass cased milsurp ammo. It functioned flawlessly. I've added an adhesive kydex stock protector behind the ejection port on the stock and I've added a Neu-trigger upgrade, which has made the trigger very smooth. The protector and neu-trigger can be removed easily if you aren't interested in them.

The case is a tan Pelican 1700. The foam in the case has been cut for the rifle with a Vortex viper PST 1-4 optic on a QD mount (sold), but most optics will fit in, or the foam could be further modified. The rifle is very snug in the case, even without an optic. The foam is also cut for a Glock 17, but could be modified to fit any other pistol.

Rifle has been cerakoted Atomic Burnt Bronze by Atomic Tactical. Gold inlay was done using Forsters gold fill kit, not a crappy paint job. Rifle has a Midwest Industries rail, synthetic Tapco grip and butstock, vertical fore grip and UTG LT-TL 101 flashlight. Rail has low profile rail covers. Rifle was made 922r compliant with Tapco double hook  trigger/hammer group (3 compliant parts) (original Chinese components included-pictured in plastic bag). I also installed a retaining plate in lieu of the hook (drop in piece). Synthetic thumb hole stock is included. Will come with two mags. I am not the original owner. I have owned the rifle for almost two years and have only fired it twice: once to test it and once after it was cerakoted. No issues at all and less than 100 rounds fired by me. Smooth as butter! Cleaned after both trips to the range and was been oiled on a regular basis. What else can I say? It's a sweet piece, but I've got some trips coming up that need funding and I just don't shoot this beauty that often. 

I will only sell/trade to a 21+ year old person with a CURRENT MN PTC or PTP and MN ID. Buyer/trader must be willing to present these at the time of sale and complete a Bill of Sale. NO EXCEPTIONS! I am not willing to ship and prefer transactions around the St. Peter area.

Any questions, just send me a message. I do work for a living so I usually cannot respond between 8:00am-5:30pm, but rest assured I will get back to you ASAP. Those looking to get this for a WASR price need not waste their time but reasonable offers will be considered. 

I can send more detailed pics of the cerakote and gold inlay. Just let me know.

The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years1.

KEY FEATURES:26"" or 28"" vent-rib bead-sighted barrelStandard Express finish on barrel and receiverShoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells....................
This shot gun is like new only used twice...It also comes with a Plano hard case and soft case that fits on most three wheelers four wheelers and bikes"

4 boxes of hunting ammo included (2 boxes Federal Premium 140gr Nosler Accubond, and 2 boxes of Hornady Superperformance 139gr SST).

I bought all of this new at Sports World in Tulsa about 10 years ago for an antelope hunt that didn't happen.  The new scope was installed by their gunsmith and bore-sighted.  The rifle has been in my dehumidified safe ever since.  Includes the original box and all paper work.  The rifle is new and perfect in every respect.

If you know your calibers then you know how great a round the .280 Rem. is.  Think of it as a .270 Win. on steroids.  Very flat shooting and packs plenty of punch for any big game in North America.  Ammo IS NOT hard to find you can get it at Bass Pro, Sports World, Dong's, etc.

BSA/Shirley. Genuine No. 5 - as attested by the lightening cuts out of the receiver (you can see them in the photos). This is not a No. 4 Mk 1 that has been made to look like a jungle carbine. 1946 manufacture. Good bore. Shoots very accurately. I have babied it since having it, mostly putting light subsonic (Trail Boss) handloads through it. And I've only shot it on 2 occasions. No rust, no pitting. Stock and rifle have not been refinished and bluing is really good. Has vernier peep sights which are very nice to use. These rifles are scarce and you will be lucky to see them available from retailers. Import Mark (I.O. Inc) is very nicely hidden under the barrel and small. These rifles are supposed to have a wandering zero issue with them, but I have been unable to verify that - if anything the rifle is scary consistent with tight groups.
Bolt and receiver match, magazine is non matching, but close serial number.
I can meet in West Cary or RTP during the day.

Here You Go!!

Contact Jeremy @ 3one7-908-one758


The ARX-160 is an extra-durable piece of gear that will satisfy even the most demanding tactical shooter.


Ambidextrous Controls

A serious training rifle should always mirror the “real thing” in the way its controls work. This is why the ARX-160 features ambidextrous two-position safety, magazine release and cocking handle. With this rifle, you can easily train and shoot with either hand dominant and improve your skills without breaking the bank.

Limitless Customization Options

This training rifle is a great base for building the tactical system of your dreams. It comes out of the box with four Picatinny rails: on top, a full rail enables you to easily attach your favorite sighting or optics system, while on either side and on the bottom of the fore-end additional rails let you add other accessories such as tactical lighting. Other customization options include the telescopic folding stock: you can adjust the length of pull at the touch of a button, while the stock can be folded partially or all the way to accommodate most firing situations.

Durable, Easy to Shoot and Maintain

The ARX-160 is built to be durable and super-tough, being constructed of superior steel and techno-polymer. Its flip-up sights are just like those on the full-caliber rifle—super-light but rugged, and featuring a rear diopter for quick and accurate target acquisition. Maintenance is easy thanks to the simple way in which it comes apart and is reassembled without any tools. Whether you use it on its own as a rimfire tactical rifle, or as a training tool to improve your handling of the full-power counterpart, the ARX-160 will always turn heads at the range and will never let you down."

There were no differences in clarity this side of 1,000 yards.

Marked ""LOT 10 / 1960""

The ammo is corrosive but shootable, I have shot a lot of this ammo in the past with no issues. Discoloration of cases / corrosion visible on some rounds as seen in photos. Very good and hard to find ammo for that enfield bolt gun!. 4 bandoliers, 3 are complete and one is missing 3 clips so 185 rounds total.

Bandoliers are in good condition with usual signs of military use, 3 of the small metal tabs that hold the compartments shut are missing and some small pin holes and wear to stitching is present. Still very usable at the range or for a display. Some of the rounds have ""stained"" the bandoliers from years of storage (see photos).

I bought this gun new at the beginning of summer and had the scope professionally mounted and bore-sighted by a gunsmith.  It has a threaded barrel (in case you ever want to throw on a suppressor) and a Hogue overmolded stock.  I bought it to take into less than ideal treestands while deer hunting so I did't scratch the expensive walnut stock on my primary rifle.  
I took it to the range and shot ONE box of ammo out of it.  Its a blast to shoot.  Low recoil and almost no muzzle blast.  Its the perfect short treestand gun because of the Hogue stock.  It doesn't get scratched and is grippy, so even with gloves its easy to carry up and down ladders.  

THE ONLY REASON I'M SELLING IS I NEED MONEY FOR SCHOOL. 
THIS GUN IS PERFECT AND LOOKS LIKE IT JUST CAME OUT OF THE BOX.  
I want to keep it but I decided to go back for another degree so a few toys have to go.

I have about 80 rounds of 125gr custom loaded softpoints for hunting that I will sell for $50 extra.  I paid $1 per round for them from a custom shop.

From their website:
Product Description
remington Chambered for the incredibly popular 300 AAC Blackout, this rifle features the time-proven Model 700 action and is designed to impress from the bench or in the field at a very affordable price. At the core of the Model 700 SPS Tactical 300 Blackout is the machined solid-steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design, ensuring uniformity, strength, and solid bedding area. Unique to this precision rifle is the 16.5"" inch, heavy-contour clean barrel threaded to accept AAC and all 5/8 x 24 threaded flash hiders, muzzle brakes, and suppressors. The tactical-style carbon steel, hammer-forged barrel is the perfect balance between handling in tight spots and delivering pinpoint accuracy. With a twist rate of one in seven inches, this rifle is optimized for accuracy. These specialty, bolt-action rifles are shipped with a thread protector installed. The rock-solid barreled action is bedded in a Hogue OverMolded, Ghillie Green, pillar-bedded, synthetic stock with a semi-beavertail fore-end for added stability. The soft-touch, sure-grip stock is extremely comfortable for extended, long range shooting and assures a positive grip in both stressful situations and inclement weather. The dual point pillar-bedding guarantees a solid interface between the action and stock to help insure cold bore accuracy and prevent point-of-impact shifts. Add Remington's X-Mark Pro externally-adjustable trigger, designed to break-like-glass and set at 3.5 pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical accuracy."

EXCELLENT shooter this one is. I picked this up in a trade not long ago and was well worth the time. This one was manufactured in 2011 as the 100th anniversary of the 1911 for Colt. Everything on this is original except for a Wilson Combat beaver tail unswept safety added. The XSE comes standard with many upgrades from Colt, including Lowered and flared ejection port, front cocking serrations, Ambi safety, and a 1 piece Full Length Guide rod.

Would give this a 9.5 out of 10 on exterior finish with 1 or two light marks on it more noticeable in person.

Comes with original box, docs, and 1 magazine.

Mostly interested in unique trades or something at par in value. I am not super picky however. Prefer handguns, revolvers, ( + or - cash) or very nice AR's. Other Colt 1911 are welcome as well if you would simply like a change

Please no rifles or shotguns at the moment."
