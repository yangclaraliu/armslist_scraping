•Item: 1911-22-B
•Caliber: .22 Long Rifle
•Action: Single action, blowback operated
•Trigger pull: 4.2-5.6 lbs. (advertised); 6-1/8 lbs. (measured)
•Length: 8.5""
•Width: 4""
•Height: 5.5""
•Barrel length: 5""
•Sight radius: 5.4""
•Weight w/magazine: 34 oz.

•Sights: Fixed, three dot, contrast sights (interchangeable front sights)
•Grips: Wood, stippled double diamond pattern
•Frame/slide finish: PTFE

Made in Germany, the blow-back operated SIG 1911-22 is an all metal pistol, except for its wood grips. The barrel, barrel bushing, hammer, slide stop and most internal parts are steel, while the slide, frame, thumb safety, grip safety, trigger and magazine are made of an unspecified, non-ferrous metal (probably aluminum alloy). The metal finish is a dull, matte black.

The SIG 1911-22 is obviously a well made pistol. Careful manufacture and assembly is evident and results in close tolerances. For example, there is almost no play in the gun's slide to frame fit.

The SIG 1911-22 operates exactly like a centerfire 1911 pistol and features the same control layout. Actually, the SIG 1911-22 represents a modern, ""enhanced"" 1911-A1 with an ambidextrous, extended thumb safety; radical beavertail grip safety; loop style burr hammer; long reach, skeletonized trigger adjustable for over-travel; grooved backstrap and low profile, three-dot, combat sights. It is very much in the style of SIG's ""21st Century"" .45 ACP 1911 pistols. Internally, SIG has added a magazine safety, drop safety and firing pin safety to the 1911-22. These are in addition to the usual 1911 hammer ""quarter cock"" safety, grip safety and thumb safety!

The high visibility front and rear sights are dovetail mounted in the round top slide. The rear sight, secured by a set screw, is drift adjustable for windage adjustment. A carrying case, Owner's Manual, gun lock, small tool set (including an open-end wrench, chamber brush and a couple of small Allen wrenches), are provided with the pistol. SIG is to be commended for including such a complete kit with their 1911-22 pistols. The only accessories most owners will ever need to buy is a spare magazine and, perhaps, a holster. The 1911-22 should fit in any holster intended for a full size 1911 pistol.

I purchased this as part of a 2 gun set with my Sig 1911 .45 Ultra, and I don't need another .22lr gun ( I already have the Sig P938-22)."

As with all used trucks there are some old truck things. 

There is a old auto start / alarm system. the remote died. You can probably get a new remote. The lights flash after you start it up. 

The wire under the front seat is loose for the seat adjustment. if you wiggle the wire it works fine. I never fixed it because I was the only person driving it and it was set to my size. windshield has a low crack insurance replaces it for free. been that way for years never been pulled over. very low on the windshield. 

The truck was my work / winter truck. The calipers on the brakes should be buffed they get a little sticky after not being used every day. 

The starter was going bad then at home depot it just didnt have enough umph to start

Just washed off the truck. To be 100% honest no 1997 looks that shiny 24/7

Truth is, I have not lost interest, I lost my job, just looking to pay some bills this month. I have another bone stock AR I can use parts for, so that's why I am offering ways to reduce costs on your end. This makes a nice stable longer range shooter, the adjustable cheek riser adds a nice balance on the rear. Shot's very nice.

I can reduce the price by removing or changing out the following parts.

1.) 500 BUCKS off the price if you don't want the scope, covers and mount.

2.) 50 BUCKS if you don't want the sling. 

3.) 125 BUCKS if you don't want the iron sights. 70 BUCKS If you don't want the iron sights but DO want brand new magpul polymer sights.

4.) 200 BUCKS if you don't want the trigger, I can put in a new stock one.

5.) 30 BUCKS if you don't want the angled fore grip.

6.) 100 BUCKS if you would prefer a quad rail (And not the one on the rifle) of the same length that I have, a Yankee hill machine YHM-9634 in excellent shape http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/2-YHM-9634

7.) 25 BUCKS for the Magpul B.A.D. Lever if you don't want it.

8.) 150 BUCKS if you don't want the bolt carrier group and want to use your own.

9.) 25 BUCKS if you don't want the Magpul QD plate on the buffer tube, please note I do not have a stock replacement.

10.) 25 BUCKS if you don't want the front rail Magpul QD sling mount.

Pick and choose. If you want the whole thing? You see the price (2000.00) If you don't want some OR all of the parts I listed in this paragraph, that's fine too."

Those guns generally sell for around $1450.

This MP5 is no longer being imported.

Currently the only way to get this configuration is to purchase an MKE/Zenith pistol (the rifles only use proprietary 10 round mags) and add a 16"" barrel and a collapsible stock.  The pistol generally runs for about $1650, heavy profile chrome lined barrels tend to cost around $250 (and up), and the stock ranges from $200-$600 depending on model and configuration.  
Putting it together is, on the low end, around $2100.  One could save money using a fixed stock though.

Included is one factory mag, 5 unused korean contract mags, pistol buttcap and clamshell case.

Is an ex-police gun but appears to have been fired very little. Very high res pictures are available here: www.machzracing.com/4046

Comes with three 11 round mags and a S&W hard case. Has a smooth hammer, night sights though they're very dim, a single-double action trigger, no external safety, and has a mag safety so that it will not fire without a mag.

On the trigger, I call them single-double action as that is how they work but traditionally they're known as double action only. Pulling the trigger pulls back the hammer and fires just like a double action, difference is once fired you cannot pull the trigger again until the slide is cycled. For those used to single action or Glock type triggers (even though a Glock is single-double action) know that trigger pull on these guns is long and heavy, 10+ pounds. If you've ever fired a revolver in double action, that is how these feel. Many like that from a safety aspect since it has no external safety.

It is located in Howard though I frequently come to Wichita so can meet there. Will have a bill of sale. Only trade I'd be interested in would be for a Glock 43. Feel free to email with questions."

This is a DWM (Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken) manufactured pistol. She was made in 1923 and has no import marks. As far as I can tell she is all matching and she is in very good condition. She includes an original style magazine (not sure if it's original but it does have the wooden mag grip).CALIBER: 7.65x21 (.30 Luger). When the first Luger pistols were manufactured for Switzerland in 1900 they were in the .30 Luger cartridge (7.65 Parabellum). This is one of the first cartridges to use a bottleneck design which reduces the chances of jamming. The Soviets copied the design and made their own 7.62x25 bottleneck pistol cartridge, and the .357 Sig cartridge also copies the bottleneck design!9mm trivia I bet ya didn't know:PER WIKI: ""In 1902 Luger presented the new round to the British Small Arms Committee as well as three prototype versions to the U.S. Army for testing at Springfield Arsenal in mid-1903. The Imperial German Navy adopted the cartridge in 1904 and in 1908 the German Army adopted it as well.[10] The ogive of the bullet was slightly redesigned in the 1910s in order to improve feeding.""I bet you didn't know that the 9mm cartridge is over 100 years old and predates the .45ACP?This pistol was made in 1923 for the American market. It is stamped ""GERMANY"" on one side ~ don't mistake that for an import stamp because that's not the case.I digress - back the DWM Luger. I bought this pistol for myself and I've shot her few times. She's in awesome condition.  CHRISTMAS IS COMING and I can assure you that this would be an awesome gift!$999...(oh yeah - they don't make this anymore)"

It is dead on accurate!
I'm selling it mainly because I just haven't used it as much as I thought I would and I could use the money for school and fixing up my truck.
I've shot just over 2 boxes of ammo through it (100ish rounds). It's is pristine condition 10/10 and as you can see in the pic, still even has the sticker on it. It has fiber optic iron sights which if you've looked at other .17HMR's most don't which is a really nice bonus so you can still shoot it without a scope if needs be. One of my favorite features is the trigger which is modeled after the Accu-trigger and gives it one of the best trigger pulls I've ever experienced IMHO. It holds 9 rounds in ruger's standard rotary mag and has a integrated butt stock system where they can be removed and you can buy various styles, lengths and heights to replace it making it extremely customizable for anyone. I also shot a video of it last time I took it out so you can see that it performs flawlessly and you can hear the ring of the target hit on every shot if you are interested.
The $300 is for the gun only, the bipod, sling and scope can be included if desired for their respective values. Text at REDACTED if interested or if you have any questions. Thanks!

I did like how the single stack Shield was easy to conceal...even with dress apparel (I have to wear shirt and tie at work)..the Glock does print more...but after much practice I just learned to love the once hated ""Block"".

The M&P Shield is like new condition and comes with everything you see new in the box, extra capacity clip, holster, safety lock and soft holster.  Have original receipt and all paper work.  You won't be disappointed.  Why buy new and pay a higher price and taxes when I'm wrong to let mine go for $75 less than you'll find it in a store. 

NOTE: This is not the M&P compact 9mm, this is the SHIELD SUBCOMPACT.  Very small, can fit in the palm of your hand. 

I will need a copy of your carry-conceal license OR purchase permit as well as driver license to verify identity.  Just don't want any sale coming back to me as illegal.

German WWII P38 for $875 (CYQcode)!This pistol came in on a trade a couple of months ago and we have marked her down for quick sale.This is the infamous Walther designed P38 that replaced the German P08 Luger just prior to WWII. The Walther P38 was cheaper to build, had fewer parts, and was much less complex than the Luger. This pistol was manufactured by Metallwarenfabrik Spreewerk GmbH in Czechoslovakia. Slave labor was used at this plant to produce firearms. By late 1944/early 1945 this was fairly common in Germany.This one was made in early 1945. I believe the Spreewerk plant was overrun by the Allies in April of 1945.NO IMPORT MARKS.ALL MATCHING.INCLUDES 2 MAGS.(9MM).If you need this (yes - you know who you are) then stop by the shop and take a look at her. I should put this one in my collection but I have have another P38 already. Christmas is coming and don't miss this opportunity for a collectible WWII firearm."
