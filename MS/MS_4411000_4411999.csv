This gun is an excellent hunting rifle for big game, and with its flat shooting 3700 fps muzzle velocity, makes a nice bench gun as well. I have been reloading my own ammunition for this round. I have been using 100 gr. Barnes XBT and Weatherby brand brass. If you are looking at this post, Weatherby brass and ammunition is not inexpensive. So I am including in the sale 200 pieces of twice fired brass and the rest of my 100 grain bullets (I believe I have around 100 but I will have the check). I also have 14 rounds of the loaded ammo that I have been shooting.

Great optical quality and that 50mm objective lense makes it really bright. This is included in the sale price, however, if you don't want it I will take $100 off of the price.

Temp range is from Tropical (+90 degrees F),  to Artic Cold  -50 degrees F) (50 degrees below zero)
This is an amazing breakthrough in universal Sleeping bags. The Gortex outer bivey cover is a self contained shelter in itself and will keep you dry in any weather conditions yet allows moisture to escape so you are comfortable even in hot climates. The Bags are used separately or in combination to provide the proper temp range. In hot climates, Just the Gortex cover is used. In moderate weather down to 20 degrees, the cover and green patrol bags are used . In temp to -10F, the mummy bag and Gortex cover are used. When all 3 bags are combined, temp protection is good to -50F, (50 degrees below zero F). For storage and transport the system is stuffed into the compression bag and then cinched up to about the size of a basketball.

This is a Saiga (Ishmash) 7.62x39 AK. She has been convrted by a local smith to use normal AK mags (and the Saiga 10 rounder still works with a slight mod).

A friend of mine and I designed the bullpup design. It uses a stainless steel cable, routed through the interior, past a tensioner pulley, and to the trigger. The G2 trigger is super snappy, though the cable does negate that a bit. What all that means is, it is completely able to be converted back to normal with nothing but an allen key and some time. Includes all extra parts, the dragonov stock, rear site. It is completely within legal limits with an extra inch. 

Only thing it will be missing is front sight and post. 

Comes with:
3 Pmags
2 Tapco mags
1 steel mag (unknown make)
1 Saiga 10 round mag
Red dot sight (Diamond SAS from Nikko Stirling, NOT sighted in)
All original screws, parts, extra cable, etc in my box 'o' AK other than the front sight, it is completely convertible BACK to standard 

Has seen the range once since bullpupping it. While not sighted in (and needs grips) she was consistent, with very little recoil/bark. 

Not in a huge rush to see, but make an offer. Can't hurt. 


Asking less than HALF of what I paid for her 
$600 cash. 
Only trades I would be interested in would be a lever action .357, or other project gun, plus cash.


Please note: I don't wish to travel farther than half hour from Redford. However if someone has cash at the ready, I'll go farther if need be.

Please contact me via text, phone, and email.

This is first come first serve, throw out an offer, I'd like to move this.

The two overriding questions that must be asked when purchasing a pistol are: How is it going to be used? and By whom?
The P250 makes those questions much less critical by being adaptable to a variety of tasks and a variety of shooters. It has the ability to be configured in everything from full sized range pistol to a deep concealment weapon, in any of four calibers. And, the selection of grip modules, coupled with a standard or short trigger, means it can be fitted to a wide range of hand sizes."

Prefer to trade but will sell for $380 if you'd rather buy, price is pretty firm. 

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 16 six 19 nine 853 if interested, texts preferred. 

Thanks!"

The PredatAR 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.

The barrels are lightweight-profiled with rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost).

The handguards on the PredatAR extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.

Both models come with a 6-position LaRue RAT Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies.

(Iron Sights, Optics and QD mounts not included in price)
Base model includes LaRue RAT Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip, 1 Aluminum Magazine, 1 Rail Strip, and A2 Flash Hider. 

About LaRue Firearm Accuracy:
LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results."

Very Nice Stock much better than average. Obviously a re-arsenaled rifle, but with the smoothest shellac I have seen. All matching, except bayonet, with no line throughs. Good Bore, but do not expect perfection...this is a military surplus rifle. The bore has very strong rifling, has shine, and a excellent crown. This rifle has been discreetly epoxy bedded and free floated....you can wiggle the barrel at the end of the stock....the bedding is solid as a rock...remember this is a 29 inch plus barrel....a free floated mosin barrel is supposed to be free and wiggle at the muzzle. Many people simply cork the barrel at the muzzle because free floating this model is not easy at all. The accuracy shows the bedding and free floating. I shot 2"" group, at 100 yards, with my pet mosin handload. This rifle won a Mosin competition at my rifle club last year.

It is authentic it is made by trijicon
The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the US Army's weapon system (14.5"" barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO features external adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without the caps.

1. Saiga 12- SGM buttpad, 2 promags (10 round), Tac47 Autoplug. Runs Flawless with any ammo. several hundred rounds run through it. Did not need the autoplug to run flawless so i never used it. Bought it as a preemptive.

2. Mossberg 930 SPX - New Never fired w/ original box and paperwork

3. ATI TACSX2 Semi Auto 12g - New never fired

4. Stevens 320 Pump - Ghost ring sights & Pistol grip. some wear on the barrel tip from being stored in soft case. Otherwise excellent condition.

5. Remington 870 Express Magnum - New Never fired but bought about 10 years ago. Was in storage without barrel and got lost. Added a new mossberg barrel. Top folding stock. Missing safety. used it on another one i had.

All of my guns have always been kept lubed and clean in gun socks and cases (the 320 with a remington rust/moisture protector in the chamber). I have not had any malfunctions with any of the ones that i have used. I have 2 hard cases and 2 soft cases that may or may not be included (depends on your offer). 
Cases:

1. Plano Dual RIfle Case - High quality weatherproof. used to store the saiga and 930 but have not cut the foam (i was waiting to convert the saiga and add a mesa tactical stock to the 930) I bought this for $140 on amazon. if you want it, make an offer on it.

2. Drago Soft Case - lots of extra pockets and can be carried on back with included backpack straps. Very high quality. Bought for $65. Make an offer if you want it. 

the other two cases are cheap soft and hard cases. The mossberg 930 will come in its original box unless you make an offer on one of the cases.I would have put up pictures of the cases but i was not allowed to put more pictures. dont know why.

I am asking:

saiga: $850

930: $650 (its new)

ATI: $300 (its new)

Stevens: $200

957,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4411957,For Sale:  Federal High Velocity 9mm Ammo Made For Royal Canadian Mounted Police.,"Spring Hill, Nashville, Tennessee",$ 19,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 9, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have some Federal Hi-Shok 115 grain jacketed hollow point ammunition for sale. This lot is an overrun for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and is loaded to +p pressure levels, even though the cases are not marked +p. You can expect around 1250 feet per second from a Glock 19 or other 4 inch barreled handgun.

Velocity is key to the 9mm round. This bullet, the Hi-Shok, is not bonded and fragments upon impact with soft tissue. This fragmentation creates many wound channels, while the core of the bullet penetrates well over 12 inches in ballistic gelatin. This is a perfect carry round, where overpenetration is a concern. If you are a CCW holder, you are financially responsible for the bullet you fire if it were to penetrate completely and strike another person.

The best thing about this bullet is the price. Most 9mm ball runs around $15 per box of 50 at the local retail stores. This box of 50 is $19, only $4 more. Overpressure hollow point ammo is usually expensive, but because this is a contract overrun, you can save.

I can't tell you much. In the late seventies I made maybe a half dozen similar pistols from CVA kits and sold them. Two of these I hand filed to octagon to round barrels. As I recall, I shortened the barrels and stocks on all of them. I never liked long pistols. I believe I reset the barrel lugs where the front lock bolt would secure the barrels. The nose cap is poured pewter. The inlayed rings in the barrel are brass. Not gold.The silver wire was from pure silver, and I still have some of it. Been a long time. As to value, I would not know what to say. These are all pre-1980, and all were percussion. I did not make the box that one is in. Thank you. That brings back fond memories.
