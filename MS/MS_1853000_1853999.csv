I bought the Law Enforcement Package. It came stock with 3 magazines and a speed loader. I have the factory fired shell casing and the lock that comes with the gun. I also purchased the magazine extensions that allow for 2 more rounds to be squeezed into each magazine. The capacity is 12 + 1 which is pretty impressive for a gun of that size. The gun is in great shape and it fires reliably and accurately. I have probably put about 500 rds through it which means it still isn't truly broken in, however everything works very smoothly. The slide release is like butter! Gun is in fantastic shape. I'm asking $540 which will save you about $45 in tax plus you can have it same day if you don't have a CCP. You also don't have to worry about FFL's.

Make me an offer.

Also, I'm selling two holsters separatly. I bought a Milt Sparks Versa Max 2 (Model # VM-2H). Below is a link directly to the Milt Sparks website:

http://www.miltsparks.com/VM-2.htm

They sell for $123 brand new but according to the website (updated on June 15th 2013) it's approximately a 4 1/2 month waiting period. See link for verification:

http://www.miltsparks.com/

Two years ago when I bought mine I had to wait 9 months so they've come a long way since then. I looked online and I've seen them sell for as much as $300 on ebay. The quality is phenomenal but waiting that long is the price that everybody has to pay. I'm asking $210 for the VM-2 holster OBO, and I won't have much reason to keep the holster any longer than I have the gun itself. 

I also have a Kramer ""Inside The Waistband #3 Gun Holster (only for Semi-autos) Horsehide"" Below is a link to the Kramer website:

http://www.kramerleather.com/productDetail.cfm?productID=7&categoryID=23

I'm asking $125 for the Kramer OBO. You will save $20 right of the bat plus $10.50 on tax plus whatever they're charging for shipping now. Total, you're saving $30-$40. Same thing, make me an offer and I'll entertain them just don't be insulting with your offer because I'm not selling it due to an immediate need for $.

BOTH HOLSTERS ARE IN MINT CONDITION. I HAVE PROBABLY WORN BOTH HOLSTERS LESS THAN 15 TIMES BECAUSE I FOUND A MORE COMFORTABLE WAY TO CARRY. NEITHER HOLSTER HAS BEEN BROKEN IN YET SO YOU CAN STILL MOLD THEM TO YOUR BODY.

 I have several new weapons I have been wanting to try out. However as two of them are hi powered rifles I cant find an indoor range that will let me shoot.  One of my new rifles is an AK-74 and I only have military steel core ammo. This is a problem for most of the decent ranges. 

I live near the city so shooting outside isnt much of an option for me. If you have land I can use I would be more than happy to share ammo. 

I am trying to test my new AK-74 , a CETME .308 + my new 9mm Tokorev style zastava.

If anyone can help me please contact me. with a location and possible times.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

 Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN SCAR MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

 Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Factory new, just released STEYR L9 A1, 9MM long slide with 4.5 Barrel. Comes with hard case, manual, and (2) 17 round magazines.

Pistols created since 1912, in the house of STEYR MANNLICHER, are famous all over the world for their futuristic design, superb ergonomics, absolute safety, and extraordinary precision.

The new M-A1 pistol line continues this tradition, while featuring many detailed innovations. The integrated Picatinny rail, in the front of the frame, is a modern and internationally applicable solution to mount quickly and easily a variety of laser-aiming, or illumination devices. With a total weight of only 27oz (w/o Mag) the new M-A1 pistol is extraordinarily light.

The unique trapezoidal sight offers a new dimension in rapid target acquisition. The sight's shape guides the eye onto the target, and thus the target is captured exactly and quickly. The new innovative grip offers unsurpassed ergonomics, which results in a natural pointability. It optimally supports the natural posture of the wrist during shooting. Improved adhesion is provided by the special surface design.

Factory new, New and ready to ship STEYR M40 A1, 40 S&W.

Pistols created since 1912, in the house of STEYR MANNLICHER, are famous all over the world for their futuristic design, superb ergonomics, absolute safety, and extraordinary precision.

The new M-A1 pistol line continues this tradition, while featuring many detailed innovations. The integrated Picatinny rail, in the front of the frame, is a modern and internationally applicable solution to mount quickly and easily a variety of laser-aiming, or illumination devices. With a total weight of only 27oz (w/o Mag) the new M-A1 pistol is extraordinarily light.

The unique trapezoidal sight offers a new dimension in rapid target acquisition. The sight's shape guides the eye onto the target, and thus the target is captured exactly and quickly. The new innovative grip offers unsurpassed ergonomics, which results in a natural pointability. It optimally supports the natural posture of the wrist during shooting. Improved adhesion is provided by the special surface design.

Product Information:

Lee Precision has been producing some of the highest quality reloading equipment for over 50 years. Their Deluxe 3-Die Sets for rifle cartridges are no different. They are made to tight tolerances to help reloaders make consistent and accurate ammunition. These die sets are perfect for both beginning and seasoned reloaders. Each die is made of steel and the set comes with a full length sizing die, collet neck sizing die and bullet seating die. Reloaders use the full length sizing die to produce ammunition to factory-new specifications using new brass or brass cases that were fired in other guns. Full length sizing dies are also great for the reloader who wants to ensure each round loaded will chamber in their rifle with ease. The collet neck sizing die allows reloaders to produce ammunition that has been fire-formed to the chamber of that rifle. Since only the neck is sized more force may be required to get each round to chamber but brass life is extended and a lot of reloaders see an increase in accuracy. This set also includes a bullet seating die, powder dipper, storage box and load data.

P2XD-A-BK
The P2X Fury Defender is a single-output version of our dual-output, pocket-sized Fury searchlight, and it also features a crenellated Strike Bezel® that can be used as a last line of defense in an emergency. Its precision micro-textured reflector shapes the light from its high-performance LED into a smooth, far-reaching 500-lumen beam with a bright central area that can temporarily blind an aggressor. Activation is quick and intuitive—a necessity in a self-defense flashlight. Just cover the pushbutton tailcap switch with your thumb and press for momentary-on activation; press further to click it into constant on mode. The Fury Defender’s high-strength aerospace aluminum body is smoothly sculpted for a comfortable, secure grip in all kinds of weather, and, it’s hard anodized to military specifications for extreme use under extreme, high-stress situations.

I bought this at the Tulsa gun show 6 years ago for $650 and it was THE best in the show. It is probably worth $750 now, but I will let it go for what I paid for it.

In process of building a long range precision Remington 700 .308 and need the extra cash for the custom build. Just took this AR to the range last wednesday and was shredding holes at 100m, plinking a 4""x4"" piece of steel all day at 200 and was putting lead on 4""x4"" steel at 400m as well. She runs smooth, is accurate, and you can tell by the parts listing that no penny was spared in the build. All high end components in this build.

It will come with original case, paperwork, lock, the two extra back straps and three 15rd glock factory mags. Also trigger guard has been professionally undercut to allow you to get a higher grip purchase. I am only looking to trade for a few things that I will list below all other offers will be ignored and I'm not interested in cash. The only reason I want to trade is that I carry this regularly and now that it is summer the gen4 grip is rubbing me the wrong way literally. The gen 4 is about $100 to $150 more that the gen 3 and its worth it for the reduced recoil due to the double recoil spring so I think anyone who trades with me will be getting a good deal.

I picked up a S&W 28-2 6"" barrel Hwy Patrol as part of a trade a while back. It has sat in the safe every since. The pistol has the proper grips that are numbered to the gun. This is a N perfix serial number.  There's a turn ring and some finish wear at the muzzle and on the front of the cylinder. Overall this is a fine old N frame Smith that will handle .357 loads all day long and not beat you up.

I have decided to stick with bullseye for my light 45 lead target loads. $25

199 rounds of 9mm for $20, thats right, $5/box!. These are rounds that I have picked up over the past couple years while digging for brass at the range, 90% of them were simply just dropped infront of the firing line and not picked up, about 10% of them have primer strikes, most of which are light strikes. I only see 3 or 4 where it looks like it was just a plain ol bad primer. These are NOT  to be haphazardly fired, some of them have bullet setback and there are several obvious reloads. These are being sold as components only for reloading. Pull the bullet, dump the powder, resize the case, weigh the bullet, and charge powder and reseat a bullet. There are 9 steel case rounds(reloadable atleast once, I have 10 loads on some tula 45 steel cases) 13 bullets are lead reloads and one cci blazer aluminum- Id save the bullet and primer but trash the casing. There are a dozen or so hollow points, but appear to be 115gr fmj. AGAIN, IT WOULD BE VERY FOOLISH TO SHOOT THIS AMMUNITION, THE POSSIBILITY OF A SQUIB OR DOUBLE CHARGE FROM A POOR RELOADER IS PRESENT. This ammunition is to be pulled and reuse the components besides the powder. $20

49 rounds of 40 s&w, 10 lead reloads, three steelcase . most are your standard truncated cone and a few hollow points. same as above, for component use only. $8

65 rounds of 380 acp. 2 are lead bullets, 5 are blazer aluminum, id suggest to save the bullet and primer and trash the casing. every time you try to seat a bullet in aluminum, it splits. 5 steel case stuff as well. rest are your standard 90-100gr fmj. again, only for use as reloading components.  $8
