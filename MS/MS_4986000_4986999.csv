At that time, he said he had only fired a box of rounds. Since I have owned it, almost 40 years, I have shot maybe a box. The gun is in excellent shape with very little wear. Bluing is excellent with a very small area at tip of barrel where bluing is slightly worn. Not noticeable unless your attention is drawn to it. It has a very, very thin line on the cylinder, but again very unnoticeable. The grips are original, but had a coat of polyurethane in late seventies which is now beginning to wear. Could be easily restored to original finish. Only selling it because I need the funds for another purchase.

This pistol includes a Crimson Trace trigger guard laser specific to a LC9 that retails for 199.00. This is the striker fired version with a much lighter trigger pull.  

Ruger succinctly describes the LC9s as, ""...a compact, centerfire, single-strike, striker fired, magazine-fed, autoloading, recoil-operated pistol"". Like the LC9, the LC9s is chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Like the LC9, the LC9s has a fiber-filled Nylon frame, aluminum subframe and a steel slide. However, where the LC9 has a preset hammer, the LC9s has a preset striker.  In making this change, Ruger addressed what many felt detracted from the performance of the original LC9, its long, uneven and heavy trigger pull. 450.00 OBO

The gun Must be Jersey compliant,  I dont want any issues with trading or any legal issues.

I have a 150lb Crossbow, I am unsure of the brand but it is in good condition, I was able to shoot it once before I bought it and it is very powerful, would come with everything in the pictures, the easy draw string, the bolts, and the arrow heads for the bolts as well.

I also have a A Golden Eagle Compound Bow. The bow was painted green by the previous owner as he hunted with it frequently, It has a side quiver, String Silencers, A counter weight attached and 3 Razor blade tips I would include as well. I do not know the model number as it was painted over by the previous owner, it is a right handed bow and I believe it is a 70lb draw. Will also come with the paper manual and bag to carry in.   
There are arrows I will include but they all have the fletching destroyed, the guy I bought it from said they were good for fishing so they are yours if you want them too.

Ive always been a fan of trading so shoot me some offers and lets so if we can make a deal.

I've put about 100 rounds through this rifle and it is an outstanding hunting rifle. Great action. I was shooting sub MOA groups @ 100 yards. It turns out that I wanted to get into more long range target shooting, so I'm selling this to put money towards a Model 10 FCP HS Precision. 

I never used the scope so I can't tell you how good it is, but it comes with a lifetime warranty and I still have the card. I also have an extra soft case that I can throw in (pretty much brand new).

These go for about $625 new once you include taxes. I'm not going to be charging any taxes.

Built on the famous Model 700 cylindrical action, Remington Varmint rifles
are the most accurate factory-built models we produce. You ll be stunned by
the degree of precision you get straight out of the box. The varmints won t
be so lucky. If you value tiny groups and the big-time weather resistance
of stainless steel and synthetic, consider the Model 700 Varmint Stainless
Fluted (SF) an instant treasure. Its 26"" heavy-contour barrel is fluted for
weight reduction while maintaining rigidity and rapid cooling. We also
added a concave dish crown that protects the rifling lands and promotes
tack-driving bullet flight. The rugged synthetic stock has overmolded
panels for a sure grip and a vented beavertail fore-end that keeps air
flowing around the barrel. There are dual front swivel studs for sling and
bipod.

I used this pistol to compete once in a USPSA match in production class and decided I want to switch guns and shoot open.

I recently fitted an Apex barrel.  They have only been on the market for a few weeks and the accuracy claims are amazing!  I've only shot 250 rounds just to check for functionality.  Zero failures reported.  I haven't tried shooting for groups but I can already tell that the pistol going to group tight.  I have grip tapped the whole front and sides (almost the exact same as talon grips).  You can still change the backstraps.  I felt that the trigger didn't need any work though you can get a really light crisp pull if you swap out for all the apex parts.  I still have everything that the pistol came with from the factory.  I have the factory barrel as well.  I have a TLR-1 HL and a kydex holster that was custom made to work with this light and a threaded barrel if you so choose to go that route later.  The holster does still work with the light un-installed if you don't want to purchase the light.  I have one ""15"" round magazine, four 17 round rebuilds and four 10 round magazines.  The magazines are numbered with sharpie so I could track failures.  I have zero to report.  This is an awesome pistol but I need cash to put toward my open class gun build.

Delivering long battery life and power to tackle trimming and edging tasks, the Black & Decker LST420 High Performance Trimmer and Edger offers the freedom of cordless convenience and extended runtime. The LST420 features a new dual-mode switch, giving you the option to choose between high power or extended run time. You'll get up to one hour of runtime1 for trimming large yards without the hassles of gas-powered trimmer/edgers.

Ideal for trimming areas of overgrowth after mowing and edging along borders, sidewalks and flower beds, the LST420 is quiet and easy to start. The adjustable height and pivoting handle positions provide maximum comfort and control.
Runtime Extension Technology
Black & Decker's Extended Runtime Technology features electronics that allow this trimmer/edger to maintain constant speed in a variety of grass conditions so the it runs at an efficient speed for extended battery life. In high-power mode, the LST420 ramps up the power output to quickly take down heavy grass and weeds. In runtime mode, the trimmer/edger provides up to one hour of runtime for normal trimming.
The LST420 comes with two 2.0 amp-hour lithium-ion batteries (model LBXR2020), which offers 33 percent more runtime per battery pack than the previous LBXR20 pack.
Trim in Comfort
Easy to start and quiet to operate, the LST420 cordless trimmer/edger weighs 5.7 pounds. Plus, it's fully adjustable so you can work at the ideal height, with pivoting handle positions to trim at odd angles in comfort and a telescoping pole that easily adjusts to a your preferred length.
This cordless trimmer/edger also features Black & Decker's PowerDrive Transmission, which delivers consistent power in most grass types, helping to maintain cutting performance while trimming and edging in heavy grass or weeds. That ultra-efficient performance plus a generous 12-inch cutting swath help every job go faster.
Smooth Operation with Fewer Stops and Starts
With the LST420, you never have to bump to release the string or waste time continually adjusting the string spool. The Black & Decker Automatic Feed Spool keeps the string at the optimal length automatically and continuously. The LST420 also converts from trimmer to an edger in seconds. A wheeled edge guide has been added for balance, helping to eliminate the need to hover the trimmer/edger over the line of grass between the lawn and sidewalk while edging. Simply roll along the sidewalk or driveway, and the wheel supports the weight of the trimmer/edger for a fine edge and straight, clean edges.
Cordless Freedom
Black & Decker's 20-volt MAX lithium-ion batteries2 offer a longer lifespan and retains its charge 5x longer than similar 18-volt NiCad batteries. They're compatible with the full line of Black & Decker's 20-volt MAX line of power and gardening tools, and you won't be limited by an extension cord.
Easy to use and maneuver, the battery-powered timmer and edger eliminates the need for gas or oil to be stored.
What's in the Box
LST420 trimmer/edger, two LBXR2020-OPE 20-volt MAX lithium-ion batteries, charger, one AF-100 30-foot spool, guard, handle, operating instructions

Action locks up tight and the hammer will not push off. Bore is pretty bad, but not totally awful. It'd make a great wall hanger if nothing else. Still a fully functional single shot shotgun."
