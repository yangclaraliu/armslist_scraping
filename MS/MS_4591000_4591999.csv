Another great shooter with the Tapco G2 trigger.  The rifle is made from a milled receiver and 100% made in the USA.  It has the awesome looking black laminate wood furniture and I've also added the Parabellum Armament rail system.  Comes back to zero every time.  On top of the rail is a Primary Arms Micro Red Dot which for the price can't be beat.  On the end is a PWS AK47 brake which makes recoil on the already soft shooting 7.62x39 feel like nothing.  Asking $950 for everything.  Won't break up the AK and the rail system, but will sell without the red dot for $800.  Also comes with the two Tapco mags and a black rifle sock.  Best way to get in touch with me is text at 360-609-1132, or email through the link in the ad. 
I live in Renton and work in Bellevue so would prefer a transfer on the east side or south.  I'll pay $10 toward the transfer at an FFL."

All three have foam that has been cut for previous use but there is still plenty of foam left for whatever your uses may be. All 3 of these are undamaged and have all latches and handles. Approx 60lbs a piece I think? These sell new on Pelican’s website for $686 new and $411 for their foam
Call/email/text for questions or contact. REDACTED
 Selling for $300 a piece but if you are interested in all 3 I will throw the 3rd in for $100
Might be willing to trade for firearms."

What I have is a 1940's Smith & Wesson M&P six shot revolver  that was part of the Lend Lease program used during and after World War II. It is one of the Victory models manufactured by S&W for the war effort. The gun was originally chambered in .38 Smith & Wesson,  but was converted to the .38 Special by Cogswell And Harrison of London, to be used by the British military and or police. This gun was returned to the US at the close of the Lend Lease program and is now up for sale. The serial numbers match the frame and crane however, the grips are not original to the gun ( very common considering the role of these guns ). The gun is in very good shape considering it's age and former life as a service weapon. It shoots very nice in single or double action with no problems at all. I am asking  $300 or best offer, the only reason I'm selling is to fund other projects so please don't send ridiculous offers, it was appraised at $400-450 in it's current condition.

It's still in almost new shape and runs like a dream.  These shotguns are made in the same factories as the Benellis (Franchi is a subsidiary of Benelli) and it's even stamped Benelli on the receiver.  Would make a great semi-auto bird gun for anybody.  The finish on it is very tough as well.  Two of my hunting partners have Versa Maxs and the barrels are both worn where they lay them on the blinds, but mine still looks great.  It's been recently cleaned and has Hornady HD Extreme dry lube all through the internals for protection against extreme conditions.  Comes with the three stock chokes as well as a Carlson's Black Cloud Mid-range choke and a gun sock.  I can throw in my old brown soft carry case as well if you want it.  Seriously won't find a better semi-auto shotgun for he price.  Best way to get in touch with me is through text at 360-609-1132 or through email in the link attached to the ad.
I'll pay $10 toward the transfer fee at an FFL."

Gun is based on a piston design and is extremely reliable and much cleaner than standard AR15's.  Gun is designed to have easy caliber changes as well with available conversion kits.

Gun is the XCR-L model and comes with the following extras:

*Troy battle sights flip up iron sights
*Ace Folding Stock
*Vltor Buffer Tube and mount with a 6 position stock.  Allows you to put any AR15 stock on the gun if desired.

***AIMPOINT CS is NOT included at this price...I may be willing to negotiate it in the deal but I really want to keep it because it is no longer for sale in the USA and has a 10 year continuous run battery life.***

Price is $1250 with all the extras (was $1450).  Several hundred dollars in additions over the base XCR which the 2015 pricing for them are $2,000 new so I think my price is very fair.  I may be open to trades but prefer cash.  I like AR10's, nice Over/Under shotguns, anything Colt, quality optics, Chiappa Rhino (4"" or longer), Weatherby Mark V's, quality AK47's (no Century's) or who knows.  Let me know what you have.

Please note:  this is was marked and sold by S&W as a ""CA Compliant"" model which means that it came with a magazine limited to 10 rounds rather than 12.  I have removed the spacer in the original magazine making it 12 round and have purchased two other 12 rounders as well.  Also, I blacked over the gaudy white lettering that comes on the M&P 22 to make it look less like an airsoft gun and more like a M&P 9/40.  It turned out well.

New from SIG SAUER®, the P238 SAS. The pistol has gone through a radical dehorning process resulting in an ultra smooth, snag free profile that’s ideal for concealed carry. It’s just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 SAS is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with custom wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® Night Sights.

This P238 is unfired, but does show a few handling marks from storage.

I have built this gun with 100 percent american made parts that fit together perfectly. The accuracy and function is perfect. The ONLY thing I do not like about this gun is that  it is too light for my liking, some love it, I don't...my favorite gun is my Colt H-Bar that is nearing 15 pounds. I would be happy to meet you at any location you are comfortable with to test fire it if you feel the need to. I only request that you have either a Conceal Carry Permit, Pistol Purchase Permit or submit to an FBI NICS check (what you do when you complete the 4473 form) to make sure I am selling to a law abiding individual. I have also kept a journal of the accuracy of the gun and with which ammo it shot the best. The only reason I am selling it is because I have found a Sig MK25 that I fell in love with.

This rifle was manufactured by the Izhvesk Arsenal in 1944. The rifle is complete from buttplate to cleaning rod. The rifle is in 98 percent cosmetic condition. The rifle has all matching serial numbers on all parts of the rifle. Factory only markings only, and does not have any electro pencil markings. The rifle has a bright shiny bore with strong lands and grooves. I have never fired corrosive ammo since this rifle has been in my possession. The bayonet locks up nice and tight just like it did in 1944. The stock appears to be crack free and I do not see any evidence of a repair, however, the stock does have a few small handling scratches. That is why this rifle is in 98 percent condition. The only major drawback is that the rifle has been import marked. Other than that everything is just as I have mentioned. For 30.00 I will ship this rifle to your FFL. If the shipping is less than 30.00 you will receive the difference included with the rifle."

All products are new and in original packaging unless otherwise indicated. We do not accept any trades. All listings are for SALE ONLY. All sales are online only and can not be picked up in person. This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comThere are now only two models of Redi-Mag rather than four. One is standard attachment and the other quick attach. Each uses the patented independent magazine release of our Gen II, and both now include a new version of our patented Bolt Catch Extension (P-BCE) made from weapons grade polymer. This new P-BCE is larger at the mounting section and will not work with our previous Redi-Mags. The injection molded P- BCE reduces our cost of production so that we can offer these new models to you at a lower price. No compromises have been made in this process, and in fact the system is even more reliable than it was before. In addition to lightning fast magazine changes, the Redi-Mag gives the advantage of a much quicker reload while prone or in an awkward cover position. It is hard to get to your spare magazines while lying on them! If you require the Quick Attach feature, order the RM-MK-I-QA. Note: The new Bolt Catch Extension (BCE), is included.

I have other items listed for a bigger deal on something.  

Trades considered:

A few items I can think of right now, AR-10(or nice upper / lower), Sig 556R 7.62x39 Gen 2 only, maybe the new converted U.S. Saiga AK-47 since they are $750 new.  I could use a quality stripped AR-10 lower, quality 1"" AR one piece scope mount with pic rails on the rings and 1-2 GG&G Ruger Mini 14/30 scope mounts.  SA XDS 9mm(post recall), the ""essentials"" package would be fine, since they are less than $400 new.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice trigger groups etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

CIS stands for Charter Industries of Singapore. The bullet is a 178 grain FMJ. I believe that the 2Z denotes the type of (flake) powder used.The green tin should have a sticker bearing the manufacture date , usually during the 1970's. The shell casings are difficult to reload. What appears to be a small pistol primer in the base of the shell is actually a non-standard primer. I don't remember the specs but it is not likely you will find replacement primers if you are considering reloading the empties. The ammo is often found in like new condition. The muzzle velocity is low - about 600 FPS. Large amounts of this ammo , along with the corresponding Webley .380 Mark 4 revolvers , were imported from the Singapore Police Force , in the period of about 1981-1991 , by various USA importers. It's hard to believe that this round was still in use by (foreign) police departments and military up until the 1980's. The round was used in the Webley and Enfield top-break revolvers. In fact , this ammo can be used in any 38 S&W (not Special) revolver."

The gun has a factory rough-textured tactical stock. The barrel is a fluted heavy bull barrel, and is fully-floated in the stock. It has a factory AccuTrigger worked down to 2.5lbs, with a very short pull and crisp break. It has an EGW 20 MOA picatinny scope base that has been fitted by a gunsmith to ensure it is true to the action, and a Harris S-BRM 6""-9"" benchrest bipod w/swivel base. I have the original packaging for both the EGW scope base and the Harris bipod, as well as the original 2-piece scope bases that came on the gun. The gun will also include the original box, paperwork, .17 caliber bore snake, and AccuTrigger adjustment tool.

I'm also going to include 65 rounds of CCI 20-grain FMJ ammunition, which is by far the most accurate 17HMR ammo on the market. I bought 100 rounds for this gun, and only shot 35 rounds through it since new. The other 65 rounds are included with the gun. This gun in this configuration was designed as a long-range trainer to practice bullet drop and windage calculations, but I no longer have anywhere to shoot it. It is in perfect, like-new condition, and will easily shoot 1MOA groups with 20 grain ammunition. 17HMR is the most accurate rimfire caliber I've ever owned, and ammunition is easy to find at any gun store or Walmart (unlike .22lr). My asking price is significantly less than what I have invested, but I just don't have anywhere to shoot it anymore. Thanks for your interest, and please email with any questions. 
MSRP on this gun is $477, plus $110 for the bipod, and $50 for the scope base. I believe my asking price is fair considering this. I will consider serious trades or offers. Thanks again!"

Trades considered:

A few items I can think of right now, AR-10(or nice upper / lower), Sig 556R 7.62x39 Gen 2 only, maybe the new converted U.S. Saiga AK-47 since they are $750 new.

SA XDS 9mm(post recall), the ""essentials"" package would be fine, since they are less than $400 new.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice trigger groups etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

Unfortunately, things didn't work out perfectly. The bolt is ugly, but it works. I have a curved bolt to replace it though. I intended to use this Mauser as a competition rifle for vintage sniper, but, I just like my PU Mosin more. Mostly because it is an actual WWII sniper rifle with more available ammo.

The Mauser has an immaculate, shiny bore. It comes with a Weaver K4 scope as prescribed by the CMP for vintage sniper competition. It also comes with a curved bolt and bayonet, as well as 130 or so rounds of ammunition. 85 of them are PPU match grade. With 200 grain match grade, it shoots right around 1 MOA at 100.

For this one, I'm mostly just interested in the cash, but I will at least consider trades."

Regular holster/presentation wear, a few nicks and scratches, but nothing that couldn't be refinished fairly easily by someone with the time or a blasting cabinet. I can provide a link to recent pics. I will gladly take more specific pics for anyone who asks.

This pistol has been flawless, no malfunctions whatsoever. I broke it in for roughly 2500 rounds, broke it down and replaced all the springs with a Wilson Bulletproof makeover kit. Maybe 250 rounds since. It has Novak type Tritium sights, only 2 years old, ambi safety, nicely beveled magwell, 25lpi hand checking on the frontstrap. I have a pair of ivory micarta grips on it right now, also have the LB cocobolo in a box here somewhere. It will come with the 2 LB 8rd mags, 3 CMC 8rd and 1 Tripp Research 8rd Cobra mag. I also have a couple holsters including a nice hybrid from HHH, a Milt Sparks VM2 and a Galco Miami Classic that could be added for the right deal.

I'm asking $1700 OBO

I'm in Terre Haute, and have to watch kids on the reg, so too long a drive would need some serious scheduling but isn't out of the question.
