In essence, the SR 25 was the AR-15 rifle scaled up to shoot 7,62x51 / .308 Win ammunition, with up to 60% of parts of new rifle being interchangeable with standard AR-15 components. This rifle sold well among civilian shooters who needed an accurate semi-automatic rifle in 7,62 / .308 caliber for hunting or target shooting. This rifle also found a favor among US Military - during early 1990s it was adopted by US Navy SEAL groups, as Mark 11 Model 0 sniper rifle system; use of Mk.11 Mod.0 rifle was later extended to US Marine Corps. Mark 11 Model 0 rifle system included the semi-automatic SR-25 rifle, a quick-detachable sound suppressor, also developed by Knights Armament Co, Leupold Vari-X Mil-dot telescope sight, Harris bipod, 20-round magazines and other necessary accessories. In 2005, a modified version of the SR-25 / Mk.11 rifle won US Army Semi-Automatic Sniper Rifle (XM110 SASR) competition, and today it is being issued to US Army snipers, in attempt to replace venerable M24 Sniper Weapon System. A certain controversy exists about this replacement, as some experts doubt that Knight's semi-automatic XM110 rifle could equal long-range accuracy of the bolt-action M24. However, Knights Armament Co claims that SR-25 is capable of 0.5 MOA accuracy with match ammo, and in the field Mk.11 or XM110 rifle can proved accurate and rapid fire out to 600 meters or even more, depending on particular circumstances and proficiency of operator. Use of quick-detachable silencer / sound moderator also has several benefits, the most obvious being concealment of the operator's position, as silencer decreases the sound of gunshot and completely eliminates muzzle flash. Another, less obvious benefit is that silencer also acts as an effective muzzle brake, decreasing recoil and thus permitting faster follow-up shots.

All rifles built on SR-25 platform share same basic action, which is based on AR-15 / M16 system. This is a gas-operated system with direct-impingement gas drive, which has no gas piston. Instead, powder gases are fed from the barrel and through a stainless-steel tube back into the receiver, and then into the cavity inside bolt carrier through the gas key. Inside the bolt carrier, powder gases push it back against the bolt, thus first causing the bolt to rotate and unlock from the barrel, and then to cycle the action. The rotary bolt has 7 radial lugs and improved extractor. Both upper and lower receiver halves are made from aircraft grade aluminum alloy, and connected by cross-pins. There is no ""forward assist"" button on the SR-25 rifles; the brass defelector is present. Barrels are of match class quality, and enclosed into free-floated forearm, fitted with Knights-made and designed Picatiny rails system. Because of AR-15-style recoil buffer, which extends rearwards fro the receiver, SR-15 cannot be fitted with folding buttstock; most rifles are fitted with fixed butt, while SR-25 carbines are fitted with telescoping buttstock. Trigger is also of match grade, fully adjustable.

Military versions of the SR-25, known as Mk.11 Mod.0 (USN / USMC) and XM110 (US Army) have some differences from civilian rifles. First of all, these rifles are fitted with proprietary sound moderator / silencer quick mount, located on the barrel just in front of the gas block. These rifles also finished to military specifications, and equipped with back-up iron sights (marked up to 600 meters and installed on folding bases). XM110 rifle also features a different buttstock, which is adjustable for length of pull, as well as different style forend rail system and a flash hider on the barrel. Military rifles are usually issued along with Harris bipod, Leupold variable-power 3,5-10X sniper scope, and a number of other accessories, including soft and hard carrying case.

Less than 50 rounds through this beauty.The are only 100 of these in the US it will hold its value and only increase."

I figure it this way; if you broke down the items as follows...
$600 rifle - pretty reasonable
$120 bi-pod - about full retail
$200 drum - runs about $300 and very hard to find; it took me several years to find this quality one... I have fired the drum fully 3 times and have never had on single misfire, hang up, stovepipe or issue of any kind besides my trigger finger getting tired or running out of targets...
$160 (8 magazines @ $20 each) you would never need to get any more... and at $20 each, good deal...
$80 140 rounds of ammo - very hard to find right now, seems like a reasonable current value.
That would be $1160... this is a good deal, I need a quick sale."

Looking to trade Troy Aikman hand signed Wilson Football(s) for QUALITY 9mm handgun.
These were sales promotions from 20 years ago signed at a charity function by the man himself (duh lol) If you buy and send a football to him to sign you will pay $200 just for his signature (www,aikman.com) + the price of the football shipping it to him and insured shipping back to yourself. These are Certified Authentic, with a hologram and website verification. If you have a contact in Texas these would be GREAT to make money off of, but not so much profit around here. I would trade 3 of these even (I have 7 total each individually certified with its own certificate) for a quality 9mm. I am in my 50's with a GA license & Ga. weapons permit. They would make a great gift or ""raffle"" item also. I might consider 2 + cash for your 9mm depending on your 9mm. Make me an offer. Average price on the internet is $375 and some are over $1,000 but that is probably in Texas..."

It will come with original case, paperwork, lock, the two extra back straps and three 15rd glock factory mags. Also trigger guard has been professionally undercut to allow you to get a higher grip purchase. I am only looking to trade for a few things that I will list below all other offers will be ignored and I'm not interested in cash. The only reason I want to trade is that I carry this regularly and now that it is summer the gen4 grip is rubbing me the wrong way literally. The gen 4 is about $100 to $150 more that the gen 3 and its worth it for the reduced recoil due to the double recoil spring so I think anyone who trades with me will be getting a good deal.

IOR is one of the few companies that makes short eye relief scopes designed specifically for the AR15. Most scopes have a 4 inch eye relief, which is fine if you are shooting a hunting rifle, but when shooting an AR, the tip of your nose should just barely touch the tip of the charging handle. This will put your scope halfway down the gun if you are using a normal sized 4 inch eye relief scope, and require either a rail or a gooseneck mount. With a short eye relief scope, you keep the proper head position and the scope is directly above the receiver. Therefore, you don't need a rail or extended mount. The scope is very compact and doesn't change the balance of the rifle since the scope is directly above the receiver. It has an illuminated Dragunov rangefinding reticle. This is also a very practical unique feature. It copies the proven Russian design, in which you bracket your target to get the range, and then turn the elevation dial and fire. Very simple and fast. The scope has a 30mm tube and is 4x, and is built like a tank. It is a shame these aren't made any more.  I will ship if you pay with USPS money order."

This 20-Round magazine is designed to replace the standard SR25/ M110 pattern magazines. The 20LR is less than half the weight of a standard steel mag and has a true 20-round capacity. The body is designed with a constant-curve inside dimension and a self-lubricating follower for reliable feeding. The textured magazine body and flared floorplate improve handling over standard magazines. The snap-on impact cover protects the feed lips from impacts and debris while in storage. The impact cover also allows loaded magazines to be stored long-term (over 1 year) without compromising the integrity of the feed lips. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using the impact cover or simple punch for cleaning and maintenance. 

The 20LR PMag will fit KAC SR25, DPMS LR-308, LWRCI REPR, Larue Tactical OBR, Bushmaster 308 ORC, Lewis Machine & Tool MWS, Remington R-25, POF P-308, JP Enterprises LRP-07, G.A.

Bluing is mint, not refinished nor re-blued. Bore is like new. All factory original finish. Comes with the factory box with matching printed serial number stamped on it. Also comes with a brand new Kimber rosewood grips. 

Second gun:

Mint condition Smith & Wesson M60 (no-dash, pre-lock, early 1980's gun), 38 Special. Lockup is very tight. And timing is excellent. No scratches or gouges on the metal. Has the factory wood grips. Grips are in excellent condition. However, it does have a couple of very minor dents and dings. But there are no cracks, splits, or damages. This gun looks like it hasn't been shot much.

I can honestly say this gun has always liked every type of round in either magazine. 
One thing my wife liked about it is that, apparently due to the way the bore is lower than many pistols, the snap and recoil have never been an issue. If you or your mate seem to have problems which may be due to limp wristing that is giving you feeding or ejection problems, this maybe is a great choice for you!

Century Arms O-PAP M70 semi-automatic rifle chambered for 7.62x39mm. The M70 is based on the notoriously rugged AK-47 design, utilizing a proven gas piston system, rotary bolt, and minimal internal parts. The original Zastava Military M70 was the standard issue firearm in the Yugoslav People's Army in 1970. Now relive that look and style with the Zastava M70 O-PAP. The O-PAP displays the original military finish of this fine rifle with oiled wood furniture and noticeable bulged trunnion on the receiver. Wooden handguards and a wooden butt stock with rubber butt pad are installed. The 16.25"" Chrome Lined Hammer Forged barrel has a 1:10"" twist rate and a slant muzzle brake. The receiver has a side mounted optics rail and is dimpled at the magazine well. The pistol grip is black polymer.

The pistol is a former police duty weapon and has some finish wear everywhere! However, I have completely cleaned the weapon (full strip) and replaced the trigger spring with a new spring. It runs 100% and its a greatly accurate gun. For a beater, this one rocks! Also, has a cool story behind it. Was a railroad transit police officers weapon, which means most of the wear is from sitting in a hostler, not from abuse or firing. This baby has given me no issues with all types of ammo and the internals are pristine, barrel has looks brand new on the inside. Extractor is sharp, striker is like new, is like a brand new glock except for the outside which I think is cool. This one you can hammer nails with!"
