This rifle has been adopted by the Designated marksman of the British Military. It is a superb rifle and in the right hands is capable of accuracy at 1000 yards. I am an intermediate shooter and I was consistently SUB MOA at 100 yards. This rifle is capable of quickly and easily switching out complete barrels through the use of its modular barrel mounting system. I have kept this rifle in pristine condition and have kept up with PROPER cleaning after every use. I've put no more than 400 rounds total through this barrel.There are a few minor cosmetic marks from use and can provide closer pictures upon request. If you have any further questions please feel free to ask.

I also have this rifle posted on texasguntrader.com under the name francomatic. I assure you this is a genuine ad.

The P250 is available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP,380ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his or her choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size (subcompact, compact and full). After any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. The 250 modular shooting system is globally-engineered to deliver the reliability one would expect from Sig Sauer. The P250 Compact Black Diamond Plate features a black Nitron-finished slide with diamond plate engraving and Siglite night sights.

The Hungarians were the first Soviot Sataliet country to actually alter the original design of the AK. The internals are the same so you have the same AK to hell and back relibility, Ive seen savages in Afghanistan clean AKs with motor oil and boot strings and still have a reliable weapon. The first big thing they did was shorten the barrel, for tankers, troops in the rear, and for Airborne and Special Ops troops, however the nasty looking muzzle break is added to make the rifle 16inches so it can be US legal. The break serves this purpouse but also really tames the 7.62 recoil, which comes in handy for follow up shots. The foward grip is also a Hungarian add on, all it is is a backward pistol grip, but its very very easy to replace.

So basically you have an AK that is awsome at close quaters, easy to control, and in my opinion looks pretty sick. Its a nice setup, and thats not all included is a ULTIMAX scout rail, which is set up so it can co witness with most red dots so you always have a backup. Also comes with 5 mags and a few hundred rounds and a cheap TASCO red dot.

The Hungarians were the first Soviot Sataliet country to actually alter the original design of the AK. The internals are the same so you have the same AK to hell and back relibility, Ive seen savages in Afghanistan clean AKs with motor oil and boot strings and still have a reliable weapon. The first big thing they did was shorten the barrel, for tankers, troops in the rear, and for Airborne and Special Ops troops, however the nasty looking muzzle break is added to make the rifle 16inches so it can be US legal. The break serves this purpouse but also really tames the 7.62 recoil, which comes in handy for follow up shots. The foward grip is also a Hungarian add on, all it is is a backward pistol grip, but its very very easy to replace.

So basically you have an AK that is awsome at close quaters, easy to control, and in my opinion looks pretty sick. Its a nice setup, and thats not all included is a ULTIMAX scout rail, which is set up so it can co witness with most red dots so you always have a backup. Also comes with 5 mags and a few hundred rounds and a cheap TASCO red dot.

Five 4 One - 622 - 9470 if you are interested in making an offer or trading. 

This gun is in great shape, it is a great home defense, concealed carry, or backup  handgun. It has under 100 rounds through it, I checked the serial # with Taurus, it was manufactured in 2010 so it is still fairly new. It does not have a rail.

The Millennium ""PRO"" also features the same revolutionary Single Action/Double Action trigger and matching serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel as the 24/7 PRO, Heinie ""Straight Eight"""" sights, an ergonomic grip design, enhanced finger indexing Ambidextrous Index Memory Pads"" and posi-traction slide serrations. Light, powerful and technically advanced, the Millennium PRO is the choice for concealment and back-up carry.

Comes with:
PT140 Taurus Millennium Pro .40 caliber compact handgun, duo tone (see photos)

Two 10 round .40S&W magazines + Two Taurus keys to lock the frame (blocks the firing pin)

Black plastic Taurus carrying case, original manual, .40 cal bore brush (I also have a .40 cal bore brush extension for the Outers cleaning kit rod if you need one)

50 rounds .40 cal ammo

Inside-the-waistband holster that fits this gun like a glove (Uncle Mike's size 12), and a Hogue HandAll Jr that fits this gun perfect. 

Will trade my gun, ammo, holster, and grip straight across for the right handgun (9mm would be best but I will consider a .40) or will sell all for $480.

Glock Manufactured Model 19 9mm 15 round Magazine

Like no other pistol, GLOCK pistols permit almost unrestricted compatibility of the magazines within a caliber. Standard magazines, for instance, can also be used for backup weapons. Compact and subcompact GLOCK pistol model magazines can be loaded with a convincing number of rounds – i.e. GLOCK 26: up to 33 rounds.

The innovative polymer frame of the GLOCK pistol does not require grip shells. As a result, it has considerably more space for the magazine body and enables double-row staggered cartridge configuration. For this reason, GLOCK pistols are superior in firepower to conventional pistol models of the same size.

GLOCK magazines have a stiff metal tube encased in the proven GLOCK high-tech polymer. This resists deformation – even when dropped from great height or exposed to extreme environment conditions.

Glock Manufactured Model 19 9mm 15 round Magazine

Like no other pistol, GLOCK pistols permit almost unrestricted compatibility of the magazines within a caliber. Standard magazines, for instance, can also be used for backup weapons. Compact and subcompact GLOCK pistol model magazines can be loaded with a convincing number of rounds – i.e. GLOCK 26: up to 33 rounds.

The innovative polymer frame of the GLOCK pistol does not require grip shells. As a result, it has considerably more space for the magazine body and enables double-row staggered cartridge configuration. For this reason, GLOCK pistols are superior in firepower to conventional pistol models of the same size.

GLOCK magazines have a stiff metal tube encased in the proven GLOCK high-tech polymer. This resists deformation – even when dropped from great height or exposed to extreme environment conditions.

Glock Manufactured Model 19 9mm 15 round Magazine

Like no other pistol, GLOCK pistols permit almost unrestricted compatibility of the magazines within a caliber. Standard magazines, for instance, can also be used for backup weapons. Compact and subcompact GLOCK pistol model magazines can be loaded with a convincing number of rounds – i.e. GLOCK 26: up to 33 rounds.

The innovative polymer frame of the GLOCK pistol does not require grip shells. As a result, it has considerably more space for the magazine body and enables double-row staggered cartridge configuration. For this reason, GLOCK pistols are superior in firepower to conventional pistol models of the same size.

GLOCK magazines have a stiff metal tube encased in the proven GLOCK high-tech polymer. This resists deformation – even when dropped from great height or exposed to extreme environment conditions.

Details:  Semi Automatic 40-Caliber Pistol with a single clips. Designed as a more compact alternative to bulky, full-sized Beretta M92F service pistols, the 8040 series handguns offer a good compromise between concealability, ease of carry, accuracy and firepower. Beretta has been able to develop an ergonomically advanced pistol, compact but capable of handling high-power cartridges with great fire capacity and extraordinary long life. The unique 8000 Series rotating barrel channels part of the recoil energy into barrel rotation and partially absorbs the barrel and slide recoil shock through the central block before it is transferred to the frame allowing Cougars to achieve unusually low felt recoil."

The PPQ M2 is a true breakthrough in ergonomics for self-defense handguns. The sculpted grip meshes smoothly into the hand. The trigger is the finest ever on a polymer, striker-fired handgun. The styling is elegant and trim. What’s more, PPQ M2 has been updated for 2013 with a new traditional reversible mag release button. The leading edge just took another step forward.

This rifle is extremely clean with less than 120 rounds fired through it. Adjustable gas piston makes sure of clean oporation when using many grades and types of either 5.56 or .223 ammunition. Fast, accurate, and reliable is what this rifle is all about. Its a full gas piston so this rfile can oporate with no stock, Very similair to many other sig gas piston 556 base rifles except this one no need for the weight and bulk of that folding stock with a custom milled buffer tube plug im including. In the photos you can see the rifle with and without the Magpul stock/buffer tube, the rifle is still  a rifle due to the applicable and legal minium length barrell which this rifle more than covers. Just like other rifles ( gas pistons...aks/556s/etc with folding stocks. )"

Good condition with a bright bore. Shoots good with no issues. Will throw in a box and a half of .308 ammo. This is the same as the 7.62 NATO rounds... they run the same pressures regardless of what the fear monkeys say. This would be a 1916 model Spanish rifle probably built in the 20's or 30's with the modern metallurgy used in 98 Mausers. It would have been rebarrelled in the 60's to conform to NATO standards. I've only ever shot .308 ammo in this one. The surplus 7.62 is fine too. It runs the same pressures. Email through here or text to REDACTED. I gave $220 for this rifle but I've lowered the price because I'm really needing a welder quick. Thanks!"

I can't stand when people charge double or triple for ammo. It's outrageous. Go online and go to Cheaper Than Dirt.com I was on there the other day and they had plenty of ammo in stock for the correct price!! I am not a employee for any of these companies. It just takes a little bit of effort to go online or make a couple phone calls to the stores.

 ""I keep seeing people selling used Glock pistols on this site for $600 and up and $750 or morefor a used FDE Glock. There is no reason for this. You have to do a background regardless so take a look around. I went into Jensen Arms yesterday and they have every Glock modle in stock in both black and FDE, Gen 3 and 4. $518 for new Gen 3's and $538 for Gen 4's. Same price for FDE. They come with 3 mags. Bushmaster ARs are $200-400 less than what they are selling for on this site as well. Just a few examples. Put these idiots out of
business once and for all so legitimate gun enthusiasts can get their site back from these parasites. 

If you see cheap guns, ammo, and accessories, post it and spread the word to others who are sick of this crap.

Stop getting ripped off by all these greedy gougers on here selling used junk for over $100 dollars more than you can buy new at a number of local gun shops. Good luck real gun lovers!"""

Product Information  (3 Die Sets)

The Lee Carbide 3-Die Set is a great set of reloading dies for any reloader looking for a set of dies that will produce accurate ammunition for many years. Lee dies are made to exacting tolerances helping to create accurate ammunition every time they are used. Each Carbide 3-Die Set comes packaged with a carbide sizing die with decapping unit, powder through expanding die (used for expanding and belling the case mouth while charging the case with powder) and bullet seating die. Each die set comes packaged with the appropriate shellholder, powder dipper, load data sheet and plastic storage container. One of the great features of carbide dies is that they do not require the cases to be lubricated prior to use like non-carbide dies.

Product Information (BULLET MOLDS)

Designed for volume production, the Lee 6-Cavity Bullet Mold blocks are machined from commercial quality aluminum and feature steel bushing and alignment pins. Lee mold blocks are machined from aluminum blocks making them rust resistant. Aluminum molds heat up and cool down faster than iron or steel molds so good bullets can usually be produced after only a few casts. In addition, they are one-third the weight of iron or steel mold blocks for less fatigue during extended casting sessions. To ensure the best possible bullets, mold block halves are CNC machined for unmatched roundness and size control. Lee 6-Cavity molds come with a cam operated, hard-anodized sprue plate which is held tightly with tempered spring washers at each end. Weights given are Lee's weights with suggested alloy; actual weight may vary due to alloy mixture used. Handles ARE NOT included (#117-892).

I bought this pistol in March of 2011. It has been in my safe
ever since. It is one of two pistols left in my NuttinButNines
collection. I really hate to let it go but I know I'll never shoot
it. I'm hoping another collector is looking for one so it goes
to a good home. Two of these sold earlier this month on GB
which is where I got my $1200 asking price. Would like to trade

•The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up.
•The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy.
•The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate.
•Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting.
•The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.
•The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired.
Safety
The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters.
When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged.

Construction
Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel."
