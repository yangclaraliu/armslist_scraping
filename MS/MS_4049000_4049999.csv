This is a bushmaster carbon 15 type 97 pistol. Carbon upper and lower pistol with 7.5 inch barrel. This pistol was upgraded to be more reliable. The short, abbreviated, buffer system and bolt carrier group has been replaced with a mil spec buffer tube, buffer, and spring. The bolt carrier was upgraded to a standard ar15 mil spec bcg. This takes this incredibly light weight ar15 pistol to a new level of reliability. It also makes the buffer and bcg become standard parts. The pistol buffer tube has a Thordson arms cheek rest conversion. This allows the installation of a CAA cheek rest saddle with qd sling attachment points on both sides. This saddle set up is similar to the sig sb15, allowing the pistol to be more easily shot using traditional ar15 shooting methods without the ATF issues with shouldering an sb15. The upgrade includes a magpul ASAP sling attachment and a single point sling. The pistol also has a continuous top rail with traditional peep and post sights permanently attached. The pistol will not include the aimpoint m4 unless an additional $500 is included. The pistol has 120 rounds fired since the conversion. No malfunctions or issues of any type. The last photo shows the pistol empty with the sling and aimpoint weighing in at an unbelievable 4 lbs 8 oz. Thats an easy weight to hike or backpack all day with. And it's 223 firepower! Please remember that the unconverted pistol costs $800 used, the new bcg is $125, buffer tube and assembly is $60, ASAP adapter is $25, sling is $25 and Thordson saddle conversion is $65. This is how I base my pricing so you don't need to ask."

This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).
With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.

This gun is in excellent shape! This was my primary carry gun for many years and I need to clean out some of my collection. It will come with a nylon ambi holster, original paperwork, box, and a box of bullets. It only has one magazine! No trades-Cash only! Located in Lenoir City/Kingston area. $200! 

The PA-63 design reflects a compromise between police and military needs.

The safety/decocking lever, located on the rear of the slide, must be pushed forward to disengage the safety. Aficionados of the John Browning-designed Model 1911 or the Makarov PM may find this design unfamiliar, although those with experience using more modern designs such as the Walther PPK or Beretta M9 pistols will find the safety/decocking lever to be located in a similar position.

The 7-round magazine capacity is much lower than many newer service pistol designs.

Due to its lighter-weight alloy construction, the PA-63 handgun produces more noticeable recoil than the similarly sized, all steel Makarov PM, and some shooters may note an increased tendency toward muzzle flip with each shot. This tendency can be reduced by replacing the stock recoil spring with a stronger one, readily available as an aftermarket item.

Many of the objections raised to the PA-63 have to do with its perception as a military service pistol in the tradition of the American M1911A1, the Russian Tokarev, the German Walther P-38 and P-08 Luger, or the Browning High-Power. As its design can be traced back to a German pocket pistol intended for concealed carry in a pocket or under a coat rather than in a holster on the battlefield, these objections are perhaps understandable. After the fall of communism in 1990, the Hungarian army and police units initiated a program to replace the PA-63 with pistols using the NATO standard 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge, first the imported Jericho 941, followed by the domestically produced P9RC, but the PA-63 is still in service in Hungarian law enforcement."

Glock's Gen4 series of semiautomatic pistols incorporate all the features and benefits Glock is famous for, along with upgrades to enhance performance and shootability. This series still boasts nearly indestructible polymer frames that are stronger than steel. Tenifer-coating on slides and barrels makes them as impervious to the elements as their predecessors. And Safe-Action-Pistol integrated safety features are still standard. Upgrades includes Rough-Textured Frames (RTF) to make them even easier to handle in extreme conditions. RTF improves Glock's all-weather performance when shooting with or without gloves. Each Gen4 includes three differently sized backstraps, so shooters can adjust the grips for a custom fit. Magazine-release buttons are larger and reversible to make them easier to operate for both right- and left-handed shooters. Dual recoil spring assemblies increase durability and reduce recoil and muzzle flip"

Producer is Colt Manufacturing Company of Hartford, CT. Construction is stainless steel barrel, with steel bolt, trigger, and internal parts assembled into lightweight alloy upper and lower receivers. It comes with a 24 inch stainless heavy barrel that is completely free-floating, except for the gas mechanism. Forend is ported alloy, as the photos show, with a 32 slot picatinny rail atop. Buttstock and pistol grip are factory issue mag-pul with folding trapdoor butt plate. Outside diameter on the photo specimen measured .730 at the muzzle, .745 at the gas port, and .945 behind the gas port. Bore is right hand six groove 1:9 twist, and this rifle will perform with exceptional accuracy with any bullet weight. Trigger is .290 Stainless National Match two stage. Photo specimen pulled at 5 1/4 pounds with negligible felt creep. Weight empty is 9 1/4 pounds; and the conventional raised military sight system is completely gone, in favor of a 13 slot Picatinny rail upper that accepts any standard Weaver type mounting devices. Colt has included their factory #W2975, alloy body scope mount like the one in the factory photo we have attached. This AR comes with one factory nine round magazine, and it will accept any conventional M-16 type magazines. Per California Law, the magazine release requires a tool, such as a cartridge, to operate the release. It is a simple matter to replace the magazine release or add what is called a bullet button magnet, but if a California civilian does, he or she can land in agua caliente mucho with Mujer General Harris. We will be happy to sub a factory 20 or 30 round magazine for the 9 rounder, for buyers who reside in jurisdictions where those are legal. Each rifle comes in its original factory box with protective paper, manual, factory registration card, and cleaning equipment. Replacement price on this rifle, if a person can even find one, is upwards of $2,000 in our area. Its most recent wholesale price was over $1300. We're offering the HBAR 6724CA in the photo, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 989.00. 2% discount if payment is with USPS Money Orders and not Credit Card.

The ""Bravo"" model retains all the features of the original SU-16, such as integrated bipod, Picatinny rail, and rotating stock with magazine storage. However, the ""Bravo"" has a lighter and shorter barrel, about 8 oz. and 2.3"". Now comes equipped with Chrome-lined bore and chamber standard.
The front and rear sight are hard coat anodized aluminum and adjustable for elevation and windage respectively. They are both removable and the front sight uses AR-15 style front sight posts. The SU-16B is not a replacement for the original SU-16 but a complement for customers that put a premium on light weight and compactness. The ""Bravo"" type sights can be purchased as a retrofit for SU-16 owners preferring the AR-15/M-16 front sight system.

It is an original ""Chicago Piano"" that was a favorite of  prohibition-era gangsters, law enforcement and WW2 military. To the best of my knowledge, this particular gun was originally issued to the military but never saw combat.  It was in storage during and after WW2 until it was de-activated and made available on the civilian market.  It has only very minor dings from storage.  Complete with internal working parts as shown, Cutts compensator, 50 rd. drum magazine AND 30 rd. stick mag.  Comes with vertical forend AND original military straight forend. Original cleaning rod and oiler are included.  Also included are a custom fancy wood display case plus a fitted violin carry case if you want the ""gangster"" look . A rare opportunity to acquire a piece of American history.   Go to www.gunbroker.com and type Thompson SMG in the search window if you want to see the value of just a few of the parts for Thompson SMG.

NOTE-  I have received several questions and here are the answers:

CAN IT BE FIRED? No, it has a dummy receiver that does not allow a round to be chambered and therefore it is BATF legal to own.

CAN IT BE MADE TO FIRE?  Yes, if you have a blueprint or a CAD program and access to CNC machinery you can make a functioning receiver. HOWEVER to do so without proper liicensing is a felony. CAD programs and blueprints are available for the  Thompson SMG receiver, but again- think FELONY!

WHY SHOULD I PAY $2000 FOR A GUN THAT CANNOT BE FIRED?  You can buy Thompson REPLICAS for about $1000 that can be fired (semi-auto only).  They are poor imitations of the real thing.  You can also buy a replica Rolex watch for $175.00, but a real one is priced at more than $4000.  If you want a ""shootable"" select-fire (full auto and semi-auto)Thompson, you will pay $20,000 or more IF YOU CAN FIND ONE, and of course you would need proper licensing to own it.

Description: ""The Troy Industries AR-15 Alpha Battle Rail is a modular, free floating handguard that incorporates light weight, strength, simplicity and versatility into a slim, aesthetically pleasing package. Building off of the legendary TRX Extreme design, the Alpha Rail maintains the distinctive look and feel of the original, but utilizes a vastly improved low profile locking mechanism for installation onto the host rifle. The new locking system makes use of the factory barrel nut, meaning its removal is no longer necessary. 

The Alpha Rail is constructed of 6061-T6 aircraft grade aluminum that is finished with a mil-spec hard coat anodizing for durability. With a full length top rail and the ability to accept modular rail sections along the handguard's circumference, the Alpha Rail is highly configurable by the end user and able to accommodate any number of tactical accessories with ease. Each handguard comes complete with 3 detachable rail sections and all of the necessary hardware. Made in the USA.""

The stock has fantastic color and figure and only very minor handling marks. The bluing is mint except for one small rub on the floor plate. The bore looks like new and the rifling looks like it was cut yesterday. This rifle has been very well cared for and shot less than 50 times since new. Comes with the original dealer hanging tag and owners manual.
Also comes in a Browning hand fitted model 1915 safari case that was purchased from the same dealer in the early 70s. The case is like new and comes with both locking keys owners manual and care card. Don't think you could ever find another Browning case this complete or in like new condition. Also comes with a Torel hand tooled Cape Buffalo sling that was purchased along with the case. Rifle will come with 1 box of vintage Winchester Western 458 solids and one box of empty's. I don't think you will ever see another 64 Super Grade Custom Shop rifle this complete or in this condition any where. Thanks for looking."

And it doesn't have to be either. This is an open public form where you can e-mail, write,call or fax the ATF and voice to them that you don't want this ammo banned until March 16th. It wasn't even 24 hours after this announcement that price gougers were in full force trying to make a buck off other people with using tricky catch phrases like ""own a piece of history"" ""get it before it's gone forever"" ""pre-banned"" like they have some magic crystal ball where they can see into the future and know it's 100% written in stone it's going to be banned. Don't play into that crap like two years ago when all this hype was happening then nothing happened except a few states encroached on their citizens rights but the majority of the country got to keep it because people stood up and said something. Write, call or e-mail the atf and your state representatives telling them you don't want this. Join the nra if you haven't already. If you stand by and do nothing it will be gone and you won't have any right to bitch about it either. Stop supporting the gougers, flag them, they don't care about you. Stop searching armslist for the lowest price green tips and use that time to write a letter that could mean the difference.
