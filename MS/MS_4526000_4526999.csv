Look this weapon up if you don't know it. I am offering this brand new package at over a 100 dollar loss to me for today only because I have only today to purchase another gun. I will only look at trades that are worth 400 dollars and come with 300 dollars in cash from you. So, please note. 300 dollars cash and something. I am open as far as the trade part of this goes but please, no crap such as Jennings, Hi-Point, Star, Davis, Lorcin and all the rest. You know what I mean. Thank you for your time. My name is Mike and my cell number is REDACTED. You can reach me by call, text or email. Please note that the pistol and holster were taken out of their respective packaging and fitted together to make sure it was what I wanted and then put back. The mags were loaded for about 3 minutes and then they too were put back in the box. When I say brand new I don't mean I fired a hundred rounds and now want to sell it for full price. This gun is new and UNFIRED other than at the factory. Everything is there including the warranty card for you to fill out and send in. Thank you for your time. Give me a shout one way or another if you would like to meet for a purchase or trade deal but please remember, 300 cash and something worth 400 along with it that I can turn around and sell for 250 since that is how it works in the real world when trying to sell used stuff. I live near Newport and will meet as far away as Lincoln City or Corvallis/Albany near I5.

Thank you to those who contacted me about this and the Ruger LCR 22 mag**

Excellent condition CZ P07 (not the duty) 9mm. Single action with ambidexterous safety. Will fire in double action but to get there you'd have to let the hammer down slowly while pressing the trigger. Does come with ambi decocker switch. The 3 dot sights are not night sights but they will glow in the dark for a while if you shine a light on them. 3 magazines: 2 are standard 15 rounders and one is a 16 rounder for the CZ 75. All mags have worked perfectly. Has 3 backstraps and the large one is currently on the gun. 

Bought this brand new, shot it quite a bit, cleaned it after every range trip. Pleasant to shoot, very accurate up to 25 yards (longest distance at the indoor range). Zero issues/stoppages from the amount of rounds I put through it. I don't think I passed 1k rounds with it yet but I'm close. It's another one I don't want to sell but need to tend to family circumstances. Regardless, I'll sell it for a bargain price.

$300 takes it. Valid FL ID or military PCS orders please. Thank you."

I have a Ruger 10-22 in great shape with a 25rd Buttler Creek Magazine. I am the second owner with no rounds down range by myself but previous owner stated he only put a box of CCI (100rds) through it and from the condition I believe him. I recently picked up a take down 10-22 so this one will be needing a new home. I am open to trade offers and of course cash will be added for items of greater value. I would be interested in,

This is a right-handed shotgun. Unfortunately, I shoot left-handed. I recently purchased the left-handed model Beretta that is safer for me to shoot! So, this one has to move out.
This shotgun was purchased new by me and has had very light use. Check it out, you will not be disappointed.
