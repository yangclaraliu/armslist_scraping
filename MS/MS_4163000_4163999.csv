All are original Israeli parts except the upper (metric) reciever (Brazilian), everything else is original Israeli military including the lower receiver, barrel, bipod, etc. It does include the ""limiting tab"" on the bipod and those are very hard to find or get. Includes the flip up tab on butt stock (rests on top of shoulder), folding bipod, gar regulator, carry handle and wood furniture. These are not made anymore and are increasingly harder to find. This rifle is a beast (very heavy) and is in excellent shape and shoots wonderful with no issues. Comes with one metric 30 round magazine. $1700. See the video on YouTube here: http://youtu.be/sIYrH7f61K8

Next, I have an original British FN FAL L1A1. All original British parts except the upper receiver which is made in the USA (CAI). The lower reciever has British markings. All original British parts include the nice wood furniture, buttstock pad (with trap door), muzzle brake, folding charging handle, ""z"" cuts on exterior of the bolt to prevent dust from entering the chamber, front sight tool, carry handle, and trigger guard that folds into the pistol grip. This is a very light weapon, very easy to carry and includes 3 inch 20 round magazines as this weapon was built on the British inch pattern system. $1500

Deemed, ""The Right Arm of the Free World"", both of these types FN FAL's are semi-automatic and getting harder to find and more rare, therefore values will only increase in the future. The only thing these two rifles are missing is the sling. I am mainly looking to trade but am willing to sell. I am mainly interested in trading for unique or rare rifles, such as old military rifles like these that have a historical sense or value. All trade or money offers will be entertained, but please don't be upset if I say no or I'm not interested. We are all in this together and I am willing to be fair if you are on both trading or selling. I'm willing to trade both or sell both. If you want to buy both I will bring the price down some. If you want to trade then we can talk about what yours is worth. I can be negotiable with trading and price as long as you do good business. Face to Face (Cash and Carry) transactions, cash only. I might sell or trade out of state from my FFL to yours, but prefer to keep it in my state unless you have something I can't live without."

The rounds that have been fired were, 200 rounds of federal brass cased XM193, and 200 rounds of freedom munition brass cased 62gr FMJ's.  This rifle has no damage to speak of, save for a small scratch on the bolt catch that was give during assembly.  The rifle and BCG has been thoroughly cleaned after each range session.  Truth be told I don't really want to part with this weapon, however, I don't feel like I've given it the attention it deserves, and I don't feel like it's very practical for a home defense weapon, so it sees too little use.

Hey Everyone, 
I have for trade/sale a heavily used but good shooting and stout Helwan (MAADI) 9mm Pistol. It is an Egyptian clone of a Beretta M1951/brigadier made on Beretta machines and tools in Egypt. This is in fair condition and has rusting in various places on the gun and the grips are cracked. However, despite it being a bit of an Ugly Duckling, i took it to the range today and it shot flawlessly for me. I also just replaced the mag with a brand new one through Triple K. This could mainly use a good thorough deep clean and she would probably look much better. This will come with the gun and one mag. Need to meet up in norman on this if possible. 
	I would also consider trades on this for firearms, mainly looking for Tokarev chambered pistols, full size 38 spell pistols, lever guns, a cheap beater SKS, etc. Im not terribly particular and somewht open. Feel free to make a reasonable offer on it. Easiest bet is to shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

Mint almost brand new looking Star PD .45. These were very popular in the 80's&90's due to being one of the first alloy framed .45s. Very light weight. Very reliable and accurate. The late Col. Cooper said it was a gun to be ""carried often, and shot little"".  I personally have only put 7 rounds through it to make sure it functioned fine. It did.

 Comes with 2 mags nice holster. Box of ammo.

The finish on the barrel and receiver look great and the wood stock is also in great shape.  These are suppose to be super accurate rifles and it's and extremely flat shooting caliber for the ultimate varmint rifle.  From researching a bit, it looks like the .220 Swift is harder to find in these older models vs. other calibers and I've yseen prices all over the place on just the rifle from $600 up to a couple grand, depending on condition etc., so not exactly sure what this one is worth, but it is very nice overall.  On the Pentax scope included, I don't know much about the Pentax line, the markings show 3-9 Pentax MC and looking this up I found a few used for $150-$160, so I guess it's a good scope for the money and it's as clear as my Nikons.  I'm just more into semi-autos, so putting it up to see what I can get for it in cash, so I can finish some other projects or will consider trades.  No hurry to get rid of it, just not sure when I will take it out.

**Update**  I've had many people contact me with questions about this rifle and want to post some updated info.  The stock may have been refinished, it looks very nice, but I was informed that the finish was more of a satin finish from Ruger.  Also, many of these rifles from 1968-1991 had an issue with the set screw.  Here is a link to order the replacement set screw for free and looks like a simple fix.  http://ruger.com/pdf/m77.pdf  It seems the set screw issue can cause the rifle to fire unexpectedly, never a good thing.  I played around with mine and when you have the safety in the on position, pull the trigger, then move the safety to the off position it clicks, so that may mean it would be firing if a round were in the chamber.  I would replace the set screw before taking it out.

$700 firm in all cash for the rifle and scope or $740 shipped insured, I lowered the price due to the above stated issue.  If I have time to order and replace the set screw myself, the price will go back up.  I will ship, but not until I have payment or the trade item(s) first. 

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, so I'll be pretty picky on any trade offer.  If wanting a trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I have several firearms in the platforms and calibers listed below along with plenty of rounds for all, but will consder trades if it makes sense on my end, otherwise I will pass on trades and wait for cash.

It will come with two factory 10rd mags, three 30rd promags, and one SGM 100rd drum. The drum is pretty unique, I believe SGM imported these as AR/M16 drums and they installed new feed lips to allow them to be used with the Saiga. I can't find them instock anywhere, so I don't know if SGM is still doing these conversions. When they were instock they were between $140- $165. Asking $875obo for everything. I will consider partial trades but mostly looking for cash. These are no longer imported and this one has already had the rear converted!

The rifle
remington 700 5r, meaning it uses the same rifling as the m24. The barrel has been duracoated black, so it is no longer the same dull silver that comes on the 5r factory. I bought this rifle used, so I cannot give you an exact round count.

The cadex chassis (strike dual) made by drake associates is incredibly solid. The stock folds and locks the bolt in place. It is all around adjustable and allows you to use an ar15 style grip.

Nightforce nxs 5.5-22x50 zero stop with the npr-1 reticle. Incredible piece of glass mounted in a Burris single point mount. 

The rifle has a surefire muzzle break attached as well as an atlas bipod. It comes in a coyote colored pelican case, with foam cut to fit.

I have an assortment of factory loaded .300wm that comes with the rifle. And might even throw in some rcbs reloading dies.

493,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4163493,For Sale:  2 Tactical Link Enhanced Battery Assist Lever,"Ashland, Northern Kentucky, Kentucky",$ 35,"Listed On: Saturday, March 28, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Enhanced Battery Assist Lever®

The Enhanced Battery Assist Lever significantly improves the speed and efficiency of reloads and clearing stoppages without switching hands, allowing you to maintain constant fire control. This device easily installs onto your existing standard mil-spec forged AR bolt release/catch (paddle) with no weapon disassembly or parts replacement, and allows you to lock the bolt back and release the bolt with just a slight movement of your trigger finger. The Battery Assist Lever was recently redesigned from the ground up with considerable improvements giving rise to the Enhanced Battery Assist Lever.





Faster reloadsLarger Bolt Release Button



The threat is still closing, the pressure increasing. Nothing is more important in the next two seconds than seating a new magazine and chambering another round. That is why we made the bolt release button of the Enhanced Battery Assist Lever 48% larger than the original to enable faster indexing and therefore faster reloads particularly important in the heat of battle.




Clear Stoppages EasierClear stoppages faster
You know you are not out of ammo but your weapon has stopped firing. Diagnostics indicates you have a situation that requires you to lock the bolt back to clear the stoppage. Simply lift up the Battery Assist Lever with your trigger finger while pulling back on the charging handle with your support hand (without the hassle of switching hands) and your bolt is locked open, whether you have thick arctic gloves on or not that is the beauty of the self-centering finger index groove.




Super tight, rock solid fitRock solid fit
The Enhanced Battery Assist Lever easily installs onto your existing standard AR15/M16 mil-spec bolt release in seconds, with no weapon disassembly or parts replacement, and provides a super-tight rock-solid fit thanks to our exclusive Triple Screw Retention System. Unlike other devices, the Enhanced Battery Assist Lever is designed to avoid making contact with the upper receiver, and does not wobble and will not come loose even under the harshest of use.


Fits wide receiversLow drag contour
The Enhanced Battery Assist Lever sports a low-drag receiver-hugging contour and rounded corners everywhere, making it snag-free and comfortable to use. With the original Battery Assist Lever, we learned that not all lower receivers are created equally. Some (i.e. billet receivers) are wider than others. That is why we designed the Enhanced Battery Assist Lever with a Wide Receiver Relief - to provide a better fit on more lower receivers. Compatible with standard / mil-spec dimensioned, right-handed, AR15 / M16 upper and lower receivers, including the HK 416, Sig 516, Sig M400; and also the Cross Machine & Tool billet upper and lower receivers. May not be compatible with the Odin Works XMR Gen1 Extended Mag Release. Not compatible with the following weapons: FNH SCAR, S&W MP15-22, S&W MP15 Magpul Edition, Ruger SR-762, Sig 716; and may not be compatible with some 7.62 / .308 models.





Easier to indexMaintain constant fire control
Unlike other devices that sit low and forward in the trigger well (requiring you to break your grip in order to reach it), the Enhanced Battery Assist Lever sits higher in the trigger well and more centered, making it easier to index (even for those with short fingers) allowing you to maintain constant fire control. The Enhanced Battery Assist Lever does not interfere with the trigger or the magazine release button. Furthermore, it is ambidextrous and is compatible with the Redi-Mag and the KNS Gen 2 (and Gen 2 Mod 2) Non-Rotating Trigger/Hammer Pins. 



Ceramic coatingDurable Cerakote finish
The Enhanced Battery Assist Lever is precision cast and then coated with an incredibly durable, non-reflective matte Cerakote finish. Available in a variety of colors (depending on inventory levels): Black, Magpul Flat Dark Earth (H-267), Magpul OD Green (H-232Q), Magpul Foliage Green (H-231), Patriort Brown (H-226Q), Burnt Bronze (H-148Q), Titanium (H-170Q), RAL8000 (H-8000Q), Zombie Green (H-168Q), USMC Red (H-167Q), and Pink (H-141Q).

1. I have a really nice SA-52 rebuild M1 garand for sale. I recently got this rifle from the CMP. But I need to sell it to fund something else. The green parkerizing is in excellent shape. The metal looks brand new. The wood is a DOD rebuild stock w/ cartouches. Nice stock just needs oil. ME: 1+ TE: 3+. I doubt it has been shot since the rebuild. Comes with everything from the CMP including certificate. You would be hard pressed to find a nicer Garand. Serial # is 2.9mil which was made June 1944.

2. I have a nice 1.8mil WWII Springfield. Serial dates to September 1943. Correct SA 11-42 barrel. Pretty rare to find. ME:1+ TE:4. Lockbar rear sight. Unmarked wartime replacement stock. No cartouches. Cut SA oprod. Very early SA gas cylinder with drawing numbers, pretty rare. Only thing not SA is the trigger housing, safety, gas plug, and hammer. So it could be made into an all SA gun pretty easily. Comes with certificate and all the goodies.

The 22 long rifle is topped with a 38-grain copper plated lead hollow point bullet that comes out of the muzzle at 1260 feet per second. The hollow point works two ways first it expands in the target second if there is a miss the hollow point will shatter on any hard surface.

This was my baby. I took several years to get it and health reasons have left me to sell it. There are a lot of other things that go. If the person who buys this pays the asking he will get what I got to get red of. Example, 5 15 round clips, an almost full case of ammo, a box of handloading stuff. I can sit on this beauty for ever so don't step on my toes. This is not a fire sale. This price is firm. Mess with me and this deal is terminated for you. Play nice and it may be Christmas."
