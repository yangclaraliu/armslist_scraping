The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter.  These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter.  TRP level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing.  Designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP for a lifetime.

The author has over 25 yrs experience collecting Lugers and owns an extensive Luger collection of several hundred pistols and Carbines. This book is a useful and affordable tool for the novice and experienced collector as well as someone just looking for a shooter to enjoy. - The book does cover values but as it is a few years old and Luger values continue to climb all the time, this section of the book makes a good starting point but you'll find more current values on the net.

This one is brand new and unfired with all original accessories. Comes in a factory supplied Plano water tight box similar to Pelican cases. It also came with magazines, pre-cut foam for the rifle, and spare spots for suppressors, pistol + mags, and other equipment. It's a pretty slick fully contained system in a box. Feel free to ask questions. Thanks for looking. http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/12/07/review-drd-cdr-15-rifle/"

It is a modern special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

This has the conventional double-action/single action trigger has a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame.  P30 models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. Double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger, so In case of an ammunition-related failure to fire all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. 

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights laser aimers or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

During a recent endurance test a P30 test pistol fired more than 91000 rounds without any major component failures.

This example has a mounted light/laser in the pics that is NOT part of the stated price, if that is to be included in the purchase it would be an additional $150 minimum cost on top of the listed price.  This is firm.  I also have about 500 or so rounds of varying ammunition I would include if desired on a trade or sale.

I am just trying to reverse finance some other projects and need to thin the herd a little. If it doesn't sell or nothing peaks my interest I don't mind putting her back in the safe. I also have other firearms and miscellaneous related items I will be listing soon as well so keep your eyes open for some other cool stuff."

It's action is a short-stroke piston, akin to the German STG-44 more than the AK-47 and it's variants.  The receiver is milled, versus stamped like an AK, resulting in a lighter weight.

Magpul Enhanced Triggerwell ($10.00) 
JP Enterprises Tuned/Polished Buffer Spring ($18.00)
Lantac Dragon 5.56 Muzzle Break ($120.00, this was from a previous build, approximately 500 rounds through it, from when it was on a different rifle)

Sig OEM Pistol Grip, Sig OEM Charging Handle, Sig Standard A2 ""Birdcage"" Flash-Hider

All together, I have approximately $2330.00 into the rifle and I would like to get $1500, although I'll entertain reasonable/respectable offers. Cash only. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions. I'd be willing to travel up to 30 miles to meet halfway (in a local PD parking lot?) to facilitate the deal.

Up for sale is my lightly used KRISS Vector.  I am a collector and gun enthusiast so when I had the opportunity to get my hands on this piece I went straight for it.  Definitely don't regret getting this gun, it's just time for something new or for me to start paying off my Harley.  This carbine is a huge head turner at the range.  Its also one of the coolest guns I've ever owned and shot.  The recoil and action sound on this rifle feels and sounds like a real mans gun; like an M1 or an SKS(bad ass internal parts).  Very quiet sounding firearm as well because its shooting a 45ACP round out of a 16 inch barrel.  Very low round count between the original owner and myself.  I have only taken the gun out a few times to play.  Let me know if you have any questions.  This is the most competitive price for a CA legal KRISS Vector on CA Armslist, and it's worth the money.  Can meet near Santa Cruz county.  You pay for the transfer fee.  Ask me for cash and carry and ill inform you that it's illegal and that you are an idiot.

The rifle comes with CA bullet button installed, bullet button tool mounted on CAA forward grip, has stock KRISS Diamond sights which are dead on at close range, Kriss rifle case, one 10 round Glock mag, and 2 other Glock magazine rebuild kits."

Hello and thanks for looking today I am selling a like new Diamondback DB9FS. Its got 30 flawless rounds (2mags) through it, and is a retardedly fun and accurate pistol to shoot. Its got a very low bore which pushes the recoil back and reduces muzzle rise greatly allowing you to put multible shots on target quickly. Its got a nice smooth trigger with a good reset. many online reviews compare this to the Strike One by Arsenal but at less than half the price. (no its not as good, but its good enough for the price point). There are a number of online reviews on this pistol (especially the video and write up on the truth about guns). these pistols come with a no nonsense lifetime warenty from diamondback period. So anything goes wrong they will fix it. So if its such a good pistol why am I selling it you ask? because its so awsome I bought 2 because I thought my wife would shoot it to, wrong, she likes sub compacts. The biggest complaint about the pistol? only one mag. but there are a few fixes dremmel some beretta mags that fit but arenot flush, or buy extras from me I have 7 mags total I got extras from Diamondback. they are hard to get and cost 25$ each plus shipping on their website. I will part with extras at 20$ a piece.."

It's in excellent condition and comes with one 12-round mag for $425 firm no trades. For pistol and five mags, $500. I will sell the mags separately $25 each. There's two 12-rounders and two 10-rounders. This gun carries like a small gun but is very easy to shoot and can be a great range pistol as well."

This Federal American Eagle Ammunition is genuineLake City Ammunition Plant overrun ammunition. This tracer ammunition is loaded to military specification and is perfect for providing the shooter with immediate feedback through trajectory visualization by allowing the bullet path to be seen. Tracer ammunition is a great choice for banging away at steel targets, casual plinking and high-volume blasting sessions. The military uses tracer ammunition as an efficient tool for signaling they are effective for use as pre-arranged signals between units and individuals; they also can be used to designate targets. Tracers burn very bright and very hot they may catch surrounding vegetation on fire so they should only be used where there is a limited chance of the shooter starting a fire. This ammunition is loaded with a delayed ignition tracer meaning it will not ignite for 50-100 yards. This means the tracer is not burning up barrels prematurely causing damage to expensive firearms. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer-primed, reloadable Lake City brass cases.

Please Note: While the 5.56x45mm NATO will fit in a .223 Remington chamber, the 5.56 is a military round that runs at higher pressures than its .223 counterpart and is not recommended to be fired in a .223 Remington chamber.

The conversion is still 1st Generation as it was done in the late 1930's prior to the start of WWII. This particular revolver has an interesting family history, but I am selling it due to some urgent financial needs. The condition of this Colt is very good to excellent and it should be both a fantastic shooter as well as fine collectible at a reasonable price due to the conversion. This revolver has a 5 1/2"" barrel and the bore looks great. Nice Colts like this are getting very hard to find so don't miss out. As with all older firearms this revolver must be checked out by a competent gunsmith prior to firing it. Buyer to pay actual shipping and provide copy of FFL."

Not looking to spend a ton of money as my plan is for it to be a truck/ loaner type rifle. Would like something in the $600-700ish range but price would depend on the specifics of the rifle. I might pay more if the rifle is genuinely worth it. Please note I have built a couple of rifles and know what stuff is worth. If I can buy or build a rifle cheaper with new parts then obviously buying it used from you would not make sense. 

Let me know what you have got and how much you want for it. Thanks, Ryan"

This Rifle was built on an imbel receiver. The person I got this from told me they purchased it in the 80s and it was an original imported Israeli Rifle and I'm still not sure it isn't but I've had a few extremely rude emails by immature children calling me stupid for posting what I was told by the previous owner in calling this a pre-ban Israeli Paratrooper which is exactly what it is. I don't know anything else about it except for what I'm posting and I know the receiver is pre-ban making the rifle itself pre-ban because all post ban imbel receivers were required to have the date stamped in the magwell and this one doesn't making it a pre-ban. If you research Imbel you will find that their quality is equal to that of original FN Belgian FALs. This rifle was built using a 16.25"" Israeli Heavy Barrel. It appears original to me and doesn't appear like it was cutdown. The reason I believe it's an original 16.25"" Israeli HB is because of the Milled cut for the bipod which would have been cut off if the barrel was originally a full length 24"" Israeli HB. It's definitely possible it could have been cut and a portion of the barrel was milled out for the bipod but if that was done it was an expert job because I can't tell. The previous owner said he took off the original bipod and flashider because he didn't like them and he was unable to find them when he sold it to me. Luckily these are easy parts to find on various sights such as gunbroker or eBay. The barrel is Israeli marked and dated 5/67 where the barrel goes into the receiver. It shoots great and is extremely accurate for such a short barrel which I attribute to the abnormally thick and heavy barrel. I have never even seen another picture of one of these in this configuration let alone seen one for sale so I don't have another one to compare it to but I do have another heavy barrel full size Israeli rifle and the barrel on this paratrooper is noticeably thicker the barrel is really a monster. Rifle will come with one 30 round magazine and 5 20 round magazines and another set of Israeli HB Hanguards which are painted black to match the rest of the rifle. The added extras alone are worth over $200 so it's a nice bonus. I have over $2000 invested in this rifle so my asking price is pretty firm. With normal pre ban Fals running over $1500 now this is a hell of a bargain. Only trade I would consider would be for a Browning 1919 belt fed in .308/7.62. I can add some cash if need be. E-mail, Call, or text REDACTED. I will ship anywhere in the US but it must go to an FFL License Holders address and I will need a copy of an FFL E-mailed to me for my records."

Barrel: Barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN Manufacturing using their proprietary blend of hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feedramps, and a carbine gas system. The barrel has an A2 style profile, is mil-spec phosphate coated, and MP/HP tested.
