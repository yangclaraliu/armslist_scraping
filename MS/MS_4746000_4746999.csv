It has been restored by Alan Harton (one of the few people you actually want restoring your old SAA). This gun has perfect hammer fit, great screws, good roll marks, and all lines are straight and true. This is the best fit and finished SAA I own. The Barrel and Cylinder have been replaced with second gen parts. There was a bit too much end-shake for my taste but a few base pin shims means that it is now tight with perfect timing. Gun is nearly flawless with almost perfect bluing except for some small amount of holster wear on the end of the ejector tube and tiny spot of wear on the back strap. Stag grips are real, old, and beautiful. This is a great first gen shooter you can use.

I have shot a total of 10 rounds through it -:) lol.  I never intended to let it go ever but I have a purchase coming very soon so cash needs to be generated.  Previous owner grouped  .780 @ 300 yards!!!

Price is $1,050 cash or 1,150 trade value for the rifle and bipod as it sits.  Really looking for cash but will consider a few trades (partial trades plus cash will also work).  Please be realistic about the value of your trade.  Thanks!

Slim rail feels great in the hand, much better than the bulky quad rails. I have another exactly lke this and can tell you the brake makes a huge difference, a little louder to the side for sure but almost no climb so fast shots are a breeze.

This a double action lightweight derringer that you can carry and barely know it's there.  (until you need it)  It's thin profile allows you to place it in a pocket without an obvious outline.  The only reason I am selling this is because my wife is having a hard time with the lengthy trigger pull.  Never been fired by me!  Just 2 test rounds from the factory.  

This is NOT from American Derringer.  They didn't list Doubletapp as a manufacturer option so that is probably the closest in description.

Drivers License/Carry permit required for purchase.  Call Tom @ REDACTED if you like.

Thank you for looking."

These are remanufactured rounds from converted 270 cases.
7.7 ammo is extremely rare and 7.7 reloadable brass is even more rare. 270 is a common cartridge that is easily converted to 7.7 jap. These rounds are reloadable after they have been fired. All the cases have been uniformly trimmed and annealed to promote long case life.

Sonny Crockett had one in season 3 of Miami Vice, now you can have one too.  They are getting harder to find in any kind of great condition.  This one is pristine condition and comes with all the original items Original S&W box (s/n does not match though but the box is correct and in excellent shape for the years), original wax paper the gun was wrapped in, Safety pamphlet, warranty card and statement, 645 owners manual, magazine dis-assembly, up opened S&W cleaning kit, and finally a warning label.  The standard weapon comes with 2 – 8 shot magazines, there are an additional 3 more making a total of 5 – 8 shot magazines all are S&W. 

This 645 is all stainless steel with wood grips and white outline adjustable rear sight plus red insert front sight.  There are no marks on the frame or slide at all it is the best one that I have seen in years.  This one has been shot but it looks new.  This is the most complete package that I have seen and the weapon is the best looking on the net.  Check out the others and you will see.

$725 cash or $775 trade.  The only item I am interested in are handguns.  No Taurus, Glocks, Kahr,Hi Point, Keltec Derringers,  handgun. Partial trade and cash OK.  Handguns must be in excellent shape as this one is.  Please respond to the email below since I do not always get a timely response from this site.

MADE IN ITALY
It’s a Limited Edition,  and clearly one of the most realistic looking toy guns ever made.  You won't find this one at Target or WalMart.
If your young hunter isn't quite ready for his own shotgun, he can now own the next best thing.  This authentic looking side-by-side toy shotgun,  scaled WAY down to 33"" and very lightweight - is a great way to learn gun handling and safety.Die cast metal receiver,  steel barrels and double triggers, this cap gun also has a true break-open action.
It includes two “shot gun” shells for youngsters to practice both loading and un-loading.  The receiver has “engraved” scrollwork,  which was then antiqued to look very authentic.  This piece also has a functioning safety,  placed right where it should be.The stock set is a thick, high quality wood-grained synthetic.  It uses proprietary caps that resemble shotgun primers,  but can’t shoot projectiles.  The caps are then put into mini-shotshells (like primers would be) and then into the capgun.  It just doesn't get more realistic than that!
Overall length: 33 in.Weight 2.1 lbLength of pull: 11.5 in.
Metal double triggers,  metal barrels and receiver.  The barrel and stock have swivels installed.  Set includes 2 two shot shells.
Alternative use ... It looks so real,  hang it on your wall and watch everyone do a double take!
 $100 each
ENTREPRENEURS – Buy my stock! Will consider dealers discount on multiples.  These sell very well at Gun Shows,  Flea Markets and Swap Meets.  They are unique, quality gifts for any age. Each comes in a full-color factory box.

Here is some info and what has been done:

The frame is from a like-new, German frame P229 (sold the .40 slide some time ago).

The folded carbon slide/barrel is from a Made in Germany P228. The serial number from it is a 2001, with approximately 100 recent rounds through it total, and has been a safe queen part. The guide rod and spring are like-new as well. It also has brand new night sights installed by Sig Custom Shop.

The 9mm locking block insert was just purchased. I replaced the .40 insert for it so that it could be properly converted to 9mm. I have the .40, too, so if you need that, I'll throw it in.

Comes with 1 OEM P228 13-round magazine. Essentially there is no real difference in this version versus the last run coming out of Exeter around 2009, I believe, except maybe the price. Need to sell to fund an upcoming November trip. Will come with original (P229) owner's manual and gray plastic hard case.

3 Tapco 30 round mags - $30
1 Tapco 10 round mag - $10

Since I've put about $1000 into the gun, I'm asking for $750.  It's a fair deal, especially since taxes and FFL transfer fees will run you an additional $150+ when buying new.

I'm also selling ~3,200 rounds of 7N6 5.45x39.  2,160 of those rounds are in sealed spam cans in a create complete with a can opener, and the remainder are stored in an included metal ammo can.  The crate is identical to this:

I'm asking for $400 for the crate of 2,160, and another $150 for the remaining ~1200 rounds.  If you would like to purchase them all, I'll sell all the ammo for $500.  That's just under 15 cents a round!

From ""truth about guns""
The Russian Tokarev was a military service pistol produced in Russia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Poland, North Korea, Egypt and China. The Tokarev typically chambers the powerful 7.62x25mm bottleneck cartridge. The Chinese made a unique variant chambered in 9mm—the Norinco 213— for the civilian market. The State Factory 66-manufactured all-steel 213 is nearly identical to the Russian TT-33 Tokarev with one key difference: an additional frame mounted safety. (Given the similarities. some gun guys speculate that the Hungarian Tokagypt 9mm pistol inspired the 213.) The 213 is pleasant to shoot, remarkably accurate and extremely reliable."

The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M)®, which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XD(M)® features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place.

Info (Truth About Guns):
The Mod30 was an improvement over the Mod28. That gun was famous for the first of the early 1980’s JSAAP competition stages for guns aspiring to become the new U.S. armed service standard-issue pistol. Although Star outperformed both the Ruger and Smith & Wesson entries, the military brass eventually awarded the Beretta 92 the contract.)

This pistol was adopted for service by a number of Spanish police organizations, and the Spanish armed forces. Spanish Air Force pilots and some Guardia personell used the MI also. The M30 was also adopted in some numbers by Peruvian police and security forces as well as French Special Forces.
