3 Sealed boxes of 150rds of recently banned M855 XM855 Green Tip with Steel Penetrator now considered by the ATF to be Armor Piercing. I also have 3 bags of loose Lake City M855.

This is a reasonable price especially given the price increase for other banned rounds such as 7.62mm Chinese Steel Core, 5.45x39 Russian 7n6 or 30-06 M2 AP which goes for about $5 a round if you can find it.

2) I will respond promptly to any offers made and can travel a reasonable distance (within the city) to meet you at OUR mutual earliest convince.

Adjustable gas settings for various applications.

Hey everyone,
	I have up for trade or sale a great little conceal carry gun. This is a Ruger LCP chambered in 380 ACP. This gun is used, and has normal expected wear from extended carry. This comes with 1 factory mag with pinky extension, and two Pro mag magazines with pinky extensions on them. This is a perfect way to get all you need to have a EDC gun that is so small you almost forget you are carrying it. 
	In terms of trades, I’m somewhat open. Would like to trade towards a cheaper AK, or even a decent SKS. Would consider most semi auto rifles (no 22LR). Would also trade for a decent Marlin 30/30. Would also trade for certain pistols/carbines chambered in 7.62x25 tokarev. Honestly, just shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Worst I can say is no! Need to meet up in Norman on this due to my Schedule. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting, 
JB"

If interested, please call or text Sean at 712-261-27zero2. I'm currently a student at the University of Iowa, so I live in Coralville, but am originally from NW Iowa (that's why the area code may seem weird). As the listing says, I'm looking to get $190 considering the age, condition, and original price of this Ruger. The only cosmetic blemish on the entire gun is a small nick in the wood stock as shown in the last picture. Thank you for looking.

The Type-C is hammer fired and has its own version of half-cock. When you rack the slide, the hammer is suspended half way through its travel, so it is under tension. A squeeze of the trigger finishes cocking the hammer and releases it. Very similar to a striker fired pistol.

This is a great gun. The recoil is moderate and it runs flawlessly.  The only reason I'm selling it is because I'm consolidating to the 9 mm caliber. This gun lists for $578.00 on Bud's website.

It has a spring loaded door that opens in less than a second. You can use over 12 million different finger access codes for this model. The one on it now is rather simple, but it can be changed. You can mount this almost anywhere that you would like, it has pre-drilled holes on the bottom for that reason. This model also has a foam layer of protection inside. It has an LED and Audio low battery warning. It also has an LED and audio tamper indicator in case someone has been messing with the combination. After a certain number of entries it will lock itself out for a certain amount of time. It also comes with a backup key for that reason, or in case the battery dies.

It's in good conditions and functions perfectly. Weapon has a viridain tac light and green laser. Weapon comes with seven, 12 round mags. Mags are filled horanady 45+p hollow point, critical duty rounds. These rounds have the best ballistic performance of any I could find. Some other types of ammunition claim better but every one I saw, turned out to be a total junk gimmick. Duty belt is your standard blackhawk molle, flat dark earth or whatever the fancy term for brown is. Matching blackhawk mag pouches are of course included. Holster is double retention, safariland, similar to what most police departments use for their glocks. Also included are about 50 federal hollow point, plus 50 mixed federal/winchester full metal jacket rounds. For now the price is fixed, as I believe in making good offers and hate haggling but if the weapon remains unsold in say a month, I'll entertain other offers. Thank you for your interest and time.

It's wearing a beautiful set of original contoured walnut grips. I got this from the original owner last year. No box or papers. 
$850.000


Next is an interesting 357 OM Ruger Blackhawk that was customized by, I think, Cosby Custom Gunsmithing. It was converted to 44sp, the barrel was shortened, the frame was remarked '44 Special' and color case hardened. Most interestingly, the topstrap was welded up and recontoured like a Colt SAA. The aluminum grip frame was replaced with a steel one that was converted to a birdhead configuration. The custom grips have the Masonic emblem. The original owner had his name engraved on the backstrap.


I didn't love the look and feel of the birdhead, so I added the original, aluminum XR3 grip frame and Sambar stag grips. Much better. 
$1000 with the Stags( the birdhead gripframe and grips included). $800 with the birdhead.




Even as I write this, I've got mixed feelings. As usual, I've found a 1911 I'm interested in, but can't buy without selling something. If you happen to have a Colt Wiley Clapp or an Armory Kote TRP you would trade for one of these, I would consider that. If you have a Les Baer or something similar you'd trade for both, I'd consider that. Also, as usual, when the gun I'm wanting sells, I'll probably take this ad down and just keep these. Prices are pretty firm. Finding a nice, original Flattop is hard enough. Finding an OM Vaquero for less than the cost of the custom work, impossible, I would think."

How It Works
--------------
This setup allowed me to collect solar energy at 24V into two 12V batteries hooked up in series (12V + 12V = 24V).

The voltage was then stepped down using the Samlex SDC-30 to 13.8V and fed to the RIGRunner. 

I used this to power a Yeasu FT-450D ham radio portable and it worked quite well. 

Everything is lightly used and works like a charm. 

Uses Anderson PowerPoles for all connections.


Let me know if you are interested in any of the components or the whole system. 

I have more pictures as well.

I am your friendly neighborhood Cerakote hobbyist located in Lincoln, CA. I work from my home at the moment until my service expands to something greater, but I can assure you that I stand by my work. If you are unhappy I will fix your issue. 

at this time I offer solid color cerakote but can do different colors on different parts for a very nice color combo.

NOTE: I am not a certified Cerakote applicator and my prices reflect that. This is my Hobby and I want to offer it to the people of the firearm community. On most occasions I am less than half the price of anyone else.

I am not currently an FFL holder, although that is in the works. I will not be able to keep your firearms overnight and all work done on ATF designated firearms will be same day turn around and pickup. Non firearm work can be completed same day, or if you would like to pick up at a later time that can work too.

here is a basic price breakdown for the hobby services that I provide:

 Rifle begin as a bushmaster ORC, which is a fabulous $1,300 weapon, in and of itself. From there I turned into a high quality SR25 carbine. It's collapsed length is 33.5 inches, a mere 4 inches longer than its 5.56 M4 cousin and 6 inches shorter than its other cousin, the beloved M16. 
The weapon has Troy Industries, free floating, Picatinny rail handguards which run around $200 and are the best handguard available for the 7.62/.308 AR. The broomstick, grip pod or what ever they're calling it now is Israeli made, Fab defense and doubles as both a fold out bipod and a tac light mount, that cost $150. The tac light is a surefire PX3 fury, which is a $300 light. The optic is a Trijicon RX30 with ARMS quick throw lever, which is a $600 optic. The scope comes with original box. 
Also included are five SR 25 mags, valued at $30 each, along with flat dark earth blackhawk mag pouches. The mags are filled with high velocity, ballistic tipped Horanady rounds, which have the best ballistic performance of any 7.62/.308 round I've found. Addition ammo includes roughly 50 more Of the same Horanady rounds and 140 federal full metal jacket rounds, which is over $300 worth of ammo. The rifle also includes a 3 point sligh that's seen combat, laser bore sight and bushmaster original kit, with raised scope mounts, manual and firearm lock. 
If you've done the math, this is package worth over $3,000, so the price is very fair and fixed, unless you don't want all of it. Feel free to contact me with any questions. Thanks for the interest and have a wonderful day! REDACTED"

Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).
With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.

It is chambered in 9mm and accepts Glock 17/19 magazines. Sub 2000 carbines are generally pretty rare as it is. However, this version is even more so because for one, it uses Glock magazines and two, because Kel-Tec stopped producing it with a Stainless Steel finish. For these reasons, I am marking the price up a bit.

Being lightweight, accurate and powerful, this is an excellent option for anyone who is looking for a companion for their Glock 17/19 pistol, looking for a great defensive carbine option or who simply wants to grab a rare firearm for collecting. I have to say that it is one of my personal favorites from my collection and I hate to part with it. However, I simply need the money right now. I am hoping to be able to get another one like this in the future.

I am selling the carbine without a magazine. The reason being is that all of my current Glock magazines are customized and I do not want to have to get rid of any, since I do still need them. If this is an issue, let me know and I will include an original Glock magazine, but I will be charging for it. I do apologize for any inconvenience. Chances are good, if you are looking at this carbine, you already have some Glock magazines lying around. If not, you may want to consider stocking up. They're excellent magazines!

I will need to meet someone in daylight at a public area. I will also need to see identification to confirm that you are at least 18 years of age. I will only accept cash and I do reserve the right to refuse a sale at any time for any reason."

The lower is made by Walther and has the look and feel of a PPQ, while the slide and barrel are made by Magnum Research.  

Although it is striker fired, it has a decocker which transforms the light striker pull into a longer action, which adds another element of safety in a carry piece that does not have a manual safety.  Although I decided not to keep it (I have too many guns, what can I say?), I did dry fire it a couple of times and the lighter action trigger feels just like the PPQ.  

I am pricing this item very, very fairly,  so the ask is firm and I have zero interest in trades.  I also follow all laws on gun transfers.

The MR Eagle Series from Magnum Research is a joint American/German effort featuring a black polymer frame with integral steel rails imported from Walther in Germany, a 416 stainless steel slide and a 4140 CrMo steel barrel machined in the USA and assembled and shipped from the Pillager, MN factory. The MR Eagle is a striker fire design and is available in two popular calibers, 9mm and the .40 S&W. Additional features include a fully adjustable rear sight for windage, three replaceable palm swells for various hand sizes and shooting styles, interchangeable front sight blades of different heights, hammer forged barrel, full Weaver style accessory rail and internal safety devices."

983,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4044983,For Sale:  Very Fine Condition and Early Colt Government Model 1911A1 .45 c. 1928,"Maryland, Maryland, United States","$ 2,545","Listed On: Wednesday, February 18, 2015",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,45 Auto RIM                                                                                ,no type,Pistol,"This is a very fine and near mint condition, all original Colt Government Model 1911A1 Pistol from 1928. The serial number on this Colt is C153591, which was manufactured at the Colt Plant in Hartford, Connecticut in 1928. The serial number range for Colt Government Model Pistols in 1928 was C152,000 to C154,999, which is a small production run of only 3,000 pistols that year. It is important to note that there was no military 1911A1 production from 1925 until 1936, only commercially available Government Models in the 1911A1 configuration, so the only examples for the Colt collector from this decade are these Government Models. Colt took the opportunity to not only capitalize on the popularity of the pistol based on its service in WWI, but to also continue to refine the design for any future military contracts. Colt's commercial production of the 1911 began just after the military contracts were manufactured. The first fifty Colt Model 1911 Pistols were crated and shipped on January 4, 1912. The first commercial Government Models 1911, serial number C1, was shipped from the Colt factory on April 13, 1912. When Colt began to experiment with design modifications following WWI, they did so with the commercially available Government Model 1911. The first of what became the 1911A1 pistol rolled off the Colt production line in October 1923, at serial number C135,000. The newly designed Colt Government Model 1911A1 incorporated the finger relief cut on the frame/receiver, the arched and checkered mainspring housing, and the fully checkered walnut stocks. The first military Colt 1911A1, which was known as the Transition Model, began at serial number 700,000 in 1924 and only 10,000 of this model were produced before military pistol contracts ceased for over a decade. The next military contract Colt 1911A1, serial number 710,001, would not be manufactured at Colt until 1937.

The Receiver (sometimes referred to as the Frame) on this pistol retains 99% of the original Colt high quality ""dull"" blue finish. As both Charles Clawson and Joe Poyer note in their respective treatises on the Colt 1911 Pistol, the ""dull"" blue finish used by Colt was only slightly less reflective than the earlier glistening ""oil finish."" Once the finish was applied, the worker polished the blued steel to what was known as a ""fine finish,"" which is the polishing stage just below the ""oil finish."" As Poyer notes, the new ""dull"" finish was ""dull only in comparison to the high gloss ""oil"" finish, which was discontinued on the Colt Government Model around serial number C10,000. The right side of the Frame has the serial number ""C153591,"" with the correct vertical, sans serif ""C"" and the numbers are the ornamental serif font that slants to the right. Colt used this font format for Government Model serial numbers from serial number C130,000 to C198,000. The serif ""C"" had previously been used but it was dropped by Colt for a short period around serial number C130,000 and did not reappear again until serial number C170,001. The ""GOVERNMENT MODEL"" stamp is sans serif and is correctly to the rear of the slide stop in hole. Both the Government Model nomenclature and the serial number stampings are as crisp as the day they were first made.

At the top right portion of the Trigger Guard flat on the right side of the Receiver is the crisp, sans serif ""51"" stamp, which is the Colt Assembler's Mark. The Assembler's Mark in this location on Colt Government Model 1911A1s began at serial number C130,000. The top left side of the Trigger Guard flat on the left side of the Receiver has a crisp ""1"" Commercial Inspection Mark above the crisp, stylized ""V"" and ""P"" stamp set inside an inverted triangle, which is the Colt Verified Proof stamp. The top of the Receiver, just to the right and rear of the disconnector at the 5 o'clock position is the correct sans serif ""S"" stamp, which is the Colt Commercial marking for ""sales,"" as opposed to the ""G"" stamp for government contracts. Just above the ""S"" stamp, at the 3 o'clock position, is the Colt Commercial Inspection Marking. The Receiver on this Colt is simply beautiful. The interior portions of the Receiver retain nearly 100% of the original blued finish with virtually no wear at all. The internal portion of the Receiver at the recoil spring shroud retains 100% of its original blued finish with no wear noted. The internal wall that serves as the facing portion of the Receiver for the Grip Safety and Mainspring Housing retains 100% of its original blued finish. The barrel recess at the front of the Receiver retains 100% of its original blued finish. The Feed Ramp is correctly polished to the white and shows no scratches from feeding or any wear whatsoever. The area around both the top and bottom side of the disconnector hole retains 100% of its original blued finish with no wear noted.

The area of the Receiver that is under the grip panels when they are installed retains 100% of the original blued finish with slight brown discoloration in places, which is probably from the original oil finish on the stocks. The front grip strap and trigger bow, areas that ordinarily show the most wear on 1911 pistols, both retains 100% of their original blued finish with minor surface scratches seen on close examination but in remarkable and beautiful condition. The Ejector is solidly in position and retains 100% of its original finish with no wear noted at all on its leading edge, which is another indicator that this pistol remains unfired since it was manufactured. All four stock screw bushings are securely screwed to the Receiver and all retain 98% of their original blued finish. The Plunger Tube on the upper left side of the Receiver retains 98% of its original blued finish. The rounded ends of both the Slide Stop Plunger and the Safety Catch Plunger correctly remain in the white and are polished bright. There is a very faint slide catch line on the left side of the Receiver arcing downwards towards the left side finger relief cut but it is not deep and appears to only go through the blued finish layer. The only wear of note on the Receiver is a small area just above the finger relief cut on the right side and a small area just above the right side trigger guard. The rest of the Receiver is pristine and truly exhibits the fine finish and lack of wear consistent with an unfired weapon."
