I am not the original owner however the knife is in 90% condition with minimal scratches and almost no dings or marring of the frame which is typically associated with balisong knives (see photos). The blade appears to still have the factory edge on it and the knife locks up (both with the blade open and blade closed) very tight.

I tried to present an accurate portrayal of the knife in the attached photos. I guarantee you will not be disappointed when you see this piece in person.

The older Benchmade balisongs are becoming highly collectible and I've seen model 44's go from up to 450-500$. That being said collectible knives seems to be a buyer's market and I'm looking to fund my ever-growing sport shooting hobby so I am open to all offers. I'm also highly receptive to all firearms trades and would even trade up if it meant myself adding some cash to the deal, so let me know what you have! Thanks, and I hope everyone enjoys the upcoming holidays. 

Looks like I can only add one image - I have several close-up, detailed photos that I would be happy to sent via email."

I've owned it for about 2 years and meant for it to be my concealed carry gun. Unfortunately, never came to be so the gun has pretty much been a safe queen. I had some trijicon HD night sights ($130 just for the sights) installed on day 1 and they look great easy to see at night and day because of the black ledge and orange front dot. The gun has seen maybe 200-300 rounds as it got quite expensive to shoot .45 for me. I cleaned it after every range visit. Gun is immaculate with all original paperwork, accesories, and case.

It's a milled receiver low round count. There's a small issue with the saftey. Previous owner milled down the internal saftey to loosen it up. He took to much off. There for the gun can go off if chambered with saftey on. Apex.com sells a brand new safty for the gun brand new for $15 or just the peice for $5. Very easy and cheap to fix. I've personally never had any problem with the way it is. I'm a gun safty freak my self. Treat every gun as a loaded one. And unless target shooting never chamber a round unless your shooting.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-ups.  Would also like more Pmags for both.

The pistol has had one repair done to it. I had to have the right upper grip screw hole repaired. Pullman Arms did an excellent job micro-welding, drilling and tapping the frame screw hole. The pistol does show wear and tear from being shot and carried by the previous owner, it was by no means a safe queen, but fires every time the trigger is pulled!!!!!

$480 firm in cash.

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less interested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

The rifle may be charged and fired while the stock is folded (without cheek risers installed). A rubber butt-pad provides an anti-slip surface. Rollover on the toe allows for easier shoulder transitions. The front sling mount is a left-side rotation limited mount that accepts push button QD swivels. The rear sling mount accepts push button QD swivels. The bottom sling mount is a 1.25"" sling loop. Collapsed length of pull is 12.2"" and extended length of pull is 14.8"". Weighs 15 ounces. MADE IN THE U.S.A.NOTE: NOT compatible with the Norinco Type 56S/MAK-90 due to differences in the trunnion’s tang."

These are the nice, much larger 10 x 50 power armored-glass ( shatterproof) binoculars, not the small, much common 6x30 feldglas commonly used by ground units. Examples like these would have been utilized by officers, senior NCOs and Armored-unit and tank Commanders, as well as FlakArtillerie, Antiflugzeugbatterie or Forward-observer posts, NOT your everyday fernglas issued to line troops.

Completely original set, wartime-manufactured by KARL ZEISS in Jenna. Clearly wartime-coded "" BLC "" as marked, and they are also marked "" + "" for Cold-weather temperature use. That means the internal mechanisms, lenses and ocular pieces are treated with special internal lubricants to facilitate vision during inclement weather and prevent seizure of the mechanisms.

Clear optics, with no hazing or fungus. These WW 2 binoculars are also range- marked with the Artillery reticle inside the lenses. 
Adjustments function fine on both oculars. Some moderate wear to its original non-slip krinkle finish as expected from a wartime-used set, to reflect its honest age, not repainted. No rust or corrosion to lense cases or aluminium body.

        Original WWII military case is made of the correct Prestoff-type black leatherette for the period, wartime-dated 1943 and also coded with the "" CNY "" military manufacture code. The front-strap latch is stamped twice "" fnh43 "".

The hinged leather-strap section is firm and not detached nor split. Original front leather strap pull still present. Its original neckstrap is also present, and in good condition with NO breaks, tears or splits.

Overall, a nice original set of WW2 German army set of binoculars, for the advanced collector. Ship USPS priority within 24 hrs. of receipt of payment, via USPS Priority with tracking."

$1,200 FIRM in cash or higher in trade value.  This set-up would run $1,400+ new and I don't see the rifle in stock anywhere, plus any fees, so that's at least $200+ off a like new set-up.  Not really wanting to split up right now, but may consider it, depending on what you are offering in cash or trade, so please be specific on what you have and the offer, pretty simple.

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal as far as the value goes, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

These were originally heavy-duty boots worn by Commonwealth troops in the North Africa campaigns since early 1941. Many examples like this were taken from captured Australian army stocks after the successful german advances into Tunisia and Libya in 1942. 

Over 18,000 British army and Commonwealth uniforms were captured after the siege and seizure of Tobruk by the AfrikaKorps. Among these, thousands of hardy Australian army combat boots, just as pictured here. You can see them in use by many DAK troops throughout North Africa in many pictorial and documented records and photographs. Some were even issued to Italian army units active in the area.




         They are heavy, wartime-manufactured of very sturdy natural leather. All leather is in excellent shape throughout the boots, with NO rips, tears, wear spots or any field repairs whatsoever. Original natural look is still remarkable. Approximate size is 8 1/2 ( the say 5 in UK size).  These are 1945 dated.

I had them with a WWII DAK static mannequin display for years, but I am very fortunate to have just received a set of salty original Afrikakorps boots from overseas ( yes, the insanely expensive and rare DAK short boots); thus, I have no further need for these anymore.
They are in unissued condition, with no wear other than being displayed in a mannequin. Unfortunately, the laces broke in several parts, but easy to replace.

$440 firm or higher in trade. 

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now and will be needing some tires in the next month or so.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

A set of MINT unissued US Marine Corps M1951 combat boots. They are very similar to the WWII ""boondocker"" boots used by the Corps in the Pacific during WW2. 

Contract dated January 1951, these were the high top rough side- out boots adopted during the Korean War......a much more sensible boot for cold weather wear than the WW2 vintage ""boondockers"". 
At some point I believe they became the standard issue Marine field boot but not sure when this happened. But I do recall seeing this boot, or one very similar, on the feet of ""Old Corps"" Marines as a little kid in the late 1960's.

The boots are stone-mint new, never even had a foot in them. They are both stamped "" ENDICOTT JOHNSON"" on the insides of the boots. They are NSN numbered differently on the inside of the boot sleeve as pictured, and for some reason the back of one the tongues is natural color. Both boots are the same maker and size. The size is 8 1/2 as noted in the photos.

The brown-cowhide roughout leather is EXCELLENT. The soles have never been treaded on anything. Mint new bootlaces. The soles are the typical black-corded rubberite of the period. 
Overall, a minty original set of USMC M51 roughout combat boots."

If you don't have a laser attached to your Kahr handgun, my guess is that this holster will not have the adequate retention needed. The gun in the photos is present for demonstration purposes only and is not part of the listing. This is for a right handed person and this was custom created for the Kahr with the laser by MultiHolsters for me. I never used it. As a result, the holster is in excellent condition without any damage or scratches or wear on it. I am selling this because I decided to go with a different gun for my micro-carry pistol. Although this holster does not have a pronounceable ""click"" or ""snap"" upon fully inserting your gun, it still has excellent retention. The Kydex thickness is .08. The holster largely closes off at the bottom to repel any lint or dust from getting inside. The side of the holster that faces the outside of your pocket is also flat so as to not noticeably print. If you look at the picture carefully, the holster also has a small ""thumb-break"" so that it will be easier to draw your gun with practice. I can meet in Tualatin or Salem."

If you're looking at buying a shotgun in general, consider the portability of the shotgun here and note that the Mossberg 500 has DUAL extractors while most other shotguns (looking at the Remington 870) have a single extractor that is not nearly as reliable. Comes with everything seen here and I'll throw in the original pistol grip and magazine tube cap if I can find it."

Blued, with 10"" barrel chambered in .357 Maximum.  

Comes with a williams peep sight, original rear sight, and is drilled and tapped for a rail.

Also will come with 100 pieces of brass for the reloaders out there.

This gun at a good hunting load is a cannon, comparable to shooting a .44 magnum.  However, with the shock pad in the grip, the weight of the gun, its very manageable.  Flatter shooting than a .44 mag, and packing approximately the same power as a .35 remington into a small convenient package.  And just like all of Thompson Centers guns, differenct caliber barrels can be purchased for just about any cartridge you would like.

Gun is in excellent condition, aside from the bottom cap on the grip is deteriorated and would need replaced, about $5 for one online.

Asking $500 obo.  Willing to trade for rifles, particularly interested in surplus rifles. Mausers, SKS, Enfields etc. No handguns please.

Willing to ship to fellow Ohio residents for $15 statewide, USPS Money and Personal checks accepted with 3 days to clear, and I need a scanned copy of your Ohio license.  I will ship nationwide for $30 to out of state FFL's for transfer.  Just need a copy of the FFL license.

I am selling these for my Dad who no longer reloads.  Looking online it looks like this stuff goes for $35 a pound from the manufacturer.

If that's accurate, $20 / lbs seems like a reasonable deal so $200 per bottle is what I'm asking.

With a huge variety of mounting systems, for nearly every type of firearm under the sun, you're sure to find the perfect match for you firearm, and your style of shooting. The Leupold Integral Mounting Systems (IMS) family quickly and easily eliminates the two most common issues faced when mounting standard rifle scopes to AR-style rifles; scope height and eye relief. Each aluminum IMS cantilever design mounts directly to the firearm's Mil-Spec 1913/Picatinny to raise the scope and push it forward, eliminating the need for risers or specialized optics with shortened eye relief. All Leupold IMS products are tested to endure the rigors of the field and are covered by the Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee.

The only improvement that was made to this pistol is a pro trigger job which resulted in a silky smooth trigger and a very crisp and clean trigger reset. The trigger pull now feels more like 4-4.5 lbs vs the factory new 6 lbs. It looks awsome - in the opinion of many it is one of the best looking semi auto pistols out there. The SR series Ruger pistols have proven to be very reliable, while having the softest recoil compared to other competitive pistols which will make it much easier to coax your wife or daughter to train with it. It sits very low in the hand, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise and the ergonomics is perfect for both long and short fingers. The combination of low bore and tight barrel lockup produce an extremely accurate and shootable big bore pistol. It is very accurate with a wide variety of ammo. It is not on the California approved roster but is perfectly legal to transfer and own in California. Comes with 2 magazines, a magazine loader, factory box and instruction manual.

This is by far the most accurate handgun I have ever shot. I can shoot a full mag into a 8.5 x 11"" paper target at 50 yards, my friend shoots with this gun a full mag within a 6"" circle at 50 yards. (He is 11 years younger than me.) He has never been able to do that with his H&K. Eats any ammo, never jams and never had any extraction or ejection issues. It hits what you aim at every time, reliably. Fast on target with the Novak sights and because of the tame recoil and muzzle-flip it is just as fast on follow-up shots. This gun outshoots any $3,000 1911.A small fortune was spent on this 1911 to make it as close to perfect as possible: See the list below.Barrel Length - 5""Frame/Material - SteelCaliber - 45 ACP2.5-lbs Upgraded Trigger Sights - Novak Target SightsGrips/Stock - Hogue Grips2-piece Stainless Steel Guide Rod and Spring SetPolished Feed RampLowered and Flared Ejection PortExtended Beavertail for maximum comfort & safety Combat Hammer, Skeletonized Trigger and magwellAmbidextrous SafetyComes with 1 factory and 2 Stainless Steel Kimber magazines, a magazine loader, factory box and instruction manual.I am looking for either the best cash offer or will consider a trade for: 1.
