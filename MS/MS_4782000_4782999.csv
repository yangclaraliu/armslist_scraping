It is the stainless steel birdshead grip addition with beautiful Wyoming maple grips and a 5.5"" barrel. It has been meticulously cared for and shot less than 50 times while I've owned it. Previous owner was a collector who didn't shoot it often either. When I did shoot it, it was very accurate and comfortable to shoot. It has surprisingly little kick due to the weight and balance of the gun. The gun will come with a western ""tied down"" holster and belt with some really nice hand tooling and in pristine condition. The belt will fit waist sizes 30-38 without alteration. I will also throw in a box of 50 Winchester cartridges as well. I prefer face to face transactions. Thanks for looking.  If you will text me your email I can send extra pictures of the gun and belt. This site will only let me upload one picture. REDACTED

It only has about 500 rounds through it. It is the sport model so it doesn't have a forward assist or dust cover. It comes with a magpul stock, Bushnell red dot and houge grip. It comes with one clip and a quad rail I installed with rubber rail covers. This gun alone new is over 700 bucks after taxes. I am willing to trade but I'm only interested in 9mm hand guns either a glock, barettas or Smith and Wesson m&p series. Also interested in revolvers. Text. 317 fourfourzero 4905 for more questions"

It has a 20 inch threaded mid profile barrel that has a PWS FSC30 compensator ($100) installed. On the optics front there is a Bushnell Elite Tactical 4.5-30 X 50 scope ($750) in Trijicon 30mm AccuPoint rings ($125) on a 20 degree Blackhawk picatinny rail ($31). Everything is all brand new and the prices shown are street prices, not MSRP. All in there is over $2100 spent without the bipod, cheek pad and sling. NO, I DO NOT WANT TO SELL THE DARKEAGLE MAGAZINES ALONE!Because I've been asked so often I will sell the rifle less optic, rings and rail for $900."

Anyway, the gun is painted an army digital camo. The barrel and feed ramp are stripped and polished. It's feeds all bullets I've put through it perfect. WI also stippled the grip in the shape of your hand gripping it. It makes it feel way better than the smooth grips on the factory grips. Don't like it? Paint over it and call the factory and tell em you want a set of grips.  Lol. Hi point customer service is actually awesome. It's a pretty cheap gun for your boat or truck or whatever. Do what you want with it and it will still fire when you want and hit what you shoot at! I'd like to get 140 out of it. That's a little less than what I paid.

It features an 18.5"" barrel with removable extended ported choke, fully adjustable XS ghost ring sights with receiver mounted Picatinny rail, and factory installed magazine extension allowing for 6+1 capacity with 2 3/4"" or 3"" shells. I am the original owner.

Upgrades to the shotgun include the Knoxx SpecOps recoil compensating stock, which is adjustable for length of pull, and drastically reduces felt recoil. The stock includes a PowerPak side shell carrier that holds 5 additional rounds, and can be fitted with the included riser, should the user choose to fit the shotgun with an optic. The forend is the Rubber OverMolded by Hogue, which has the same enhanced grip texture as the Hogue Handall sleeve installed on the stock's pistol grip. The non-receiver-shrouding forend allows for the 6-round TacStar SideSaddle shell carrier to be installed on the left side of the receiver, without interfering with the action. Lastly, a GG&G single-point sling adapter is installed between the receiver and stock for easy use of a single point sling, if the use of the front and rear sling studs is not preferred.

I will include with the sale:
Original stock and forend
Knoxx forend (shrouds the receiver) and extended hex wrench required to swap stocks
RemChoke wrench and Modified choke (factory ported choke tube is Cylinder)
TacStar Flashlight Mount for SideSaddle & TacStar Pressure Switch End Cap for Surefire 6P (pressure switch end slips into Hogue pistol grip sleeve for easy momentary on/off light activation / the light is not included, but can be for an extra $40 - like new Surefire 6P LED)
Original cross-pins removed from receiver for SideSaddle installation, and all hardware required to install (easy return to factory configuration if desired)
