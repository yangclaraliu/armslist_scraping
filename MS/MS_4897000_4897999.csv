The holster is a Remora ITWB holster and I absolutely love it.  There is a little white smudge on it that you can see in the picture but it doesn't effect the functionality whatsoever."

ornady's 2012 introduction of Critical Duty ammo has been met with applause from the law enforcement community. Critical Duty ammunition is designed to perform very well on the stringent FBI protocol tests making this ideally suited for law enforcement as well as personal defense situations.

The biggest thing that differentiates Critical Duty from Hornady's Critical Defense ammo is that Critical Duty ammo is designed to penetrate barriers such as sheet metal, wall board, plywood, heavy clothing, and auto glass as outlined in the FBI protocols. This barrier penetration need is more prevalent in the law enforcement community due to the different types of threats that LE professionals are likely to encounter.

This ammo has performed very well in FBI tests maintaining great weight retention through all barriers helping it to achieve the required 12-18"" of penetration into gelatin after passing through the established barriers. The FlexLock bullet incorporates Hornady's patented Flex Tip that initiates expansion every time while preventing clogging along with their Interlock band that prevents jacket/core separation. Jacket/Core separation is where most non-bonded JHP bullets fail in penetration tests because when the lead core and copper jacket separate from each other their lighter weights aren't able to achieve the needed penetration to bring down an assailant. The Interlock band prevents this occurrence.

Hornady's Critical Duty line of ammo is truly a 21st century duty ammunition!"

This pistol looks and works like new. It's a solid, metal replica that is accurate and feels very satisfying to shoot.  I have probably only put about 6 Umarex Brand CO2 cartridges through it. It has been oiled per the manufacturer’s recommendations, using RWS Air Chamber Lube on the tip of each CO2 cartridge, and RWS Spring Cylinder Oil on the moving parts of the gun. This gun has never been dropped, mishandled, jammed, or had issues of any kind.  It is accurate, and is very fun to shoot.  This gun gets great reviews at PyramydAir, averaging about 4.5 stars with over 80 reviews.


When I Chrony tested the gun, it fired 5 16-shot magazines starting at 444fps and ending at 400fps.  On the sixth magazine, the speed steadily dropped below 400fps.  This means it gets about 80 shots per CO2 cylinder.


Also included are some extras: 

UTG 1x30 Tactical Dot Sight with Red/Green Dot Reticle (Model SCP-RD40RGW-A)
Umarex Universal Airgun Laser Sight
Universal Pistol Tactical Rail Mount (Made of Aluminum)
(1) Full Bottle of 1500 Steel Umarex BB's
(1) Partial Bottle of 1500 Steel Umarex BB's
Plano Double pistol Case

The original H&R firm was in business for over a century from 1871 to 1986.
Frank Wesson started a firearms manufacturing firm in 1859, sharing an early patent with Nathan Harrington. He started a brief partnership in 1871 with his nephew Gilbert Henderson Harrington, as Wesson & Harrington, until Harrington bought him out in 1874.

In 1875 Harrington and another former Wesson employee, William Augustus Richardson, formed the new Harrington & Richardson Company. In 1888 the firm was incorporated as The Harrington & Richardson Arms Company. 

In the 1960s H&R was acquired by the Kidde corporation and run by the Rowe family in Gardner, Massachusetts. The original H&R company went out of business in 1986. A new company, H&R 1871, Inc., was formed in 1991 and started production of revolvers, single-shot rifles and shotguns using original H&R designs. H&R 1871, Inc. assets were subsequently sold to H&R 1871, LLC., a Connecticut LLC owned by Marlin Firearms Company in November 2000. Marlin, including all its H&R assets, was later acquired by Remington Arms Company in December, 2007"

Some facts about the 
different Walther's:
Walther PP vs. PPK vs. PPK/S There are several variants of the Walther PP, the basic story is that the PP has a longer slide and barrel, and a metal backstrap. The PPK is shorter than the PP by 0.6″ and has no metal backstrap, so the grips wrap around the rear. The PPK also has a shorter grip, and the magazines hold one less round. The PPK/S is a combination of the two. It has the shorter barrel and slide of the PPK, but the longer grip of the PP. The original chambering was .32 ACP (or 7.62mm in Europe) but all three variants have also been offered in .380 ACP, .25 ACP and .22 LR.

Dr. No is the first entry in the official James Bond film series and marked the debut of Sean Connery as Agent 007. The 1962 film follows Bond as he investigates the murder of a British agent that leads him to a diabolical scientist who has taken over an entire island for his criminal enterprises. While Bond's signature PPK is mentioned in the film, the actual pistol carried is a Walther PP."

1998 IH Cub Cadet Heavy Duty 3000 series Model HDS3205 Compact Tractor

Have been using flawlessly to cut a 2 acre area around our cabin in KY but on my last cut of the year the PTO belt smoked ( electric PTO ) looks like the belt needs replaced as tension is all the way out on adjustment. 

Has Hydraulic Power Steering
54"" Mid mower Heavy Deck with Hydraulic lift
Rear Diff. Lock , ~350 hrs on meter
Kawasaki V-twin 20 HP engine
Hydrostatic transmission
Starts,runs, drives excellent. 

This is not your standard garden tractor. Heavy sheet metal and undercarriage.They offer small loaders, blades, etc for this unit. Solid deck, no rust.

No tire , engine , or hydraulic leaks. Rear axle has developed a leak that requires half a qt. of fluid after sitting between cuts but functions flawlessly. Will include some extras such as new oil filter, mower deck belt, spare deck rollers, factory owners manual, both keys. 

Newer cost over 6k when purchased new. Brought home this fall but may just buy something new to leave at farm so thought this would make a nice tractor for someone and they can get it ready this winter while the rush is off. Would normally run around 2k but with needing work I'm asking $1100 cash.

Not just is it a TNArms polymer lower, but this is a GHOST / Flame Polished CLEAR lower.  Yes, you can see the whole fire control group while the gun is assembled!  It even already has a pistol kit installed on it.  They are not producing these lowers in clear at the moment, who knows if they will again.  I am asking $280 cash, or will trade!  Since this has been built into a pistol (and stripped lowers require it as well), I must see a CCW or obtain a pistol permit.

Better than Saiga.  Next to be banned?
From an online review:
	""The Molot Vepr 12 isn’t like previous AK platform blasters. It hasn’t been neutered. It isn’t bastardized. In my considered opinion, the Vepr is better than the best Saiga 12 or other AK platform shotguns.""
	""The Vepr 12 is very similar the standard Kalashnikov shotgun. It uses similar parts but works off of a stronger foundation. Built around an RPK receiver, these guns are more or less an AK on steroids. Beyond the thicker steel, these guns also sport other RPK inspirations–notable the handguard and rear sight; the rest is just classic AK design.""

The ideal firearms for security and protective work, where collateral damage (death of bystanders, property damage) are to be kept to zero or close to that. Not quite the old KGB favorite for that purpose, but nearly as accurate and more reliable in function.  Email for more images.  Many of the other guns are under Listings by this User which also is http://www.armslist.com/classifieds/search?relatedto=4574568   Several grips are available, including a LH grip for this gun (Hammerli OEM).  FINAL PRICE depends on which grip you choose.  The listed price is for the P240 in .32 only AS SHOWN.  Price is higher with other grips, or for the complete set, which is $5200 as shown.  The P240 in .38 was the prototype of nearly all the SigArms and SIG Sauer guns that followed. In either caliber, it is quite different from the P210, although there are similarities.  In .32 (the caliber advertised), the gun uses an inertial breech lock, not the dropping barrel lock of the .38 or the SigSauer guns. The frame uses a sloped grip, like the GSP, and not a right angle grip. Trigger is single stage and fixed position, but is adjustable for pull weight and lash.  This gun is one of the best of the .32 available. Not as accurate as the TriAce due to barrel design, it and the GSP are ""second best"" by comparison, but that is a very high comparison mark.  Price is with one magazine. Unfortunately due to slow processing at ATF, others would be obtainable from the commercial market at this time.  Also available are  Steyr Match pistol .22lr (R or LH grip) Full nickel factory plated Walther GSP in .22lr/32,  Hammerli Sig P240 in ALL 3 CALIBER SET (.38, .32, .22lr)--$5200Hammerli 208 S commemorative model $2500 Hammerli 208 with factory safety, 2 magazines $1500 Walther GSP, Walther OSP (all versions, 10"" barrel) $800 to 3600 Hi Standard Victors (Hamden 5.5"" barrels only) $770 up Whitney marked WOLVERINE, & one typical, not wolverine-marked $1200 M96 Swedish Mauser in 6.5x55 with Elit diopter sights, target trigger, and pistol grip, 400 rd Norma sniper/match ammo  Discounts can be applied on request to multiple gun purchases, usually 10% of the higher priced gun or guns, with a few exceptions.  Transfer can be on an IL FOID card after state police approval, or to NH residents with any of the several forms of ID acceptable there. Shipping to FFL holder for transfer also is available. Cost depends on shipping rates, and if receiving FFL holder accepts incoming guns from individuals.   NOT a commercial dealer.  No credit cards, PayPal, and no special orders or requests for guns I do not currently have in my collection.
If you want this gun for pickup in NH, let me know by mid-May.
To avoid confusion, these guns were NOT made by SigSauer. They WERE made by SIG in a sense, when they owned Hammerli. The Caliber is .32S&W-WC. The gun will not fire the standard .32 S&W or .32 ACP cartridges, although some have modified them for .32 ACP. In addition to being superb target guns, some really like them for defense and security work, due to the extreme accuracy and lack of misfeed, and ability to minimize unintended injury. This caliber was a KGB favorite for that use, although the SAKO TriAce was the preferred gun in that caliber. Due to the bullet configuration and low noise, they can be used in ""home based"" target ranges due to the limited backstop required, compared to 9x19 cartridges. Accuracy is much better than the best 9x19 or .45ACP Target gun to about 35 yards. Beyond that, accuracy drops off with this gun, unless slight barrel modification is used."
