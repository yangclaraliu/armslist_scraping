The ACC projects 7.62mm NATO performance in a package of comparable weight and size to many 5.56mm platforms. Barrel and bolt life well exceed the expectation of a lightweight carbine. An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offer the left-handed user the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15 based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternate methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The Drop -In 2-Stage Trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. The 5-slot flash hider reduces ground disturbance and flash, while allowing the attachment of Knight’s QDC suppressors. Pressure ReductionPressure Reduction system is a feature designed to increase control ability and soften the rifle’s perceived recoil. This is achieved by employing unique lengths in our gas tubes and buffer tubes. On the 16” SR25 EC and ECC models we utilize a rifle length gas system coupled with a buffer tube that is ¾” longer than the standard carbine length buffer. In some of the SR15 and SR16 models, KAC employs a similar system of lengthened components to achieve the same result.  By using this setup, the energy released when firing is spread out over more time within the weapon. This helps to relieve vertical kick in addition to a reduction in the rearward recoil force that is absorbed by a shooter’s shoulder. Various parts in the weapon system also see an increase in service life under this system. Our Pressure Reduction system serves to increase reliability and decrease fouling, especially in suppressed usage. Carbon Cutter Bolt CarrierThe Carbon Cutter Bolt Carrier is a system Knight’s developed to help increase reliability and longevity in our rifles, particularly while firing suppressed. The serrated edges along the carrier’s lower edges serve a dual purpose: The first is to pull away any foreign material; the second is to provide an area for lubrication to pool.  The weapon will cycle and physically move the bolt carrier. When this happens, the serrated edges will draw away any foreign material that builds up along its path. This helps to provide a cleaner surface for the weapon to cycle through. The second benefit to those serrations is that they provide an area for lubrication to pool. Lubrication will normally be applied across the flat surface of the carrier and wear off. The slight pooling effect gained by these areas helps to keep the lubrication from wearing off too quickly and reapplies it when the carrier cycles. The overall effect of this Carbon Cutter Bolt Carrier is a cleaner, more reliable weapon over a longer period of time. Ambidextrous ControlsKnight’s Armament designed this system to give shooters the maximum amount of options in their controls. Under this design all of the weapon’s major controls can be accessed from either side of the lower receiver. Left-handed shooters see the immediate benefits of being able to access the weapon’s controls in a more intuitive manner; however, there are a number of other benefits that right-handed shooters will enjoy under this system.  Competition shooters benefit from these controls from the increase of speed that is achieved through components such as the right-side bolt catch. Trainers enjoy the variety of options because they can watch their trainee from either side of the weapon and even manipulate the weapon’s controls from the non-operating side. KAC has also introduced modifications to the design such as the scalloped safety selector switch. This allows a lower profile for the selector switch on the non-operating side of the receiver which helps to relieve any interference between the switch and a shooter’s glove or hand. For the maximum amount of configuration and operation options, Knight’s Ambidextrous Controls offer a sure solution. Two-Stage Match TriggerAll of the weapons available from Knight’s Armament come equipped with a 4.5lb, 2-Stage Match Trigger. This type of trigger mechanism uses a system where, during the rearward squeeze of a trigger, it cycles through two stages of resistance The first stage is a ‘no-poundage’ stage where hardly any resistance is felt during the rear-ward squeeze. There is a center point at which point resistance is felt and the second stage of the trigger begins. At this point, 4.5 pounds of force is required to squeeze the trigger through the second stage and cause the weapon to cycle.  Our 2-stage trigger is meant to inform a shooter of exactly where their weapon is going to fire. This bolsters a firer’s confidence and can also assist in reducing trigger jerk, thereby increasing accuracy. The 4.5lb 2-Stage Trigger from Knight’s Armament is a highly calibrated and smooth component that is sure to be a welcome addition to any setup. Quick Detach CouplerThe Quick Detach Coupler (QDC) line of Sound Suppressors and Muzzle Devices are proprietary items designed for secure interoperability. The coupling device itself consists of multiple ball bearings arrayed in a circular pattern which fit into sockets specifically machined into various muzzle devices to accept the QDC. The bearings are aligned with the sockets by way of a V-shaped notch that seats the device onto an index pin. Once aligned, a simple twist of the outer retaining ring locks the device securely into place.  This system was developed to provide fast and easy operation and interoperability between weapons and suppressors. Knight's QDC line of sound suppressors all feature this method of attachment. Various muzzle devices, such as the QDC Flash Suppressors and the MAMS muzzle break, also feature the QDC pockets to accept sound suppressors equipped with this coupling device. Secure interoperability and intelligent, efficient design are the intended goals of this quick and easy technology. URX 4The URX 4 is a continuous top-rail system that utilizes the Keymod mounting brackets developed by Vltor and Noveske. This rail system is built stronger and more stable than previous designs due to the absence of a removable bottom rail. The modular layout allows an end user to fully customize exactly where to place accessories without the use of specialized tools, small parts, or additional forces applied to the barrel. The URX 4 is currently available for 5.56 rifles in 8.5”, 10”, 13”, and 14.5” lengths, and is equipped with Knight’s unique IBN mounting configuration. The idea was to create a more modular, and thus more serviceable, rail system that still maintains its strength and stiffness. Th IBN system torques the rail onto the weapon and allows the rail to act as the barrel nut. This design was developed to increase stabilization and provide a simpler solution that requires less specialized tools to install and maintain. A full array of modular accessories, iron sights, and panel kits utilizing the Keymod mounting brackets have been developed specifically to accompany this rail system. With the introduction of the URX 4, Knight’s Armament Co. demonstrates its continuing determination to intelligently design effective products.E2 BoltThe E2 bolt's optimized design introduces dual ejectors, providing superior ejection force and consistency whether suppressed or unsuppressed, with a fixed or collapsible stock. Stress riser mitigation in the lug areas of the bolt extends usable life to support frequent high-density use. The gas system is designed to minimize leakage, ensuring more consistent operation in harsh conditions, both with and without a suppressor mounted. A straight gas tube improves efficiency and simplifies installation. The gas block is secured with a locking ring and self-aligns with the barrel, resulting in a more rigid barrel due to the elimination of taper-pin grooves, and does not require individually fit gas blocks or single-use taper-pins.

Bought this upper new but want to trade for a carbine-length upper. The upper has 1095 rounds through it (500 Wolf steel-cased, the rest PMC, Lake City M855, Independence 5.56, and other quality brass-cased ammo). Shoots very well but I want something lighter. 

Upper includes bolt/carrier group, charging handle, and rear sight. Barrel is a heavy profile 1:9 twist, great for stabilizing the common lighter 55gr bullets. Mid-length gas system is softer shooting and easier on components, particularly the bolt.

This is a like new handgun. This gun is extremely clean. Look at the pictures of it taken apart. If you are buying a used gun always ask for pictures of the internal components to verify the stated conidition is true! If a seller refuses do not buy the gun, they are hiding something! 

I purchased this gun march 2015 and after taxes and transfer fees paid, it was close to $600 from Cabelas. Taxes add up quick when you buy a gun new! 

There is no fouling, the gun is well oiled and it has been cared for well. The gun comes with a case, the normal lock, two 17 round clips and a few grip adjusters. 

I am willing to consider trades. Feel free to shoot me an email. 

Please Local Buyers only - If you have cash and are over 18 the gun is yours, it is that simple. I'm asking 450 or best offer. No additional tax or hidden fees! 450 flat, and this remarkable American made, time proven reliable pistol is yours.

Reposting due to the many who flagged due to me not selling to them. Have a CCW permit or purchase permit from the local Sheriff's Office or face an illegal arms sale. Plain and simple!

I am military and law enforcement and will not sell unless you meet these requirements. With that, this is a G23 in great condition and we less than 500 rounds pushed through her. Originally purchased for home protection that spent most of its life in a drawer and was fired once a year. Great condition and will make a good weapon for conceal or home protection.

You will obtain all stock items to include: G23, case, cleaning kit, speed loader, booklet, two magazines, with ammo in the magazines as well as a full box of Gold Dot hollow points. All this values for over $550, as you gunsmiths know, this is a great deal but willing to part with for $400 firm!

Not looking to make a profit, but am looking to ensure it is sold legally, and I will not allow low ball offers or trades. Again, you must have a CCW permit or purchase permit to which I will make a bill of sale thereafter."

====================================
As many of you know our Dear Leader banned Russian imports with a stroke of his pen. Major bummer. But don’t feat – you can get one right here and right now, because I am selling my Saiga 223. It is brand new. Eats both .223 and 5.56 ammo.
I added an optional Molot factory “Dragunov style” stock, just so *you* can look bad a$$ at the range.

My Saiga comes with additional “Monte Carlo” Molot stock, *one* 5 round mag, box, papers, cleaning rod, oil can, etc.

HOW MUCH - $649. You get the rifle with second stock, as in the picture. Hi-cap magazine, scope mount and red dot have been sold. I can probably come up with another red dot for $50

BOTTOM LINE: It's a *very* good deal. Second stock alone was 80$. No shipping, no FFL paperwork, no tax.  TRADES possible

The pistol comes with Sig night sights and it has a rail for accessories. I also added Hogue Extreme G10 checkered grips and had a gunsmith install Sig's Short Reset Trigger kit. The pistol comes with two additional eight round magazines for a total of four mags.

In addition, the pistol comes with the stock Hogue rubber grips, the stock trigger reset parts, and the case, owner's manual, and lock. It came with Sig's short reach trigger installed.

This pistol is an off-roster firearm in good ol' California. I'm asking $1000 cash and buyer pays $35 transfer fee at an FFL in the Vallejo area. Feel free to email with any questions, and thanks for checking out my post."

This gun was made when Kimber still put out high quality 1911s. This 1911 is the most reliable I've ever seen. It truly will eat any 45 acp that you load into the magazine. I did carry this weapon daily for years on the job as my primary weapon. The finish shows slight signs of holster wear and just being used. I've put many rounds through this weapon and have always meticulously maintained it. It is definitely no safe queen, however will out preform guns twice it's price on today's market. The sights are nothing fancy but they are very precise. The trigger in this weapon is light with a very crisp break and has the ability to adjust the over travel. If the white letters aren't your thing I have no problem removing then before purchase. If your in the market for a 1911 you will get a lot of bang for your buck here. The gun is being sold with a el paso saddlery holster and a thumb break leather holster that I can't remember the brand. It comes with 1 Wilson mag, 3 (or 4 if I can find the last one) Kim pro tac mags, 1 10 round pro mag, and the mag that came with the gun. I have several mag pouches that will come with the gun as well. I also have a 22 conversion with two mags that will come with the weapon. Total cost of everything here is around 1400$ new"

Rare military collectible. Is one in your collection?  
This bayonet is new as manufactured and still wrapped in its protective hard wax coating over probable Suncorite finish from the factory. Which factory is unknown because it is still sealed. One report stated that fewer than 25,000 were coated because of the prohibited high cost. They went back to just wax paper wrapping. I removed it from the original paper wrapping (included), but I will not remove the protective coating to see the factory name and date. To me that would just ruin the collectability and value, but the new owner can remove the coating if they want to do so.
This is not a reproduction. A No.9 scabbard is not included – it is bayonet only.
