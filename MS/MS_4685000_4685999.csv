Rifle has approximately 15-20 rounds through it.  I tried to be an artist and did a ""custom"" Pine Camo job on the rifle for fun.  The action/scope and everything else mechanical was taped off but my sniper paint job is a bit scratched from last deer season...Brand new, the rifle was $275.00.  Brand new, the Nikon scope was $285.00

The trigger is totally acceptable and predictable on these rifles and they are pretty accurate.

Thank you for looking.

$450 Firm.   The gun has barely been shot.  It is accurate and doesn't kick too bad at all for anyone.  I could shoot it all day I guess but I probably wouldn't want to.

An extra frame for parts, stock blinkers, lights, air filters, a set of HID headlights I never installed NIB and other parts for the bike. I also have a bike cover that will go as well. The bike will also come with a bike stand/lift for oil changes and working on the bike. 

The motorcycle just had an oil change, air filter charge, spark plug change, and radiator flush. Tires have less than 1000 miles on them. This bike is ready to ride. This is the perfect bike for anyone who is looking for their first motorcycle. It has a salvage title, the prior owner dropped it in the garage and bent the exhaust can and an engine mount. Repairing the engine mount means taking the bike completely to the frame. Due to labor costs it was salvaged by the insurance company. I bought it and spent 300 in parts to fix it. All fixes were done in a professional body shop. Everything was fixed to new condition. While it was being fixed we custom painted the entire bike. Send your best offer. This bike is amazing once you ride it you will see."

Swedish Lahti m40 9mm Pistol. Stock # MMH282003. Serial # 429xx. This is a 9MM Swedish Model m40 9mm semi-auto pistol, sometimes referred to as a “Lahti” Pistol. Made in Sweden by Husqvarna, this was the standard Swedish Military sidearm from the 1940’s to Post-WWII. The Lahti is a unique semi-auto pistol, in that the trigger has an accellerator in it that allows the pistol to be fired in sub-zero conditions. The pistol has a blue factory finish and brown plastic checkered factory grips with the Hsqvarna logo. There are faint importers markings on the right front of the receiver, the Husqvarna markings are crisp and legible. The magazine is not marked. The pistol has heavy holster wear, wear on the grip straps, service marks, and there is a large spot of discoloration on top of the slide. The grips show minimal wear. The pistol has a nice, crisp bore, good rifling, and a smooth trigger pull. We do not have a box, holster, or any other accessories for this gun."

The Barrett MRAD rifle’s user changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun’s modularity. The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply unscrewing two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens This unique design paves the way for future caliber interchangeability and serviceability at the user level.

The Barrett MRAD also boasts Barrett’s new trigger module that is easily accessed for maintenance adjustment and replacement. This match grade trigger is drop fire proof and combat ready. The thumb operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld.

Integrated into the Barrett MRAD rifle’s 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a Picatinny M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper. At 21.75 inches the rail offers plenty of space for in line night vision devices. Configurable side and bottom rails allow for mounting a number of other accessories.

The Barrett MRAD rifle’s stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed stock rifle creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. When folded the stock latches around the bolt handle for added security during transport. Because the stock folds to the bolt handle side of the action the rifle is the same width overall folded or extended. Made of a temperature resistant polymer the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle to user contact point. The rifle’s length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. From its multi-positional quick-detach sling sockets to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color of the rifle that blends into any environment-every detail of the Barrett MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own.

We live in a world of uncertainty where conflicts can ignite overnight. We face uncertain days with new challenges thrust upon us like never before in the history of this country. Not all challenges come from abroad. Civil unrest can cause a flash point where the only line between armed chaos and the average citizen is Law Enforcement. When this happens the individuals called upon need weapons that are reliable and effective. That's exactly what we had in mind when we introduced the GRP.

The GRP comes ready for duty and built to stand up to rigorous use that is required to keep professionals proficient in their skills. Tough micarta Gator Grips are standard as well as a lanyard loop integrated into the mainspring housing. The forged slide stop axle is cut flush with the frame and the frame is chambered around it for easy removal. Heinie Slant-Pro Night Sights or Three Dot Night Sights are standard features.

The Global Response Pistol is a fighting gun plain and simple and is ready for duty wherever it is called upon to perform. If you are looking for a home defense weapon that meets these requirements then the GRP is the ultimate solution.

This semi-automatic rifle proved itself well during World War II, but in the late 1950s it was considered outdated and obsolete and the Italian military also wanted a new rifle chambered for the NATO-standard 7.62×51mm round. To meet these requirements, Beretta designed the BM59, which was essentially a rechambered M1 fitted with a removable 20-round magazine, folding bipod and a combined flash suppressor/rifle grenade launcher. The BM59 is capable of selective fire. The BM59 was adopted in 1959 and served with Italian, Argentinian, Indonesian, and Moroccan armies. In the early 1980s, semi-automatic versions were imported to the United States and sold to private collectors."

This particular rifle is Model 1903-A3 made by Smith Corona Typewriter Company back in January 1944. Subcontractor barrels give high collector value to these 234,580 rifles. Serial numbers 3608000 to 3707999 and 4708000 to 4992000 carry the Smith-Corona name on the receiver ring.
It had been assembled by Smith Corona with 4-groove barrel manufactured by High Standard. Those barrels proved to be very accurate, and I did 1/2 inch groups at 50 yards bench rest with my target hand loads. Other guns have 2-groove barrels.
It is hard to come across gun like this these days, as contemporary hunters and shooting enthusiasts value the rifle for its beauty, dependability, and adaptability for almost all U.S. game animals, and with proper gunsmithing, the M1903 makes a wonderful sporting rifle, comparing favorably with many modern firearms. Authentic examples of Smith-Corona rifles, especially with excellent barrels are uncommon for sell, and are in collector's hands.
This rifle has excellent bore, chamber and muzzle. Absolutely no rust or corrosion. No cracks or splits in the wooden parts. Inspector's cartouche is by EmcF. It has small Ordnance Escutcheon and a circled serif ""P"" is present inside the pistol grip. It is hard to create a clear photo image from the right side of stock. Bolt extractor has ""S"" marks and Bolt has square Safety Lug, Arrowhead on top of Bolt Handle and single Digit under Bolt Handle (this is normal for Smith-Corona bolts). Receiver is marked ""US Smith-Corona 03-A3 and serial number), Barrel is marked ""S C"" over ""Flaming Bomb"" and ""8 43"".Butt plate is Smith-Corona, and is checkered with 11 lines per inch.

I have a 2001 Jeep Cherokee Limited for sale, it has a few cosmetic issues such as paint will be needed at some point and a windshield is also needed. As far as mechanical issues it may need new shocks or something in the front, it shakes a little but when you apply the brakes at 50MPH only. I am not a mechanic so I am unsure of what it actually is. It has 181,123 miles on it and it runs great. This jeep would be perfect for someone who wants to make an off road or a wheelin vehicle. I have attached the pictures on it, I am asking $2,500.00 OBO for the Jeep, the Kelly Blue Book is $3,826 in fair condition which I believe it is. I am asking below the price since it does need a little bit of work and I understand it wont bring that price. It has a clean title and can be signed over to the buyer that day. I can also add more pictures if needed and email them to you as I can only upload three on here. Please let me know if you have any questions or offers."

As pictured, the gun comes with the box and all accessories along with 5, 13 round magazines. Only one of the mags has been used - the rest are brand new. 

If interested, initially respond to this and then we can talk. I'm willing to meet in a public place in Indy, preferably on the Northwest side of town but I'm flexible. To avoid any potential internet funny business I'll be driving a police car (I'm a cop). $525.

I purchased this pistol brand new from Point Blank in Blue Ash on 9/7/15. If you have purchased a firearm at Point Blank before you know that two associates will double check the serial numbers and so forth before finalizing your paperwork. Unfortunately, after I made it home with said firearm I noticed the slide serial number on this brand new firearm was different than the barrel, frame, and case all of which match. Needless to say Point Blank told me tough luck however Glock will fix this issue if you send the firearm in as the slide was placed with the wrong firearm. The firearm IS new and was unfortunately a mix up at the factory according to Glock. Having said all of that I am selling this at a cheaper price (my loss is your gain) and moving on. Again, it is brand new never used and I have the receipt to prove purchase. I also have a new in box Galco KingTuk holster that I will throw in for an additional $40 that cost me $60 new. Buyer must meet in either Middletown or Mason (I will be in both places today) cash only, present ID at time of sale, and all local and federal laws apply. My price is 100% firm at $400 or $440 with the holster. If interested please reply to ad or for faster response text me at REDACTED (no phone calls please). Thanks for looking"

I'm looking for someone that truly knows what they're doing to spend a few hours with me teaching me what I need to know to be a safe and decently-skilled shooter.  I know the ranges have teachers, but they're $100/hr. and that's unaffordable.  I am looking for someone who will spend 2-3 hrs. with me for a reasonable charge.  I'm a smart guy and I pay attention, so in a few hours I should be able to get the basics back.  From there, practice will make perfect."

It has the following features:
- 16.1” target bull barrel
- improved trigger group
- Hogue Overmolded stock

In addition, I have added the following accessories:
- Fully adjustable GI-style aperture sights from Tech Sights
- Volquartsen extended magazine release
- Volquartsen bolt release (allows you to pull back slightly on the bolt handle to release the bolt)

If you would rather use this rifle with optics, a Weaver rail is included -- just remove the screws securing the rear sight to the receiver and install the rail. The front sight is pretty much permanently attached, however.

I’m also including the factory 10 round magazine and a Ruger 25-round magazine.

This rifle is perfect for a Project Appleseed shoot (just needs a sling) or as a general purpose compact target rifle that doesn’t have the length and bulk of the other Ruger target models.

Price is $400 firm. Cash only, no trades. Can meet in the central Knoxville area."

This is the QA model, striker fired but with a decocker (google it if you're not sure.  It will NOT fire when ""decocked"" unlike the P99 SA or other models. You must rack the slide a small amount, like 1/4 of an inch for it to reset.)  Nice smooth trigger, not too light that you have to worry about but light enough to be super accurate.  I have enjoyed this pistol, I have personally put about 150 rounds through it but I have no idea the true round count.  It has some holster wear on the slide but is 100% solid and reliable.  It has been carried daily by me, and probably by whoever owned it prior.  This is fully made in Germany, with all the appropriate maker's marks on the slide and the frame, and the import engraving for Smith & Wesson on the slide.  The barrel is a Jarvis barrel.

Comes with original plastic box, two 10 round Walther magazines and some standard capacity magazines if you are LE.  Also comes with over 500 rounds of 9mm, some HP, the rest factory target. No reloads! Maybe more, I'll have to count them all up. 

I'm ONLY looking to trade this for a Smith & Wesson M&P WITH manual thumb safety. I would consider any caliber, compact or full size, but must have the manual safety.  IDEALLY I would prefer the 45c, and I would be willing to kick in some cash for the right trade.

I would consider other semi autos with manual safeties, try me. Not looking for any Ruger SR series. I like them, but that's not what I want this time around, thanks.

For those of you who are new to firearms, Glock makes excellent pistols. They have their haters but it's all bs. Glocks are extremely reliable well built guns. They aren't as pretty as some other guns but if you are looking for something that goes boom every time, is lightweight, and is easy to maintain, Glocks are excellent pistols. I will never part with two of my Glocks. I say this having owned 50+ pistols including Colts, Sigs, Kimbers, Springfields, Smith and Wessons, Rugers, Kahr, etc.  

New Condition Polish Tantal AK74: Very pleasant AK to shoot. In a sense, the AK 74 is the Soviet block's version of the .223. Cheap ammo. I purchased this gun because I wanted a high capacity rifle that had the simple takedown of an AK but the pleasant recoil of an AR-15. I paid $650 for this rifle and am firm on this price.

General Description: 3” gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun that allows you to shoot light target loads to heavy pheasant loads. Removable choke system that uses Beretta® Mobile threads includes four extended choke tubes (SK, IC, M, F), choke box and choke wrench. “TriStar Select” Turkish Walnut stock and forearm with cut checkering and semi-gloss finish. Adjustable comb, raised target rib, middle bead and fiber optic front sight. Rubber recoil pad, backed with a five-year mechanical warranty.

Features:
• Manual E-Z Load Magazine Cut-Off
• Raised Target Rib w/ Matted Sight Plane
• Middle Bead and Fiber Optic Sight
• 5 Round Magazine – Shot Plug Included
• Quick Shot Plug Removal
• Chrome-lined Chamber and Barrel
• Adjustable Comb
• “TriStar Select” Turkish Walnut w/ adjustable comb (Select Wood is hand-picked!!)
• 4 Extended Beretta® Mobile Style Choke Tubes (SK, IC, M, F)

Action: Gas operated semi-automatic. Bolt remains open after last round is fired. If magazine and chamber are both loaded, opening action will result in ejecting shell from chamber and cycling new shell from magazine into the chamber. If operator desires to unload the chamber only, slightly push lifter up and open action. This cuts the magazine off from cycling a new shell while unloading the chamber. Chamber will remain closed though.

Safety: The primary safety is located on the backside of the trigger guard. When engaged, the safety is designed to block the trigger, hammer lever and the hammer which makes the firing mechanism immobile.

Magazine: Tubular magazine; bottom loading. Shot plug is included and comes installed. Shot plug is easily removable by unscrewing the magazine cap. Simply pull plug out and replace magazine cap.

""TriStar Viper G2 Sporting
Few companies—arguably none—are as good at offering more value for the money than TriStar. The Turkish-made Viper G2 Sporting features a 30-inch ported barrel with extended choke tubes, a raised target rib and a magazine cut-off button. Its furniture includes an adjustable comb with decent wood quality. Those features are available at a price that leaves plenty of cash left over for range fees and shells. """

DB-15 pistol with 2 mags(-700$)
That adds up to about 950ish dollars new.
I am asking 625$ cash for the whole package or trade for 720$ value
Or I'll take an even 500$ for just the AR pistol with no sights or sling.
