The jet funnel magazines have been stored with the base plates removed as to not keep excess pressure on the springs, the other magazines were all stored intact and unloaded.

The Novac front sight does rub on the upper portion of the inside of the holster due to its height, but i wanted something to keep it in at the range.

Nicely balanced, minimal recoil, comes back on target very quickly.   This is one smooth shooting piece.  Minimal wear on it, always properly cleaned and lubricated before and after shooting. Clearly if your a NYS Resident you CAN NOT own most of these magazines.  I will only sell them to a LEO with proper ID, sale through local FFL only.  Please don't bother haggling over the price, these get listed for sale quite infrequently, and when they do its at this price point without the extras...  Questions? More pictures?

Up for Trade is my Troy-Built XP Zero Turn Mower 42in. I purchased it 3 years ago and has less then 30hrs (22.9hrs) run time on it so basically still new. I serviced the mower regularly and winterized it ever year. Its been stored in the garage and has never been left outside. I also replaced the battery this year since it 3 years old. The only reason I'm selling it is because I really don't use it as much as someone else could. With my yard size I can get away with something smaller. Brand new this Zero Turn cost about $2499 I would ace a Trade Value of $1500 on this but I am willing to negotiate. Not looking for anything specific and open to any firearms. Let me know what you have and we can go from there. Thanks for looking. You can message me here or text me at REDACTED"

Want to keep your front sight post because you like the security of OEM taper pins? Want to de-clutter your hand guard? This rail allows all of this in a free-floating rail.

The unique 2 piece design does not require removal of front sight or flash hider. Locks up tight. Has front QD swivels built in. Troy makes a host of accessories for these. Provides about 14.5"" of handguard instead of the 9"" that is typical of a midlength. Very lightweight.

This is in used condition. Has a few very minor scratches from being used on hunting trips. Has some blue loctite on the bolts. Nothing you wouldn't expect from a rail that has been installed. MSRP is in the $230 range. Save some bucks for more ammo. The only reason I am changing rails is because I am running a lower power optic and get a shadow from the FSB. I'll have to chop my sight. Since that's the case, I need a different rail."

The new Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, V9 Lightweight is approximately five ounces lighter than the standard V9. It's designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications. The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Light Weight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

Carbine Conversion Unit
A revolutionary accessory that will change the way you see your pistol!

What exactly is the CCU system? It is an 'upper' for an autoloading pistol. Shown below is a photo of a basic unit and fixed stock. You can add any number of accessory items to the basic unit, such as sights, adjustable stocks and additional rail systems. Start by going to our web page for your pistol type. The CCU is not a firearm and requires no special licensing to purchase. Under federal law (BATFE) it is perfecty legal to install a pistol lower and then remove the lower and reassemble the pistol. (see forum and FAQ pages for details) The unit comes completely assembled and test fired.
The above is from the Mech Tech site.



All CCU's have a 16"" barrel. The basic unit is NOT a firearm and needs no special licensing to purchase! What do you need? You need a Glock, 1911 or XD/XD(M) pistol. What do you need to do? Field strip your pistol. This will separate the 'top end' assembly from the frame or 'lower'.

This unit is for the 1911 .45acp caliber.
Comes as shown with optic, and case - does not include the 1911 lower. This is 'a fun 1911 accessory.

Listed manufacturer as Colt but it is Mech Tech out of Montana."

It's the best balancing and feeling Buckmark you will ever handle and I can't tell any difference in accuracy between the 4"" and the 5.5"" barrel.  I built two of these and now realize I only need one. Pistol has had about 50 rounds through it for testing only, NEW condition, there is not a single blemish on this beautiful little pistol. Prever a local deal but could ship it, comes with factory case, lock and all paperwork as new. One factory mag included. More pictures available upon request, could only put one up in the ad...

Different sights, grip safety and more cast parts to keep cost down. Mine is the earlier more desireable model. It is in excellent condition having spent much of its life in the original case.

Finish is also the correct to a rearsenal too and both slide and Frame  match in color. It has a flat MPH, milled trigger, and doesn't have the relief cuts. For this reason RIA marked the right side M1911 US army instead of the Normal M1911A1 US army. This is correct because the pistol doesn't meet the true A1 configuration.
