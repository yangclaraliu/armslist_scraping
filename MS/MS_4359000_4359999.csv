THE BARRETT REC-7 5.56 with Barrett Soft Sided Case For Sale with Trijicon Scope- Trijicon TA31 TA31RCOM1 ACOG 4x32mm RCO Scope -  

THE REC-7 Gun and Soft Sided Tactical Case only ($2,000) 

ELIMINATE ALL DOUBT.
Compact, accurate and completely trustworthy, the REC7 is designed specifically for situations in which there’s no room for error. Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life.

This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine.

The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance.

The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.

The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance.

At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance.

The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 Class 2 hardcoat anodized and Cerakote finished. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle.

Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using
fiber optics which collect ambient light. The ACOG combines traditional,
precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. The ACOG has many
features which are very advantageous for military use. Designed for use
with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was
chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all
lighting conditions, without failure prone batteries.

THE GUN: (MA COMPLIANT) Selling for $10,500 (gun only) (Paid $13,500)

A WHOLE NEW LEGEND.
It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor (MA Compliant), this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor (MA Compliant).

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

It does have some ware on the back of the slide, but it doesn't affect the shooting at all.

The gun is in excellent condition and shows almost no use. Included with the 22/45 is two 10Rd mags, box, lock, and all factory literature. Great deal on this firearm!No other .22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger Mark III pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 .45 caliber pistol. The 22/45 Lite has an aircraft-grade aluminum upper that's ventilated or fluted, making the pistol extremely lightweight. The 4.4-inch stainless barrel sleeve is kept in place by a tension nut, ensuring the same accuracy and reliability of the Ruger 22/45 line. The barrel is threaded 1/2""-28 for popular muzzle accessories with a thread protector supplied. The 22/45's integral cylindrical bolt construction ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving slide designs. The comfortable, precision-molded Zytel polymer grip frame has a serrated front strap and backstrap. The accurate sighting system features precision-adjustable rear and fixed front sights and a drilled and tapped receiver for the included Weaver-style scope base adapters. Ruger's patented loaded chamber indicator provides visual and tactile indication that the chamber is loaded and the magazine disconnect prevents discharge when the magazine has been removed. Other features include: a contoured ejection port, easy-to-grasp tapered bolt ears, and a conveniently located push-button magazine release on the left side of the frame.Come check this pistol out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte.

Hey all, 
I have a classic Hunting rifle for sale. This is a Remington 742 Woodsmaster chamber in the hard hitting 30-06 Springfield. This will come with sling mounts installed and a little bit of AMA ammunition. This is already tapped for a scope mount and i ready for you to get a scope setup mounted on it and sighted in with plenty of time before hunting season! I would keep this for myself, but I just picked up a 308 and would prefer to have something else. This is in good overall condition and actually even has the internal plastic “dust cover” on the bolt that most of these do not have any longer (this one is cracked, but still present and functional). Needs a good deep cleaning. Has normal ""sat In a Safe a while"" light spot rusting in the barrel and elsewhere, but would clear easily with scrubber or by shooting it once. Haha. Need to meet up in norman on this if possible. 
I am wide open for trades on this. Preferably no 22’s, blackpowders, or shotguns unless it is heavily in my favor. (I already have plenty of these that I do not shoot enough haha). Mostly interested in semi auto rifles, certain lever rifles, semi-auto pistols, compact revolvers and boot, PF9 and boot, DB9 and boot, compact 45s, 1911’s in 45. Would trade with a little boot for certain ARs, AK pistols, AKs, PMR30s, etc. Just shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here and we can go from there. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

Has factory iron sights, professional trigger work to 3 lbs, Cerakote (black graphite), there is evidence of pitting on the barrel which was removed completely before the Cerakote finish, stock was refinished, aftermarket recoil pad added.

The tires are old but hold air, the guy i bough it from had it stolen from him years ago only to have it returned by the police almost 8 years later. I have the title. Neighbor kid did spray paint the fenders and tank the wrong color.  I cannot express enough about how well this bike runs, almost seems like its new."
