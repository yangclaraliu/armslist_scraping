I bought the gun new at Florida Gun Exchange last year and have shot 200 rounds through it flawlessly. I replaced the resin wood chip stock with a hard to find and expensive orginal beech wood stock which was used on the first issued vz58s in the 50s. 
I was suprised how well Century Arms put this thing together concidering their past. The AK74 brake makes it a comfortable shooter even with the folding stock.

Beretta quality plus affordability for the Sporting Clays Enthusiast !
Steelium Plus Barrels (both 30"" and 32"" in Stock)
Inspired by the Steelium Pro barrels of the DT11 and thanks to a conical profile 5.5 times longer than the 682 Gold, the new Steelium Plus barrels give outstanding pattern quality and precision, improved recoil reduction and reduced muzzle raise. The much longer forcing cone is the key to the improvement in the barrel’s overall performance. At the beginning of the Steelium era, all of the competition barrels had a similar conic profile of approximately 2.6” on a 30” barrel. With the development of the new Beretta 692, Steelium Plus defines a new standard for competition shotgun barrels by lengthening the forcing cone to ~14” on a 30” barrel.  The longer forcing cone provides better patterns, less muzzle raise, and faster target acquisition on follow-up for the 2nd shot. 
Wider Receiver
The new Beretta 692 features a 1.3mm (1/2”) wider receiver than the 682 Gold, improving handling and control. This wider receiver adds a small amount of weight for better balance, providing more stability and better handling before and after each shot. 
The wider receiver is also adorned in a technical yet elegant design. Polished metal surfaces pair with matte finish and “black gold” engraving highlight the unmistakable lines of a Beretta Over / Under with an attractive new design. The selectable safety features a two selector showing which barrel is ready to fire first, while the ergonomic over molded opening lever combines form and function. The stock (with optional

 I purchased this gun in 2004 or 2005. When I purchased it, it  included the LEM trigger, 3 magazines and factory night sights. The owner of the gun shop told me that it was a law enforcement package. It did not come with any documentation stating this, but from what I can tell, most P2000's don't come with night sights from the factory and only include 2 magazines.
I bought this gun for concealed carry, but was too used to a 1911 and only carried it a few times. It has only had a few boxes of ammo through it.

One is new still in bag and the other was taken out on 2 occasions and shows very little wear.

This was copy and pasted from Midway.com:

The MidwayUSA Heavy Duty Shooting Mat Gun Case brings together two shooting essentials into one convenient package.  This design combines our popular tactical rifle cases with our shooting mats to form a great rifle transportation and shooting platform.  The interior gun case has hook-&-loop fastener retention straps to secure your rifle with a muzzle sleeve to prevent debris from entering the muzzle.  Padded backpack straps on the rear of the case give you an easy and comfortable carry option to go along with a heavy duty carry handle.  The gun case body is padded throughout to give your precision rifle the support and protection it needs during transport.  When you arrive at your desired shooting location, simply unfold the case and remove your rifle from the retention straps.  The case then becomes a shooting mat with four corner loops to stake down the mat preventing lift from muzzle blast or wind.   





Six MOLLE webbing straps are located inside the gun case providing space for attachments for your shooting accessories.  Two outer pockets are located on the front of the case with five rows of MOLLE webbing inside each of them hold ammunition or any additional gear you may need on the range.  An exterior storage pouch contains the included stakes to hold down your shooting mat while in use.  Rugged material along with heavy duty zippers ensure this shooting mat gun case will stand up to a variety of shooting situations and environments that you may find yourself in. The Shooting Mat Gun Case is the best of both worlds by eliminating the need to bring a shooting mat along with your gun case and rifle to the range."

You will never get a new retail price for it and you are wasting your time and other people's time as well.  Used guns sell for less then their new counterparts.  I don't care if it was used just once or twice.  So don't put an idiotic price on it hoping it someone is stupid enough to buy it.

I shot some with that, then put the small backstrap on and that felt better to me. So the small one is currently on it but changing out the backstraps is very easy.

Gun is great, only selling because I prefer Glock 19-sized or larger handguns. The P99C is similar to a Glock 26 in size. If you research this gun you'll find overwhelmingly positive reviews, and from how I've been able to shoot it (70 flawless, accurate rounds) then if no one buys then I'm just fine with keeping it.

You Can Never Be Too Prepared. The Ruger SP101® revolver boasts the strength to handle the powerful 357 Magnum cartridge in a controllable, small-framed double-action revolver. Among the most powerful small-frame revolvers on the market, they are engineered for solid performance. Featuring a recoil-reducing grip, the SP101® is comfortable to shoot and perfect for personal defense or field use. Strong and reliable shot after shot, all SP101® revolvers have solid steel sidewalls (no side-plates), making them rugged, reliable, and dependable. This one is Double-Action-Only (DAO) defensive weapon.  Great for concealment or to be carried in a purse.
I am the original owner and have the original box  and all that came with it.  I have fired maybe 35 round through it.  It is in excellent near new condition.  I am reducing the herd since I have not carried this or shot it in over 1 year. 

Great concealed/defensive weapon for a man or women !!

$550 Cash, gun and original box only; $575 with 50 rounds of range target ammo and an in-the-waist holster.  TRADES ACCEPTED.  I will not respond to low ball offers.

With a 25 year track record of reliability, durability and performance in the field, P-Series pistols are simple, economical, and serviceable and can be counted on to perform in adverse conditions. The P345 is designed to be easily maintained and can be field-stripped into five major subassemblies for cleaning, without the need for special tools. Its black, custom-compounded polymer grip frame has a built-in picatinny rail to accept modern lights and lasers to keep your sighting options open and also features contoured and checkered grip panels, front-strap, and backstrap. The P345's high-visibility 3-dot sight system is drift adjustable on both the front and the rear for faster, more precise target acquisition while its manual safety is ambidextrous and within easy reach of either thumb. Its rugged slide is made of Ruger's proprietary Terhune Anticorro stainless steel. Two 8-round magazines and a hard plastic case included 

I am the original owner and have the original box with all the items that came from Ruger.  This weapon is in excellent condition and comes with an additional Ruger magazine making a total of 3 Ruger magazines.  The ramp has also been polished and I have about 125 rounds through it with the only issue of problems traced to bad crimped reloads not allowing the bullet to fully seat.

You Can Never Be Too Prepared. The Ruger SP101® revolver boasts the strength to handle the powerful 357 Magnum cartridge in a controllable, small-framed double-action revolver. Among the most powerful small-frame revolvers on the market, they are engineered for solid performance. Featuring a recoil-reducing grip, the SP101® is comfortable to shoot and perfect for personal defense or field use. Strong and reliable shot after shot, all SP101® revolvers have solid steel sidewalls (no side-plates), making them rugged, reliable, and dependable. This one is Double-Action-Only (DAO) defensive weapon.  Great for concealment or to be carried in a purse.
I am the original owner and have the original box  and all that came with it.  I have fired maybe 35 round through it.  It is in excellent near new condition.  I am reducing the herd since I have not carried this or shot it in over 1 year. 

Great concealed/defensive weapon for a man or women !!

This rifle can and will be shipped to your doorstep!
The Gras rifle is an example of military equipment that reached legendary status in Modern Greece. Despite the fact that it could fire only one shot at a time, its robustness and lethality made it a favourite weapon of guerilla fighters for 70 years, from the local revolts against the Ottoman Empire to the resistance against the Germans.

I was VERY lucky to find one of these in the Cavalry Carbine configuration! Being roughly 125 years old, she has held her age well as you can see from the pictures. What's REALLY amazing is that the whole rifle still matches after all this time! The bolt pieces, receiver, and stock all have matching numbers! What's even MORE mindblowing is the bore is as shiny as a brand new rifle with strong rifling (I'm not making that up either...after cleaning her up I couldn't believe how the bore looked!).
This rifle is in full working order and comes with the original sling as well. You'll notice that the front brass cap on the stock is missing and so is the cleaning rod. Complete, these have been selling for 650-700 on lately on the collector market but because of these two missing pieces, i have lowered the price."

This was built by me on an unfired(as far as i could tell) crate 91/30. My father and I have been gunsmithing for 20 years  and I'm an experienced machinist. The scope mount, balancing, and muzzle brake are all one-offs meaning i machine the gun, blueprint it, then make the mating pieces accordingly. The trigger job is the best ive done on a nagant, not to brag but its damn good. The paint job is your standard green,brown,tan,black matte hand delieved via spray bomb and a bale of straw. This gun was built to use and it has been shot about 150 times by me with different optics for my own testing purposes. I wont post pics of shot patterns because im a better shot than some and a worse shot than most. Can include 100 to 800 rounds of 147gr bulgarian, berdan primed ammo in 100 round increments for the right offer. . 419-769-5five8eight text preferred"
