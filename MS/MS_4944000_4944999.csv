At across-the- room distances, an open-choked scattergun loaded with 00 buckshot is ideal in my opinion. Even loaded with lighter birdshot, these guns remain highly effective, and the pellets aren’t as likely to penetrate walls and shouldn’t endanger those in the next room.While you have several action choices, my money is on the slide-action pump. Pump guns designed for tactical use typically have tubular magazines containing six (sometimes more) shells. It takes only a little practice to fire these shells in rapid succession. Another point to consider is the deterrent effect the distinctive “shuck-shuck” sound a pump gun makes when chambering a shell. It would take a determined (or drugged-out) assailant to ignore that chilling noise and keep on coming. Unfortunately, many home-invasion robberies are carried out under the influence of meth or other intoxicants. If you’re a potential victim in these circumstances, shooting is often the only answer to avoid personal injury or even death. That’s when you want a tactical shotgun in your hands and to be willing and ready to use it.Pump guns are noted for their reliability. You can depend on a manually operated pump, which is comforting when lives are on the line. In the unlikely event of a misfire, cycling the slide will quickly have you back in business. Slide-action shotguns have been the weapon of choice in countless military actions over the years. While their usefulness is limited to short-range en-counters, there’s nothing better for close combat.Shotguns were famously used as “trench guns” in World War I, where fighting was often done in the confined quarters of a sandbagged trench or bunker. Highly prized for their fast-handling deadliness, shotguns also saw service against Japanese forces in the Pacific Islands during WWII, where hand-to-hand combat was often the deciding factor. More recently, tactical shotguns have been employed in Iraq and Afghanistan. No other type of weapon has a longer record of proven battlefield success.Tactical shotguns have long been part of the arsenal police cruisers regularly carried in the trunks or slotted alongside the front seat. As close-range weapons, shotguns have no equal. They’ve proven themselves time and time again for well over a century, and their effectiveness has never been challenged. In the 19th century, stagecoach guards were typically armed with double-barreled shotguns, which were favored over rifles for keep-ing bandits at bay. These twin-tubed scatterguns could be considered the first “tactical” firearms.This Mossberg 500 Persuader is brand new come with a pistol grip and a  factory stock.

Up for sale is one FNH-USA model FNS-40, standard frame with stainless slide and white stainless barrel.  Date on the test round is 6/13, I actually purchased this brand new at Point Blank in Mentor just this past September.  I've taken it out a total of 3 times and have put a little over 200 rounds through it. I also have an old Glock 35 laying around, so I don't need another .40 S&W as much as I thought I did.  I've been a Browning/FN fan all my life, sometimes brand loyalty gets the better of me.

Accuracy is better than I expected from a brand new gun. Trigger and magazine springs are still a little stiff, they will relax with use.  This is a truly ambidextrous handgun, as it has slide and magazine releases on both sides of the receiver. Perfect for Southpaws and weak hand practice.  FN also uses the Sig Sauer type of takedown lever, so field stripping is far easier than a Glock and some others.  I've owned a good many handguns, and in my opinion the Sig design is the most user friendly for cleaning your gun.

Comes with 3 Kalifornia (10-round) magazines, two backstraps, and standard 3-dot sights plus the usual factory case, lock, owner's manual, etc.  Located on the East side of Columbus, but I travel to the Marion/Mansfield/Ashland area pretty frequently.  Thanks for your interest."

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. Contrast or Night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous. Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol.
