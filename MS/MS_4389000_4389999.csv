Available in two compact models—PT 111 and PT 140—the Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment.Taurus Security System (TSS)sTaurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.Loaded Chamber IndicatorTaurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.Accessory RailFeatures the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessoriesSpecificationsModel: 111G2Finish: BlueCaliber: 9 mmCapacity: 12 +1 Weight: 22 oz.Barrel Length: 3.2""Frame: CompactAction: SA/DAFront Sight: FixedRear Sight: Adjustable- 2 DotsLength: 6.24""Safety: Loaded Chamber Indicator,Manual Safety,Taurus Security System,Trigger safetyMSRP: $301.52"

Manufacturer is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Construction on this 930 is steel barrel, bolt, and parts, built into a light weight alloy receiver with matching alloy trigger housing. Type is dual system self regulating gas operated semi-automatic, made to specs for the zealous Carolina security contractor whose name it bears. Chambering is for 12 gauge shells, 2 3/4 inch and 3 inch magnums interchangeably. Capacity with extended 

Choate factory installed tube is 7 + 1 + a ghost round as seen here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpyNoCnO4B4 6 + 1 on 3 inch. We have added an extension tube clamp, since the 930 lug does not have a detent ball. Operators should keep the clamp tight. Barrel is 18 1/2 inch Cylinder Bore, .725 muzzle diameter. 

Since the 930 is not back bored, it will handle rifled slugs and sabots just fine. Sight system is factory issue, low profile XS brand windage and elevation adjustable, removable aperture or Ghost Ring rear sight integral to its 10 slot Picatinny Rail. Receiver on the 930 is contoured like the Model 500 and 835 shotguns, for a Weaver #88 or 417 four screw base. Front sight is raised, white bar blade type. Operating handle is oversize knurled steel. Safety is classic Mossberg top tang style; and the .250 smooth face blue steel trigger pulls at 5 pound vicinity with minimal felt creep. Length of pull is 14 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 1 inch black factory recoil pad. Weight empty is 7 1/2 pounds, with center of gravity at the operating handle. Pistol grip stock and forend are black graphite based synthetic, with lateral checkered surfaces. Buttstock tapers to a 2 1/2 inch drop at the heel, with a 3/4 inch right hand cant. It has a removable spacer, visible in the photos, next to the buttstock that will bring the length of pull down 7/8 of an inch. Buttstock has a blue steel sling swivel stud. Metal finish is matte blue to its steel, with matching black matte anodized receiver, and black trigger group, stock, and forend. This 930 served with Mossberg’s sales demonstrator. Surface detractions on this specimen are minimal, only faint occasional surface streaking or edge whitening. We rate it as Excellent, 90 to 95 percent vicinity by our estimate, but its photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bore, choke threads, and mechanism are all bright and clean. From examination of the shell carrier, we do not believe this shotgun was loaded more than 10 or 15 times; if it was ever fired, no more than that. It comes in a factory box with cable lock and instruction manual that bears Mossberg’s Statement of Warranty. Replacement pricing on this shotgun in our area is $800 or more.

The factory cleaner/oil is included as well as 160ish rounds of wolf steel ammunition that I had for ""emergencies"". I shot up all of my brass ammo that I had so all I have are some boxes of steel that I've kept incase I needed some in a hurry. The blackhawk case also comes with the rifle. Contact me with any questions. I might be interested in trades. Let me know what you have! Thanks for looking!"

The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally new trigger system. The new Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (sold separately) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a new sleek slide profile, which is fully machined from bar stock to reduce weight, makes the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.

These precision scopes are specifically built to match your favorite target and varmint calibers. The caliber-specific EXT bullet-drop reticle takes the guesswork out of long-range shooting with crosshairs precisely calibrated to the bullet drop of a specific caliber. Once you've determined the target range, simply take the corresponding crosshair, put it on target and squeeze the trigger. The enhanced multicoated optics feature a wide field of view, amazing clarity and efficient light transmission. They are also waterproof, fogproof and shockproof. Low-profile turrets provide a streamlined profile. 1/4-MOA adjustments. Matte finish."

There’s a new option in concealed carry performance: the P220® Compact. The P220 Compact is a 6+1 capacity pistol featuring enhanced ergonomics and true concealability in the powerful .45 Auto platform. The shortened frame provides concealability while the ergonomically contoured magazine floorplate lengthens the grip just enough to provide a firm grip for even large handed shooters. The hard coat anodize alloy frame combines light weight and strength for extreme durability. The integrated accessory rail ensures compatibility with industry standard options, such as the STL-900L Tactical Light & Laser. Topping the compact frame is a shorter, “commander-length” stainless slide housing a 3.9” cold hammer forged barrel and external extractor, for enhanced reliability. Like all P220 pistols, the Compact features a rock solid lock up and superb out-of-the-box accuracy. In a world full of concealed carry options, the P220 Compact’s improved ergonomics, slim profile and shorter slide and frame make the pistol the ideal choice. And with the SIG name you know that when it comes to protecting your life you’re backed by a standard of excellence unmatched in the firearms world.

This rifle was a build project of mine several years ago and while I had fun building it I no longer enjoy it as much as I used to so I am moving on from it.

As mentioned the rifle is an ADCOR BEAR Elite mounted on an SR15 lower. The ADCOR BEAR is a gas piston rifle with a milspec phosphorous bolt and hard chrome bolt carrier. The BC features a spring loaded cover that pops up into the ejection port sealing it from outside debris. This rifle has a 16"" FN cold hammer forged barrel with a KAC triple tap that is not pinned or welded so you may keep it on the rifle or move it to another as seen fit. The KAC 3T is no longer in production and is meant as a host for the KAC NT4.

For sling options you also have a Magpul RSA.

The upper has a 4 position gas block for suppressor use and use with different ammo loads.

The Lower is fully ambidextrous with a GA Super dynamic trigger, battle arms development 45 short throw safety, Magpul MIAD pistol grip. spikes ST-T2 buffer, Magpul UBR with strike plate, Impact Weapons Component CSAP which allows you to mount a sling that utilizes a hook such as the magpul sling shown.

Note I misplaced the sling so the rifle will not come with it.

The upper mounts an Aimpoint Micro T1 on a Larue QD base. You get a surefire X400 laser light combo and the Magpul AFG as well.

All painting was done by me.

The buffer tube has wear but not carrier tilt. This is a used rifle.

This rifle has everything you could want or need for a home defense or general purpose rifle as it is currently setup.

Additionally the rifle has Troy HK flip up sights which are fully tritium and the front sight post has a white stripe for easy target acquisition.

There are a few dings on the upper but the functionality of the rifle is not effected nor are they significant to the point of notability.

The top of the rail has Larue index clips and lastly the rifle features a folding charging handle that can be moved to either side or completely removed should you desire it.

The regular charging handle is a phase 5 gen 1 ambidextrous charging handle.

The rifle will come with 14 (or 12 if memory serves me right) Pmags which have chrome silicon springs. Additionally I will throw in a case for free.

In total for this complete package I am asking $4000 flat.

It's entirely your choice to part this rifle out or keep it together.

*Please note these are older pics and do not display the phase 5 charging handle. Thank you for your interest and time.

Ideal for carbine-length rifles in the 11.5 to 16"" range. The 10.0's length stops about an inch past of a carbine-length gas block, providing true free-float. Our two-pin proprietary barrel nut system with its locking anti-slip plate, sets LaRue handguards apart from the competition. Once properly installed, there is no chance of movement whatsoever. The side and bottom rails are tucked closer to the barrel, keeping the profile narrower and more streamlined. LaRue handguards also include integral QD sling-swivel sockets at the base of each side for convenient mounting 2-point slings. Additionally, our Free-float Rail system provides an excellent heat-sinking feature that pulls throat-damaging heat away from the chamber area. Another heat-sinking benefit is the elimination of pressure-spikes, which some feel is the cause of a large part of pre-mature bolt failures."

Previous owner used it as a duty pistol so it has some holster wear but they shot it less than 300 times and ive shot it less than 100 times. I completely field stripped it and cleaned it top to bottom. Comes with 20 hollow points and 50 target rounds and holster. Feel free to text me at REDACTED"
