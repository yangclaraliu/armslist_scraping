This is the 2015 model and was purchased new last month, still in mint condition. It's had one trip to the range and exactly 100 rounds through it. For those who don't know this is the revamped version of the classic uzi pistol. Some upgrades it has over the original uzi platform are full rail system, switchable side-charging handle, upgraded sights, and a polymer frame that fits the hands much better. This weapon is very compact with a 4"" barrel but still has a lot of potential. I got great groups at 50 yards with a red dot sight attached. 
It will come with all the original goodies, box and 2 magazines. 

I was planning on building a SBR like the one pictured but my interests have changed. That being said please make an offer, I will respond either way. Just don't lowball me i paid $1000 for this last month. Look at my list of trades too, maybe we could work out a trade plus cash.

No scratches, dings, gouges or rough spots. Only finish issues are near the muzzle and you can rub your finger over it as it's not a scatch at all. I'm thinking some rubbing of a leather holster. I'm also the second owner. 

Comes with the revolver, 20 something 158gr FMJ rounds, 2 speed loaders, the original wood S&W grips as this is a Pachmayer grip, and a Bianchi tan OWB leather holster. I can meet you at River City Marketplace as I'm about 30 minutes away in Nassau County.

For those who don't know what this is, think of Terminator or Jurassic Park ""Clever Girl"" scene. 
Roughly 1850 of these were important to the usa before the weapons ban. Theres probably four or five for sale from what ive found recently and when you do find them they are beat to hell or don't function or don't have anything with them. 
This spas 12 dates at 1988 by the proofing code. I have the original box, manual, parts list, tag, magazine plug, sling, and hook. The gun has had the safety recall (push botton) and has had the nessasary maintenance, (anything that was rubber from 27 years ago has been replaced with aftermarker or factory parts). This comes with the locking case shown in the picture. 
This gun is practically brand new. Everyone that has seen it usually can't believe the condition and for 1988 it only looks a year or two old. 
I'm the third owner. The original owner never fired it. A friend of mine bought it from him who did fire it, and ive put 20 rounds for a function test. The gun probably has less than 100-150 rounds totally. Text me at 828423829four
 And please don't ask me what my ""bottom dollar is."" I will not respond to your text or email. I'm asking 2,500. Make me an offer and will go from there. If your offer stands near 1500 or below even in a trade, you and I are way off. The quality and shape of this spas is very rare. I've seen this gun go with nothing but the gun and grip (no stock) and in rough condition for 1500-1700.
Trades:
Make respectful offers, all i can say is no. 
All offer will be considered, only partial trades."
