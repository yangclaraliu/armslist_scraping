No other .22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger® 22/45™ pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 45 caliber pistol.

In addition to the identical grip angles, the 22/45 features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making them perfect for 45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train. Moreover, this is a great handgun for plinking, target shooting, and small game hunting.

This MKIII 22/45 bull barrel pistol comes drilled and tapped for Weaver® style scope base adapters, for a simplistic addition of optics. Other great features include a contoured ejection port, push button mag release, two magazines, a hard plastic carry case, and tapered bolt ears that couldn`t be easier to grasp."

Selling my American Tactical Titan 1911 (It is NOT the ""Light Weight"" model)  Nice little subcompact 1911. I am the first owner and since buying it, I have put around 250 rounds of various ammo  (Federal aluminum/arass case, Freedom Munitions, Hornady American Gunner Hollow Points) through it with absolutely no failures.

It is also a nice size for carrying if you don't mind the weight. Even with the short barrel, recoil/muzzle flip is not an issue on this gun. I have only shot out to 20 yards but it's pretty accurate. Selling to find a small carry gun.

Included are all original parts as well as upgrades I did:
Kimber recoil assembly (Factory assembly included as well, it is still good since I replaced it with the Kimber part before ever shooting the gun)

Hogue wraparound grips and stainless steel grip screws (Original checkered wood grips and screws included)

TWO Kimber KimProTac compact mags + 1 ACT Compact Mag (7 rounds each)

Tagua leather IWB holster

Let's be honest, this '85 Beemer is showing its age, but it does run and drive and we have the title.  It isn't our daily driver, but it usually gets around town once or twice a week.  We recently put in a new battery and it has two new tires, the spare is on the passenger side in the photos (it's full sized) and the regular tire is in the trunk. We've replaced most of the big stuff over the years, including the transmission, so it should just be the small things left.  It has the original engine, though, which is classic German engineering. It occasionally dies while idling, but that never happened before the new battery so it's most likely a loose connection somewhere.The back of the drivers seat has come off, but all parts are present, so someone more mechanically inclined than me should have no trouble reassembling it. There's a small dent in the front passenger side panel where someone slid into it a few winters ago. That being said, this beast is solid and you can see everything in those massive windows. Most electrical parts work perfectly, the power locks are slow to respond but do function. AC works when it feels like it but the heater was great last winter. Might be useful for parts or a project, it's up to you. We are moving and will only need one vehicle. This has been an occasional driver over the last two years. 
Odometer says 170403, not sure it's accurate.

**Last week we had a safety inspection done and the vehicle failed on one fault.  There is a leak somewhere in the power steering system.  We had this vehicle listed on Craigslist for $1300, and our mechanic said that a worst case scenario fix for the leak would be about $400, so we've dropped the price to $800."

Low-profile, flattop-mounted, polymer sights deploy instantly at the touch of a finger to provide backup sighting if a primary optic fails. Streamlined contours mean there’s nothing to snag on brush, sling, or other gear when folded. Spring-loaded ambidextrous release mechanism lets you hit the grooved tab on either side of the sight to deploy, and lock it in place. Hitting the same tabs retract the sight when you’re done. Uses less than 1"" of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny receiver rail space and locks securely in place with the included steel crossbolt. Provides the same height over bore as standard A2 iron sights. Windage-adjustable rear sight has two apertures: a large, .185"" peep and a .070"" peep. Designed for AR-type rifles and carbines, fits any weapon with Picatinny rails."

Spyderco Para Military 2 Black Blade

The Spyderco Para Military 2 was released in 2010 with several changes over the classic version. Implementation of a new Bushing Pivot System generates fluid action and more consistent manufacturing tolerances. The G-10 handle is narrowed at the end improving ergonomics. The handle and blade have been profile thinner to eliminate hard angles when in the pocket in a closed position. It features a Compression Lock and an ambidextrous-friendly four way clip which carries tip-up/tip-down, left/right-hand that rests deep in a pocket.

The Para Military 2 has a high-performance CPM S30V full flat-ground blade but we've lengthened the blade's tip and added additional surface jimping to both the spine and finger choil, then we coated it in non-reflective DLC (Diamond-Like Coating). Screw-together handle components, the pocket clip and the blade are coated in black to inhibit the folder's reflective qualities.

Overall construction refinements are not drastic or even visible to the eye, but from the G-10 textured handle to the CPM S30V steel full flat black blade, everything is sharper, smoother and guaranteed to provide performance and user comfort.

The CT Carbine's upper receiver is constructed of aluminum with an integral full-length Picatinny rail with sights attached. The rugged rear flip up sight is elevation- and windage-adjustable and the square-post front sight has a protective hood. The convertible charging handle can be switched for right- or left-handed shooters. The CT Carbine incorporates a versatile polymer handguard that can accommodate 3 additional Picatinny rails in the 3-6-and 9 O'clock positions for the addition of accessories. The lower receiver is comprised of polymer with steel reinforcing inserts. The CT Carbine has a skeletonized fixed stock, pistol grip and a very distinctive magwell that doubles as a forward grip, providing additional control. The ambidextrous fire/safe selector switch is located just above the grip for quick and easy operation. The magazine release is located near the magwell housing, protecting the magazine from inadvertent releases. Provided with the CT Carbine is a hard case, sling, cleaning brush and owners manual.SPECIFICATIONS:Manufacturer: TaurusModel: CT9Type: Semi-AutomaticCaliber: 9mmWeight: 8.375 lbs.Stock: SyntheticColor: BlackBarrel Length: 16”Overall Length: 31.5""Capacity: 10+1"

The LC9 features a  single-sided manual safety and a magazine safety that will not permit the gun to fire when the mag is removed. Another additional safety feature is the loaded-chamber indicator atop the slide for obvious visual and tactile confirmation that the chamber is charged. The LC9’s pivoting external extractor design is also notably more massive and heavy-duty than most extractors on similar-size compact 9mm autos. Again, this is typical of Ruger’s approach to rugged reliability. Even Ruger’s smallest guns are strong.

The VEPR rifle chambered in 7.62x39mm is a top of the line Kalashnikov action semi auto rifle. This particular rifle features a hammer forged heavy barrel which is chrome lined along with the chamber, gas block and gas piston. They are built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

One tool, any job.

The SPHINX SDP Compact Black is a duty-sized pistol for the most discerning of shooters. The SDP Compact Black features a full aluminum lower frame, which gives it unparalleled balance, and can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Black is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is HAND FITTED to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The aluminum pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition.  Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Black. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.

It possesses all the attributes a shooter would hope for. It has great power, solid magazine capacity, solid accuracy, and legendary Glock reliability. It is easy to see why many federal and local law enforcement agencies have converted to the Glock 22. You will also notice the additional benefit of a serrated or “fish gill” at the rear end of the slide, which improves grip. This G22 has a low round count only approximately 200 or less put thru the pipe. No scratches or blemishes, it is clean, well maintained, and has a Mature Owner.

It probably has been fired at some point but hard to tell. 

Very slight holster rub on left side of barrel (see pic) and light cylinder ring---virtually all the old 29s have the same. Tiny dent on left side bottom of Coke grips. 

I can offer a couple different deals. For the revolver and the beautiful diamond Coke grips, the price is $2300.

For the revolver and very nice but somewhat later diamondless grips, the price is $2000. Both great buys, it's hard to find the 29s out there, especially under $3,000.

Prefer face-to-face, but will consider shipping if buyer bears costs, etc. What look like smudges on the finish are just my crappy photography. Limited on pictures here if you are interested can email more."

My wife has had this gun quite a few years but has only fired 200-300 rounds thru it. She liked the gun but it was never a 100% fit for her smallish hands. She is now retired and decided to go with a smaller less powerful gun, so she has upgraded to a Glock 43, 9mm, which is the perfect fit for her hands. She has cleaned this gun after every firing session and  it's in great condition. The slight visible wear on the outside is due to leather holster rubbing, as she does carry concealed. The gun comes with (4)  9 round mags, each with a Pearce +2 pinkie extension for a total capacity of 11+ 1 in the chamber. The original magazine base plates are also included. A padded, lockable case with padlock and a separate gun cable lock are also included as well as a new Glock cleaning brush, rod and speed loader.
The price is for the gun and accessories only, but I have for sale, separately, 89 rounds of Speer, Gold Dot 40 S&W, 165gr GDHP hollow point self defense ammo for $29.00 (less than $.33 per round). These sells new for $.60 per round if you can find them.
