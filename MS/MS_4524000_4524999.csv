Has no scratches and every thing works as expected.  Has never been dropped, wet, or abused.  I had this on my crossbow, upgraded to the newer xb30pro and now this one has to go.

Description from manufacturer:
The XB30 is a high performance 30mm crossbow specific scope featuring a crossbow speed selector and illuminated glass etched range finding reticle. All the scope you could ever ask for! The 30 mm optics allow high levels of light transmission even when light starts to drop, when game is more active, such as dawn and dusk. All lenses are fully multi-coated and hand selected to guarantee optimum image quality with impressive color and contrast. The precision glass etched reticle has been expertly designed to offer aim points at exact 10 yard intervals of 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 yards. The aim points are fine crosses offering extreme accuracy. The measure 2 inches across at the corresponding distances. Alongside the aim points are measuring bars, useful for quick range-finding. Each bar segment measure 12 inches at the corresponding distance. This allows range finding of 12, 24, 36, and 48 inches. The reticle aim points illuminate red and green. Special attention has been given to the intensity of illumination levels. Levels 1 - 3 offer a low level illumination very useful in low light situations. Levels 4 and 5 are a higher intensity ideally suited for daytime shooting when aiming into areas with a dark background, where reticles can easily be lost. Powered by a single CR2032 battery. Features 1/2 M.O.A. finger adjustment, locking fast focus ocular, and flip-open lens covers. Adjustable to match any crossbow (speeds ranging from 210 to 360 feet/second. Is waterproof, shockproof and fog proof."

This product is built like a tank, with a full half-inch steel plate on the door. The body's walls are two inches thick, and are filled with American Security's DryLight concrete, offering totally seamless fire protection. The inner and outer walls of the hull add up to seven gauge steel. This safe offers an astonishing two hours of fire protection at 1200 degrees F, giving it one of the highest fire ratings on the market.The door bolts are 1.5 inches of solid steel, and extend on three sides to prevent pry attacks. Both the door, and the door jam are lined with a heavy fire strip which expands when heated, sealing the interior of the safe to prevent the influx of hot air. The door is also built to a very tight tolerance, making it extremely difficult to attack with a pry bar.UL LISTED BURGLARY CLASSIFICATIONAmerican Security's BF series has earned a UL listed residential security container with a Burglary Classification.DRYLIGHT FIRE PROTECTIONAmerican Security’s BF Gun Safes use a proprietary fill material called DryLight, which offers exceptional fire protection without adding excess weight. This superior fire protection was confirmed at Intertek, the industry’s leading independent laboratory for gun safe fire testing. When analyzing the fire performance of competitive safes, be sure to weigh reports from independent laboratories against unverified factory testing.During fire testing, Intertek kept AMSEC's BF Gun Safes in their test oven for two hours. Within 8 minutes, the furnace temperature was raised to 1200° F, and that temperature was maintained for the remainder of the two-hour test. This method is consistent with the UL-72 fire test curve. Typical house fires only reach temperatures of 1100° F. A safe is considered to have failed this test if temperatures exceed 350°F anywhere in the safe. American Security's safe passed the test as internal temperatures never exceeded 325° F during the two hours of testing. Paper typically starts to ignite at 450° F.ETL Verified fire protection of 1200°F for 120 minutes.PREMIUM DOOR ORGANIZERThe BF series comes with a manufacturer installed premium door organizer, which is ideal for providing quick access to firearms. The pistol holsters and magazine pouches can accommodate a wide variety of small arms, and the quick release shotgun and rifle storage system allows you to place two long arms on the door.ELECTRICAL OUTLETA 110V outlet allows electrical accessories to be added without taking apart power cords.1/2"" SOLID STEEL DOOR PLATE(½)"" steel plate door combined with 1"" DryLight insulation.

I have here a Draco, with metal rail system with covers, aftermarket recoil spring, an internal recoil buffer, Thread cover, slant muzzle brake, and krinkov style muzzle brake, as well as a 30 Rd. magazine. What makes this pistol unique is the brace set up. This sig brace is mounded on a KAK industries extender tube and side-fold mount. This allows the user to have a greater distance between the brace and rear of the receiver. The mound folds up and locks, and can be unfolded by a nice tug. To fold, simply squeeze the locking mechanism at the base of the mount and fold. This pistol has seen about 200 rounds. It was thoroughly cleaned after each range trip and is in spectacular shape. This is a fantastic pistol, but as I said, I am looking to move on to something different and let somebody else enjoy it as much as I have."

This gun takes .223/5.56 ak mags. I love this gun, it is an extremely handy truck/hd/range/varmint hunting gun. I'm pretty on the fence about selling it, so lowballers will be ignored. It is accurate, begs for a red dot or low mag scope to see its potential. The only reason I'm thinking of selling or trading is I'm moving to Arizona and could use some cash, better optics, or guns to work on in school. This pistol comes with a 30 round steel mag, plastic 30 rounder, arsenal smoke/clear 20 round mag, hogue grip and original grip, and ak brace.

I bought this Nagant in Ogden Kansas. When I bought it it was strait from a warehouse, never fired. I've taken it out shooting a few times, but not recently. Overall, I would say that I've run maybe 30 rounds through it. 

The only damage is a few scratches in the polish

NIB Primary Arms 1-6x ACSS / Designed for accurate use on .223, 5.45, and .308 loads.

Laser-etched reticle with built-in bullet drop compensation out to 800 yards and built in range finder and pre-calculated wind leads.

11 levels of illumination, including night-vision setting.

Nitrogen-purged. Shock, water, fog, ice proof.

Half-minute adjustments.

I have two of these and have decided on a different optic in the 4x range for my second build. So, selling. Go for around 270-280 elsewhere depending on where one finds it. I'm offering 260 shipped Priority to CONUS. Not the most earth shattering discount I know, but money's money and the savings could be a box of ammo. These are truly awesome scopes. Please look up reviews if unsure. Consensus is Primary Arms could sell these things at the 450 range and not only get away with it, but it would be worth it still. I agree. Keep in mind, this is a fast-acquisition combat optic. This isn't dialing in at a soda can at 1000 yards type scope. This is a fast-moving hunting/tactical scope that offers immediate range and wind feedback for quick, fast and effective engagements on targets, be they 2 or 4 legged. Very popular with 3-gun community.

I encourage anyone interested to please request a proof-of-product picture so you know the product is real and that I am real. This protects you and your funds. Armslist has its share of bots, scammers, and liars like anywhere else. Proof will be provided immediately upon receiving such a request. For extra assurance, I can and will if asked provide proof of my five-year gunbroker account which holds an A+ rating with zero negative feedback.

For more detailed info on this optic, Sootch00 did a fantastic review of it, seen here: https://goo.gl/7pEXR5

It is a small shank barrel like almost all new savage rifles. I am wanting to re-barrel the action with a lighter kicking caliber that my wife can shoot as well. The barrel is only a few years old and barely has any rounds down it. It is a very accurate barrel. I was shooting 3 1/2"" groups with it at 570 yards. But this is just to much gun for my wife. The barrel has 3 tiny spots where rust was starting due to it being in a case on a few humid days while we were moving. I have taken very good care of the bore and the crown is in excellent condition. I have taken proper barrel brake in procedures when I first shot the gun. I am the original owner of the gun and have all the tools to properly take the barrel off the gun without marring the finish. To install the barrel is easy. the tools needed to install the barrel is just a savage action wrench, a savage barrel nut wrench, and a go gauge and no go gauge. much cheaper than buying a new gun.

The barrel is only a few years old and barely has any rounds down it. It is a very accurate barrel. I was shooting 3 1/2"" groups with it at 570 yards. But this is just to much gun for my wife. The barrel has 3 tiny spots where rust was starting due to it being in a case on a few humid days while we were moving. I have taken very good care of the bore and the crown is in excellent condition. I have taken proper barrel brake in procedures when I first shot the gun. I am the original owner of the gun and have all the tools to properly take the barrel off the gun without marring the finish. To install the barrel is easy. the tools needed to install the barrel is just a savage action wrench, a savage barrel nut wrench, and a go gauge and no go gauge. much cheaper than buying a new gun.

According to the date stamp it was produced in 1989. The side of the slide says West Germany inside of just Germany like todays Sigs do. I took thiis gun on a trade so I am not sure how many rounds have been ran through the gun total. I know I personally have ran a box of 50 through it. I have just one magazine for this weapon at the moment. I recently purchase a P220 Parts kit directly from Sig and replaced the internal springs on the gun. I also added a neww set of Hougue grips with some brand new screws and washers that were in the kit from Sig Sauer.

618,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4524618,For Sale:  Night Vision Camera,"Grandview Heights, Columbus, Ohio",$ 995,"Listed On: Saturday, July 18, 2015",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"iGEN LE night vision viewer/camera, with two lenses. The primary lens is a 42 mm objective lens with 2.6 magnification. The iGEN LE comes with a telephoto lens that can attach to the basic lens. The combination of the two lenses together will provide an overall magnification of 6X. Inside the iGEN is an enhanced sensor that allows for more gain with less noise, better contrast and overall a clearer image.

This monocular replaces the traditional intensifier tube found in Gen 2 night vision with a microprocessor and CCD sensor. The result is that the price of night vision is dramatically reduced while adding image processing and the ability to take a picture. The iGEN LE offers stunning resolution and superior image output that is ideal for surveillance and evidence collection. The all glass 2.6x lens provides 70-ft field of view and ambient light amplification up to 650 times. This night vision monocular can be connected to real-time video, making it possible to record day and night activity. With built-in Infrared IntelligenceTM, wattage adjusts automatically as needed for varying levels of darkness. User adjustable exposure time, variable display brightness and color output choices. Powered by four AA batteries. Comes with a compact tripod and car window mount, adjustable neck strap and protective carrying case. Made in USA.

This camera was only used once on a private investigation case. In excellent condition. Please email me with any questions. No trades."
