MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds.

I will also trade straight across for a new/unfired COMPLETE AR 16"" upper, to include BCG and CH. Has to be new in the box/unfired. A used one is not worth the trade.

- fortis featherweight rail
- Yankee hill lower with match trigger (about a 2.5 lb break)

Also have several pmags and a soft case and tons of ammo (something like 800 rounds I think?) 
Total value around 1700 to 1800


Now, what I'm looking for is as follows and ONLY as follows.
- authentic knives from wwII (any of the German flavors will do) but not hugely interested in bayonets unless they come with the correct weapon.
- side arms, specifically a luger, perhaps a 1911 or Enfield break barrel.
- rifles, specifically m1 carbines and 1903's, I don't want a mosin and I already own a garand
- I'd also love a colt python, or similar revolver (I just love the look)
- .357 lever gun/revolver with ammo combo (priority)

It is in excellent condition, almost flawless. It has approx. 600 rounds through it. Never had a failure to fire, shoots any .22lr ammo I've put through it. There is slight difficulty with shell extraction once the rounds are fired due to shell expansion with some manufacturers rounds, but a slap of the extractor rod gets them out. 

I did send it back to Taurus factory to fix my mistake of dry firing too many times which resulted in a broken transfer bar, due to over-travel since there was no round to make contact with. While at factory, I had it serviced and requested the trigger pull be lightened for double action shooting; there is definitely a difference in the trigger pull."

Burris Zee Signature rings. This setup will easily shoot 1"" groups on the target at 25 yards.

789,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4188789,For Sale:  US WWII 37mm Antitank Gun Breechring Registered DD,"Kingwood / Humble / NE, Houston, Texas","$ 7,000","Listed On: Saturday, April 30, 2016",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The carriage is gone and the breechring is left and for sale. US M3 37mm Antitank Gun breechring and block, complete, plus accessories for sale. This is an NFA Registered Destructive Device. Marked on ring: Gun 37mm M3 NO. 23557 ORD. DEPT. U.S.A. U.S Machine Corp. 1943 191 LBS. INSP. B.O.L. This is a complete ring and block, ready to screw on and fire. This block was precision saw-cut – ‘demilled’ – in order to import it back in the 1980’s. See photos. The cut is 0.5” wide by 2” long. Even with this cut I chose to register the ring as a Destructive Device with the BATF in 2003; I could not verify with the BATF that even ‘demilled’ it would never be construed as a DD as it functions as designed, and theoretically could fire live rounds (at least one anyway). Absent BATF endorsement I decided it best to register. Therefore, transfer to the new owner will require an approved BATFE Form 4. As it sits it is fully functional as a blank-firing breechring. I have fired hundreds of rounds with it with no failures, issues or any danger whatsoever. However, in no way should the buyer assume this ring is safe for firing live projectile rounds. Terms of sale will include the buyer executing a separate agreement stating Buyer acknowledges the ring is not deemed safe for use with live projectile rounds and relieves Seller / Manufacturer from any and all liability. Also included in this sale as a package are as follows: 1. Faux Projectile Blank Adapter Complete 10 gauge (2) 2. Faux Projectile Adapter Insert 12 gauge (1) 3. Shotgun Blanks: 12 gauge (100) 4. Blackpowder Blanks: 10 gauge (100) 5. Bore brush, 37mm: 2 6. Bore swabs, 37mm: 2 7. Casings, 37mm w/ primer inserts (6) 8. Firing Pin, spare (2) The ‘Faux Projectile Blank Adapters’ are custom machined from an original 37mm shell casing with a faux projectile that screws into a tubular insert that accepts a 10 gauge or 12 gauge blank round. There are two complete units with 10 gauge inserts and one additional 12 gauge insert. There are six original 37mm cases used for handloading black powder blank rounds using the original cases. The original primers are pushed out and custom brass inserts pressed into the brass case 9no alteration to the case). The new inserts accept .50 BMG primers and therefore the rounds function like normal. I have reprimed, reloaded and fired each of these cases maybe 4-5 times each. The swabs and brushes are current production, non-military. I made my own cleaning rods and installed matching threaded inserts. You can have these rods if you want to pay postage or pick them up in person. Located near Houston, TX. Here are the photos: http://s214.photobucket.com/user/R_S_Hu ... breechring Terms: Buyer is responsible for submitting the BATFE Form 4, arranging shipping and all transfer fees. Buyer must sign and notarize ‘Not For use with live Projectile Rounds’ release document. Payment is due before the Form 4 is submitted. I am happy to ship everything but the ring upon receipt of payment. Physical pickup is fine too."

I bought it new a few weeks ago and have only put 120rds through it. I've realized is rather have another Glock or build another AR since then.

Anyway, the ak will come in its original box with 2 30rd mags (1tapco and 1 magpul) with a sling and cleaning kit. I've also added a magpul moe + ak grip to the ak for a better feel over the stock girly-man commie grip. I'll include the original too. This WASR is a 2014 production gun, meaning that the wood and attention to detail on it are much better than previous models. It is unfired and has only been racked and disassembled a few times.

I prefer a cash sale and I would be looking for $525 for this one. You'll need a valid NCDL and I want to see a ccw or original pistol permit for my peace of mind. Seeing a permit is a for a long gun is not an NC requirement, but it is one of mine, no exceptions.

We both get a bill of sale. FTF meetings in the matthews/southeast clt area only.

The Ruger Compact Revolver (LCR) is a light, small-frame handgun with highly manageable recoil. The cylinder is strong 400-Series stainless steel, extensively fluted to reduce weight.

This LCR Comes LNIB, as it would from the store with original box and all documentation and Lock. The Cylinder has an 8 round capacity.
*** Included will be a Speed Loader specially designed for this revolver and 1 Box of Federal ""Target Grade"" 325 Rounds of Ammo since .22LR is so hard to find ***

Many people find this revolver ideal for personal protection, and for beginning women especially who have a hard time with pulling back the slide on a Semi-Auto handgun. Most Small Framed Revolvers offer a fairly decent ""Kick"" for many and are sometimes reluctant to shoot it. The .22LR LCR is not that way and offers a very comfortable experience for those who cannot handle or have no desire for a larger caliber but, still need or want personal protection.

Price is $400 as seen in the pictures

My online store prices are competitive and if you call me you get a real person with actual field time. I don’t believe in dumb questions, so don’t hesitate to ask.

The Trekker II Mat is based on the original Trekker Mat but with 2 valves for quicker inflation & deflation and double the thickness. Some end users have been requesting a thicker mat for some time now for greater comfort as well as enhanced insulation properties. With its 2 inch thick foam core the Trekker II mat achieves this. It rolls to similar size and diameter of the traditional green military foam mat but with much more comfort while at the same time creating a nice insulating barrier between the user and the cold ground.
