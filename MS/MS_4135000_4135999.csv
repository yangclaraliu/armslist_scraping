It is good condition with and is built like a Tiger Tank. Very accurate with easy sight aperture for quick target acquisition. Normal mild wear to wood. The first Mauser-pattern rifle produced in Yugoslavia was the M24. Its predecessor, the FN Model 1924 had been produced for the Yugoslav army by FN Herstal until the Ministry and FN signed a contract on the purchase of the licence for production of rifles 7.9 mm M 24. Nearly all M24's were produced either before or during World War II, at the Kragujevac Arsenal plant. The M24 and Model 1924 are nearly identical.[2] The final additions to the M24 family were the M24/47 and M24/52 rifles. Both were produced by reworking existing prewar Model 1924 rifles after World War II at the Zastava Arms (formally Kragujevac Arsenal) plant, which was at that time under the control of the postwar communist government. ""47"" and ""52"" indicate the beginning of the rebuild program for each respective model: 1947 for the M24/47 and 1952 for the M24/52. One common misconception is that the M24/47 rifles were produced only in 1947; actually, the rebuild program lasted into the early 1950s alongside new production of M48 rifles. Minor cosmetic differences exist between the M24/47 and M24/52, but the rifles are nearly identical to one another and to their predecessors, the Model 1924 and M24.[3] M24 series rifles were used by the Royal Yugoslav Army and the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II."

The arms company Zastava released the M76 in the mid-1970s. Since then it has become the standard issue sharpshooter rifle in the Serbian army and its predecessor the Yugoslav National Army (JNA). It is designed to fulfill the same role as the Soviet Dragunov SVD, which is to provide a designated marksman capability to the infantry platoon. During the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, it was used by several sides; it saw action in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.[2] In Serbian service it is reportedly being replaced by the Zastava M91. The Zastava M91 uses the 7.62x54mmR cartridge which is replacing the 8x57mm IS (M-49) cartridge in Serbian service. Design details[edit] The M76 is similar in concept to the Russian Dragunov SVD sniper rifle; a semi-automatic rifle using a full-power cartridge from a 10-round magazine. However, the M76 is closer to the AK-47/RPK design than the Dragunov, similar to the Romanian PSL. Being derived from the AK design it is simple and reliable, and like other Zastava AK-derivatives it is of high-quality manufacture. Accuracy is typically around 1.5 MOA, which is good for a Kalashnikov design and entirely acceptable for the designated marksman role. Macedonian special policeman holding a Zastava M76 sniper in his hands. ZRAK ON-M76 4x 5°10’ reticle layout. The top center ""chevron"" (^) is used as the main aiming mark. The horizontal hash marks are for windage and lead corrections and can be used as mil marks for ranging as well. In the bottom-left corner is a stadiametric rangefinder that can be used to determine the distance from a 1.75 meters (5 ft 8.9 in) tall person/object from 200 m (2) to 800 m (8). Rather than being a Dragunov clone, it looks more like a lengthened AK-47 with a heavier barrel, an impression strengthened by the separate stock and pistol grip rather than the Dragunov's thumbhole combination stock. Instead of the Dragunov's 7,62x54mmR chambering it uses the 7.92x57mm Mauser a.k.a. the 7.9mm or 8x57mm IS round. The Yugoslav National Army (JNA) adopted a 7.9mm Cartridge, Ball M49 variant, designated as M49, as infantry ammunition at the end of the 1940s and later a 7.9mm Cartridge, Sniper, with Universal ball M75, as sniper ammunition, designated as M75.[3][4] Instead of the Dragunov's separate gas piston, the M76 has an AK-type piston attached to the bolt carrier.[5] The receiver is a milled forging like that of the original AK-47 to give greater rigidity when firing a full-power round and it is longer to suit the 8x57mm IS chambering. The AK-type rotating bolt, bolt carrier, barrel and other parts are also longer and heavier to suit. Feeding is via a 10-round steel box magazine, which has a follower that holds the bolt open after the last shot. Since there is no device in the weapon to hold the bolt to the rear, the bolt will move forward when the magazine is removed, which increases the difficulty of removing the magazine. Fire is semi-automatic only, so the AK-47-type safety on the right side of the receiver has only 2 settings - 'safe' and 'fire'. The barrel has a tapered profile with a Dragunov-type combination slotted flash suppressor and foresight housing. A standard AKM bayonet can be fitted to the bayonet lug below the foresight. Like the Dragunov, but unlike the AK-47, the M76 features an operator-adjustable gas regulator enabling more propellant gas to be vented to the piston in marginal operating conditions and even blocking the gas from pushing back the bolt, making the rifle a manual repeater. The furniture features a straight comb butt, which has a rubber pad similar to that found on the Zastava M70 series of weapons, and a well-shaped contoured pistol grip. The fore-end is also reminiscent of that found on the M70 series. There is no butt trap for cleaning kit storage in the wooden butt. In newer production models the wooden furniture is replaced with synthetic polymer material which offers some storage space for accessories like a cleaning kit and reduces the M76 overall weight by approximately 0.5 kg. With the exception of the gas regulator, disassembly and operation are similar to that of the AK-47/AKM family of weapons. Though the M76 fires its bullets at a relatively modest 730 m/s (2,395 ft/s) muzzle velocity, the 8x57mm IS cartridge loaded with aerodynamically efficient 12.8 grams (197.53 gr) military sS ball bullets still offers a supersonic reach of ˜ 950 m (1,040 yd) under ICAO Standard Atmosphere conditions at sea level (air density ? = 1.225 kg/m³). To mount the optics, a side-rail is permanently attached to the left wall of the receiver which accepts an alloy sliding dovetail mount with a clamping lever to which can be attached various telescopic sights and night optics. The mount is detachable from the receiver rail in seconds by swinging the locking lever open and sliding the scope and mount off the rail to the rear. It can be removed and reattached without loss of zero. The optic sight is normally removed during field stripping to give easy access to the receiver cover and bolt carrier. The rifle features mechanically adjustable backup AKM-type iron sights with a sliding tangent rear sight which can be adjusted from 100 m to 1,000 m. These sights can be used with or without the optic sight in place. ZRAK ON-M76 elevation turret with bullet drop compensation markings and warning for the radioactive illumination The typical scope used is a ZRAK ON-M76 4x 5°10’ scope originally produced in the ZRAK factory in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.[6][7] This optical sight is similar to the PSO-1 4x24 sight used on the Russian SVD rifle and the Romanian I.O.R. LPS 4x6° TIP2 4x24 sight used on the PSL rifle. The ON-M76 elevation turret features bullet drop compensation (BDC) in 50 m increments for engaging point and area targets at ranges from 100 m up to 1,000 m. The BDC feature must be tuned at the factory for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of rifle and cartridge (the 7,9 M75 sniper ammunition) at a predefined air density. Inevitable BDC induced errors will occur if the environmental and meteorological circumstances deviate from the circumstances the BDC was calibrated for. Marksmen can be trained to compensate for these errors. Besides the BDC elevation or vertical adjustment control of the reticle, the windage or horizontal adjustment control of the reticle can also be easily dialed in by the user without having to remove turret caps etc. The reticle illumination of the ZRAK M-76 4x 5°10’ is provided by (radioactive) tritium. The tritium light source has to be replaced every 8–12 years, since it gradually loses its brightness due to radioactive decay. The reticle features a PSO-1 type range-finding reticle. Performance[edit] The M76 is relatively accurate for a semi-automatic rifle. It can achieve 1.5 to 2 Minute of angle or MOA consistent accuracy with appropriate ammunition. Under normal conditions a maximum effective range of 800 m (875 yd) against man sized targets for an average sniper is achievable. The dispersion at 900 m (984 yd) is described as 50 x 50 cm (19.7 x 19.7 in), which is ˜ 1.9 MOA. Under optimal atmospheric and environmental conditions excellent marksmen might use the M76 up to 1,000 m (1,094 yd). Recoil is described as being modest.[1][8] It has the reputation of a reliable and capable weapon and has seen extensive combat service.[citation needed] There is a known issue, however, with the magazines of the M76 being unreliable. Due to the bolt hold open property of the magazines, the bolt will slam forward when the magazine is removed, putting considerable pressure on the follower. This can result in the follower being jammed in the forward position, rendering the magazine inoperable."

It has harly been fired and has a very faint cyclinder drag ring to show it. Color case hardening on both the trigger and hammer are very nice.

Pictures coming soon but it's the standard black model with a leather OWB holster included from the factory.

Will include quality defensive rounds and 100 rounds of .38 Special.  Can include more if you want.

No trades. $740."

Fairfax, Va. – The National Rifle Association (NRA) was instrumental in stalling the Obama Administration's initial attempt to ban commonly used ammunition for the most popular rifle in America, the AR-15. The announcement that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) will suspend its proposed framework to ban M855 ammunition validates the NRA's assertion that this effort was nothing more than a political maneuver to bypass Congress and impose gun control on the American people.

""Today's announcement proves what we have said all along – this was 100% political. President Obama failed to pass gun control through Congress, so he tried to impose his political agenda through executive fiat. But every gun owner in America needs to understand Barack Obama's hatred of the Second Amendment has not changed,"" said Wayne La Pierre, Executive Vice President of the National Rifle Association.

Chris Cox, Executive Director of NRA-ILA criticized the dishonest campaign to ban this common ammunition: ""The lies used to justify the ban were shameful. This proposal was never about law enforcement safety – it was about the Obama Administration's desire to pander to billionaire Michael Bloomberg and his gun control groups. Since they haven't been able to ban America's most popular rifle, they are trying to ban the ammunition instead.""

Since the BATFE announced its plan to ban commonly used ammunition less than a month ago, the NRA rallied its five million members and tens of millions of supporters across the country in strong opposition. In addition, the NRA worked with congressional leaders in both the U.S. House and Senate to oppose this misguided proposal.

""The NRA would like to thank House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and House Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman John Culberson for leading the fight against this unconstitutional attack on our Second Amendment freedoms,"" continued Cox. ""This was a significant victory for our five million members and tens of millions of supporters across the country.

""Make no mistake, this fight is not over. We will remain vigilant and continue to fight against President Obama's attempt to dismantle the Second Amendment,"" concluded LaPierre."

205,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4135205,For Sale:  THE ORIGINALS: Walther GSP + OSP SET,"Far NE IL, Illinois, United States","$ 1,599","Listed On: Friday, March 20, 2015",Handguns,Walther                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"A rare opportunity to obtain BOTH the ORIGINAL version of the Walther GSP in .22lr and the ORIGINAL version of the Walther OSP in .22 short.  These are the first commercial version of the Walther GSP, and the first version of the OSP.  The GSP uses a modular trigger, receiver, barrel and frame, the single stage trigger IS adjustable for position and trigger pull weight.  The standard 5 rd magazine operates the bolt hold open (there is no external latch lever).  This model has a safety.

The OSP also is modular, but is a predecessor version with the modules interconnecting differently than the GSP.  For the most part, they do NOT interchange with the GSP modules.

While the GSP can accept the later upper sections, it does not accept the later trigger modules easily, and requires frame recutting to use the .32 magazines.  Later upper sections also require some recutting of the wood grip, so this is not recommended.  The grip is different from the later GSP guns, and does not interchange due to details of the interlock with the frame.

The GSP will accept the 10"" barrel however, if desired. Note the slight difference in outer dimension in the last image.  This is due to the slightly outer perimeter size of the upper section on this gun compared to the later GSP, for which this barrel was made.  This is a cosmetic discrepancy only, but it does illustrate the change that would be needed in the grip if a later upper section is used on this gun.

A 10"" barrel is available separately, but $650 if purchased alone.  It will fit any GSP or OSP (except for the very first OSP version with the round barrel).  However, use with .22s cartridges is NOT recommended due to the differing twist rate.

Price is with 2 of the ""correct"" 5 rd magazines for each caliber.  A 10 rd custom cut magazines also can be provided for the GSP.  Additional OEM magazines ARE available from me with the gun purchase ONLY.

This is THE CLASSIC GSP, of which about 500 were made, and very very few brought into the USA.  More of the OSP were brought into the USA, but are not commonplace.

These guns also were the basis of the current Pardini and Morini designs.

Cosmetic and mechanical condition are superb.

The GSP handles all ammunition with ease, but should be used only with standard velocity ammunition.  Due to the barrel vents, the OSP is a bit finnicky and vents may need to be adjusted for some 22s ammunition.

Other GSP available, and OSP.  Price for the others varies from about $800 to 3800.  

10"" barrel is $600 additional with any gun.

Please note that although these are an olympic competition guns, they also are classified as assaults weapon in some areas.  In Europe, the GSP is perhaps the single most popular target gun, but also is widely used for firearms training for police officers.  These guns are extremely reliable, have near-perfect feeding, and very high accuracy.  

I do have some S&W 41, Hi Standard Victors, and Hammerli 208 and 208S available, as well as a few other items.  Please see other listings, or ask for catalogs.

Some states and localities classify these guns as assault weapons and do not permit transfer of this weapon to a private individual unless exceptions apply, and consider it suitable for law enforcement or government agency use only.  Generally it is transferable to a private individual (exempt list) in California, and can be shipped there, again with a few possible exceptions. The same is true for MA and MD, but exceptions may exist.  Check local laws.

Brand New Unfired,"Randleman, Greensboro, North Carolina",$ 580,"Listed On: Friday, April 24, 2015",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,30 Carbine                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014."

It's complete with barrel, recoil spring assembly and the complete slide. Everything you need to mount on top of a Glock lower and turn it into a functional firearm. This slide will mount on top of any Gen 3 20/21/20sf/21sf lower. I originally bought it to go with my G20sf so I could swap slides and move between 10mm and .45acp. I eventually sold the G20sf, but the guy didn't want the .45acp slide assembly, so I'm selling it since I have no further use.

This slide is a great accessory for a Gen 3 G20 or G20sf if you'd like the chance to swap calibers easily. Just add this slide on your Gen 3 G20/20sf lower, add some .45acp magazines and you're ready to go.

Instead I ended up relegating this to ccw. I have fired maybe 200 rounds through this and that is all. For about a year it sat in a safe due to the area I was working I was not able to carry at the time.

This is a BD Police model, so it is Single and Double action, and it has a manual de-cocker. There is no external safety on this handgun. It also has factory glow in the dark sights as well as a loaded chamber indicator on the top of the slide.

It has two magazines and will come with the case and all paper work from when I purchased it.

I am only looking for trades for another 9mm, something a little lighter, since this is a full size full steel firearm, it does get a little heavy at times."

	Hey all,
I have available for trade/sale a used but great condition Bi-Tone Springfield XD-45. I just picked this up on trade It is in great condition with on a ding on the front sight and some blueing wear on that barrel. This also comes with a never worn Uncle Mikes paddle/belt holster and two magazines. I also have defense/target ammo i could include for extra. This gun is still nice and tight and would be a great piece for anyone wanting a reliable and quality piece. Need to be able to meet up in Norman on this due to my schedule. 
	Mainly looking for cash, but would consider trades if they happen to peak my interest. I can add ammo or cash for certain trades, but some trades will need boot on your end. I am somewhat open to trades, but no 22, BP, or non-gun items (unless it is for a large LED TV heavily in my favor, that i would consider. Im a guy, sue me. haha.) would like another M9, 92fs, or ATI clone if possible. Would also consider a pair of Tokarev pistols and boot. Would consider a GP100 4 inch stainless (or blued if it really clicks with me). A Ruger Security Six 4 inch. A Kel Tec PMR30. Possibly a Glock 20sf or ""maybe"" a 20c or regular. Honestly, shoot me a message, worst I can say is no. 

If you have any questions or anything shoot me a message at 4058212160 or a message on here and we can go from there. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting

Wood has been refinished with tung oil varnish, which provides a flat, satiny finish. No rear sight but a Leupold 1-pc scope base is included. Nice patina on the lever, good sharp rifling although the bluing is worn at the muzzle (typical of used rifles from this period.)
Last time I shot this it had no problem giving sub-inch groups at 100 yds. with several different loads. Hate to sell an old classic but I can use the money for other projects. Make a reasonable offer and it's yours.
I also have reloading dies and a couple hundred pieces of virgin brass for this caliber, and will sell them at a reasonable price if the buyer is interested."

It has a lot of awesome upgrades. Has been shot only 20 rounds of slugs to zero the red dot sights at 50 yards. Selling for personal reasons. I am also selling my Remi 700 SPS Tactical in a separate listing.

The $700 price includes the following:
- The Remington 870 Express Tactical 12 Gauge shotgun ($570 cost). It accepts 2-and-3/4"" and 3"" shells. The Remi 870 is one of the most tried, tested and reliable shotguns in the world.
- Bushnell First Strike Red Dot Sight ($100 cost). This sight has a light sensor on it that turns the red dot off when you put the plastic cap on it, so your batteries don't go dead if you forget to turn it off. In fact, it doesn't have an on/off switch. Just open the cap and shoot, close it when finished and that's it.
- Mesa Tactical 4-Shell Carrier ($65 cost).
- Mesa Tactical Magazine Clamp that looks way cooler than the factory one (which is still included) and has QD sling slots on both sides ($100 cost).
- 5-Position Round Picatinny Clamp that lets you mount lights and lasers on it at different angles ($15 cost)
- A brand new, unused set of 4 Carlsons Choke Tubes for Remington ($80 cost)  
- Remington Choke Wrench ($10 cost)

The price does NOT include the Light+Laser combo shown in some of the photos, which you can have for $65 extra.

I am also selling my Remington 700 SPS Tactical in .308 with a gun case that is custom cut to fit that rifle and this shotgun. You can find that listing on this site separately.

Will sell for cash only for local pickup and FFL transfer in Dublin/Pleasanton/Livermore area."

If the Colt Scout line of revolvers had the fan base in the 1960s that it seems to have now, production of them may never have ceased. Whether poor marketing, bad timing, or some other factor was to blame is immaterial - the fact remains that the last of this line was built about 5 decades ago.

But in all likelihood, the fate of the Colt Scout revolvers would be the same today; more people claim to like them than would actually pay what would almost certainly be an extremely high retail price to buy a new one from Colt.

this pistol is 53 years old made in 1962 and looks like it was made last year. From what I've read, it's the first year they offered int the magnum caliber. Serial number confirms manufacture date. Not sure it's antique status, but I bet it has potential. besides that, it's just FUN! If you want to have some fun with a cowboy pistol this is a great one.  It's very accurate and the action is like butter.  it's been fired but not much.  I put 30 rounds through it. I couldn't resist :). It was flawless.  It comes with the original display box lined in felt. I don't have a reason for selling, I just like trading guns with other gun lovers and trying the next thing.  There are not many of these for sale. I posted a pic of one i found on another site and it's price."

Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. 

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."
