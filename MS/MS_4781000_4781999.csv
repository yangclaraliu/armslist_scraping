 .308 /7.62x51
Made by Zastava, model M70. 
Purchased NEW in 2013.
This is NOT a sporterized military rifle.

This rifle is identical to the Remington 798, Parker-Hale 1200, and Interams Mark X.. Zastava actually manufactured the receivers for all of those rifles. 
Typical mauser awesomeness- claw extractor, recoil lug machined into receiver body, controlled feed, hinged floorplate on milled steel trigger guard/bottom metal. Hammer-forged barrel.

Shoots well under MOA with good ammo.

The walnut stock has been free-floated and glass bedded to the action. A complete trigger job was performed, trigger breaks around 2.5 lb, perfect for hunting and very safe.

The bluing is phenomenal on this rifle. The stock has a couple small dings from falling over in the safe but looks very good. The scope pictured is not included, but I will include a 4-16x50mm scope. Leupold one piece base and rings included.

I will also include some ammo if interested, I have several types available.

Not even ONE part will exchange. Milled receiver made in Czechoslovakia, Chrome lined barrel, Striker fired (like a Glock), Hold open upon empty port cover, Can use stripper clips, SHORT gas fired piston, Lighter than an AK, Faster than an AK, Much Much more. It was still issued by the Czech Army up until 2011. They are still one of the more common weapons used in all the theaters we fight. They just are not the early Solid wood versions of the era just after the Warsaw Pact. In fact, the Warsaw Pact was the reason for it's creation. The Soviet Union wanted a universal cartridge (7.62 x 39), but the Czechs went on to build a ""better"" model of their own instead of the AK.

NOT PRESSED WOOD AND RESIN!  The Beech Wood Furniture is ORIGINAL, and is VERY hard to find intact.

If you are into collectible rifles...THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT! It will do nothing but increase in value.

CzechPoint does not produce these rifles on a regular basis. In the past, mind you they have produced around 12 per year. This is a fact that I have in writing from CzechPoint. That alone makes this unfired rifle (except 15 - 25 rounds to zero at 25 m. after manufacture) VERY Special Indeed. The Beech was used for a Very short period of time during 1959-60? You can find pieces and parts of un-matching sets on the internet, or even re-manufactured new wood. This is the original wood used in assembly at the CzechPoint facility (in the past, they have only made around 12 per year and this was #9). I have definitely Not seen 12 Beech Wood this year! I HAVE seen a few...what does that tell you? After 1958 - 1960 the Czechs found it more cost effective and faster to use a mixture of compressed wood and resin composite (most of what you see today).

Times are changing and who knows what the future holds for these Beech Wood original rifles? The value can ONLY go up!  This hand assembled VZ stands alone in it's class. If you do the research, you will find that this rifle will out perform any AK out there. Side by side. As I said before, Not a SINGLE part is interchangeable. I suppose that the above statement is simply based upon my research on the weapon prior to me buying it.

What else makes this package so special? I am also including a ""pimped out"" tactical version that includes FAB furniture from Zahal in Israel as well! This includes the folding 6 position tactical Stock with all the adjustments and inside storage, both top and bottom front rails and the rubberized grip with inside storage for two 123 size batteries and something else small. There is also a NON Zahal forward grip with pop out inserts for pressure switches too. So...What it boils down to is that you can build it the way you want. I have pics of both. I am listing the photo of the original in the CzechPoint box (as it is now) with it's 2 magazines, tool kit, bayonet and OH YES! the sticker! The bipod and night sights are on the side of the CzechPoint box in the first photo. These two extra originals give the whole setup the extra special touch! I have misplaced the CD that came in the box, but I am still looking.

I purchased the Zahal ""tactical accessories""  and put them onto the frame and took some photos. I felt that it took away what made the rifle ""unique"".  While it is already drilled and tapped for a side mount rail, I will also include a magnetic rail mount for the receiver that allows a red dot or small scope to be mounted. The rail uses a very strong magnet and supposedly returns to zero since it only has one place to rest. The jury is still out on this one. Bottom line?  You will NEVER find a package deal like this again.

Note: send me a request for more photos. I can take as many as you desire.

I am looking for a, VERY NICE 1911. ID required.
There was no choice for CzechPoint, so I chose CZ USA, the weapon is CzechPoint."

We ship or will meet locally priced on our website for 12$ plus tax or $13 if we meet locally . Here is description The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit."

Winchester Model 94 Carbine, chambered in .30-30 in “ready to go” condition. This gun is all original; no extra holes, modifications or touch-ups. Serial # 4,536,463, it is top eject & DOES NOT have the cross-bolt safety, just like the Pre-64 ones. 20” barrel, full length magazine tube, ramp front sight & the rear is adjustable for windage & elevation. This has factory supplied holes for a receiver sight (peep). Mechanically sound, functions properly & safely with a crisp action. The bore is in excellent condition; bright, shiny with no frosting. The bolt face & chamber area are super clean, it has obviously not been fired much. The blue is deep & rich, bright & shiny showing very little wear or handling marks. There are no dings or dents, but there is some is some minor scattered pitting as seen in the pics. The stocks are walnut with interesting grain with birds eyes & swirls. There are no cracks or repairs just minor handling marks, the wood fits proud to the metal & it has a nice deep finish. Perfect carbine for its intended use; hunting. It is short & compact, well balanced, great for carry in a scabbard of an ORV or horse. The Model 94 is Americas favorite rifle & the .30-30 round has put a lot of food on the table over the years.

Many prefer the Bisley gripframe for its excellent recoil control, while others like the short and handy 3-3/4″ barrel length that makes for a very nice carry size revolver. Our latest exclusive marries these two features into one sixgun that is easy to carry and can handle the heavy recoil from full power 44 Magnum loads. The stainless barrel features a pinned front sight that can be customized to your liking. The black laminate grips contrast well to the clean lines of the satin stainless steel construction. If you are looking for a “little big gun” for the woods, this is the one for you. We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $649.

It is the tourniquet of choice for many of the world's most elite and experienced warriors who have selected it for its outstanding ability to control severe bleeding, high level of reliability and ease of application. While some military units have replaced their issued tourniquets with the SOF®TT, others military units have implemented SOP's stating that the SOF® Tactical Tourniquet is to be used on all lower extremity bleeds. That means the SOF®TT is the tourniquet trusted to control the most severe extremity hemorrhage on the battlefield. The key to successful implementation of a device to be used in a high stress environment is training and ease of use. For law enforcement officers, application of the tourniquet is similar to the use of a hobble. This existing level of familiarity reduces training time and aids in the effectiveness of the device. ADVANTAGES OF THE SOF® TACTICAL TOURNIQUET 100% Effective. Proven to be 100% effective during US Army Institute of Surgical Research testing. Simple application. The SOF®TT is applied the same to an arm or leg. Unlike other tourniquets that require you to learn two methods of application and implement the proper method when under stress, the SOF®TT is applied the same way to an arm or leg. By accounting for the factors of human performance in combat, we have minimized the risk of failure. Applying a tourniquet should not be a multiple choice exam; It should be simple and straight forward. The SOF®TT provides the necessary effectiveness with an unmatched level of simplicity to increase the overall effectiveness of the device. Durability. The SOF®TT is constructed of quality, high-strength materials. The tourniquet handle is machined from a solid piece of aircraft aluminum and maintains its strength in extreme temperatures. The tri-rings are molded Acetyl, a high impact plastic that will also maintain its strength in extreme operating conditions. Reliable. The SOF® Tactical Tourniquet is designed to reduce the chance of accidental release or mechanical failure. Unlike other materials including Velcro®, the fastening system will perform when soiled, muddy, frozen, or wet. Safety set screw prevents accidental release of pressure during tactical patient movement. The screw is not required to gain hemorrhage control, but it is recommended if the patient will be moved in a tactical environment. Dual locking rings offer a back up locking system. Made in the USA.

Dealers, agencies, and collectors may take any extra 715Ps we have on hand at the same per gun price and with no additional shipping charges. Here is Mossberg International’s model 715P pistol, that looks like a cross between a Tec-22 and an AR15. Manufacturer is Companhia Brasileira de Cartuchos, CBC of Ribeirão Pires, Brazil, the company that brought us the fine little Nylon 66 copies in the 1980s. Importer and Warrantor is Mossberg International of North Haven, CT., and Eagle Pass, Texas. Type is blowback semi automatic pistol. Construction is steel barrel, bolt, trigger assembly, internal parts and screws built into a polymer frame. Chambering is .22 Long Rifle High Velocity. Barrel is 6 inch 1:16 six groove right hand rifling, with M16 cage type flash suppressor / muzzle brake. Barrel shroud is two piece, with 9 slot picatinny rail on top, and three more 7 slot rails laterally and on the lower side. Receiver cover has 15 slot picatinny upper. Sights are elevation adjustable M16 post front, and detachable windage adjustable aperture or peep rear. It comes with a 702 series 10 shot steel magazine, but with a 715T Rifle Magazine it will hold 26 rounds of .22 Long Rifle caliber ammunition, 26 + 1 fully loaded capacity. Magazine release is ambidextrous lever. Safety is non reversible, mounted forward of the trigger for right handed shooters. Bolt operating handle can be depressed to lock open. Bolt operates from the right side, similar to a Marlin model 60 rifle. Rear handle area on the upper receiver is cosmetic. Trigger is .225 smooth face, pulls at 5 pound vicinity with minimal felt creep but moderate to extensive overtravel. Finish is blued steel metal, with white steel bolt, and black matte polymer encasement. Weight empty, no magazine, is 49 ounces, with center of gravity at the magazine release pivot. This Mossberg Pistol and its mates come to us from Mossberg’s distribution channels. They are what we call factory demos; they probably served light duty with Mossberg’s sales force at trade shows and as sales reps’ samples. Surface detractions are minimal, principally a factory executed expansion of the serial number slot and the letter U stamped on the frame at that point. We rate them as Excellent, 90 percent vicinity by our estimate, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. If these pistols were fired at all, it was fewer than 50 times. Each one comes in a relabeled factory box with protective papers, cable lock, new factory issue 10 shot 702 magazine, and instruction manual that contains Mossberg’s warranty statement. Replacement pricing on this pistol in our area is upwards of $400. We’re offering the 715P in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates, each     for only     $ 189.00.         Not transferable to civilian residents of California, Chicago Cook County IL, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or New York.

Excellent for covering sizeable areas, such as the thigh, shoulder or back. Water-Jel Military burn dressings have a more durable and more compact packaging than the consumer version, and the label can be read with night vision goggles. Unit Dimensions: 8in. x 18in. (20 cm x 45 cm) Weight: 0.6 lb. Sterile Stops burn progression, cools the skin, eases pain and protects against airborne contamination. Gel-soaked, sterile dressing. When a burn occurs, seconds count! Burn injuries should be cooled immediately, otherwise the heat will continue to destroy the surrounding and underlying tissue, and may progress a partial thickness (second degree) burn into a full thickness (third degree) burn injury. This, in turn, will present serious consequences for the patient and considerable extra cost for the receiving hospital/burn unit. CRITICAL STEPS TO TREAT A BURN: 1. Immediately stop the burning process—seconds count! 2. Cool the burn—don’t overcool the victim. 3. Provide pain relief. 4. Cover and protect the burn area against contamination. COOLING BURNS THE RIGHT WAY Water-Jel Burn Dressings are a gelatinized water mix designed to perform the four critical steps for burn management in one application. Because of their gelatinous nature, they seal the burn from further contamination, they cool the burn site and relieve pain by heat transfer into themselves, and the fluids on the burn site cannot soak into the dressing nor can they evaporate through them. And finally, as the burn site cools down, the dressing warms up, leaving the site covered by a warm dressing, helping to prevent hypothermia. Water-Jel Burn Dressings will absorb temperatures in excess of 2000 degrees F—extremely important when you consider that human bone carbonizes at 1400 degrees F and other dressings could melt into the site. With Water-Jel, there is plenty of extra gel to use on any hyperemic or stasis sites surrounding the main burn, and the gel can be left on for more than four hours. ACTIONS • Provides controlled cooling by convection, not evaporation • Acts as a heat exchanger • Absorbs heat throughout the gel contact area • Conforms to the burn surface, providing total cooling contact • Does not affect core body temperature or contribute to hypothermia BENEFITS OF WATER-JEL • Stops the burning process • Portable—on the scene—when seconds count! • Cools the burn, dissipates heat • Provides pain relief • Easy to use • Evaporates slowly • Use on any burn • Non-adherent, easy to remove • Covers and protects against contamination • Helps prevent infection • Water-soluble • Won’t irritate the eyes, nose or mouth. Price is per pack. 9 packs available."

From the Website:
""Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.
The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.""

QuikClot Combat Gauze is a 3-inch x 4-yard strip of z-folded, soft, white, nonwoven, hydrophilic gauze impregnated with kaolin, an inorganic mineral that is both safe and effective in accelerating the body’s natural clotting cascade without any exothermic reactions or use of animal or human proteins. QuikClot Combat Gauze® contains an X-ray detectable strip for easy identification. Each QuikClot Combat Gauze®, Item #200, NSN 6510-01-562-3325 is packaged in an easy-tear pouch, vacuum sealed and has five year expiration. Noted as the best prehospital tourniquet in the February 2008 supplement of The Journal of Trauma The patented C-A-T® is a true one-handed tourniquet proven to be 100% effective by the U.S. Army’s Institute of Surgical Research. Tests proved that the C-A-T® completely occluded blood flow of an extremity in the event of a traumatic wound with significant hemorrhage. The C-A-T® utilizes a durable windlass system with a patented free-moving internal band providing true circumferential pressure to the extremity. Once adequately tightened, bleeding will cease and the windlass is locked into place. A hook and loop windlass retention strap is then applied, securing the windlass to maintain pressure during casualty evacuation. The C-A-T®’s unique dual securing system avoids the use of screws and clips which can become difficult to operate under survival stress or where fine motor skills are compromised. The patented Combat Application Tourniquet® (C-A-T®) featuring the proprietary red tip design and the mechanical advantage of a band within a band has been the Official Tourniquet of the U.S. Army since 2005. The innovations in the C-A-T® are protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 7,842,067 and 7,892,253.  Price listed is for one tourniquet and one Quikclot gauze pack.  5 available."

Obtaining the greatest accuracy for target shooting was the main reason for the development of the GLOCK 34 which has an extended barrel, greater slide dimensions, and unmatched reliability in a 9x19mm pistol. This highly accurate pistol has found widespread use as a competitive pistol for USPSA, IDPA, IPSC, GSSF and other sport shooting organizations.

This is not a reproduction, no cracks in the stock , and the metal has a nice brown patina. The previous owner stated it was War Between the States era and it has few markings and no manufacturer or serial numbers. From what I've found, I believe it is pre ""war of northern aggression"" era. I've not fired the old gun as I don't know the gauge ork bore but it looks about like a 28 or 20 ga at the end of the barrel and I would not be concerned to fire it, as it appears sound. Would trade to other guns or sale for $450. Or best offer. Call, REDACTED. Thanks."

Quick Overview
NAA-22LR-HG:
- 22 Long Rifle Mini-Revolver
- 1 & 1/8"" Barrel
- Holster Grips
- 5-Shot Capacity
""The NAA .22 Long Rifle is also offered in our Holster Grip configuration which allows for convenient carrying and operation. The grip folds up to allow for easy concealment and carry and folds out into a locked grip for more convenient use and control. It is versatile for many applications and is the standard by which other Mini-Revolvers are judged.

The trigger pull is as smooth or smoother than any gun the PC turns out today. Fit and finish are second to none and the stainless looks wet no matter which way you turn the gun. Whoever the Gunsmith was that built this one sure went the extra mile. Comes with everything it left S&W with including 8 front sight blades that can be changed with no tools. Also certificate of build plus case locking key still in factory envelope all housed in a beautiful Mahogany Case that's in mint condition as well. The most accurate 44 S&W ever made.

This was purchased in 2005. I set it up with the Eotech and the Rock River Arms Dominator 2 Eotech Mount. They are a perfect match. You can use either the iron sights or the Eotech without having to remove anything at all. 

Take a look at the specs on the Rock River Arms sight. If you have been AR shopping or looked around at quality you know RRA is one of the higher quality builder of non-custom ARs out there.

The original box, the additional Dominator mount, the sling, and one 30 round Magpul mag are included.

The round count is 20. About 8 years ago I took it to the range and sighted it in, cleaned it up, and then put it in the safe 'just in case'.

I've got a hankering to shoot some 3 gun competitions and I'm looking to upgrade to a specific 3 gun AR.

The price at this time is firm. If you have a real hankerin' for a gun like this and have something to trade never hurts to ask. I'll either politely decline or we can talk through some options.

PRICE $1150.00

YOU MUST BE WILLING TO PROVIDE ID, SIGN A RECEIPT STAGING IT IS LEGAL FOR YOU TO POSSESS THIS WEAPON IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. NO EXCEPTIONS. I will sign it as well."
