I'm looking to trade this for another gun. I'm open to pretty much anything except hunting rifles and most shotguns. I'd prefer to trade even, but for the right gun I can add cash if it's something I really want. You can Email me directly at REDACTED or text me at REDACTED.  I have several pictures and can take more pictures if there's something specific you'd like to see. Must meet Face to Face for trade, I am willing to meet half way for the right deal."

I do a lot of research online, said this ""AK 47"" can do 1.5 MOA, because the trigger pull is so smooth and light. Barrel is chromed, 3 mags , 2 point sling

Anyway, used less than one year, I am an OSU student, no so much time to shoot, so less than 800 rds, clean every time, love this rifle but I have to move to CA for job relocation.

if you interesting this rifle, you can stop by and try the trigger, you will certainly LOVE it ! I would say lighter than bolt action trigger, like match trigger.

The difference is that kits only come with one magazine (nice magazines btw), but I have two 12 round 9mm mags for mine. It has the night sights (Siglites) and the ""grip module"" (frame) is Magpul FDE duracoated, it's a little darker in the picture than reality. It's the size small grip it comes with. Comes with the upper (slide and night sights, barrel, dual recoil spring guide rod,) as well as the ""grip module"" and and the 2 12 round magazines. This thing is great for concealed carry, similar to a Glock 26 or 27. Concealability, plus capacity, plus not going lower than 3.5 inches with the barrel. It's essentially a whole two tone FDE P320 subcompact minus the FCU (I might get another kit later, now I have bigger worries). I'm asking $275 for it all (or $315 with the compact 15 round mag and x-grip). They sell from Sig for 399 at the moment. Yes, with 20% discount you can swing $320 (IF they have it). You only get one mag though and they don't make the kits for Subcompact. It may not look as tacticool as a Compact, but it works much better for carry in my experience and there's only a .3 inch barrel length difference. So you're not buying a 3 inch Shield, it's well rounded in all ways. Unfortunately I have to get rid of one pistol right now and since I can get a kit later, I thought doing this would be best. It's been maintained (with it's siblings) religiously using NRA mil-comm grease, lubricant oil, and a green ""safe"" degreaser (which works, even the bore after a session). Sig recommends it and I can see why, everything functions so much better and smoother. I can give a sample small bottle I have of the grease (you use it the most)  also. Make me an offer if you wish (please don't play high/low games or lowball, just give me a straight number. No offer/counteroffer for 5 or 10 minutes. Not to say I won't hear an offer and then counteroffer if it's fair and I feel it should be bit more. Just not over and over. My number is REDACTED. I also have some ads for Glock 17 stock parts to check out if you're interested. FL ID also.

YOU MUST have a P320 of any size or at least a P320 FCU trigger unit alone for this kit to work. Without it, it has no trigger system."

I can include the leather/kydex iwb holster pictured for a similar holster, extra mags, or ammo.  Also have an Alien Gear Cloak Slide holster in transit for it I could work into the deal for something. 

These are the only trades I'm really looking for right now, absolutely not interested in rifles or shotguns right now. 
I have my ccl, if interested feel free to call/text me at three 16 six 19 nine 853, texts preferred. 
Thanks!"

I have 400 rounds through it since I picked it up with no issues. Very balanced gun, feels great in hand and easy to shoot well. It is also very concealable for carry. Has the oldschool contrast sights. Perfect as a high quality beater/training gun or for a cerakote/refinishing project. I have always kept it clean. These are great workhorse guns with good aftermarket support and affordable spare parts. Compatible with P226/P229 mags. P228 mags are cheap and abundant thanks to Mecgar.

I originally bought it with the intention of cerakoting it, throwing on night sights, grips, short reset trigger and Sig Service Package but will sell it to fund other projects if I can get my asking price.

COMES WITH:
THREE 13 round Sig ""Antique"" magazines (Labeled for LE/Military Use Only) The mags are pretty old and cycle/function reliably but sometimes the slide does not lock back after the last round.

Whether you are an expert reloader or have never reloaded in your life and are looking to start a new hobby / save a little money then I have the perfect set up for you!  

This single stage reloader is extremely easy to use and very fast.  I’ve had the unit for many years and its in pretty good condition. A few rusted spots and dings but the unit is fully functional.

https://www.mecshootingsports.com/p-382-600-jr-mark-v.aspx

I am also including all of the necessary accessories to get you started.

First the Shotshell Reloading Handbook by Lyman 5th edition has everything you need.  If you are a beginner it has step by step instructions on how to reload (this book helped me start completely from scratch knowing nothing about reloading).  For the experts just flip the page to your powder brand and quickly figure out your load with ease.   

http://www.amazon.com/Lyman-Shotshell-Handbook-5Th-Edition/dp/B00162MK2M

I am also including 3 charge bars (1 for lead shot [1 1/8 oz] and 2 for steel shot [1 oz and 1 1/8 oz])
I have 14 powder bushings of various sizes
Hodgdon titewad shotshell powder (nearly full bottle – a $60 value itself)
Bag of 500 Claybusters 12 ga wads
1 shell checker tool
10 lbs of steel shot
Primers
Bag of empty 12 ga shells

This is everything you need.  You can literally go home and start loading your own shells right away!  

It’s very rewarding to take down a clay target or a dove/duck with your own hand loaded shells.  It also saves you big $$$$.  

I am selling everything as a whole unit/package so please don’t inquire about individual items.  Cash only.  I am located near downtown Dallas with easy access from the interstate.

I will also consider reasonable trades for guns. Keep in mind this package new in store would run you over $500 for shells/primers/powder/shot/reloader/etc/etc……."

G2 trigger,top hand guard mounted Bushnell First Strike.
Comes with 3 30 round top of the line circle 10 mags,500 rounds Tula non corrosive steel case ammo and about 1000 rounds surplus ammo, also comes with original wire folder stock and lower hand gaurd. 

Deduct $125 if you only want orginal wire folder and hand gaurds.  
Deduct $100 without Bushnell red dot.

This is an incredibly accurate and reliable AK. Recoil on the 5.45 is virtually none and the ammo can still be purchased for as low as $.12 a round. Amazingly fun to shoot and has been maticuliously maintained. 

Century had some barrel issues with the tantal several years ago but this gun has no such issues. It shoots true and is the most accurate AK I've ever shot and I own 3 different calibers in the AK platform.  In trying to consolidate my calibers the poor 5.45 is the odd man out of my collection.  Price with everything listed is $875, apply deducts as you wish.

These are all classic rifles acquired through the passing of a family member. If you are interested, please reply with your name and contact number and I will pass along to the family.
I'll give descriptions in the picture from top to bottom and please note, these are old firearms and while they are in pretty good shape, there are some cosmetic things that a little TLC from the right hands would clean up very nicely. Some light rust in some spots, no major scratches or dings, and all seemed to function very well.

1st up is a Ruger Carbine in .44 Mag.- also known as the Ruger Deerstalker. - it is loaded in the bottom much like a shotgun. It was produced from 1961-1985 and has a 4 round tubular magazine.I don't know what year it was made but it looks like it may be an older version- my opinion only based on the rest of the collection. $700 obo

2nd in the list is a Remington Fieldmaster 572 that shoots .22s, L & LR. This is an older model and you can tell by the weight and the wood. Heavy steel and real wood stock and fore grip. It may be the Smoothbore version- I forgot to check.  $500 obo

3rd up is a nice Marlin 39A Microgroove lever-action rifle. .22s, L & LR. This is a nice piece and would be a great addition to anyone collection. $650 obo

Last but not least is a very well built Belgian FN-49 and based on some markings on both sides of the receiver, I THINK it was built for the Egyptian Military ( 8mm). Not 100% of the caliber as I could not find any caliber markings anywhere. But it is in great shape and by the reviews I've read - are very well built and solid rifles. $850 obo

Again- you contact me, I'll pass along your name/ number to the family and I am in no way saying they are Mint condition, but they are in great shape to be that old. Thx for looking.

Please do not hesitate to message me with any questions and thank you for your interest."

I'd rate the revolver overall at 98% because no paperwork. Timing is excellent. Finish is mirrored hard chrome. Stands up to time, scratch, and corrosion better than blue or stainless. This revolver was made in 1994 and has been checked with Taurus USA and is covered by the transferable lifetime warranty. This revolver is very rare in its condition and more so in its length. A search on any gun site shows no availability of this model. They simply are not being sold by their owners, partly because of the Strength and quality of this revolver.

I bought this pistol in 2012 and have probably put around 1000 rounds through it.  It has always functioned great and has never had any kind of malfunction or jam with any of the various types of ammo I have put through it.  It is in great shape with only very minor wear and tear you would see for a pistol this age.  It is equipped with a Hogue grip and of course the standard Novak sites.  

I am selling this pistol because I want to buy something different.  I am also selling this pistol because, honestly I dont think it shoots as straight as it should.  Im pretty sure its not me but I suppose it could be.  I tried a new recoil spring but it still does not shoot as straight as I would like.  I dont think the sights are off but I suppose that is possible.  Personally, I think it needs a new barrel but it could just as easily be something else or something very minor or just that I dont shoot it very well.  

As I said, it is in great shape and has always functioned flawlessly and is a really nice looking pistol.  I will include 2 15 round SW factory mags as well as 2 16 round Mecgar mags.  All of the mags work perfect.  I used the plastic box for something else so that is not included.  I will give the pistols and mags to the buyer in a cardboard box.  

I looked around and it looked like most of these are going for about $400 without extra mags.  Since this one might have a minor issue, I will let it go for $375 with the extra mags.  I am also open to offers so feel free to make an offer also!  

As per state law, ANY BUYER MUST HAVE A VALID PERMIT TO PURCHASE OR PERMIT TO CARRY.  I will be asking to see a valid permit and matching drivers license.  Upon completion of a sale, there will be 2 bills of sale filled out, one for me and one for the buyer.  The following info will be recorded on both copies:

Serial number, make, and model of pistol
Name for both parties
Drivers license number for both parties
Permit numbers for both parties
Phone numbers for both parties
Appropriate signatures for both parties

I am willing to meet in a public but discreet place such as a mall or store parking lot or at any gun shop you choose.

Description

Unwavering in its dedication to high performance quality and durability—the Titanium Advanced Tactical Mount (TATM) developed according to Special Forces specifications reveals a helmet mount capable of rigorous activities according to Norotos’ commitment to engineering elegance and manufacturing precision.

Built with high-strength, lightweight aluminum and titanium, the TATM permits unwavering enduring stability for DOVETAIL style NVGs, while Push Button Deploy/Stow Release prevents inadvertent goggle flip-up persevering through high-velocity operations. Maximizing safety through intuitively placed operating levers, knobs, and buttons, the TATM’s patented NVG Safety Release Rotating Knob only releases upon complete 120-degree rotation.

Compact and lightweight the TATM delivers a helmet mount prepared for rigorous, high-performance demands when adequate is simply not sufficient. The TATM preserves enduring durable field longevity in a night vision mount solution while enhancing a custom-fit user experience with Vertical, Tilt, and Fore/Aft-Eye-Relief Adjustment, permitting extended operational use.

Through Norotos’ continual commitment to constant product line enhancement according to an unwavering dedication to its core values, the TATM brings together a Special Forces specified helmet mount solution engineered surpassing former standards in compact lightweight helmet mount performance.

This rifle is rollmarked ""St. Etienne Mle. 1907/15"" however it is in the configuration of a 1916 model, with the extended magazine and upper handguard. Due to this and the fact that it is in quite good condition despite rapidly approaching one century old makes me suspect that it is a post-WWI rearsenaled rifle. I cannot confirm this, though. Barrel shank is stamped 1917.

Though 8mm Lebel may sound a bit odd and obscure, new production factory ammunition is available from Prvi Partizan, and reloading components from a few other sources.

NOTICE: This rifle is a whopping 51 inches from buttplate to muzzle. This will not fit in some rifle cases. Please keep this in mind as I am not including a case in this sale.
