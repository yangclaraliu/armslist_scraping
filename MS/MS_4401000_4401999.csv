Nothing wrong with it, I just don't use it much so I would be interested in trading for something more basic with potentially some cash on top. I would be interested in a Beretta Tomcat, Taurus TCP, Taurus PT-25/PT-22 plus cash on your end (non poly version), Kel-Tec P3AT, Doubletap, etc. I will consider most any pocket pistol, but it must be just that, if it won't fit in the pocket, I'm not interested.

FACTORY NEW. Heckler & Koch USP 9mm Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. Â All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. The modular design of the USPâs internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type oaf trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.Â http://hk-usa.com/hk-models/usp/Overall Length: 7.64 in.Overall height: 5.35 in.Overall width: 1.26 in.Barrel length: 4.25 in.Weight: 1.69 lb (with empty mag)Trigger system: SA/DA, DAO"

Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members.Â The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018.

I have only put a handful of rounds through it and found it to be quite accurate.

I have my truck. I need this car out of my driveway. Will make a perfectly fine daily driver for someone. This car is clean on the inside. Needs a little work on the outside...but it will fire right up and drive you down the road.

(suspension front arm lower ball joint makes noises when you turn left), there was a toggle switch installed for the heat which works on high only, AC probably won't work for long if at all, front windows won't always roll back up...they roll down but half the time won't go back up. There are small dents and a scrape on the passenger side, the front driver's side wheel cover is missing, driver's side head light is out.

I put a brand new battery in it right before my wife decided to buy a different car. it's got cruise control, power windows, power door locks, power steering, tilt wheel, dual air bags, am/fm with cassette deck, I'm sure there are most of the receipts for everything that she had done (down to the oil changes) in the glove compartment right next to the manual.

I'm not a mechanic so I can't tell you everything it needs but feel free to come inspect it before making an offer. I'm honest and negotiable and will disclose everything we know about it.

-Fair Condition ($1039)

However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies across the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4âs dedicated following.This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use.The CX4 just begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization.Features:Caliber: 9mmCapacity: 14Barrel Length: 16.6""Finish: BlackAction: SingleOverall Height: 7.5""Overall length: 29.7""Overall Width: 2.5""Sight Radius: 12.9""Weight: 90.8 oz."

Thanks to the comfortable, relatively wide grip, there is little recoil; the gun simply bounces. It is easy to fire a second shot. The gun is very sturdy and there is no play when the barrels are locked in place. Also, with the shorter 2 1/2â³ barrels and Cowboy Defender-style frame, theÂ Mini is light enough to make the gun very pocketable"

Looking to sell or trade my Vortex Razor HD 20-60x85 spotter for a 16-48x65 model (plus cash or firearm and reloading related gear) or sell outright. 

There isnt a scratch on this and the glass is perfect. The only reason that I would like to trade it for a lower magnification model is the size. It is a great piece of glass but takes up too much of my pack while hunting/scouting and I would like to downsize. 

If giving a trade offer, I would like for your spotter to be in the same (or nearly the same) condition."

in Next Generation Body Armor available from BAE Systems Specialty
Group, Inc. This system provides a number of features that improve
wearer comfort and overall performance. The RBAV system is compatible
with the Special Operation Forces Personal Equipment Advanced
Requirements (SPEAR) Body Armor Load Carriage System (BALCS)
soft armor inserts and hard armor plates. This vest is also capable of
integrating the BALCS Modular Supplemental Armor Protection (MSAP)
system and utilizes the Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment
(MOLLE) attachment system. Ancillary components, such as the BALCS
groin protector and neck protector are also compatible with this
design.
In addition, the RBAV incorporates a new âquick-releaseâ mechanism
that can be used in emergency situations. This functionality allows the
soldier to remove the vest quickly in emergency situations, and may
also be used by medics in the field that need to gain access to an
injured soldierâs torso area without having to move them excessively.
Once the Quick-Release mechanism has been used, the vest can be
easily reassembled to provide ballistic protection.

It is excellent condition and very low round count, less than 50. It chambers anything up to 3"" magnum and has a 18 inch smooth bore barrel. Perfect tactical shotgun for home defense, it cycles smooth and fast. It comes with the patented  SXP recoil buttpad.It is the best recoil pad on the market and really saves  your shoulder when shooting heavy magnums. It holds six shells but Midway USA sells 2 shell extension tubes for it at $29.00 online. It has a big 42mm BSA red dot sight mounted on a removable picatinny rail. The large red dot is a great choice for a tactical shotgun because it works great with both eyes open. Of course the red dot can be removed for using the reliable front bead sight. I have three boxes of Winchester military 9 ball buckshot included with it. The navy is currently using this shotgun so you know it's an excellent design. $250 without the big BSA red dot or $300 with it."
