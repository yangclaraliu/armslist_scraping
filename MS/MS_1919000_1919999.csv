At the end of the 1982 Israel-Lebanon War arose an understanding that the modern battlefield had changed. One of the conclusions from the war, particularly relevant to the small arms industry, was that the battle had moved from open field conflicts to close-quarters engagements – and there was a need for a seamless transition from daylight to nighttime capability on a single mission. Out of this understanding, and after more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Rifles, Pistols, etc.

Based on my research this was produced for the Spanish Air Force. It includes the reproduction trench magazine, the original floor plate and a G3 magazine (some have reporting that the trench magazine won't work for rounds other than 8x57, but that the guts of these magazines can be swapped in with a spacer, should you decide that you want this magazine on something like a .308)

The serial numbers that I can find match, and it has the symbol for the Spanish Air Force, as seen here (not this gun): http://cdn2.armslist.com/sites/armslist/...orce_19_640.jpg

The finish is overall very good. There are a couple of spots of pitting on the outside. The barrel has very deep and sharp rifling, with some frost in the grooves. I have found this to shoot very well."

Our revolutionary FLITECONTROL wad uses a rear-braking shot cup to stay with pellets longer and choke them into a lethally tight pattern.

5.56 NATO (223 Remington), 16 in, 6 Point Collapsible Stock, Black Finish, 30 Round Detachable Magazine

This rifle was built for the price conscious user who is looking for a good quality and inexpensive AR15 style rifle for range practice and/or home defense. They were able to do so by changing some features that should NOT upset the majority of target shooting users out there. The barrel used is made in house – 16″ without m203 cuts, melanite coated inside and out, 1:8 twist rate, and 5R rifled. The 5R rifled barrel designs have been in use by Thompson Center, a S&W owned company, for a long time in order to produce an inexpensive and very accurate product. Those looking for a milspec rifle, this isn’t the one for you, but melanite has proven itself a durable, corrosion resistant, uniform coating that can be considered more accurate than chrome lining. Other differences on the Sport models include: an upper receiver lacking a dusk cover and forward assist, a lower receiver with integral enhanced trigger guard, LMT style removable rear sight and A2 style front sight, chromed gas key and bolt carrier and other standard A2 styled parts. For those budget conscious shooters out there looking for a rifle that offers good quality with a low sticker price, the M&P15 Sport rifle may be just what you’re looking for.

In double action everything is nice and smooth. In single action the trigger is light and crisp. The adjustable rear sight makes this gun quite accurate. It is a pleasure to shoot. The only reason I am selling this gun is because I have enough revolvers and I'm trying to fund my next project.

The gun comes with the original wood grips and a set of Pachmayr presentation grips. The gun also comes with a custom hand made holster. The holster alone is worth about $150. 

I'm asking $800 OBO. Like I said, I'm trying to fund a new project so I would prefer a straight cash sale, but I'm always willing to listen to trade or partial trade offers. I'm into revolvers (old S&W's are my favorite), all metal semi-autos, lever action rifles and semi-auto rifles/shotguns. I love to restore/work on old guns (both handguns and long guns), so feel free to offer up your dirty, rusty, ""project"" or ""ugly"" gun(s) as a partial trade. Worst I can say is ""no thanks"".

I would prefer to do a local deal, but will ship to an FFL (buy pays actual shipping costs)."

Introduction
The Spike's Tactical 7” BAR Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that’s machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The main benefit of the BAR rail is to those who wish to have a suppressor inside of the rail or for those shooters who have large bear paw hands and who feel that skinnier rails are just too small ( the BAR is about the same circumference as a DD rail with the popular Magpul XTM covers). The 7” BAR rail weighs in at 310 grams (10.93 oz.) and has an ID of 1.79”. 

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling. 

But wait, there’s more! The BAR has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it’s compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it’s made right here in the USA and backed by our LIFETIME WARRANTY! 

NOTE: You will need to remove your front sight base and delta ring assembly for installation. The BAR rail system installs with a Standard USGI barrel nut wrench and supplied Torx wrench.
NOTE: The BAR Barrel Nut Has an I.D. of 1.00"".

I bought this about a year and a half ago and have shot it once so far. The reason being that I have a limited amount of ranges that I can shoot lead shot shells and cannot shoot slugs with this barrel.

I know the photos are blurry, so if you want better ones, just ask and I will get them to you ASAP.

It is basically brand new as I have only shot it once, as I said. It is semi automatic and is able to hold four shells max. It is the wood and satin finish. It is a .12g with a 28 inch barrel (Mod Choke). I will also provide a case as well as 250 rounds of range ammo."

Only one SGM 10 round magazine was used in the test fire and was reloaded 3 times. Other magazines and drum are brand new/never used. The ProMag drum does need minor fitting as do all of them when bought brand new. Also with this purchase comes the manual and a box. Only selling everything together and will not separate. 650 dollars for brand new Saiga 12, 3-10 round magazines and drum is an insane deal and well worth it considering your getting a brand new Saiga for a fair used price  and all the magazines on top of that. Will consider shipping, however, face to face is preferred. If shipping is the only option, buyer must split shipping charges with me and must pay using paypal or money order.

- 100 rounds of CII Stinger 22 LR ammo

The gun does have minor wear marks (on the slide - visible in picture) from the kydex holster, but nothing major. It functions great and fires smooth; it is a tad picky in particular with Federal bulk ammo that I've noticed, so it might require more breaking in before it will eat that particular ammo. Other than that, it's a great little shooter; I have no complaints.

I would really like to sell this for $375.00 cash, but would settle for a partial trade of cash and ammo. The ammo I'd accept: 22LR and 9mm priced fair. I will respond to all posts, and if I feel your asking value for the ammo is too high, I will let you know."

The pistol, a full-size (“’ barreled) 1911, chambered for .45acp, bright polished stainless and genuine Ivory grips. The work was done by Frontier Classics in Texas, and the work is excellent, and covers about 95% of the pistol, however all of the original Springfield markings remain. The pistol may have been test-fired, but it is in truly MINT (98%) overall condition inside and out. The pistol comes with the original factory plastic box, serial-numbered to the gun, and with a factory plastic holster, mag holder, cleaning rod, and manual (no extra magazines, however). This engraved Springfield Armory 1911 looks just like an engraved Colt, the only real difference is the price, which is quite a bit less than what a similarly-engraved Colt would sell for!."

815,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1919815,For Sale:  Jennings Black Lightning / Bear Archery Compound Bow RARE CAMO DIP,"Byron Center/South GR, Grand Rapids, Michigan",$ 300,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 24, 2013",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling my bow and all my accessories. The bow is made by Jennings when it was owned by Bear Archery. The bow is one of the later generations when they started to improve the quality of the Black Lightning Series. According to online people, this has compression molded glass limbs and are more durable than the older models. The bow is in very good condition. I got this about 10 years ago as a young teenager. I practiced a few times with it, took it hunting (never got a deer with it), and put it in storage until a year ago. Originally, it was at a 24"" pull with 45lb draw weight. Last year, I went back to the place where I bought in Bay City, Michigan (Bay Archery). I am 6'-4"" so I had the draw made to about 36-40"" and 60lbs. I would say that I have shot it less than 100 times. I took it to the bow shop in Grand Rapids and paid to make sure the arrows were coming off the bow straight in the current setup. They also said that my arrow rest was setup wrong. It was setup for a 3-finger setup. They flipped the rest upside down and said that it needed to be fired that way. I have been thinking that a whisker biscuit would be an awesome setup for this bow. Has a lot of character and still looks modern. If your looking to get your kid into a bow that will grow with him, this would be perfect.

The accessories:
Kisser Button
D-Loop
Stabilizer
6 Wolverine Carbon Arrows
2 Easton Aluminum Arrows
NEW Armguard
NEW 3 Set of Game Tracker 100 gr 3-blade broadheads. (I took them out to the woods when I went hunting but never fired one. In original packaging)
Used release that attaches to wrist
NEW Timeless Archery Release (Never tried it but I think it mimics drawing with 3 fingers. Silent and similar to a hair trigger.)
Handful of unused field points
Arrow quiver
Fiber optic sight (like new. Bought it about 3 years ago but never sighted in)

I WILL ALSO THROW IN A $25 GIFT CARD TO GANDER MT.

I will consider offers. I will also look at trades like rifles or cbc shotguns with cash.  But please, I am not interested in tools or your rusty old truck, as much fun as that would be.  I don't necessarily need to sell it but I won't be using it anytime soon. Get it and practice before archery season! You can meet me at M6 and 131 or M6 and Byron Center Ave. Thanks."

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

The shotgun is also equipped with auto ejectors.

This is an absolutely beautiful gun, and is a great shooter. I am asking $1450 for it.

Hard to find weapon, so I've heard.

I bought this item for $800 after tax a few months ago and have taken it out shooting once. It's a beast and I realized that this 12 gauge is a bit more powerful than I need... 

That said I'm looking to sell for $750 + shipping/paperwork fees  [feel free to make an offer or contact me for more information/ pictures]. 

I'll ship to the licensed dealer of your choice once funds have been received through paypal (buyer and seller have protection through paypal), cash, check or money order {these must clear before I ship}.

If you're in state of AZ just show me your license, and don't be a felon.

I'm not in a rush to sell this gun- but the sooner the better. Thanks for considering."

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.
