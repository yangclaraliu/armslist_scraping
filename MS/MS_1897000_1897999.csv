There is a serial number hand engraved on the side of the action. Overall finish of the rifle is good, not perfect. This rifle has been used but the round count is unknown.

It is still in the original hard case with all the original accessories, and an extra pinky Pearce grip included as well. Only 50 rounds fired; 5 by my girlfriend, who it was bought for, too much power for her so I shot the next 45 rounds. I have my own 45 so no need, now it's up for a good deal. IL sales only with valid FOID and DL. I'm near Chicago, but in the burbs. I also have 100 rounds of WWB 45, 200 rounds of Federal 45 and 50 rounds of Winchester SXZ, totalling 350 rounds. The ammo and XDs sold as a package are only $640 out the door, cash!

Do the math on a new XDs, tax, ammo at full price, plus that tax, and this is a sweet deal.

The 3 that missed were when the scope was being dialed in and by the last 6 to 8 rounds you can see I was getting right on target.

I will consider quality handgun trades (I like Ruger, S&W and Colt 357's and 1911's) but prefer a cash deal.  If you want to trade something it needs to be a nice weapon and worth more than $600 because this rifle is worth more than $600.  I will add some cash on my end in the right deal.

To take up 2 pages and then a couple of pages later 6 pages is disrespectful and armslist was not intended for some gunshop to take up 1 or especially 8 pages..it was intended for 1 to 3 individual listings at most.. It's a great site to trade sell for individuals.. A couple of times I have sold a rifle or pistol to help pay may bills or rent in hard times. The reason you can't flag some of these listing is because it takes more than one person to flag it that's why it says the community has spoken.. There's no whining or bitching were just stating a fact.. Go to east county gun shop in elma....they have a great assortment of firearms and they have great customer service with respect...I will never purchase any firearm from ANACORTES even if it is the last firearm on earth... All I have to say is !!!!!!!!!!!!  !!!!!! Oops miss fire!!!! LOL

In .40 S&W Caliber Shooting Industry Masters Auction Benefiting First Shots More than 350 industry representatives, ranging from top administrators and factory personnel to professional shooters, will compete in the 2013 Shooting Industry Masters shooting competition July 19-20 at the Cody Shooting Complex near Cody, Wyoming. A major component of the shoot will be fundraising events to benefit the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) First Shots program, which introduces thousands of new shooters to the shooting sports each year. The Robar Companies have been customizing and finishing firearms for decades, and have developed a world-wide reputation for craftsmanship, customer service and aerospace-grade metal finishes. Robar uses their same high-tech plating process used on space vehicles and demanding industry applications, to create custom finishes on firearms that can withstand any extreme you could ever encounter. NP3+ (applied to the metal parts of this custom gun) has five times the ability to withstand corrosion as the original NP3, and up to ten times more resistance than regular nickel. Benefits of NP3+ are: EXTREMELY CORROSION RESISTANT: A 1mil (.001) thick coating of can withstand a salt spray corrosion test of 1,000+ hours per ASTM B-117 SELF-LUBRICATING: PTFE is deposited throughout the coating so for most firearms no additional lubrication is needed after initial break-in. ACCURATE PLATING THICKNESS: Coating thickness can be predetermined for nominal tolerance to suit your weapon system. VERY ABRASION RESISTANT: NP3 Plus is a very hard, abrasion-resistant coating with an as-plated hardness of Rc 35-50. In certain applications it can be heat treated to Rc 68-70 EASY TO CLEAN: NP3 Plus is easy to clean; in most cases wiping with a rag will suffice (We do NOT plate the inside of barrels; these need to be cleaned conventionally). LONGER FIRING PERIODS: NP3 Plus allows for longer firing cycles as the dry, self-lubricating PTFE-rich surface makes it harder for powder residue and debris to adhere to surfaces PLATES TO MOST GUN ALLOYS: NP3 Plus can be plated to almost all alloys used in the firearms industry. This includes steel, aluminum and stainless steel. SERVICE LIFE IS EXTENDED: NP3 Plus has a high lubricity and low coefficient of friction; therefore, the life expectancy of a firearm will be greatly increased due to less frictional wear. NO COROSSION MIGRATION: In cases where the coating is damaged and perforated, the corrosion shows no tendency to spread or migrate under the coating. EASY TO REPLATE: NP3 Plus is chemically strippable and can be re-plated without any damage to the substrate. Weapons subject to heavy use can be refurbished to as-new condition. SAVES MONEY: Taking all the attributes of into account, it is easy to see that service life, hours in service, low maintenance and ease of cleaning combine to make this a money saving addition to any firearm. Robar gunsmiths crafted a custom trigger job on this pistol, then carefully test-fired it for functionality and reliability. The final result is a hard-knocks semi-auto right at home in a duty holster, as a personal defense pistol or an “ultimate” personal handgun for any situation. The subtle two-tone look of the black polymer and subdued silver-grey of the NP3+ yields an over-all look of competency and authority. An added value is the fact Robar coated all three supplied magazines in NP3! This S&W M&P 40 has been specifically customized for this special auction benefiting the NSSF First Shots program, and is an opportunity to both own an uncompromising defensive semi-auto — and to help keep our shooting sports growing! GunBroker.com clients can participate in the excitement of the Masters, and substantially support the NSSF’s First Shot’s Program by bidding on this very capable .40 S&W auto! We welcome your participation in the auction for this Robar collectible, and appreciate your support of the important NSSF “First Shots” program!"

Don't want anything AR15/AR10 style/operating system, even if you claim it shoots steel case all day, don't know you, don't trust you, still wouldn't want your gun, sorry. Already have a Saiga 7.62x39 (converted) AK and absolutely love it. So if you have one of those lets talk (otherwise I don't want 7.62x39 unless you're priced reasonably). Otherwise I'm really more seeking the 5.56/.223 or .308/7.62x51 than the traditional AK. I know some of you may be reading this thinking, ""this is it, this is my dummy, this guy will pay me more then I paid for the gun and accessories before I shot the shit out of it and put it away filthy"" News flash, these guns are pretty regularly stocked all over the place now. I'm not the dummy some of you were praying for so if that was you just click back. Otherwise, sane, rational people with principles and morals are more then welcome to respond. I have cash, a permit to carry (just a heads up cause someone recently flipped out on me in an armslist meeting, I open carry and WILL have a fully loaded Glock 19 holstered on my hip, you're welcome/encouraged to do the same, don't trust strangers (who does?) and it makes me feel safer) can drive to meet in MN. Will want to fill out bill of sale with both parties getting copies. Please send all details you have, including PRICE, accessories, modifications if any and all of what the rifle will come with. Highballers will be read, laughed at, shown to a few other people for laughs, then deleted. Just keep it sane. I'm not expecting a $1000 rifle for $400. But I'm not paying you $1500 for your now USED $1000 rifle. See what I'm getting at? Oh. Numbers given above dont represent my spending range or limit. I will pay what a good rifle is worth I'm just not someone who'll pay you $1500 for your WASR you threw cheap plastic tactiUNcool crap on. Btw, not dogging WASRs.

One is dated via serial number to 1898 the other 1906.

These are in a field configuration, 28"" 12 ga. barrels, hammer fire, full choke, with a sight bead.

The 1898 has a steel buttplate. The 1906 has powdered remnants of a turn of the century plastic buttplate. It's not Bakelite, that was invented in 1907. Regardless of its composition, it's no longer there but can be replaced for roughly $30 by a number of online retailers. The 1906 also has a cracked stock and someone put tape on it a long time ago that's been there for a while. Either of these guns could use some love from someone more interested than I am.

The shortened version of this shotgun was known as the ""trench gun"" in WWI. They are both capable of slam firing.

I do not need to sell these guns, but have my eye on other firearms. I would consider a full or partial trade depending on what you've got."

Parts/project gun

Needs a new hammer (north of dallas has a few in stock, you'd need to ship it to match the part or contact another gunsmith in particular, in a different state, if not drive), the striker/spur on it is too short to hit the primer (often happens on these guns) ... I'm also looking into other forms of repair--in which case, I won't sell or might anyway but doubt it (I bought this as a project but just recently incurred more expenses/bills)

Also has a crack/damage to the receiver

Buy it now!! ArmaLite is proud to announce its AR-10 Law Enforcement Carbine. ArmaLite has long been known for its LE carbines chambered in .223/5.56X45mm NATO. Now comes an LE firearm with the added stopping power of the .308 cartridge. ArmaLite already manufactures well-known, dependable AR-10A2 carbines. They are based on the traditional A2 front sight, A2 upper receiver and permanent carry handle. The AR-10 LE Carbine combines an innovative A2 style front sight with the A4 flat-top upper receiver so popular for its ability to accommodate sights, scopes, lights and other LE accessories. The new A2 style front sight was designed by ArmaLite’s engineers and is manufactured from forgings here in our factory. The front sight is taller than traditional A2 front sights to account for differences in AR-15 and AR-10 receiver heights. This eliminates any issues of being able to zero your sights when a carry handle or flip up rear sight is used in combination with an A2 style front sight, on your .308 platform. The result is a spectacular Armalite .308 carbine ready for the toughest LE duty. The 16” barrel is chrome lined chrome moly. The rugged Troy Medieval muzzle brake enhances control and accuracy during rapid fire. It's tough enough to serve as an improvised breaching device if the situation calls for it. The ERGO F93 buttstock features a fixed cheek piece for a constant and repeatable cheek weld in any of the eight available stock positions. Once the buttstock is locked into position, the F93 is as rigid as a fixed stock. With a completely adjustable 4” length of pull, this stock gives the shooter plenty of room for fine-tuning the stock to their liking. Caliber: .308/7.62X51mm NATO Barrel: 16"" Chrome Lined Chrome Moly Rifling Twist: RH 11:25"" Muzzle Device: Medieval 762 Muzzle Brake Trigger: Tactical Two-Stage Stock: ERGO F93 Overall Length: 35.3"" to 39.3"" Weight: 9 LBS Accuracy: 2 - 2.5 MOA Included with Rifle: One 10 Round Magazine, One 20 Round Magazine, Sling, Black Case, Owner's Manual, Limited Lifetime Warranty Shipping to lower 48 only, Shipping $30.00 KNOW YOUR LOCAL AND STATE LAWS!!!"

It is a great shooter!  The package deal includes: 

- 1205 rounds of .22 ammo.  (One new box of Federal 525, One new box of Federal 550, One new 100 round box of CCI Mini-mags, and the 30 rounds in each of the three magazines).

- 3 ten round magazines. Two of them are brand new and one is a little older but works perfectly

- Scope.  It is a digicam scope to match the rifle and you can pick either a red or green reticle.  I honestly can't remember the brand or what power it is but it is dead on accurate.

- An ""AllenGator Tri-Mag"".  I love this thing.  It is also brand new and you can easily hook three mags together for convenient mag swaps.

- Sling

- Automatic bolt release.  I just bought this recently and installed it.  It is a must-have and makes a world of difference to anyone familiar with the stock bolt release and how you have to do finger gymnastics to release the bolt.  

- Magazine Release.  Also a new upgrade I did recently.  The stock mag release is very small and awkward as you would push it forward to release.  This one is bigger and you pull to release.  Much better!  (in my opinion)

- And last but not least, I recently installed a new Volquartzen ""exact edge"" extractor.  As many of you know, the stock extractor wears easily and leads to failures.  These hold there edge, and come highly recommended.  

 I am sorry, but I am not wanting to sell anything separately.  I want to sell all of this as a package deal and I am also firm on the price and will accept cash only please.   

If you want, I can text you additional pics.  Just let me know.  I have taken closer-up of the mag release/bolt release and also the reticle... but they only allow 3 pictures

Very nice and relatively rare Croatian PHP MV17 9 mm pistol (long barrel). These pistols are getting harder to find.

This pistol is in very good condition. Barrel is excellent and looks like new. A few light surface marks on the plastic grips and small crack in plastic handle (see photos). Comes with (2) 15 round magazines (one etched with the proper serial number) and user manual. No case is included. Gun should be cleaned prior to firing to remove the packing oil. Never use +P ammo in this pistol.

Here is a great article from American Handgunner regarding the MV17: http://fmgpublications.ipaperus.com/FMGPublications/AmericanHandgunner/AHND11/?page=45

Product Description:

PHP (Prvi Hrvatski Pistolj - first Croatian pistol) is a weapon which was developed in Croatia during its war for independence in early 1990s. Production and quality of this pistol (which was produced in at least two versions, short-barreled PHP MV 9 and long-barreled PHP MV 17) was sporadic, and it was soon replaced in production and use by the HS 2000 pistol.

By design, this pistol represents a mix between Beretta 92 and Walther P38 pistols. The basic short-recoil operated action with vertically tilting locking piece is similar to both pistols, the general appearance of the open-top slide is close to the Walther but the single return spring below the barrel is apparently an Italian influence. Trigger is of traditional double action type, and the safety consists of a manual decocking lever, located on the left side of the grip frame. Magazines are double-stack and hold 15 cartridges (2 mags total with each pistol).

This Croatian weapon is relatively rare, since production ceased after a short run and did not pick up again until after the breakup of the former Yugoslavia was well underway. The weapon is essentially a version of the Walther P-38; though it looks very different externally, the breech locking, trigger, and decocking system are the same. The only real improvement is the high-capacity magazine and the protection for the barrel.

Item not for sale where prohibited. Check local laws before purchasing as purchaser is responsible for following all state laws. No CA, MA, NY, CO or HI or Cook Co. IL sales (sorry too many home rule areas).

Also included with this is 1 gallon of Zinc Phosphate Parkerizing Solution and 1 gallon of Post Treatment Solution, both new and unopened.  Each gallon of chemical is concentrated and gets mixed with 4 gallons of water for 5 total gallons of each, which is the capacity of each tank.  

I paid right around $450 shipped to the door for the pair of tanks/lids and around $125 shipped to the door for the chemicals. I will sell everything as a set for $425.  Located in Dublin and you must be willing to meet in the Dublin area for the sale.

Here is the description of the tanks from the manufacturer:

6""x6""x40"", pure 304 Stainless Steel. Tank, cover, and Stainless Steel ball valve are included. 

We are proud to offer the very best Parkerizing Tanks in the industry. They are cut and formed out of pure 304 stainless steel. Handles are formed right into the ends. All edges of these tanks are hemmed, so there are no exposed sharp edges. Feel free to handle these tank with your bare hands! 

The tanks are TIG welded using supreme skill and elaborate tooling. The outside of the welds are treated and polished to reveal the beauty of the stainless steel and show the excellence of the weld. We maintain complete passivation inside the weld during manufacturing. Please look at the last picture taken of the inside of the weld, you will see that it remains brilliant and shiny. If you see a weld in stainless steel that is black or rust colored inside this means that proper provisions were not taken and rust and breakdown will start immediately when your liquid is applied."

Requirements were issued in 1949 that the pistol had to be chambered for 9 mm Parabellum and could not exceed 7 inches in length or weigh more than 25 ounces.[2]
Candidates included Browning Hi-Power variants by Canada's Inglis and Belgium's Fabrique Nationale, and Smith & Wesson's S&W Model 39. Colt entered a modified version of their M1911 pistol that was chambered for 9 mm Parabellum, had an aluminum alloy frame, a short 4.25-inch barrel, and a 9-round magazine. In 1951, Colt moved their candidate into regular production. It was the first aluminum-framed large frame pistol in major production and the first Colt pistol to be originally chambered in 9 mm Parabellum. The first year's production included 45 ACP and 38 Super chamberings.
In 1970, Colt introduced the all-steel ""Colt Combat Commander"", with an optional model in satin nickel. To differentiate between the two models, the aluminum-framed model was renamed the ""Lightweight Commander"".

The Lancer Systems L5AWM Magazine is a polymer and steel hybrid that combines the best features of each material. The one-piece steel feed lip unit is permanently fixed to the polymer body. The steel is hardened so the dimensions will not change in long term storage or rough use. The PTFE coating ensures the steel will not rust. The polymer body is designed with an internal dimension that is a constant curve, combined with a no-tilt follower for maximum reliability in feeding 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition. The exterior texture of the polymer body is aggressive for improved grip when changing magazines. The steel feed lip assembly and the polymer body are corrosion and chemical resistant. The translucent smoke body allows you to see how many rounds are remaining in the magazine. The Floor plate slides off similar to a USGI magazine for cleaning and maintenance.
