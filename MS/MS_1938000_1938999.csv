The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle."

In addition to lawful owners, many gangsters of the pre-World War II era favored the Model 1903 and Model 1908 because they were relatively small and easily concealed. It is said that Al Capone kept one in his coat pocket and Bonnie Parker used one to break Clyde Barrow out of jail after smuggling it into the jail by taping it to her thigh. Bank robber John Dillinger was carrying this model of pistol when he was shot by FBI agents outside the Biograph theater on July 22, 1934, and another famous bank robber, Willie Sutton kept one when was captured by police in Brooklyn on February 18, 1952."

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

The Detonics Combat Master was the first really small and compact 1911-pattern pistol to be produced in significant numbers.  Law enforcement fell in love with it immediately due to its diminutive size and quality.  The Detonics started in Seattle Washington in the late 70's and in the early 80's the Mark series introduced the bulged barrel end so that the pistol did not require a bushing.  It also incorporated double and triple recoil springs.  It was the first production 1911-pattern which was throated and ramped for hollow-points.  This gun is in very nice condition.  The Detonics Mark III has hard chrome finish.  This is a rare pistol that is a great size for concealed carry.  It is a bit heavy but this really helps with the recoil.  It comes with 2 original magazines and original Pachmayr grips.  Asking $750 or best reasonable cash offer.  Looking for a nice .22 Magnum Rifle but cash is King on this deal so I can order what I'm looking for.  Call/Text Rick 5O5*6IO*529I

Excellent condition with some slight pitting on the side of the receiver. Dutsche Waffen-Und Munitionsfabriken Berlin 1916 stamped receiver. From what I've been told, this is a pre-war Gew98 that was reworked in 1938. Nazi Germany took its existing G98s left over and often modernized them to K98 standards. This meant cutting down, or in this case replacing the barrel, changing the stock, bolts, rear sights, etc. It has a BO stamp on the barrel, which should indicate a Brohmler Brothers manufacture. All #s that are on the gun match. The stock looks like a Russian capture, but there is no ""x"" on the receiver. There is no electro pencil markings. There are imperial Germany proof markings on it, along with Nazi factory code marks. The bore is bright, VG lands with slight frost. I fired 5 rounds to check for function, it works a-ok! It has a cleaning rod, and if I can find it, I have a sight hood to include as well. I'm in and around knoxville quite often, and I'm willing to travel if you are.

I was told that this gun belonged to and was carried by a US Marshal for 15 years. I cant prove that in anyway but it makes sense, someone definitely carried this for years. There is holster wear and a small crack in the plastic hand grips (they are original grips, Colt had dumb idea of putting plastic grips on police/detective spc from 47'-54'). Gun shoots straight, the cylinder is in good shape, and the gun has been mechanically very well maintained. Like I said definitely a ""working"" gun. 

Two 50ct boxes of PMC .38 Spec will be included in purchase if bought locally, if I have to ship it I cant include the ammo for obvious reasons. 

I will ship to an FFL anywhere in the country, but keep in mind it is a pistol so it will have to be sent over night by law so shipping will be about 65$ (that's not me that is just the price to ship threw UPS http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/ship/packaging/guidelines/firearms.html).

I am open to trade. Have an offer? Just ask worst case I say no. I am a firm believer in haggling as well and am not offended when someone makes an offer that I think is low. Think of 500$ as the sticker price, that being said 1st person to offer 500$ gets it right away Hahaha.

Made in the early 1950's by Zastava. I bought this rifle nine years ago from a local gun shop that was selling these rifles fresh from the milsurp rifle market that has long past.

This rifle comes complete with its accessories, original Yugo issue sling, Bayonet, scabbard w/frog, ammo pouch, and the cleaning kit consisting of the pouch, oil can, bore brush, and rope. The bore is very good, sharp lands and grooves. Finish rates 95-98%. All the serial #s match on the Bolt, stock, and floorplate where appropriate on a Yugo M48. 

This would be an excellent rifle for the milsurp shooter and collector alike. These hand select M48s with the matching serials and complete with accessories.

Feel free to Email at: zfox1944(@)gmail.com if you have any questions or additional photo requests. 

I can do FTF in Twin cities area or in southern Minnesota. I am also willing to ship direct to C&R FFL holder if out of state. Three day inspection period will be honored. I will accept USPS Money order, Bank certified check, or Personal check (must clear before I ship.) 
Thanks for looking!"

It is up to the person (not a firearm dealer) to decide if they wish to sell a firearm to an individual. I wouldn't expect to be sold a handgun just because it is legal to do so. 

Go ahead and whine on here about how fair it is not to be sold one, but remember you are dealing with an individual person. They might not want to sell one to anyone under 40, an that is their right.

I paid $270 for the gun ten years ago, the scope was $90, $20 rail, $75 worth of mags, and $20 bucks worth of ammo. About $480 retail for all this stuff; and it is rare to find one of these all metal 10/22's in like new condition from back when Ruger was still making quality 10/22's. I think $400 would be fair."

I like it so much Im looking to buy a 2nd one. Im willing to pay $550 for the same gun and Ill pay an aditional $25 per extra mag other than the two that come with. I have a Lifetime CCP and Im a lifetime resident of Indiana. Im in my 40's so your not selling your firearm to a kid or a straw purchaser for gangs or terrorist. If I havent found a gently used one before the sale is over Ill probably just buy another brand new one for $575 at ZXguns on Coliseum blvd. Thanks fellas and now Im gonna go practice ;)

120 rounds of Federal Premium Guard Dog .45 ACP
About 13 rounds of mixed hollow points: 5 Corbon and 5 Remington. 
350 rounds of plinker ammo (Blazer, HSM, PPU)

Ok! So here's the deal! Times are hard and I need some money. If you're remotely Interested in the Winchester ammo then You know how hard it is to find and how ridiculously overpriced its been. Same goes for the Federal Premium ammo. Ive seen some crazy prices and some ok prices. I'm going to pass on some damn good savings on to someone. Here's the stipulation.... I will not break up the Winchester, the Guard Dog, or the plinker ammo. So:
500 rounds of Winchester for $500
120 rounds of Guard Dog for  $120
13 miscellaneous rounds for   $13
    That is a dollar a round on ammo priced from 1.25-2.00 a round. Think about it. 
 350 rounds of plinker ammo  $175
     .50 cents a round
Also.... 145 shells for 12ga.     $ask about them and possibly get the 2 3/4"" shells for a dollar a piece. Please don't call or email me with some bogus offer claiming you can get this stuff cheaper. I've looked and researched before I bought it months ago and now that I need to get bills squared away. If you can find it cheaper you won't be contacting me. That being said please do the math and remember 500 rounds for $500, 120 rounds $120,  13 rounds for $13, and plinker ammo at $.50 a round (for all 350 rounds) thank you for you're understanding.
