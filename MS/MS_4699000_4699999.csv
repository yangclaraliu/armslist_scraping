Included with the lower: the single piece, solid forged, non-removable, over sized for gloves trigger guard. A typical six position telescoping stock is standard, along with sling mounts allowing for single or double point sling attachment. There is even a bayonet lug just in case. All of the M&P15 Sport’s parts are interchangeable with the rest of their AR15 product line.The M&P15 Sport’s barrel isn’t an M4 cut. This cut in the barrel will allow to mount a M203 grenade launcher. This additional cut also does not help the harmonics of the barrel. We think this a advantage that will help accuracy but will ultimately come down to the ammo used. The Smith sports a full profile barrel of American 4140 Steel. The bolt carrier and gas key are chromed, and the barrel sports their Melonite coating. Smith claims that the bare bones approach has no effect on durability. There have been reviews with this rifle firing 85,000 rounds of various brands of ammunition without any visible damage to the Melonite finish. We have found this to be a very reliable platform and so have law enforcement and countless other agencies. The engineers at Smith and Wesson made a great call when deciding to reduce the cost of their AR15 by not including a forward assist most shooters don’t use forward assists often, and when they do, it can lead to a dangerous situation. When using a forward assist, there is a potential for an inexperienced shooter to use the forward assist to jam the bolt forward when it is not the right response to a jam. A forward assist on any AR15 could cause the cartridge to get super stuck in the rifle. The original Mil Spec on the AR-15 did not include the forward assist. Smith and Wesson made another good call deciding not adding a dust cover to their M&P Sport AR15. Most AR15 shooters have little or no need for a dust cover because they’re firing from safe and clean environments. The M&P Sport is mostly used at shooting ranges, hunting, etc. In this day and age everyone is looking for the best value out there and with out any doubt this is it, you are defiantly not paying for any unneccessary features on this model. 30 Round PMAG MagazineAdjustable Front and Rear Sights6-Position Telescopic Butt StockChrome-lined Gas Key and Bolt Carrier16"" Barrel 1 in 9” 4140 Steel 5.56 mm NATOReceiver 7075 T6 Aluminum Hard Coat Black AnodizedUPC: REDACTED63MFG: 811036"

This particular rifle is Model 1903-A3 made by Smith Corona Typewriter Company back in January 1944. Subcontractor barrels give high collector value.

It had been assembled by Smith Corona with 4-groove barrel manufactured by High Standard. Those barrels proved to be very accurate, and I did 1/2 inch groups at 50 yards bench rest with my target hand loads. Other guns have 2-groove barrels.

It is hard to come across gun like this these days, as contemporary hunters and shooting enthusiasts value the rifle for its beauty, dependability, and adaptability for almost all U.S. game animals, and with proper gunsmithing, the M1903 makes a wonderful sporting rifle, comparing favorably with many modern firearms. Authentic examples of Smith-Corona rifles, especially with excellent barrels are uncommon for sell, and are in collector's hands.

This rifle has excellent bore, chamber and muzzle. Absolutely no rust or corrosion. No cracks or splits in the wooden parts. Inspector's cartouche is by EmcF. It has small Ordnance Escutcheon and a circled serif ""P"" is present inside the pistol grip. It is hard to create a clear photo image from the right side of stock. Bolt extractor has ""S"" marks and Bolt has square Safety Lug, Arrowhead on top of Bolt Handle and single Digit under Bolt Handle (this is normal for Smith-Corona bolts). Receiver is marked ""US Smith-Corona 03-A3 and serial number), Barrel is marked ""S C"" over ""Flaming Bomb"" and ""8 43"".Butt plate is Smith-Corona, and is checkered with 11 lines per inch.

This gun is also a tack driver. If you have read about how 9mm M&Ps are inaccurate, please note those reports are universally for the full size model. The compact models such as this, have a very good reputation for accuracy. This a great turnkey carry gun. I'm only selling to pay some bills.

I purchased it new about a month ago from Rainier Arms, mounted it a couple weeks ago, fired 50rds for zeroing and fun, and then purchased the the circle dot model because my wife saw it at the store and decided she liked it better. It's a good sight from what little experience I've had with it. I decided to give it a try after coming across many great reviews and was not disappointed by it or the one I just replaced it with.

I believe MSRP is about $249 on these. I honestly don't remember exactly what I paid for it  at the moment but I do have the receipt in the box which I will include for warranty or any other reason it may prove useful. I am asking $180 or best cash offer within reason. I am also open to trade or partial trade offers but for a straight trade I would expect something of at least $200 in value. I would prefer to deal somewhere in the Maple Valley/Black Diamond or Kent/Covington area but am negotiable. If your interested, want to make me an offer, or have any questions just send me an email and I will do my best to respond in a timely manor. If you would prefer to talk or text just let me know, include your number, and I will reply accordingly.

I've had it for about a year. It's been in my garage since the day I got it. I have stored some gear in it, but I did not use the foam inserts, so the Pick N Pluck foam insert kit is totally intact. The O-Ring, pressure valves, wheels, latches, and handles are all in excellent shape. Like I said, it's basically brand new.

You can use multiple configurations to set it up for one gun or multiple guns. Guns and gear can lay flat or be set upright like a gun cabinet depending on preference. Being that it is completely sealed, you can get it completely submerged in water or buried in sand or dirt. I believe it floats with up to 280 lbs in it. It would make a great SHTF box or long term gun storage case.

Great rifle, got it about a year ago.  Now that I have learned more about the AR platform I am just looking to build one myself.  Need to sell this one to have money for my build.  Rifles has less than 1000 rounds through it, finish is free on major scratches and blemishes.  I still have the entire package from when I bought it including lifetime warranty.  I have made some minor upgrades:

Magpul MOE grip
Magpul RVG vertical grip
Magpul MBUS rear sight
Troy Front sight for low profile gas block
NC Star Scope with red and green reticles
3 9"" accessory rails for handguard
Magpul XTM Enhanced Rail Panels alternating colors black and grey
One Mag that came with the gun
Hard plastic case
Do have some other accessories I would be willing to part with if interested

This is great and accurate AR-15, perfect as a beginner to intermediate AR-15 when your not looking to spend a bunch of money.  Gun sells for a little less than $900 from stag or any major store.  I have put at least $200+ into the gun in accessories, so I'm looking for around $750.  Plus I need about $900 for my build so its pretty close."

Included with the lower: the single piece, solid forged, non-removable, over sized for gloves trigger guard. A typical six position telescoping stock is standard, along with sling mounts allowing for single or double point sling attachment. There is even a bayonet lug just in case. All of the M&P15 Sport’s parts are interchangeable with the rest of their AR15 product line.The M&P15 Sport’s barrel isn’t an M4 cut. This cut in the barrel will allow to mount a M203 grenade launcher. This additional cut also does not help the harmonics of the barrel. We think this a advantage that will help accuracy but will ultimately come down to the ammo used. The Smith sports a full profile barrel of American 4140 Steel. The bolt carrier and gas key are chromed, and the barrel sports their Melonite coating. Smith claims that the bare bones approach has no effect on durability. There have been reviews with this rifle firing 85,000 rounds of various brands of ammunition without any visible damage to the Melonite finish. We have found this to be a very reliable platform and so have law enforcement and countless other agencies. The engineers at Smith and Wesson made a great call when deciding to reduce the cost of their AR15 by not including a forward assist most shooters don’t use forward assists often, and when they do, it can lead to a dangerous situation. When using a forward assist, there is a potential for an inexperienced shooter to use the forward assist to jam the bolt forward when it is not the right response to a jam. A forward assist on any AR15 could cause the cartridge to get super stuck in the rifle. The original Mil Spec on the AR-15 did not include the forward assist. Smith and Wesson made another good call deciding not adding a dust cover to their M&P Sport AR15. Most AR15 shooters have little or no need for a dust cover because they’re firing from safe and clean environments. The M&P Sport is mostly used at shooting ranges, hunting, etc. In this day and age everyone is looking for the best value out there and with out any doubt this is it, you are defiantly not paying for any unneccessary features on this model. 30 Round PMAG MagazineAdjustable Front and Rear Sights6-Position Telescopic Butt StockChrome-lined Gas Key and Bolt Carrier16"" Barrel 1 in 9” 4140 Steel 5.56 mm NATOReceiver 7075 T6 Aluminum Hard Coat Black AnodizedUPC:REDACTED63MFG:811036"

Springfield Armory armors and engineers were challenged to understand the many mechanical complexities involved in converting an M-1 Garand combat rifle to an accurate shooting match grade M-1 Garand in 1955.. 

I bought this rifle some year ago from an older gentleman, some years ago and have spent more time researching its origin, then shooting it. He said the bought it directly off the shelf at the CMP store.    
Note: Parts were not originally stamped with the ""NM"" logo until 1957-58. Stocks bedding was starting to be refined in/or around the same time.   
In 1955 Springfield Armory produced a number of newly machined receivers to closer tolerance specifications with serial numbers stating at: 5796945 for ""NM"" grade. And serial numbers 5813163 for ""NM"" Type II. 
The Serial Number of the rifle being sold is: 58097XX

the weapon is a accurate shooting rifle. Some exterior finish ware on the gas cylinder. No dings or dents.

I added new gas (Non-adjustable) plug that softens the recoil rearward operating rod hammering, witch works great with any type of ammunition and saves the parts from any ""slamming""damage.

I am now, going on 70-year old and am have problems focusing through the small aperture and rather sell the rifle to someone whom appreciates the shooting the rifle, rather then modify the sight."

Optical engineering advancement produces a generous 3.3 inches of constant eye relief while decreasing overall scope length to 13.9 inches. Its 3x to 15x magnification range make it a viable choice for myriad applications, from LE and military operations to benchrest competition to varmint and big-game hunting. The TARS features a patented illuminated-reticle system with 10 levels of intensity, including two for use with night-vision optics. Its non-forward emitting LED is much more efficient than current systems; One CR2032 battery provides 30,000 hours of use. Four reticle choices are available an intuitive MOA reticle (Model 101), Trijicon-exclusive JW mil reticle (102) and two duplex versions (103 and 104).

Popularly-named the Perfect Repeater at its introduction, it largely set the standard for pump action shotguns over its 51 year high-rate production life. From August 1912 until first discontinued by Winchester in May 1964, nearly two million Model 12 shotguns were produced in various grades and barrel lengths. Initially chambered for 20 gauge only, the 12 and 16 gauge versions came out in 1913 (first listed in the 1914 catalogs), and the 28 gauge version came out in 1934. A .410 version was never produced; instead, a scaled-down version of the Model 12 known as the Model 42, directly derived from scaled drawings of the Model 12, was produced in .410 .The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432www.LincolnPawnShop.com"

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

851,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4699851,For Sale/Trade:  NEW - H&K VP .40,"Toledo, Toledo, Ohio",$ 0,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 17, 2016",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,40 cal                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"The VP40 is the .40 S&W model of the acclaimed VP pistol line first introduced in 2014 with the VP9 (9 mm).In development for more than four years, the VP Series is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.Experience gained by HK engineers with the P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP, but the VP Series breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.Heckler & Koch pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs.The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.The VP40 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six grip side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.Although influenced by other HK models, the VP Series has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.A new feature found on VP pistols is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength.VP40 pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines; either 13-round or reduced, 10-round capacity magazines.VP Series pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces (160 grams).VP pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.The VP40’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.The VP40 is essentially the same dimensions as the 9 mm VP9 model. The overall height of the VP40 is one millimeter (.04 inch) taller. The VP40 also weighs 2.37 ounces (67 grams) more, 28.93 ounces for the VP40 versus 26.56 ounces for the VP9.VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the VP Series is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis.The VP40 has a suggested retail cost of $719. A law enforcement configuration VP40 with tritium night sights and three magazines is also available for $819. VP40 pistols are available now (June 2015)."

915,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4699915,"For Sale:  Ruger Redhawk 71/2"" Barrel with scope mount Blued NICE","Port Charlotte 33952, South West Florida, Florida",$ 425,"Listed On: Sunday, October 4, 2015",Handguns,Ruger                                                                                ,44 Magnum                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"I am still interested in trades.  You cannot touch a Redhawk for anything close to this inexpensively anywhere.  The weapon overall is in nice shape.  The barrel end has bluing missing from holster wear and from the heat of shooting Hornady 44 Remmington Magnum Zombie rounds.  It does not affect the function at all.

I have owned a Model 29 Smith and this is a whole 'nother animal.  It is a beast - it puts them right in the pocket at 75 ft a sub 2"" group is easy.  This is a really awesome defender or a very capable hunting weapon especially with a scope on the included mount.

You should go to the website of the scope mount - it is the first patented scope mount that does not require you to permanently alter the handgun.  The installation video is pretty interesting - you can do it yourself and it provides a rock solid scope mount for this weapon that can easily take most game (and food is no good but servings are too small guys) on the North American continent.

The bluing is bad near the tip of the barrel and there is a common thin scratch and wear around the cylinder where the lock rides.  THE REST OF The frame, the rest of the barrel and the cylinder the bluing is quite nice - shooting pictures of a blued gun with a flash makes it look like it is all spotty apparently.  

$425

Keep in mind the stippling and holster wear on the tip 1"" of the barrel is NOT a functional problem.  I get that the cosmetics of the end of the barrel are a turn off that is the reason it is so inexpensive.  A clean blued Redhawk goes for $600 at least on Gunbroker.

1 mostly full box of ammo is included the value of that alone is $40 so you are down another $40 for the gun itself minus $65 for the Jack Weigand www.jackweigand.com weaver scope mount - that is down another $65 for the gun.  Minus $20 for the included Outbags full length holster and it is like you are paying $20 less for the gun.  Plus the hard case by Flambeau Tactical for $20.  That is $145 of swag to go with the revolver. 

I will trade this- I am interested in trades of shapes and sizes especially 45 acp trades.

if you text me an offer I am not going to be mean to you.  I hate it when I text someone an offer and they are pissed off at me because I offered something lower than they believe is ""right"" for the weapon.  So I will not flip out.  What I will not do is answer questions that are already answered in this add.  If you text or email me something that is in the add I will refer you to the add.

If you have a trade please send a picture of it via text or email - I will want to see everything before I can consider it.

I live in North Port, Fl 34286

I will 1) Require ID when you make the purchase or trade
       2) Only meet for a sale or a trade in my home - no longer will I meet in a parking lot to do a gun deal - that is unsafe for us both.  At least if you are coming to my home you can tell someone exactly where you will be instead of ""in the Home Depot parking lot near the dumpster"".
       3) We will both sigh a bill of sale - I will not ever sell a weapon without documenting it again.  I sold a rifle recently to someone who really unsettled me after the sale and I simply will not go through that again.

These three conditions are for honesty and safety for BOTH of us.

Thanks for looking.

The price is specific because I am buying something and that is the amount I need!"

The brand new bullpup-rifle from IWI that's taking the world of modern semi-auto rifles by storm. After more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Bullpup configuration; short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy

Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles

Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies

Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR® SAR parts

Last round hold open on empty magazine
