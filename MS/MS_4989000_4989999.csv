Both guns are patriot arms meaning no paper work required just the way America originally intended. I think everybody knows this particular Taurus was made in a Beretta plant with the same tooling as the famous m9 or pt92 Beretta this thing shoots like a cadillac asking $425obo same asking price for the Canik $425 obo these are fairly new to the gun market here in US but they are made in turkey in an ISO 9001 plant meaning quality control is there number1 focus and if they blow it they will lose all the rapid rising momentum they have gained in a short time. These are used by several militaries, swat teams and police forces around the world, very reliable and looks awesome in this desert tan. As far as a trade for the canik I would like to trade for a home protection high capacity shotgun. Or I would trade both pieces for a nice .45 pistol. I would also consider a package price around $750 for Both.

Pistol was bought with the intention of being my primary carry pistol, but I opted for a different configuration so the pistol sat untouched.  

Pistol comes with everything pictured: box, case, two magazines, bushing wrench and all paperwork.

Would like to get what I put into it, $650.  I'll even throw in a pair of Magpul grips I had bought for it, too, but never used."

I purchased one of each caliber offered and I've only had a chance to shoot the .45 once in the last 8mo. It was great and accurate. I only put 2 boxes through it(9mms get more use lately). Here's the breakdown of what I did with this pair of handguns:
I bought Para OEM Stainless Match barrels and had Ten Ring Precision cut, thread, and fit them to each pistol with a new GI recoil system, barrel bushing, and recoil lugs. (Standard barrels and full length guide rods are sold).The Recon model is a commander length handgun. The .45 holds 14 + 1. I paid $1199.00/ea for the gun. Bought the match barrel for $175.00, Ed Brown recoil plug $10.00, Wilson recoil spring guide $8.00, Wolff spring $9.00, threading, fitting, and testing $215.00(sold the full length guide rods and barrels for $95). I bought a couple of additional OEM mags $25/ea. So you will get 4 magazines total. $1666.00 deduct $95.00(spring & barrel) = $1571.00 invested in the pistol.
Gun shown with TiRant mounted(suppressor NOT included). I had the .45 threaded for use with the AAC Short Piston so that it functions without the gap normally seen between guns and suppressors. I'll ship the pistol to your FFL outside of Texas that accepts from individuals. Within the state with a valid CHL. Discrete PP gift preferred or you cover fees. Otherwise, USPS money order.

Caliber-Specific Rimfire Riflescopes are built to match your favorite target and varmint calibers. The caliber-specific EXT bullet-drop reticle takes the guesswork out of long-range shooting with crosshairs precisely calibrated to the bullet drop of a specific caliber. Once you've determined the target range, simply take the corresponding crosshair, put it on target and squeeze the trigger. The enhanced multicoated optics feature a wide field of view, amazing clarity and efficient light transmission. They are also water-, fog- and shockproof. Low-profile turrets provide a streamlined profile. 1/4-MOA adjustments."

Selling my excellent condition P239 in .357 SIG. A few small scratches, but other than that it's gorgeous. This is an amazing weapon.

This is single stack, 7+1 beautiful lady and she definitely packs a punch. The .357 SIG round is amazing for self defense, and has always been my preferred caliber for carry.

This package includes:

- The gun...of course!
- Mitch Rosen ""President"" leather holster (Extremely comfortable).
- Hogue rubber grips, installed already.
- Factory grips.
- 2 magazines.
- 17 rounds of Speer Gold Dot 125gr GHDP defense ammo.
- 18 rounds of Hornady Custom 147gr JHP/XTP defense ammo.
- 7 rounds of Winchester Ranger 125gr SXT (Already loaded into one of the mags).
- Factory SIG case.

Asking $600 FIRM for this package. For an $800+ gun, with a $145 holster, a bunch of ammo, and Hogue grips...you won't get a better deal than that. My loss, your gain!

From the modified Diamondback aluminum four-rail handguard, to a variety of color, sight, and stock options, the Diamondback DB15 represents value and versatility all at a very affordable price. The DB15SB is the basic DB15 model that features an ATI Strikeforce Stock, an A3 Flattop Forged 7075 T6 Aluminum Upper Receiver and forged lower receiver. It also features a 16"" 4140 chome-moly barrel, a standard 2-piece handguard and an A2 style pistol grip. As the basic DB15 model, the SB15 has a black anodized hardcoat; it does not include a forward assist or a dust cover.

Premium components, runs like a scalded dog. Hell of a deal.

I’m selling my AR15. It’s been a great rifle, and I’ve done some recent upgrades to it, but I’m looking for cash for other projects. Total wear and tear is less than 3,000 rounds. I used this during a Larry Vickers carbine/pistol class over the summer and haven’t shot it since then. I recently replaced the barrel, muzzle device, gas block & tube, and the rail (see details below). I haven’t even fired it after the upgrades. The paint job is just Krylon, so if that’s a road block, it can be stripped with ease. With everything included, this is almost a $2,000 gun. However, I’m looking for $1,100 OBO, I’m willing to negotiate on price as well. Cash or money order. I prefer that you have valid CCW so I know that I’m selling to a lawful citizen.
