The die has vents to prevent case damage caused by trapped air and for excessive lubricant. Headspace is held to minimum tolerances to avoid changing the case body length during full length sizing.

(Note:  The photo is of #0009, however you are buying 0005, I just don't have a good photo of it). This is your only opportunity to purchase this single digits serial number AR-1641 lower. Numbers 0001-0009 went to the family, friends and organizers of the fundraiser. Not to mention these SOLD OUT within 4 hours of delivery.

I am a private party so I can sell this to a person 18 or older. An FFL requires you to be 21 to buy a stripped lower. This has never been on a 4473 as a rifle, so at this point it can still be made into a pistol or a rifle.

I have only seen 3 of these sell, and the higher serial numbers still went for $250-$275. I think $475 is a reasonable price for this fine lower. If it doesn't sell locally, it will likely end up on at an auction as it will likely bring more money on that venue. (This particular lower is NOT color filled, but this service can be done for $20-$40).

Bluing is typical for age (fair to poor, no rust etc). Bore is good, gun is accurate.  test fired for accuracy, then cleaned and stored.  5-digit Finnish serial number

Highly unusual bolt, including markings from all 3 New England Westinghouse facilities (Meridian, Chicopee Falls, and East Springfield) plus the US arsenal flaming bomb. This was a US manufactured bolt that was purchased by the US when Russia defaulted on the Westinghouse contract, and likely was issued to US troops during the 1918 Siberian expedition.  It evidently made its way to Finland at some point thereafter, then back to the states almost 100 years later. Quite a trip.
Magazine follower is also marked with the Westinghouse logo.

As a 1896 receiver, gun is classified as an antique by the ATF, and is therefore legal for interstate sales without a background check.  I will consider buyers from neighboring states, but will ask to see ID.  All state, federal, and local laws apply as with any private sale :)"

GEN 4 Universal sight tool, Best tool on the market
Handgun Sight Pusher Tool Universal for 1911 glock sig springfield and others
This is the new gen 4 universal sight tool 
What sets it apart from our previous sight tools, and most all the other tools on the market,
Is how it grips the slide. This tool grips ""all 4 sides"" of the slide to keep it from trying to tilt the slide while it exerts the thousands of pounds of force required to adjust or remove the sights. This tool does not need the extra block sets to ""TRY"" and grip the slide like most of the other tools offered on the market.

By the use of non-metallic inserts that you bring into contact on the sides of the slide ""AFTER"" snugging up the lower clamp block you stop all chance of the slide tilting. 

QUALITY 
This tool is built from Billet 6061 aluminum made here is the USA.
The pusher block is built from 4140 ""cromo"" steel to meet the required strength. 
All of the hardware is US made grade 8"

1944 Izzy Mosin Nagant M44 with matching serials(except the magazine floor plate). Has some upgrades/custom work done to it. Brand new firing pin spring, Custom adjustable front sight red fiber optic/metal target post(can change them out.)http://www.smith-sights.com/ and a mosin accuracy kit installed.(shim kit you can see it on that page I linked) I also fixed the common ""sticky bolt"" issue that Mosins have.( Extractor usually the culprit)
Rifle hasn't been sighted in since the new front sight was put on. I also have all the accessories that originally came with the rifle when I bought it ten years ago. Sling, belt pouches, oil can, tools and manual. I also have stripper clips. I have a Mosin front sight tool, a sight pusher, don't feel like taking a picture of it. Bore does have wear, it's a 70 year old rifle...


The stock was sanded and sealed(not by me, I prefer the original red color)

Smith & Wesson M&P 15 with Magpul hand guard. 1-8 twist 5R barrel!  So none of the downfalls/issues like the newer 1-9 twist model.
Have original gandguard & box.

This .223/5.56 is a very sought after model as it will literally fire anything you put through it. 
I have yet to hear of one of these models ever jamming, and I can say that this one has never jammed on me. Again, this is a 1/8 twist 5R, so its barrel is coated correctly, none of the crap they now put in the newer 1/9 twist models. So it has none of the downfalls and will actually last!
The rifle has seen ~600 rounds; 150 or so of it was aluminum casing, was only $10/20rounds (and that was the price when there was an ammo shortage a couple of years ago)

A conservative estimate of condition is 90-95%; it's pretty nice, but not perfect, so there are a few (but not a lot) very light ""dings"" on the stock and metal.  The box is long gone; sorry!  I have the rifle available for your inspection if you are interested in looking.  If a deal involves shipping, it would have to be to your FFL, and you would pay for shipping and insurance (FedEx ~$35).
The pistol has just been sold and is not available.  The cowboy hat is still available @ $25, and is a quality lined product, sized about 7&1/8.  It is made by Rockmount Ranch Wear out of Denver, and is a ""Tru-West * Top Hand"" style 78.  The Sheriff star is not included or for sale.

The Sig Sauer SB-15 Stabilizing Brace is a shooter's aid that is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols. It is made from high-quality, elasto-polymer and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.

It was originally sporterized by Golden State Arms in the late 50's. They called it the Model 1942 Sharpshooter. Original sights were going removed, barrel shortened to 22"" and the stock was sporterized by cutting it down, adding a rubber butt plate and throwing away the hand guard and barrel bands. They added a ramp front and rear peeps. They did some polishing and a little bedding. The rifle has the original 2 groove barrel. I recontoured the stock, removed all oil, removed old hard butt pad, added a new sorbothane pad, rebedded action , and refinished with 14 coats if tongue oil inside and out. I have never fired it and I seriously doubt it has been fired much if any at all. I just have no use for it. It has the original military stock that was sporterized. Pistol grip cap and foreend cap were added and now it not only looks good, it feels good too.
I'm asking only $200. Call/text 360-536-7234."
