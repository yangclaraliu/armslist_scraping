The only flaw if you could call it that is the stock has been cut down about an inch as the original length of pull was way too long for my arms. Adding something like a Pachmayr pad brings it back to original length  Works flawlessly with full power loads, fires 9 rounds in less than 6 seconds. Less than full power and it gets finicky depending brand of ammo. Remember this uses 2 3/4"" shell only don't use 3"" inch.

The foundation for this 1911 is a Norinco slide, frame, and match grade barrel. Norinco is a carbon-forged steel, 5100 series chromoly steel to be precise (everyone else uses 4100 series), and this is a better metal than almost all manufacturers use today. Bill Wilson of Wilson Combat began making 1911's using Colt and Norinco, none other, and somehow we have decided Norinco is garbage because of the country it comes from. Cerakote job from K2 precision in New Albany. All Wilson Combat internals, comes with one regular mag and an extended mag. Custom punisher grips. Cash can be added for the right trade. Really going for a Mk25.

Please don't tell me you're looking for a ""higher-quality"" foundation for a 1911, only Colt, Springfield or Caspian use carbon forged steel these days besides Norinco. This is one of the best put together 1911's on the market for such a fantastic price. It will outperform any standard 1911, especially stainless or aluminum. Thanks for checking this out."

The bolt and carrier both pass a thorough Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) test for guaranteed structural integrity, and the gas key is properly staked to its mil-spec bolt carrier. All steel parts feature a heavy Mil-Spec Phosphate finish for superior corrosion resistance and durability, while aluminum parts are Type III Hard Coat Anodized.  This DDM4v5 features the new DDM4 12.0 Free Float Quad Rail Handguard that extends forward over a pinned, low profile gas block to create one long, uninterrupted top rail platform, as well as providing ample room for mounting tactical accessories and enhancing the system's accuracy potential by isolating the barrel from outside influences. The DDM4 Rail combines the best features of Daniel Defense's previous handguard designs to create an entirely new and improved platform. The 1-Piece Lower Rail of the handguard has been located closer to the barrel for an exceptionally slim, compact exterior footprint that is more comfortable and ergonomic to hold in the off-hand. The DDM4 rail is secured to the upper receiver with a new Bolt-Up System using 4 steel fasteners for rock solid stability and repeatable positioning of rail mounted accessories, and includes 4 Integral Quick Detach Sling Swivel Sockets for a multitude of sling mounting options. This DDM4v5 Upper is equipped with a Mid-Length Gas System that offers the advantages of a longer sight radius and a smoother recoil impulse, and comes complete and ready to fire with a charging handle assembly, Daniel Defense Flash Hider, 3 low profile ladder rail covers and a Daniel Defense Vertical Fore Grip.

This (almost) classic collector comes with an inexpensive scope, 4 10-round mags and also the original mag., about 100 rounds of name brand ammo (mostly Remington). The bore is spotless, the bluing is about 90% and the wood is about the same. The rear ramp sight is not original to the gun, it's a flat finish steel; identical to the original blued one, just not shiny. This would make a great wild pig gun, and a coyote wouldn't stand a chance! Load up with 125 grain bullets and do a little woodchuck hunting.
    I work too many hours to travel very far to meet, but can meet at exit 25 on I-77 at the county fairground parking lot or somewhere close  to I-70 around Cambridge. Also, I am not willing to ship- too much can go wrong for either party.

History:

George Kellgren, a Swedish born Engineer & gun developer, moved to the US and eventually founded the firearms company Grendel, Inc. in 1987. In 1990 he developed and introduced the Grendel P-30, which was a .22wmr Pistol that had the capacity of 31rds, and weighed only 26ozs fully loaded. The pistol remained in production until 1994, when Mr. Kellgren sold the company. He founded another firearms company, Kel-Tec CNC Industries, or better known as Kel-Tec, and began producing firearms once again in 1995. In 2011, Mr. Kellgren produced the PMR-30, which was modeled from his earlier P-30 design.

A used Taurus PT92AF 9mm blued finish (slight holster wear on the front edges of the slide)  in good condition & very well maintained (cleaned Regularly after each trip to shooting range)

These pistols are of very good quality, both accurate & reliable IF you aren't familiar with them do a little research online & you will see for yourself. They are known as the Beretta M-9 clone, but they are actually an improved version of the M-9, Taurus produced these pistols using a Beretta factory in Brazil & made design changes to the pistol w/ improved controls & materials.
This model has a rail & has safety/decocker & is single/double action & can be carried cocked w/ safety engage (cocked & locked). It has the Loaded round indicator & Taurus safety system key lock (never used it)
It has standard 3 dot sights & comes with the original configuration of 2 mags (1-19 round & 1-17 round) original box & papers (& original checkered plastic slab grips).
This pistol has performed flawlessly every time I've shot it and is very simple to maintain/ clean. Never had any issue w/ an FTE/FTF with any brands or types of ammo & it will basically eat anything. Cheap 115 grain steel or brass case,  124 gr +p JHP or 147 gr FMJ or 156 gr buffalo bore ammo. It seems to like 124 grain FMJ any brand for best target accuracy out to 25 yards & beyond (yes I've plinked milk jugs at 50 yds w/ this pistol)
Included upgrades are the Houge rubberized grip panels & a professional trigger job to polish the internals of the trigger group & a Berretta ''D'' spring to lighten the trigger pull & overall the trigger performance is very nice with a clean break & reset.
As stated above the original configuration +upgrades  is for sale for $400.00 Firm - don't email asking if I will accept less, that's pretty tacky considering you have Not even shot this pistol or even seen it in person.

Additional accessories:
1 factory Taurus mag 17 round (cost $30)
1 promag 20 round mag (cost $15)
Bulldog black nylon holster ($20) has mag pouch, belt clip & loop & is large enough to accomidate rail mounted light)
led/cree type rail mount weapon light ($25)
Pelican 1450 case ($40)
These additional accessories are available for sale individually for the prices listed but I prefer to make a package deal with the pistol all for one price of $500.00 obo

This may seem like a lot for a used gun & yes I know new ones sell for $399+shipping+FFL fees, but do your homework the later models are getting some bad reviews and have had some quality control issues that this gun does not have its proven reliable & accurate.

This gun still has/& will continue to carry the Taurus Lifetime warranty so if there is ever any issue (which I doubt), mail it to Taurus & they will either fix or replace the pistol.

  I hate to sell this pistol, as you may notice I've spent quite a bit of time/money on this gun, but I bought a new pistol & my wife said one of my collection has to go. So I am making an offering.

Created via a collaborative effort between Remington Arms Company, LLC and TrackingPoint, an applied technology company in Austin, Texas, the Remington 2020 is programmed specifically for the hand-selected Remington rifle and the ballistic performance of the ammunition being used.
Power up the unit and you are treated to a Heads-Up Display (HUD) over your
field of view that provides visual aids for shot set-up. The Remington 2020 allows you to designate a target and have an internal ballistic calculator generate an immediate, precise firing solution that accounts for range and all environmental factors using multiple integrated sensors. This is accomplished through a shooting sequence referred to as Tag, Track, ReactTM (TTR).
This rifle will range out to 750 yards. It figured out all ballistic solutions from rifle can't, inclination, bullet drop compensation, wind, temperature, humidity, spin drift, Magnus effect even coreollis effect (earth spin). You just tag the target. Point at the tagged for when the reticle Turns from blue to red you squeeze off. I've ran 30 rounds of Barnes tsx through it and never missed a 9"" gong out to 550 yards. I have videos the scope recorded and also videos from my phone. You really can't miss. Linux based computer software. It is water proof under normal Hunting conditions. Just don't submerge in water. 
In addition to the HUD and the Tag and Track technology, the system broadcasts a
Wi-Fi signal allowing others to see a streaming live video feed from your HUD via a smartphone app. For the first time, another person can share what you are seeing and doing. The system also automatically records video and audio of every shot fired so you can easily document each shooting sequence and share proof of your shots with others via a second smartphone app.
The benefits of the Remington 2020 go beyond the consolidation of gear currently required to perform ballistic calculations and the improved speed with which you can make decisions. The use of the Remington 2020 goes beyond better shot placement over longer range. The real benefit is the confidence. Less hesitation. Less limitation. And a far greater understanding of how ballistic variables affect your sport. All of which encourages a more ethical hunt. REDACTED

I’ve owned it for exactly 4 years and just don’t shoot it enough anymore to keep it in the safe.

I have done some modifications over the years to make the gun a bit more like a 3-gun shotgun. Modifications include: Daves Metal Works mag tube (9+1) & barrel nut, updated M1 forend, M4 buttstock, Sure Cycle recoil tube assembly, TacStar side saddle, Arredondo charging handle, GG&G bolt release, and a Nordic billet barrel clamp.

I’ve only ever shot 00-buckshot through it. I believe the choke is a ‘full’.

The gun is in pretty good shape for its age.  I've taken good care of it since I’ve owned it.  It does have a few wear marks in the finish on the receiver.  Just average wear from using the gun and getting it in and out of the safe.  But there’s no rust anywhere, the bore is nice, and the gun runs well.

Also included:  Original mag tube and spring, barrel clamp, barrel nut, charging handle, recoil tube and spring, and two more chokes.


I’m asking $900 for it.

I also have a Surefire flashlight forend for it that I would include for an extra $80, if you want it."

Up for sale is BRAND NEW – Leupold VX-3 3.5-10x40 DUPLEX Cat. 66090 Xtended Twilight Lens System Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System™. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System®, using Leupold’s® index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won’t be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When we combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.  DiamondCoat 2 Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2™, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we’ve ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.    2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.    Lead Free Leupold optics offer better optical clarity as a result of lead-free glass lenses. In addition to its superior optics, the lenses are produced with none of the environmentally damaging by-products common to standard glass production. A small step, but one in the right direction.    Generous Eyebox The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high power, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight pictue that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.  Blackened Lens Edges Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical prerformance.  Twin Bias Spring Erector System  Super Fast-Focus Eyepiece  3:1 Zoom Ratio  CDS (Custom Dial System) Leupold CDS™ models allow you to quickly dial your elevation to different sight-in ranges with a custom adjustment matched to your specific ballistics information. The CDS dials change out easily, allowing you flexibility with different loads, conditions and calibers.Every CDS dial features ¼-MOA click increment finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-2, VX-3, VX-6 and VX-R even more accurate and rugged.How the CDS™ System Works The CDS System works by laser-inscribing your scope's elevation dial to match your load, velocity and conditions. Your scope will be in perfect synch with the way your rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads.Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into account:  BAS (Ballistic Aiming System) Leupold’s® Ballistics Aiming System™ is comprised of five specialized reticles – Boone and Crockett® Big Game, Varmint Hunter’s, LR Duplex, LRV Duplex, and the new SA.B.R. reticles – which take into account the variables crucial to accurate, long-range shooting. A special ballistics indicator ring allows users to customize their power settings for their cartridge’s ballistics, then saves that setting for easy reference in a hunting situation. With multiple aiming points for longer ranges and varying wind speeds, and infinite power selector settings to match your rifle’s ballistics, the Ballistics Aiming System can help you master the art of accurate, long-range shooting. It has proved so successful in helping hunters learn how to shoot accurately at long range, we’ve expanded your BAS options with additional reticles offering many of the same benefits as the original reticles. We’ve also made them available in more riflescopes than ever. With practice, the Ballistics Aiming System will teach you how to gauge the distance to your target, where to place your reticle for that distance, and even how to compensate for wind deflection. With the Ballistics Aiming System and some practice, you’ll consistently make shots you wouldn’t have attempted in the past.Accurate, long-range shooting is probably one of the most difficult hunting skills to master. For many hunters, it remains a combination of hard-won experience, intuition, and a little luck. Together, the reticles of the Ballistics Aiming System give the hunter very useful tools for successful hunts with clean and efficient harvests. By practicing with the Ballistics Aiming System, all hunters can add science to the art of long-range shooting, and master this important skill.One System, Five Unique ReticlesThe Boone and Crockett Big Game reticle and the Varmint Hunter’s reticle use the same principles to help you hone your long-range shooting skills, though each has been tailored to meet the needs of big game or varmint hunters. With practice, using each will become a natural part of your shooting. Unlike other range estimating reticles, the calculations made here are incredibly simple, and take the guesswork out of long-range shooting.Each reticle provides a series of aiming points. The first aiming point, the intersection of the Duplex® reticle, is to be used at 200 yards with most common cartridges, and 300 yards with several flatter shooting, longer-range loads. The Boone and Crockett Big Game reticle and Varmint Hunter’s reticle also provides you with two different power selector ring settings, indicated by large and small triangles on the power selector. These allow you to select the hold points best suited to the cartridge you are using. In some cases, the smaller triangle setting can be used with your slower, heavier bullet load, and the large triangle setting with your faster loads in the same rifle. The new SA.B.R. reticle also features holdover points and a power selector matched to different load settings for muzzleloaders and shotguns. The LR Duplex and LRV Duplex reticles are designed to be used only at the maximum magnification settings.For example, a 30-06 with a 180gr spitzer bullet and 2700 fps muzzle velocity would use the smaller triangle setting. In the same rifle, a 150gr spitzer bullet with 3000 fps muzzle velocity would use the larger triangle. We have designated three sets of cartridges to be used with the large and small triangle settings, and sight-in distances of either 200 or 300 yards, described as Group A (large triangle, 200 yard zero), Group B (large triangle, 300 yard zero), or Group C (small triangle, 200 yard zero). Verify the aiming points by shooting at the actual distances at which the hold points in the reticle are intended to work. With the LR Duplex and LRV Duplex reticles a shooter can tailor the reticle to his or her load by varying the magnifications, thus altering the subtensions. With all four reticles, remember: pratice, practice, practice!    MST (Motion Sensor Technology) An important feature of select Illuminated reticle models is the Leupold-exclusive Motion Sensor Technology (MST). A single touch of the button or twist of the dial activates the illumination, offering several different intensity settings (depending on model) including a high/low indicator (FireDot reticles only). The reticle will automatically switch to “stand-by mode” after five minutes of inactivity, then reactivate whenever the rifle is moved. This eliminates the need for excess movement reaching for buttons, while extending battery life (powered by a readily available CR-2032 coin cell battery.  1/4 MOA Target  1/4 MOA Finger Click Finger click adjustments for windage and elevation (¼-MOA) offer absolute repeatability and dependability over a lifetime of extreme use (metric adjustments – 1 cm per click).  3rd Generation Illumination  Side Focus  Custom Shop serviceable  EFR Adjustable Objective  Adjustable Objective  One inch Maintube  6061-T6 Aircraft Quality Aluminum  Tactile Power Indicator with Range Estimation Tactile power indicator also features built-in range estimation functions and graphite O-rings for easy operation.  Leupold Scope Cover Keep your Leupold® riflescope looking like new.

Protect your scope in storage or in the field.  Factory Standard Reticles Leupold offers more factory standard reticles than any other scope manufacture. Our line of hunting scopes feature over 20 different popular reticle configurations including Leupold's own line of Ballistics Aiming System reticles.If that weren't enough, most Leupold scopes may be configured with your preferred reticle through the Leupold Custom Shop.

His father used it mainly for (Florida - ‘Key Deer’) deer hunting, and passed it on to Tom, his son, in the 50's; who 'retired' it from hunting in the 80's. It has not been fired for over 10 years; at 70, he has decided to sell some of his guns. This rifle is 106 years old! It is in excellent mechanical condition; sharp rifling with no pitting or problems. The wood is absolutely beautiful... typical of the early Winchesters! But it shows some of its ‘age’ being a ‘Used’ rifle... misc. SMALL Dents and Scratches. The only two significant signs of ‘’her’ age are first is in the fore end, it has a long, 'old', tight crack that can be seen to the pictures: Secondly, there are a couple of small, very TIGHT, cracks in the ‘pistol grip’ area. The overall ‘Bluing’ is ‘good’, with wear only on the ‘edges’... BUT at the end of the barrel! There is some light pitting, and significant loss of ‘bluing’... I believe someone attempted ‘cleaning’ with a ‘fine’ abrasive, which also removed some of the ‘bluing’; see the pictures. NOW the PERKS / EXTRAS!! It comes with TWO correctly marked (.351) clips: AND the Rear Sight is very unique and RARE; marked ""Chas. Daniels"", from the early 1900s. Contact for additional pictures.

The A300 Outlander is the latest evolution of Beretta’s 300-series gas-operated semiauto shotguns, which have sold by the millions to hunters and sportsmen around the world.

And there’s a reason for their popularity: unbeatable performance as well as great value out of the box. With its 3” chamber, Mobilchoke barrel and self-cleaning piston, the A300 is there to get the job done with Beretta-style quality and reliability--whether it is upland hunting, waterfowling or at the sporting clays range.

One of the things you’ll appreciate about the A300 Outlander is the fact that you can easily adapt it to your measurements and shooting style. This shotgun gives you the possibility to customize the drop and cast of the stock by means of spacers that you can insert between the action and the pistol-grip. Also, the safety is reversible, making it a snap to adapt the A300 for a left-handed shooter.

The A300 is made of the proprietary steel blends that have made Beretta shotguns famous for their durability. The Mobilchoke barrel is designed to shrug off the pounding of heavy hunting loads, giving you a long-lasting tool that will work as hard as you need it to. But in spite of its toughness, the A300 is light, feels lively in the hands and easily follows your eyes to the target, thanks to the low-profile action. And its impeccable balance make it feel even lighter than its 7.25 lbs, meaning that this attractively-priced shotgun will give you premium shootability in spite of its unbeatable value.

This shotgun is the perfect embodiment of Beretta’s philosophy about maintenance: easy, quick and tool-free. The A300 Outlalander breaks down into four major components, making it simple to take apart and clean even under less-than-ideal field conditions. Also, the self-cleaning gas piston makes this shotgun shoot much cleaner than other actions, giving you more durability as well as less work keeping it in perfect shape even after a hard day’s hunting or clay-shooting. Overall, the A300 Outlander is today’s best value in a semi-automatic shotgun, and a worthy heir to Beretta’s legendary 300 line.

The upper receiver looks like a VLTOR, but is a production over-run from a manufacturer that cannot advertise who they made their uppers for. The lower receiver is a Aero Precision with a Aero lower parts kit. The lower receiver extension is a longer version of a ""pistol"" lower tube which when combined with the 11"" barrel makes the overall length of this firearm 26.5 inches. The BCG is Nickel Boron. The handguard is 10"" keymod very strong but very lightweight too. The barrel is 11"" chrome lined and is chambered 5.56 with a 1:9 twist. The sound and flash director keeps all the flash and noise going forward instead of sideways and up / down.

As the pictures show is how it will be sold. I have approx. 400 SS109 62 gr fired through it with zero FTF's or FTE's. This firearm is awesome to shoot and is very accurate.

The price is $590 and I will sell ""only"" to a Arizona resident with a Arizona CCW. The buyer will also sign a bill of sale which is a CYA for the two of us. This is a fantastic price for a fantastic firearm. 

No trades and please be respectful of my decision to sell only to a Az resident and Az CCW holder.

Thank you for looking at my high quality, very fair priced build. :-)"

The upper receiver looks like a VLTOR, but is a production over-run from a manufacturer that cannot advertise who they made their uppers for. The lower receiver is a Aero Precision with a Aero lower parts kit. The lower receiver extension is a longer version of a ""pistol"" lower tube which when combined with the 11"" barrel makes the overall length of this firearm 26.5 inches. The BCG is Nickel Boron. The handguard is 10"" keymod very strong but very lightweight too. The barrel is 11"" chrome lined and is chambered 5.56 with a 1:9 twist. The sound and flash director keeps all the flash and noise going forward instead of sideways and up / down.

As the pictures show is how it will be sold. I have approx. 400 SS109 62 gr fired through it with zero FTF's or FTE's. This firearm is awesome to shoot and is very accurate.

The price is $590 and I will sell ""only"" to a Arizona resident with a Arizona CCW. The buyer will also sign a bill of sale which is a CYA for the two of us. This is a fantastic price for a fantastic firearm. 

No trades and please be respectful of my decision to sell only to a Az resident and Az CCW holder.

Thank you for looking at my high quality, very fair priced build. :-)"

Accu-strut harmonic stabilizer is included as pictured.

I bought this gun a while back to do a full restore but have run out of time/interest, and want to sell it to someone who will actually use it. Basically the only thing I planned to do that's left is rebluing the receiver. It's in good shape, but I just wanted to shine it up. It has a new extractor, extractor pin, and extractor spring. New bolt catch pin, spring, and cover plate. New Wolff extra power recoil spring, new SS gas pipe, new stainless forend stock liner AND barrel stock liner.
