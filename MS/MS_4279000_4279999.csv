Here's what EOTech has to say about this model:

The XPS2 is the shortest, smallest and lightest EOTech model holographic weapon sight available without night vision. Its size and weight make it convenient for hunters and law enforcement officers to carry.

It is also fast and runs on a single 123 battery. The compact, single-lithium-battery configuration leaves more rail space than ever for rear iron sights or magnifiers."

German Sport Guns / American Tactical Imports GSG AK-47 22LR Kalashnikov 90th birthday commemorative model. This is number 49 of 1919. The rifle comes with everything that originally came in the box: hat, key chain, bag for stock, tool kit, picture signed by Mr. Kalashnikov, trigger lock and manuals. The rifle has a real steel AK side mount installed instead of the polymer unit that ships with the gun. It has a 1X red dot sight with Russian writing on it. I don't know much about it. It is mounted high so the iron sights can also be used. Dot is adjustable in size. This gun has been shot. My wife has put about 500 though it and she loves it. It's her favorite plinker but we are moving on so to speak. Rifle is in great shape. 2 small dings (1/8"") on special Minelli Italian made stocks.  Limited Commemorative Action: Semi-Automatic Caliber: 22 Long Rifle Capacity: 24 Round Barrel Length: 16.5 Inches Overall Length: 34.5 Inches Safety: Lever Grip Style: Pistol Includes: 2 Magazine 10 rd and 24 rd Commemorative & Edition #49 of 1919 on receiver Signed Photo Of Kalashnikov Limited Edition Stock: Wood made by Minelli Sights: Adjustable AK Weight: 9.6 Pounds Safety: Manual Color: Matte Black"

Prefer local sale, but will ship to lower 48, add $18.00 to the price.   Cash or US postal money orders only, no exceptions.

No trades at this time, got another project I'm working on.
This is a package deal, would prefer to keep it all together, and it's a great deal considering you are saving a couple hundred bucks.

Price is firm and very fair.   Please call or text, I'm not around the computer much and my emails are slow getting to my so called ""Smart Phone"".   843 670 96three six

If you are unsure of the legalities of owning a 14.5"" upper, you can research it on the BATFE website.  But in short, you cannot legally buy this and install it on a rifle lower receiver in the condition it is in.  The flash hider or an even longer one would need to be pinned and welded according to the BATFE guidelines to bring the barrel to 16"" or longer before you can install on your lower.  There are many flash hiders and compensators on the market that fit the need and some will enhance the performance of the weapon system once completed.  My experience with this barrel length shows me that the accuracy is darn good out to about 400m, beyond that, I use a rifle length upper.  I personally run the FSC556 Compensator/brake and the H6 buffer combined to achieve an ""almost none"" recoil.   Ammo is too expensive to waste missing your target.

With over seventy-five years in the business, Weaver Optics is an American company dedicated to assisting the hunter's pursuits at a great price.  The 36x40 T-36 Target/Varmint has all the features needed in the competitive shooting circles.

The 36x40 T-36 Target/Varmint feature Weaver's Micro Trac® 4-point elevation/windage adjustment system, which allows you to adjust one without affecting the other.  Conventional adjustment systems employ two adjusting screws and a single biasing spring, which eventually results in the spring affecting the adjustment of the other axis after you've tried to adjust one screw too far.  Rather than bearing down directly upon the erector tube itself, the Micro-Trac® 4 Point System bears down upon a single, consistent point of contact-for repeatable, unparalleled accuracy.

I'm selling my M&P AR -15 made by S&W for $1300 or best offer. It only has about 200 rounds through it and has many upgrades:
-Timney 3lb competition trigger (very smooth and made my groups very small)- worth $230
-Nikon monarch 4-16x scope specifically calibrated to the .223 / 5.56 round and Leupold single piece mount - worth $600
-Bipod - $45
-Foregrip - $25
- Laser/light combo - $70
- Quad rail - $45
- Magpul adjustable stock - $45
- rubber pistol grip - $15
- Aftermarket sling and sling mounts -$50
-Also, rifle comes with nice a blackhawk soft carry case and 2 30 round magazines.
As you can see, there is over $1100 dollars worth of upgrades on this rifle. Also, this model of AR-15 is not the crappy ""sport"" model offered by S&W. This is a step above that with a better barrel, dust cover and bolt carrier group. It was $1060 brand new. I'm also going to throw in 800 rounds of ammo for free, which is worth an additional $300. So, you're getting almost $2600 dollars worth of stuff for $1300 obo. Please don't offer me 900 for all of this. It's a ridiculous deal as it is.
I would be willing to sell the scope and rifle separately, I would take 1000 for the rifle and I'll still throw in the free ammo. The price is negotiable, Please feel free to call or text anytime, day or night: REDACTED"

The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Price $399 will take some trade's let me know what you got...

The Career 707 blew the doors off the PCP market when it was introduced in the US in the 1990s. Even after all these years, this airgun continues to be a favorite among hunters.

The variable power levels give you a huge range of energy for taking small- and medium-sized game at distances previously reserved only for firearms. The gun is manufactured by ShinSung, a Korean company that knows what hunters need and want, because Koreans have been using the Career far longer to hunt all types of game.

The Monte Carlo Indonesian hardwood stock has a raised cheekpiece and checkering on the wrist (directly above the lever). The forearm also has checkering to ensure a firm grip when you're in the thick of things. The lever-action cocking mechanism works quickly, smoothly and effortlessly as you chamber each pellet from the multi-shot magazine.

The number of shots you can load in the mag depends on the length of the pellets, but most people load about 6 pellets (although you can fit 10 Crosman Premiers!). Longer ones take up more room, so you won't be able to load as many. 

The built-in manometer (air pressure gauge) shows you how much air remains in the two built-in air reservoirs, located directly below the barrel. This air rifle was the first to offer adjustable velocities with its integral power wheel. Adjust the wheel to accommodate heavy or light pellets, long or short distances and the type of game you're shooting. The gun adjusts to YOUR needs instead of the other way around! Max velocity is 1,250 fps in .22 cal. and 1,000 fps in .25 cal. You'll get up to 20 full-power shots.

The two-stage trigger can be adjusted to your shooting preference. The front sight is a hunting-style ramp with a bead, and the rear sight is fully adjustable. The Career 707 is known for its accuracy."

That was the build list from Tick Performance, since then I have added the following parts from Tick Also. In mid to late 2013 I had the following Camshaft package put on, it came with things like a better oil pump, ect. Also the same time this was being installed I had a Snow Performance Meth injection kit installed, and I had a different size boost pulley put on. The car currently makes 12lbs of boost. The only negative things currently with the car is, the headliner is falling down, and the Parking brake cable needs to be replaced. (the rear tires need replacing soon, i have brand new tires ready to replace them.) I also have the original wheels that came with the car.

Model: Finnbear
Caliber: .30-06
Barrel Length: 24 inch
This is a very clean Sako Finnbear Sporter in cal. 30/06 Spfld. The overall condition of the rifle, in my opinion, is excellent + with only a very few light handling marks in the stock forend. There are no cracks or gouges in the wood. There is some dryness in the Sako recoil pad. The original blue is 99.5%. with an excellent bore. This rifle appears never to have been hunted and apparently has had limited rounds through it.The scope is a vintage Redfield Widefield, 4X with duplex reticle. The scope is clear and bright but I do see a speck of dirt or something on the outside edge of the lens about 11 O'clock.. Other than what is mentioned, the scope is in excellent condition, both function and cosmetic. This is a used gun and, as such, should be examined by a qualified gunsmith prior to firing. This rifle is going to make someone a really nice hunting rig. The rifle will be very well packaged and shipped insured for the full amount of it contact me if interested.(REDACTED)"
