Looking to sell or trade my black Bushmaster ACR enhanced . It's maybe a month old, with a low round count. 400 rounds: 200 rounds Perfecta, 100 rounds TulAmmo, 100 rounds PPU. Didn't have a problem with any of them, though the TulAmmo was a little dirty, as you might expect. It's a really nice rifle and shoots great, it just isn't my slice of pie. There are really minor handling marks in the usual places, like on the deflector.

Comes with all the goodies: nice hard case, 30 round pmag, magpul flip up sights, cable lock, all original manuals and paperwork. It just needs a new home so don't be afraid to make an offer or maybe partial trade?

The grip and stock have been swapped out for Hogue parts. Also comes with a complete factory Daniel Defense 556 lightweight upper. I’ve replaced the front sight post with a Troy low profile gas block and added a 15 inch Troy Alpha rail with a set of offset iron sights as shown in photo.. Less than 500 rounds have been fired through this upper. Have the DD hard factory case, and the box the 556 upper came in. The optics in this package are both lightly used. The first is a SWFA SS HD 1-4x24 front focal plane scope with a illuminated donut reticle. Great condition with clear/scratch free glass, but minor ring marks. It comes with a SWFA branded switchview lever. The second scope is a Vortex Viper PST 1-4x24 also in great scratch free condition. This one comes with a Vortex branded switchview lever. Both come with Vortex branded ADM QD mounts.

This is a high quality setup that I hate to let go. 300 blkout is a great caliber for deer/hog hunting or shooting suppressed. It uses all the same parts as 556 except the barrel so no trouble in finding spare parts.

If you are not familiar with S&W's short time spent producing all-metal firearms, the M645 is a handgun that is the dad to the M4506. The rarity is justified by all firearms manufacturers producing guns that have polymer (plastic) parts. You will not find any polymer on this gun. It is a double action modern take on the classic 1911. Grips and extended magazines are widely available for this firearm. Think of it as the Harley Davidson Fatboy motorcycle of the 1911 world. UNIQUE CHARACTER. I am selling to pay for eye surgery. 

If you purchase the firearm, you will also get a duty holster (faux leather which I believe to be Bianchi), 2 8 round steel factory magazines, a nylon double mag holster, a trigger lock, and a nylon case. This firearm was detail stripped and cleaned by an armorer and was not shot since. My asking price is 570$ OBO.

I have a Smith & Wesson Model 39-2 9mm in it's original box. I would rate this pistol in 95% condition and I believe it to be unfired. It come with two factory magazines.This is a collector grade pistol. This pistol is a single/double action semi auto 9mm caliber with a single stack 8-round magazine.  These pistol are known for their smooth, crisp single and double action trigger pull. This pistol have a thumb de-cocker/firing pin block design. 
*The model 39 is Unlike the later god awful Smith & Wesson double action only triggers you need a wench to fire and forget about hitting anything*

The history of the Model 39 along with the Colt Commander were developed in the early 50's  for military trials. They want to replace the standard 1911A1 GI sidearm. After the trials the military decided to stay with the 1911A1.
Both the Smith & Wesson and Colt pistols were later released to the civilian market. 

Buyer must be a Oregon resident able to legally own/possess this firearm above the age of 21 years old.

I have a Ruger Security Six 357 Magnum six shot Revolver for sale. This revolver is in great usable shape. I would rate the bluing around 85-90%. Timing is excellent and the original wood grips are in good shape.
It's a excellent shooter that I have enjoyed for many years. 
I got something new so something old has got to go and I truly hate to see it go!
I've said for years, if I was to have one pistol it would be an Ruger Security Six 357. They can't be beat for the money, hell their hard to beat at all for reliability and toughness. 
They are tougher then a Smith, Colt, new ruger red hawk or GP series revolvers.
Only tougher revolver is a Ruger single action black hawk.


Buyer must be a Oregon resident able to legally own/possess this firearm above the age of 21 years old.

Thanks

571,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4330571,For Sale:  Browning B-92 model 1892 Winchester in .357 magnum / .38 Special,"Skagit County, Mount Vernon, Washington",$ 700,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 13, 2015",Rifles,Browning                                                                                ,357 Magnum                                                                                ,Lever Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"I have for sale a very nice Browning Model B-92 in .357 magnum.  This Browning version of the classic Winchester model 1892.  The Winchester Model 1892 was a lever-action repeating rifle designed by John Browning as a smaller, lighter version of his large-frame Model 1886, and which replaced the Model 1873 as the company's lever-action for pistol-caliber rounds such as the .44-40.

Many believe the Browning 1892 to be the best reincarnation of the vintage Winchester, having the highest quality and fit & finish.   They were made to very high standards in Belgium or Japan, NOT like the cheaper ones made in Italy or Brazil.  The barrel on this rifle is 18"" long, with a full-length magazine tube that hold twelve rounds.  The bluing and metal looks as close to perfect as you can get.  It looks basically brand new.  There is absolutely no rust, and never has been.  No corrosion of any kind, and not even any scratches or scuffs in the blueing or wood.   The stocks look beautiful, I believe they are fancy grade, with some figuring and marbling in both the stock and forestock.   I am the second owner, and I believe the round count to be extremely low.  There is absolutely no wear on any of the internal parts.  The barrel bore looks crisp and clean, as does the rest of the rifle.   From the serial number, it appears that the gun was made in 1983.

The rifle also feeds and shoots .38 specials (or .38 government for you Cowboy shooters!) great.   It is a pleasure to shoot with kids with the .38 specials; no recoil and almost quiet enough for no ear protection!

I have more pictures including some close-up's that I can e-mail to interested parties.  Arms List only allowed 1 picture to be uploaded.

If you are in another state, I can ship the beautiful model 92 to your FFL for around $40.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask."

(The earlier AKs were banned because of their original features: pistol grips, folding stocks, threaded muzzles and bayonets.) The new model was basically an AK with a wood thumb-hole stock and no bayonet lug, although you do sometimes see MAK-90 receivers with under-folder holes drilled and filled! Only a million MAK-90s were exported to the USA in the early 90s. According to ""JA,"" of AK47.net, more MAK-90 rifles were imported from China than any other model of semi automatic AK type rifle from any other country. MAK-90s were made to shoot 7.62x39 or .223 caliber ammunition. Thicker steel and chrome threaded  barrel make the MAK superior and far more rare than your typical Soviat sisters!"

1. What kind of 80% receiver do I need? 
As shipped, Ghost Gunner can manufacture with any mil-spec lower receiver (with or without pre-milled rear take down well)
2. What end mills (a.k.a. 'drill bits') are accepted?
Ghost Gunner uses industry standard ER-11 collets, and ships with both 1/4"" and 5/32"" collets. Changing end mills is a simple process and full instructions are included. FYI: 'drill bit' is an incorrect term to describe an end mill, which cuts both radially and axially; drill bits only cut axially.
3. How is the work piece held on the table?
3D printable jigs are used to hold the part in place as each milling step is performed. For example, milling an 80% AR-15 lower receiver requires 2 jig pieces to secure the lower in place while the trigger pocket is milled, and then two more jig pieces are installed to drill the trigger pin holes. As most 80% firearms require deep pocket milling, Ghost Gunner's mounting table is parallel to the end mill shaft. This orientation maximizes 3D printed jig strength, minimizes jig complexity, and mechanically aligns the part to the machine upon insertion into the MakerSlide-patterned, Open Source T Slot stainless rails. No glue or tape required... this is a real CNC with real mounting solutions.
4. What Open Source parts did Defense Distributed design?
The entire machine is Open Source. For other Open Source designs, Defense Distributed developed a custom spindle that exceeds the quality, accuracy, and cutting capabilities of any sub-$400 spindle we've tested. We also developed a custom signal conditioning PCB called GrbIO that reduces RF noise generated by the several stepper motors used on the machine. GrbIO includes screw-posts for easy wiring, including separate analog, digital, power supply and chassis grounds, which internally isolate noisy components from sensitive ground planes. The plug-and-play PCB connects between existing Arduino and gshield boards, requires zero software changes, and should resolve many headaches on other derivative designs.
5. What else do I need to buy for the machine to work?
No additional parts are required to manufacture any compatible AR-15 lower receiver. Just plug Ghost Gunner into your computer, install our software and download any compatible .dd design file. You'll need to provide the lower receiver and all other firearm parts, including the lower build kit, stock and complete upper. These parts are not regulated for sale in the United States and you can have them delivered to your door without an FFL. Note: Future firearm designs might require different end mills.
6. How fast can the machine run?
When cutting aluminum, there's usually no reason to cut insanely fast, as this tactic is primarily used by machines that have too much chatter to cut with deep passes. For example, many machines that claim to cut aluminum do so by cutting as fast as possible at depths of just 0.001"", which results in poor part tolerance, as only the tip of the end mill (a.k.a 'drill bit') actually cuts the metal. The result is the end mill tip dulls quickly and then part quality suffers. By increasing the cutting depth to say 0.100"" inches, a machine can cut 100x slower and still finish the part in the same amount of time. Ghost Gunner is designed to cut deep grooves and thus doesn't need some insanely fast gibberish feed rate to overcome an inadequate design. To specifically answer the question, Ghost Gunner can run fast (80ipm), but doesn't need to, as it's rigid enough to cut like a real CNC.
7. Do I need a special power supply?
No. Ghost Gunner uses a standard IEC power cord and is compatible with any 110/220V circuit. No external power brick is used; the machine is entirely self contained.
8. How do I connect to Ghost Gunner?
Ghost Gunner has two ports: Power (IEC standard) and USB (Type 'B').
9. What sort of maintenance is required for Ghost Gunner?
Ghost Gunner's moving parts are entirely sealed from chip debris. All bearings are sealed and contain wipers to prevent foreign contaminate entry. The rails are stainless steel and are factory lubricated, but do require periodic wiping to prolong life. End Mills dull over time and are considered a consumable. With proper use, end mills should manufacture dozens of lowers. Emptying the chip tray after each build will prevent chip overflow (shaved aluminum chips occupy approximately 15 times their solid volume).
10. Is manufacturing a firearm legal?
In general, yes. Semi-automatic firearms, including the AR-15 lower receivers, are generally legal to manufacture for private individuals per US federal law Title 18 do not require serialization or other maker's marks. However, some states/municipalities restrict either the manufacture of certain firearms, or, more recently, the personal manufacture of a firearm with a 3D printer and/or CNC machine. DD makes no claim regarding local manufacturing legality; lower receiver files provided by Defense Distributed might require special licensing to manufacture and/or possess.

Under federal law, manufacturing a firearm for contemplation of future sale without an FFL is prohibited. Without a manufacturing FFL, you should manufacture firearms for personal use only. There are methods to legally transfer ownership of personally manufactured firearms, but they do not apply when the original manufacturing intent is to build a firearm for commercial or non-personal use. Recent ATF determinations have signaled that allowing others use of your CNC equipment may itself constitute manufacturing, therefore Defense Distributed advises Ghost Gunner owners to neither print firearms for other individuals, nor allow other individuals to use their Ghost Gunner to manufacture firearms.
11. Will the Ghost Gunner be able to finish AR-10/.308 receivers?
The machine can physically accommodate and work with these receivers. We are not yet working on parts files or workflows for these. However, we expect the code to quickly be written.
12. When is my order shipping? Are you sold out?
Orders at the promotional prices of $999 and $1199 are now sold out. Orders 1-100 at $1299 can expect shipment January 2015. All orders after Oct. 4 can expect delivery Q1 2015.
13. What is Defense Distributed? 
DD is a pending non-profit digital publisher and technology developer based in Austin Texas. We are organized to promote and expand your civil right to keep and bear arms.

Purchased this stock kit for a build I'm working on but before it arrived I found a different kit I liked better.  As it is this kit is brand new and unused and ready to be installed. Comes with the buffer tube, spring, buffer, castle nut, and a mil spec carbine stock. Buffer tube is mil spec in dimension and the positions are laser engraved so you can see what position your stock is in by just looking at it.  Great choice if you're working on a build right now and it will screw into any lower receiver with standard threads.

I have no use for it so I'd like to sell it for $45, just looking to get what I have in it back out.  Would also consider trades for AR mags, optics of some kind, or a rear sight.  Im building an M16A2 clone so I would be particularly interested in a carry handle style sight.

Model: Mini-14

Barrel Length: 18 inch
Ship.Yes
 This is a very Nice Mini 14 with the original Ruger side folding stock. The rifle has one small gouge on the stock that is not very deep, just enough to remove finish. The bluing is worn on the moving parts, like the bolt contact surfaces etc. but otherwise is in great shape. Included, and installed is the Ultimak scout mount, and a set of Tech sights. The Ultimak has been used with an Aimpoint micro dot, and was an excellent combination. As far as iron sights go the Mini 14s are always lacking but the new Tech sight rear sight makes a world of difference. I do not like peep sights, but I have no issue using the Mini with the new rear sight. There is also a M14 style flash hider installed to give it that A-team feel. The original parts, sights, and heat shield are included. Its with a 1:10 twist barrel. Mini 14s are chambered in 5.56, and I have fired 62g green tip ammunition with great results, and no key holing.I am including several magazines with, all but one function. That one is rusty and bet up. It works great to practice reloads, or open beers. the others are thermold, one is a new Tapco magazine that was used once, and the short magazine is a 20rd. None to my knowledge are factory magazines."

The FN Five-seven, trademarked as the Five-seveN, is a semi-automatic pistol designed and manufactured by Fabrique Nationale d’Armes de Guerre-Herstal (FN Herstal) in Belgium.[8] The pistol is named for its 5.7-mm (.224 in) bullet diameter, and the trademark capitalization style is intended to emphasize the manufacturer's initials—FN.[13]

The Five-seven pistol was developed in conjunction with the FN P90 personal defense weapon and the FN 5.7×28mm cartridge.[14] The P90 was introduced in 1990, and the Five-seven was introduced in 1998 as a pistol using the same 5.7×28mm ammunition.[7] Developed as a companion pistol to the P90, the Five-seven shares many of its design features: it is a lightweight polymer-based weapon with a large magazine capacity, ambidextrous controls, low recoil, and the ability to penetrate body armor when using certain cartridge types.[15]

Sales of the Five-seven were originally restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers, but since 2004, the pistol has also been offered to civilian shooters for personal protection, target shooting, and similar uses.[16][17] Although offered only with sporting ammunition, the Five-seven's introduction to civilian shooters was met with vocal opposition from gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign, and the pistol has been subject to ongoing controversy in the United States.[18][19]

The Five-seven is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations, including Canada, France, Greece, India, Poland, Spain, and the United States.[20] In the United States, the Five-seven is in use with numerous law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service.[13][21] In the years since the pistol's introduction to the civilian market in the United States, it has also become increasingly popular with civilian shooters.["

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4330998,"For Sale:  8"" Alpine Subwoofer and Amp","Old Town Alexandria, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 200,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 13, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Very lightly used Alpine 8"" Subwoofer and Amp for sale with RCA cables included.

Purchased brand new from Crutchfield, I had this little guy mounted in a Land Rover Discovery for about 6months before I sold the truck. I was skeptical on how the 8"" would peform but the combination of the ported box and 500watt Alpine amp was more than enough to produce deep lows and a nice thump without being obnoxious. Yes, even in that big SUV. You will not be disappointed in this package if you are looking for a compact solution to bass performance.

First offer of $200 takes it (must meet locally in Alexandria/Fairfax/Tysons).
