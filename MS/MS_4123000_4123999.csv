Springfield Armory M-14 / M1A Scout rifle

$ 1,300


with original factory box, 10-round magazine, and Mossy Oak camo pattern stock.

The Osprey 4x32 scope in the picture is also included.  It has see-through flip-up scope covers.  EDITED TO ADD:  MSRP of this scope is about $50.   


This was manufactured in 2008. The Mossy Oak camo pattern appears darker than the current models.  I bought this a year ago, so I am not the original owner.  Rifle is in excellent condition.


For those of you in Colorado, I have plenty of 20-round M-14 complete magazine ""repair kits""  available for sale at $25 each.   Since I cannot legally transfer 20 round magazines, I have to disassemble them and sell them as ""repair kits"".  If you want to disrespect the law and re-assemble them into complete boxes-with-springs, please think of the children before doing so.


A background check at an FFL dealer is required, per stupid state law, before this rifle can be transferred.  



caveat:  The forward position scope mount should be a standard Picatinny rail, but I had difficulty mounting both my Lucid HD-7 and my Meprolight M21 onto it. I was able to mount them, but I had to “jiggle” them on.  I got a friend who's using a Primary Arms RDS ( www.primaryarms.com/Primary_Arms_AA_Battery_Red_Dot_GEN_3_p/pa-aasdg3.htm ) on his M1A Scout, and he reports no problems.  The Osprey in the picture mounted without any problem.  And I’ve been able to mount other accessories (ex., weapon lights) onto the rail without any problems.  So I’m not sure what the issue is.

""Following up on their test of 5.56mm and .300 Winchester Magnum ammunition velocities through different barrel lengths, Rifleshooter.com has posted a velocity vs. barrel length examination of .308 Winchester. One of the most well-balanced and versatile .30 caliber rounds in history, the .308 Winchester proved surprisingly well suited to almost all barrel lengths tested, with Winchester 147gr ammunition ranging from almost 3,000 ft/s from a 28″ barrel to just under 2,700 ft/s from a 16.5″ barrel:""

This round is ideal for shooters using bolt-actions or single shot rifles (but is perfectly safe in semi-automatics although it might not completely cycle the action). This subsonic ammunition is a perfect choice for shooting through your favorite rimfire suppressor. CCI Quiet ammunition is new production and non-corrosive.

Ruger's Elite 452 MSR Trigger is a 4.5-lb. two-stage trigger that delivers the repeatability, dependability and predictability you need for exceptional accuracy. The first stage takes up approximately 1.5 lbs. of slack, while gentle pressure continues to build till the trigger breaks smooth and crisp at precisely 4.5 lbs. With up to a 30% faster lock time over standard MSR triggers, it's ideal for competition shooting where pinpoint precision is paramount. Rugged polymer fire-control housing and ergonomic polymer grip make exceptional durability a foregone conclusion. Full-strength hammer spring delivers consistent primer ignition. Fully assembled design allows you to repeatedly dry-fire for trigger practice or to use as a training aid. Includes all pins and springs for installation in any MSR receiver with .154"" trigger/hammer pins. Integrated safety lever."

In the past packing a short barrel meant you were dealing with less velocity and less reliable expansion. Speer has created an entire category of specialized ammunition designed specifically for back-up guns. Gold Dot Short Barrel was introduced in 2004 and designed from the ground up to work in 2-inch barrels. Speer ATK redesigned select Gold Dot bullets to make the cavity larger for reliable expansion at the reduced velocities common to short barrel handguns. You also get less ""kick"" to keep you on target when wielding sharp snapping revolvers.

Our introduction of a ""heavy bullet for cartridge"" 9X18 Makarov +P loading is the sole result of numerous customer requests.  With millions of these pistols now on American soil and no +P heavy loadings available, this cartridge and the many pistol owners are suffering from the lack of serious fight stopping ammunition.  This load is 20grs. heavier and 100 fps faster than standard 9X18 ammo.

This loading features a flash suppressed powder, so if you need to shoot in low light, you won't be blinded by your own gun fire and this is a useful tactical advantage since around 95% of all civilian shootings in the US happen in low light while the criminal element is out and about.  Our use of a hard cast bullet, with a flat nose, can best be understood if you'll read our technical article on ""The Use of Expanding Bullets in Small Defensive Cartridges,"" posted under the ""Technical Articles"" category on our home page.

Further, please note that the use of hard cast bullets (not lead but, Hard Cast) does NOT cause lead fouling in the polygonal rifling's used in all 9X18 Makarov pistols.  For more information, please see our technical articles entitled ""Hard Cast Bullets in Polygonal Barrels"" and ""Dangers of Pure Lead Cowboy Bullets"". We found no appreciable leading in any of our Makarov test guns. It should also be noted that all of our test guns functioned and fed flawlessly with this load. We also experienced very good to excellent accuracy in all test guns.

Please note the real world velocities listed below from real world 9X18 Makarov pistols. At Buffalo Bore we always use real, ‘over-the-counter’ firearms for our published velocities, as we feel the use of laboratory test barrels that give false, high velocities does the customer a disservice as each customer needs to know what their carry ammo will really do on-the-street in a real world situation.

We all remember the first time squeezing a trigger, usually consisting of simply plinking a few tin cans. For some of us, those first shots were from an original Browning T-Bolt, one of the most accurate, handy and easy-to-shoot rimfires ever produced. Those days can now be relived with today’s T-Bolt, a rifle every bit the equal of the original, with new features that put this unique rifle in a class by itself. The straight ""T"" bolt design lets you load and eject with a simple pull back and push forward. This system is  unequaled among rimfires for raw bolt action speed -- nearly as fast as a semi-auto 22. But you retain all the accuracy advantages of a bolt action design. Today's T-Bolt has even more than the original.

The absolute reliability and authenticity make the SGL31 the ONLY CHOICE for collectors, perfectionists, and AK enthusiasts alike. All authentic components, made according to the original technology, and detailed attention, which went into the manufacturing, make the SGL31 THE rifle you will be proud to own and show off to your friends at the shooting range. The ONLY truly configured AK-74 currently available in the US market that uses brand new Hammer Forged and Chrome Line barrel, the SGL31 offers the safety and reliability that you expect from your rifle, making it the highest quality AK-74 available on the market. 

I have put 200 rounds through this rifle so it is in great condition. It features a rifle dynamics M-4 stock adapter and magpul CTR stock, and a set of upgraded tritium night sights. I have a set of wood furniture to go along with the rifle as well. I am selling/trading the rifle by itself or as a package with 1100 rounds of 7N6 ammo and Bulgarian circle 10 magazines. 

This rifle unfortunately isn't being imported anymore, and the true Arsenal stamped SGL series are very rare to find.

Most is rings and chains.  All is stamped with its purity.  Here's a list of what I have.....

10k gold: 1.155 grams
12k gold: 16.700 grams
14k gold: 85.810 grams
16k gold: 4 grams

Calculated down to melt value of pure gold in ounces:

10k gold: 0.0154.    $17.94
12k gold: 0.2683.    $313.56
14k gold: 1.6070.    $1,878.11
16k gold: 0.0858.    $100.16

Total market value:  $2309.77

For a cost of about $100 it can be smelted down to a bar of pure 24k gold in the weight of about 1.9756 ounce.  Market value of it is about $2300 depending on when you do the calculations.  

With gold value always changing I'm setting my trade value at $1600.  If I get a chance to take my gold to the smelter before trading it off the price will change.  I just wanted to try listing it before I smelt and ell it outright.  

No I will not just sell the gold as is.  My plan is to try to trade it or next week I'm going to smelt it and have it poured into a solid 2 ounce bar.

Now for what I'm looking for.  I'm really looking for guns, AR's, bolt actions, lever actions, pistols.  I will also trade for ammo, reloading supplies, gun safes, hunting equipment.  As for specifics..... I'm looking for a 458 socom, 50 beuwolf, 338 federal, 454 casull revolvers, single action 357's, Winchester model 70's, Remington 700's, 1911's, 338 lapua, long range 308 or 300 win mag.

To meet the stringent requirements set and demanded by our elite fighting forces, EOTech has developed the EOTech Holo Sight M 553, modeled after the ever popular, battle proven Eotech HWS design. The EOTech M553 Holo Sight incorporates many additional features required within the SOPMOD Block 2 program. The advantage of EOTech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sights is its holographic reticle patterns that are instantly visible in any light condition, instinctive to center regardless of shooting angle and always remain in view to achieve lightning quick reticle to target acquisition without covering or obscuring the point of aim. The magic of EOTech Holographic 553 Weapon Sights is the edge they provide to you in close quarter or urban combat zones. The EOTech Holographic M553 Weapon Sight will remain fully operational even when the laminated window is obstructed by mud, snow, rain, or even damaged/shattered, as long as you can see through any portion of the laminated window, the entire reticle pattern will be visible on target with point of aim/impact being maintained and fully functional, the operator can still engage with confidence.

The SureFire X300 features a high-efficiency LED that generates 170 lumens of brilliant white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with good reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The LED has no filament to burn out or break and generates tactical-level light—enough to overwhelm an aggressor's night-adapted vision—for 2.4 hours per set of batteries. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it submersible to 22 meters. 

The X300 Rail-Lock® system comes with adapter plates permitting rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. An ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation. Optional pistol grip switches permit operation with the top grip finger, leaving the index finger free to operate the handgun trigger. Other switches are available for operating the X300 when attached to a long gun. 

Fits: Handguns and long guns with Picatinny or Universal rails.
