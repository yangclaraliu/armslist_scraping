New pressure treated decking. Has carried 11,000 pounds all the way across the state of Oregon. I have the TITLE AND PLATE. Tags are expired. Lights work as they should but wiring is brittle due to sitting in the valley sun and need replaced. Trailer came from eastern Oregon and has only been here at my house in Toledo since last week. I want 1500 cash or trade. I have roughly 2500 in it. There are 4 foot tall removable side posts for sides of some sort if you want to go that route. They simply slip right out of the stake pockets if just used to haul cars or whatever. The deck is right at 30 inches off the ground so loading cars requires some long ramps which are NOT included and have been sold. Awesome, strong and reliable trailer. Both axles also have brakes but are not hooked up nor have they been in many years. Coupler is a 2 inch. Includes tongue jack and safety chains. Ready to tow away today. Thank you.
UPDATE....Needs two tires that are 50 dollars each in Woodburn. I am dropping myy price by 300 so you can buy 100 dollars worth of tires. Price is rock solid."

This has been a good gun but I am just not much of a shotgun guy.  I traded for it.  Shot it.  Took some boy scouts out to shoot it.  We all had a blast shooting targets with birdshot and buckshot.  But...  Then it just sat in the safe.  

I am a Semi Auto rifle kinda guy.  I like AR-15s.  Especially in 6.5 Grendel, 300BLK, or other rounds.  I have two solid 5.56 uppers so, not really feeling the need for anymore of those.  I like pistol caliber carbines.  9mm, 40sw, 45acp.  Whatever.  9mm is cheapest to shoot, but I have a lot of 40sw in my house so...

I like 308 semi autos.  I really would like a good FNAR, or AR10.  The new GenII DPMS seem interesting.  If its a 3moa shooter, I am not interested.  If its a 1 moa or better shooter, I am likely interested.  I reload, so if your 308 semi auto bruises the brass, I will pass.

I dont have an AK, but am interested in them.  Arsenal, Saiga, Vepr, these things interest me.  7.62x39 or 54r.  AK74...

I like bolt action rifles in long range, but not shoulder punishing calibers.  So 6.5 lapua/creedmore/260.  I currently do not have a 308 bolt so for the right now, sure.  I like precision when it comes to rifles, so if you cannot show .6moa or better 5 round groups for your bolt, then I am probably not interested.

Optics.  I like optics.  Higher end optics.  HD optics.  Or a decent night vision/thermal.  Red dots...  Probably not.  I have found that the primary arms red dots do everything I could ever ask for and just make me smile.  Trijicon 4x or 6x, or accupoint variable power are nice.  Higher end Vortex, Zeiss, Burris, Bushnell all intrigue me.  Laser range finding scopes... nah.  I already own one and it does all I need in that category.

I value this russian made saiga at around $1250.  So keep that in mind when discussing trades."

Winchester’s1873 rifle was the “Rifle that Won the West.” It is chambered in the economical .38/.357 Magnum cartridge. A cowboy could have both a lever-action rifle and his six shooter, and needed only one cartridge belt for both. Most Texas Rangers and every old West cowboy worth his salt carried 1873 rifles. Chappo, the son of Apache war chief Geronimo, packed an 1873. And Buffalo Bill carried an 1873 lever-action rifle along with a pair of .44-40 Colts in 1876 when he worked as an Army scout. This piece of rifle history is available in a variety of distinctive models including this Special Cimarron branded Deluxe Short rifle. Don't let that fool you though, it has a 10+1 capacity and power to spare."

I did park a Zastava M70A in it for a while and has a impression in holster where safety rode as you can see in pic. Otherwise in great condition. I think I paid about $45 for it and would like to get 30 for it. Can possibly meet in indy SS depending on day."

This is a 90+% rifle: The only ‘problems’ are to the edges of the Receiver and Trigger Guard... were the ‘bluing’ is worn to the ‘Alloy’ base metal.  EMAIL for PICTURES.
An early, rare, and Still Quality Made MARLIN !
There is no ‘record’ of actual production, but by compiling the ‘changes’ through the years... this should be the last year of the ‘99’ - 1964.
The 1st Marlin 99s were made from 1959 - 1961 with a plain pistol grip stock and 22"" barrel (YES).
Also... during that time, 1960-64, they introduced the 99DL, “...essentially the same rifle but with minor changes to make it a fancier rifle; gold plated trigger (YES), swivels for leather sling (YES-WERE There!), new style one-piece WALNUT stock with fluted comb & Monte Carlo drop (YES), pistol grip (YES), custom type hard rubber butt plate with white line spacer (YES).” And now, the final ‘dating’... “1964 saw receivers being grooved for tip-off mounts instead of using the scope base adapter (YES).

It lacks the dreaded magazine safety that kills the trigger pull and can be fired with no magazine seated. Additionally it has factory installed night sights (Lamps are dim).  Also included is an original S&W research letter for this particular pistol showing it was shipped on November 5, 1991 to Lew Horton Distributing in MA.Overall a nice package for the collector and shooter."

I unfortunately (for me) only sent about 100 rounds down range with it so it does not have much use. That being said I've decided to sell it as I've recently gotten into building rifles and will be replacing this one with one that I custom build. This is not something that I NEED to get rid of, so I'm not open to serious price cuts; but I am open to negotiate with the reasonable and respectful individual. This does come with the Vortex scope shown (which I bought new for this rifle) as well as the GG&G bipod(also bought new) and magazine(came with rifle). This rifle also still has all of the magpul furniture that it had when I purchased it. Below is the standard Davidson's rundown.

First, looking to sell my unfired Mossberg Talo MVP .308 rifle, topped with Primary Arms 4-14x44 FFP ACSS scope. Comes with standard Caldwell bipod, just the one magazine and UTG LE rings. This rifle is a nice little package, again it is unfired. Though it does have a tiny gouge on the comb of the stock (see below pic), that happened when I closed the safe with it packed to tightly :( Other than that, just hand cycled the bolt a few times (not fired!). These MVP's are best known for being able to take AR-10 and M-14 magazines.
Only local sales in Houston, I'm in Katy but will meet up a reasonable distance. Asking $800.

Also, have an H&K USP 45 compact for sale. Has a couple dings on the back from carrying. Pistol is 'AH' dated, meaning it was made in 2007. Has factory night sights, though they are now dim. Comes with 2 mags (which I've replaced the springs in with Wolff +10% springs), factory case, Safariland holster (seen in pics) and also a complete factory LEM conversion kit. It started life as a Variant 3 (sa/da with decocker ONLY) but I changed it to a Variant 1 (sa/da with safety and decock). Then I changed it to its current config, which is a Heavy LEM with a safety lever (no decock). I can easily change it back to whatever configuration you want or you can do it yourself, as ALL parts are included. Replaced the tiny factory mag release with the much better mag release from the HK45c. Also, if you look at the pics in the Imgur album, the one with the yellow arrow: I am showing what looks like ""wear"" from usage. It is NOT wear! I field stripped and then buffed all the trigger parts to a super smooth finish, and some of the finish came off while buffing. I DID NOT FILE/SAND anything, just buffed with polish and dremel cotton buff wheel. It lightened the trigger a little but made it much smoother. Looking for $620 for the pistol, holster and LEM kit.

Previous owner grouped .780 @ 300 yards!!!

Cash Price is $1100 firm for the RIFLE ALONE or $1750 with the Vortex Viper FFP 2.5-10x32 (scope is NEW and unused. Only Mounted for the photo) with box, paper work etc. Warne 30mm rings included. You can also do a 3-9x40 Trijicon Accupoint w/Green Triangle reticle if you prefer it to the Vortex (same price either way).

Really only need cash on this one since I am only selling to make another purchase. HOWEVER, I have listed a few items below I could possibly swap for plus cash if someone is interested in the Entire package. I will have a few other items up for sale so whichever goes first....I will keep the other -:)

Taser X3 Description:

The TASER X3 ECD is a software upgradable, 3-shot ECD manufactured by TASER International, Inc. ECDs use propelled wires or direct contact to conduct energy to affect the sensory and motor functions of the nervous system. The X3 ECD offers a multi-shot capability that previous-generation TASER ECDs do not. The X3 ECD deploys Smart Cartridges one at a time. It is possible to apply energy beyond the initial burst to a deployed cartridge without deploying the remaining cartridges. It also is possible to apply a Warning ArcTM display or drive-stun without deploying any of the cartridges loaded in the ECD.

The X3 ECD uses three replaceable X3 Smart Cartridges containing compressed nitrogen to deploy two small probes that are attached to the X3 ECD by insulated conductive wires. The X3 ECD transmits electrical pulses along the wires and into the body affecting the sensory and motor functions of the peripheral nervous system. The energy can penetrate up to 1.5 cumulative inches of clothing, or 0.75 inches per probe. The cartridges are available with various wire lengths from 15’ to 35’ (4.6 meters to 10.7 meters). X3 Smart Cartridges are equipped with Charge DiffusionTM probes for optimal Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI) pulse delivery.

The X3 ECD’s Trilogy LogTM can be uploaded securely to EVIDENCE.COM, where the information is encrypted, stored securely, and organized into dashboards that allow your agency to easily monitor the usage and system status of your entire arsenal of X3 ECDs.
The X3 ECD’s optional TACOMTM Digital Power Magazine, or TPM, enables the X3 ECD to communicate wirelessly to other TACOM enabled ECDs such as the AXON Tactical Computer for time synchronization and event triggering. Furthermore, the X3 ECD features a Power Optimization Control (POC) capability that continually monitors the power remaining in the battery pack and, when needed, shuts down peripheral functions to maintain critical NMI capability while warning the user when the battery power reaches low levels.

The X3 ECD has an internal memory that stores the operating software and a record of every deployment. See the ""Trilogy Log"" section in this manual for more details.

The X3 ECD’s capabilities are encased within a rugged unibody chassis. This rugged structure protects the enclosed circuitry from hostile environments. Additionally, the unibody polymer frame provides much greater structural integrity and impact survivability than previous clamshell housings.

FOR SALE:  Bushnell Sportview 3-9x32.  Made in Japan.  The finish is wearing off on the underside of the scope.  This isn't the prettiest scope but it works great.  Again, a great tractor/truck/shed/etc. gun because it's cheap but has very clear glass and works fine.  $40.00 firm.

Just one man's opinion, but these are the best Bushnell scopes for the money.  They're Japanese, which are known for glass quality over the new Chinese scopes.  If these scopes break down the road, Bushnell has an awesome ""no questions asked"" warranty, and they'll send you a comparable model as a replacement.  All you have to pay is shipping.

Century Arm C93 Sporter, 5.56, 16.25” 1:9 twist barrel, fluted chamber, roller lock bolt system, black synthetic A2 stock and forend (with heatshield). 

I’ve owned a number of Century rifles (some of the crap ones that never fired or cycled correctly and some of the CETME’s that were top notch) and I can say this is by far the most reliable one I’ve ever shot. Picked this up a few months ago as a project rifle for long range but it’s just not my cup of tea. I love the look, and it’s a lot more reliable than I imagined when I bought it, but it’s just too bulky for my taste and I want something with a bit more range. One thing I was impressed with was its accuracy - after sighting it in I was hitting roughly 3” groups at 100 yards – so someone who actually knows how to shoot can easily hit 2” or smaller groups.

I purchased this used and the main reason being that it looked to have been a shooter, which meant it functioned, and I wanted something can throw steel cased ammo through easily. I disassembled and checked every part of the gun, cleaned it and lubed it to death (as these things love oil baths). First trip to the range I put 100rds of Tula 223, 100rds M855, 100rds AE 556, 100rds of AE 223 and 40rds of Wolf 223 without a hitch. Functioned flawlessly with all the ammo I used and all 4 of the mags. The only time I had an issue was when I was shooting with a suppressor the last round in each of the promags caused an FTF which I can only attribute to the increased back pressure from the suppressor and/or possibly weaker spring in the promags vs the original HK mag. So 2 FTF’s out of probably 1000 rounds is extremely good for an HK clone built by CAI (if you know their history).

COLT FIREARMS started making this New Model in 1897 or 1898... depending on who you read.  This one was made in 1916, was handed down from father to son, carried thru WW1 for 4 yrs, then handed down again to son who passed away at 89 years old and I purchased the weapon and it's history at auction.  I took it to a professional who inspected it, I had it cleaned and we shot it, 10 shots, and I have to say it shoots... AWESOME!   You can shoot regular .45 or .45 auto or if you can find them, 455 Eley rounds.  You can't shoot .45 Long Colt rounds unless you modify the cylinder, which isn't difficult to do... many do that with this handgun.  

This one is in ABSOLUTE ORIGINAL CONDITION.    The professional also told me it was worth at least, in present condition, $700. to $900. ...  it's not perfect, but it's 100 yrs old. it is tight and it shoots GREAT!!   he said that these weapons in working ORIGINAL condition are getting harder to find so when they find one that still shoots...they will pay a decent price for them.  Watch what you buy folks!  IF it takes Long Colt rounds... it is NOT original. This pistol was never made for .45 longcolts.
I'm asking only $650. obo    As this is a vintage or antique weapon, it can be shipped to most states directly to the buyer I'm told... We can figure that out if you decide you want to buy it. I will accept some trade...maybe.   I'm looking for a ""Mare's Leg"" in 357mag.
