(Pictures available on request-price is negotiable within reason)

I have a Gen4 Glock 19 up for sale or trade. I have put 150 rounds of mixed 115 and 124 grain factory ammo through the gun and it has run flawlessly. The gun has had the trigger guard double undercut to eliminate the ""Glock knuckle,"" I installed rubber Talon grips on it, I put a beaver tail half backstrap on, and I had the factory Glock night sights installed (at the factory in Georgia) two weeks ago. 

The gun comes with the two standard backstraps, two 15 round magazines and one 17 round magazine (one of the magazines has the factory ""+"" base pad making it 17 rounds). I'm also including a Blackhawk! Serpa holster with the gun. 

Please be an Indiana resident and be willing to show your DL and Carry Permit. Absolutely NO out of state sales unless going through an FFL (buyer pays shipping and FFL fees). Also be willing to sign a bill of sale. 

Thanks for looking!"

It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

Extremely Accurate TooUpdate: High Capacity 20 round magazines are now available!  Add one via the Custom Option above.  See more details here.To me this is by far the best deal in a large caliber rifle in the U.S.The brand new Zastava PAP M77 PS has classic AK styling in .308 caliber!  The M77 comes with 1 -10 rd. mag, and features an adjustable gas system for flawless functioning with many types of ammunition. The cold-forged barrel technology offers excellent accuracy and performance. Key internal components are all machined from solid steel.Not only that, but this high quality rifle combines the rugged reliable action of an AK-47, with the power and long range accuracy of the .308 Winchester caliber. Built in rail on receiver makes scope mounting a breeze. The crisp trigger, smooth action and reliable performance made the M77 a battle proven workhorse of a weapon. A rifle will easily out perform other .308 semi-auto's costing over three times as much.We have spent considerable range time with this weapon as well as personally owning one. I love it. Although we don't reccommend it ,mine fires cheap steel case ammo flawlessly ( see attached video ) as well as commercial .308 soft point, and all sorts of surplus military 7.62 x 51 Nato.  And not only does it feed all of these different rounds, the cold forged barrel seems to stabilize all types of different bullet weights for exceptional long range accuracy. Features a bolt hold open safety and a handy side rail so you can easily mount a scope. Our UTG Scope Mounts and AK Scope Pkg's work perfectly. This rifle is so multi purpose it could easily be your go to weapon for military and police tactical long range applications ( read sniper ) , heavy bore range competition, or it would even make an excellent hunting rifle with the right loads being capable of taking any big game in North America. Due to the piston driven action, and the heavy recoil spring and guide rod, felt recoil is actually quite light and manageable and probably only around half of what you would encounter in a bolt action of the same caliber. As you can see from the attached video, backward recoil is actually quite light and manageable even under rapid fire. In my opinion everyone needs at least one rifle in .308 caliber. I would strongly recommend  this one. Don't know why we never published this before, probably because these rifles are so reliable that no one has ever needed to know. But someone asked today so here is the answer. These rifles are fully warrantied by the importer with a full one year from date of purchase, bumper to bumper guarantee. As such, you can buy with confidence. Now I can't remember a single issue ever with one of these rifles, they just perform flawlessly, but if there is an issue, simply contact us, and we will be sure it is made right. Mag. capacity: 10 rds.

The Ruger® SR-762™ is a lightweight, quick-handling carbine that is an ideal rifle for those who appreciate the familiar and ergonomic AR-style platform.

GRIP-POD GPS-02 MILITARY MODEL Vertical ForeGrip With Built-In Quick-Deploy Bipod

Dual-function vertical grip locks to the bottom accessory rail of your tactical rifle’s forend to give you enhanced control during CQB and a stable bipod rest for precise long-range fire. The grip’s hand-filling contours and deep grooves provide a solid purchase even when your hands are wet. Hit the large, deeply grooved release button, and a powerful spring deploys the legs instantly. Conveniently placed for thumb activation, the button sits flush with the surrounding surface to prevent accidental deployment. Extended legs provide sufficient elevation for a standard 30-round magazine to clear the ground, and will not snag on brush, vehicle interior, or other gear when retracted. Legs and grip are made of tough, injection-molded polymer; steel cross-bolt with easy-grip thumbscrew locks directly to any MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail to ensure a rock-solid fit. GPS-02 has steel inserts in legs for maximum strength in high-stress tactical operations.

 First is a Pre-model 10 38 special. Has 4"" barrel, numbers all match and the grips are in excellent shape and are original to the gun as they are factory stamped with the same serial number. Retains 95% plus of its original blueing. It locks up like a vault, has no cylinder slap and timing and trigger are smooth and perfect. Numbers put its manufacture in 1949 and comes with a nice holster and belt strap for ammo as well as a speed loader I have. $550 obo.

Next is a 38 special Victory Model that was part of the Lend-lease program with Allied partners in WWII. It has the correct Parkerized finish in easy 90% plus condition and a 5"" barrel. Lockup, timing and trigger are right on. Comes with a very nice period correct holster. From all the searches I have done and with help from other forums, the holster appears to be a British officers design. $500 obo.

Third is a rare 32-20 Hand Ejector WCF (Model of 1905-4th Change) with a 5"" barrel. Serials all match, even the grips are original to the revolver. Numbers place it at late 1918 or 1919 production. Lockup, timing and trigger on this are also perfect. It shows its age and is unrestored but still maintains at least 60% of its original blueing. Solid 60% gun. Comes with period correct holster and a few rounds of ammo. These are rarer and the Blue Book I have that is two years old places its value in 60% condition at $625. I am asking $575 obo.

All of these are nice and very well taken care of. They are nicer in the hand than in pictures. I have many pics I can email anyone who is interested.

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum magazines, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum magazines, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 100-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.
