This lightly used Bowers CAC-9 suppressor can be yours! If you've never owned or used a suppressor, let me tell you, it's easier and less expensive than you may think -- and if you want to take the leap, gi'me a holler and I can talk you through it, even help you with the paperwork if you decide to move forward.

This suppressor is in good used condition, fully ready for use. There are minor marks in the finish, but nothing that effects function. The sale includes a Bowers ""Griptastic"" High-Temp Silicone cover, which protects the suppressor during handling, and your hands from the heat. The M11/9 (3/4-10 thread) Versadapt unit currently installed is included in the sale if you want it, but you will likely need to get what you need to suit your weapon(s) from Bowers.

The CAC-9 was developed to suppress the 9mm MAC SMG's, but because of its design, it is quite effective for anything that shoots 9mm, or rifles up through .30 cal. I personally have fired 9mm and .22 pistols through it, as well as .22, .223, 6.8 SPC, .300 Blackout and .308 rifles – and it did fine in every case. It is rated for fully-automatic fire should you be fortunate enough to have that capability, but even if not, that means it is tough enough to take heat and abuse. Also, on a rifle, you'll see that the suppressor is a very effective muzzle brake in addition to reducing the noise. Unlike most other modern suppressors, the CAC-9 can be fully disassembled for cleaning to keep it in top condition for years of service.

The Bowers Versadapt backend also makes the CAC-9 highly adaptable. Bowers offers 24 different thread adapters for this can to fit almost anything you have, and at $45 each, you can afford to have several.

Finally, if you ever have a question or a problem with it, even if it's your fault, all you have to do is call Bowers -- and I mean, when you call the company, you get Tom Bowers on the line. I don't want to promise anything on his behalf, but the times I've talked to him, he was helpful and always ready to upgrade my cans at little or no cost. He didn't ask when I bought it or from where, he just wants people to be happy with his products -- and I reckon you will be.

All laws apply here. I will expect you to pay for the purchase up front, and you will have to complete and submit paperwork to the BATFE for their approval before I can hand you the suppressor, but if you can legally own a pistol, you can probably own this suppressor. There's a $200 tax that has to be paid to the BATFE one time, a little more paperwork than a firearm, and you'll have to wait a few months, but believe me, it'll be worth it!

Initially wasn't a fan of Swift scopes being a Burris, Leupold, Nikon fan, but I'll tell you what, once you shoulder this shotgun and put a few rounds down range, the scope is wonderful! Holds without a doubt, is bright and clear. You pull it up and it is RIGHT THERE! Dead nuts shooting Hornady SST slugs. Chambered for 2-3/4 or 3"" shells. Used it for 1 season before our area turned to rifle. Hit a doe exactly where I was aiming. I bought it used from a friend who barely shot it. I would estimate that I shot it 35-45 times since owning it. Did manage to shoot very well out to 250 yards from my leadsled. Surprised me because I never shot sabots until this shotgun. Looking to sell because I have too many other projects that require attention. I have no use for it after going to rifle. I would estimate the gun to be in 95% condition. Feel free to ask questions.

Whether you are buying your first AR rifle, or need an affordable yet accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is for you. Built to bridge the gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this introductory level carbine features a 16′ light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible, six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny Rail. The 16″ barrel, although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.

I have a Sig P226 chambered in 9mm that I am looking to sell or trade. The Sig was converted to Double Action Only and is no longer DA/SA. The Sig will come with the Sig box and 2-Magazines. It has some carry wear from use but not abused condition. The P226 can be converted back to SA/DA but I do not have the original parts to do so. I am looking to trade for one of the following and cash can be offered to make up any difference.

Equipped with an innovative Blowback feature, the PT-85 Blowback Socom CO2-powered air pistol delivers a realistic action and an authentic look and feel when shooting. The Blowback pistol accomplishes this by using a small portion of air to move the slide backward when firing. As a result, you'll feel like you're shooting the real thing. The PT-85 Socom also includes an extended rifled steel barrel, a textured grip, and a 16-pellet double magazine. The pistol is capable of shooting at velocities of up to 560 feet per second with Gamo PBA platinum pellets.
Note: The extended barrel is designed for added velocity. It is not a silencer and does provide any noise reduction. The extended barrel must remain installed in order to shoot pistol. Only standard-skirt pellets should be used with the PT-85 Blowback pistols. To avoid damaging your magazine, never use long-skirt pellets, such as: Red Fire, Blue Flame, Glow Fire, PBA Bullet, or TS-10.

With one (1) magazine, believed to be original but not serialized. This is a WWII, Nazi-era pistol, circa 19 with the following features: 4 3/4 inch round barrel, blued metal finish (fair condition-see attached pictures) , rounded front blade sight, fixed-notch rear sight, serrated ring hammer, smooth trigger, and checkered original grips. All parts match. Metal stamping's include: left side of slide – three line maker mark, Browning Patent reference on the left side of the slide – FABRIQUE NATIONALE D'ARMES DE GUERRE (NATIONAL FACTORY OF ARMS FOR WAR) HERSTAL-BELGIQUE (HERSTAL, BELGIUM) BROWNING'S PATENT DEPOSE – along with the Nazi Eagle over WaA 140 and the Nazi Eagle over a circled swastika; left side frame – the Nazi Eagle over WaA 140 (a little worn) and the Nazi Eagle over a circled swastika (nicely visible); right side of slide, frame and barrel – the serial number 505546; front of slide beneath muzzle – the Nazi Eagle over WaA 140; Condition is good. Bluing is toning to brown/grey. Edge wear. Some handling marks. All function checks work well, gun fires perfect. Barrel rifling is excellent! A collectible pistol from WWII that demonstrates the Belgian manufacturing characteristics under Nazi Germany occupation and control. 

WaA 140 = The third and final German WWII era made Hi-Powers will be found with the Waffenamt stamp WaA 140. These WaA 140 stamped pistols were manufactured from late 1941 until the liberation of the FN plant in Belgium in 1944. None of these pistols will have the shoulder stock slot, but the early made examples in the serial number range of 95,000 to 135,000 will have the tangent rear sight. When the tangent rear sight was removed, the Germans replaced it with a fixed rear sight that was drift adjustable for windage only. It appears that the first of these WaA 140 marked fixed rear sight pistols begin at around the serial number of 150,000 which leaves a gap in the serial number range between the tangent and fixed sight WaA 140 marked pistols.The fixed sight WaA 140 marked pistols continued until around serial number 200,000 which dates them toward the end of 1942. At the beginning of 1943, a new serial code numbering system is used which began at number 01a until number 99999a was reached. Then at the beginning of 1944 the serial number 01b began and continues to about 6300b, at which time German production ceased due to the liberation of the FN factory. All of the letter suffixed serial numbered pistols will be found with the fixed rear sight."

This is a production new gun, factory test fire date is 16 July 2014. I'm the original owner, and I've fired less than a box (<50 rounds) through it. It's been sitting in its original box in my safe the rest of the time. This pistol is cosmetically and mechanically flawless, and it looks exactly as it did the day I picked it up. Lots of original factory grease still on the inside.
Comes with two 12 round magazines and everything else originally included in the box except for the HK logo sticker (see pics).
Only selling this because I suddenly encountered expensive car problems, and I don't want to have to dip into my savings.
FOID card holders only, all laws will be followed.
Price is absolutely inelastic.
Not interested in trades at all.
Will not ship.

889,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4224889,For Sale:  D-Ring Cobra Riggers Belts - custom made to fit you,"Garden of the Gods, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 65,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 8, 2015",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a made to order Cobra D-Ring Riggers Belt.  The belt is made of a double layer of mil-spec Type 13 resin reinforced webbing that is sewn together with 7 rows of stitching using type 92 bonded nylon thread.  What does all that mean?  It means this belt is rigid enough to hold your gun comfortably all day.  

The famous Cobra Buckle is made by AustriAlpin, and is twice as strong (rated to 18 kN straight pull) as the normal 1 3/4 Cobra Buckle.  The integrated D-ring is rated to 22 kN straight pull.  The D-ring is under tension, so it doesn't flop around.

Based on customer feedback, I did not include velcro to secure the tail of the belt.  The belt tail is long enough to allow plenty of adjustment.  If you find it is too long, you can simply double it up, and fold it under your belt loop.  For a permanent adjustment, you can cut it with scissors, and singe it with a lighter.

The belt is available in coyote brown, black, and ranger green.  The buckle is only available in black.

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING SIZING:  To determine the size you need, measure one of the belts you currently wear from the end of the buckle to the hole you usually wear it in.  The sizes here do not correspond to your pant size.  The reason I use this method is because different manufacturers of pants size them differently.  I know, it's weird, but that's what they do.  Additionally, everyone wears their pants differently, resulting in a different belt size.  The reason I use this method is to get you the belt in the exact size you want the first time.

My belts will adjust approximately 3 inches in from this size, and approximately 3 out from this size."

 I am asking $1350 for everything

 Just an fyi this is how I got to that price. The Dillon stuff was $1412 and used Dillon stuff goes for around 80-85 cents on the dollar. I went with 83 cents on the dollar or $1180. The dies were $261 and used dies go for around 65 cents on the dollar of new so, $261 at 65 cents on the dollar= $170.
