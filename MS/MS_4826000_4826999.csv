I must be crazy for selling it.  It would pass for brand new in the box, but I have carried it and fired it, although it's still in like-new condition inside and out.   I do have the box it came in, as well as two extra magazines, one with the extended finger grip and one flush bottom magazine.  Each magazine holds 10 rounds, plus one round in the gun.

I invested in a Kel-Tec trigger shoe to make the trigger wider, and best of all, a proper Ross cowhide holster that rides high on the belt and tucks in close.

The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, double-action-only pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well-suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. 

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free-floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. 

This would be a perfect pistol for personal, home or automobile security use.  How about giving this as an awesome Christmas gift for somebody special. Contact me so we can meet and let you inspect this Kel-Tec P11. I know you won't be disappointed. The price is $275 cash only, and you must show me your Oklahoma Driver's license."

OVERVIEW:

We created an unrivaled combination of precision accuracy, blazing-fast follow-ups and hunt-specific features. The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. The results are astounding – with very serious implications for every coyote, fox or bobcat that crosses its path.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.

Our R-15 VTR Predator Carbine and R-15 Predator Carbine CS* (Collapsible Stock) handle like lightning with their 18"" barrels and weigh a mere 6 3/4 lbs. – perfect for high-speed hunting scenarios. The Predator Carbine CS features a telescoping stock with a fully adjustable length of pull for a custom fit.

It loves wolf gold, fiocchi, winchester, remington, s&b etc.  It will fire 38 spl but won't cycle the action.  this Eagle was made in America not Israel.

Kentucky residents only. Must show current driver's license. I will not ship this gun out of state or in state. Face to face deals only. Meet in Lexington or Nicholasville only. Can't travel cuz of car problems. $475 cash or trade. Trade value is $550. Cash price is firm. No low ball please. I got way more than $500 tied up on the gun. I will not reply to low ball offers. Will not separate the extra mags from the gun. Package sale or trade only. Thanks for looking.

The Colt LE901-16S is a “Modular Carbine,” which means it can be adapted to any AR-15 platform upper. This isn’t a new concept, because there are of course a whole bunch of different caliber uppers for ARs. The difference is in all the other ones, they have adapted a standard size AR magazine to boutique calibers and cartridge designs. The Colt 901 is different. It can be adapted from .308/7.62, using standard P-Mags, to .223/5.56, using standard AR mags, and back again, in literally seconds. The design uses one proprietary part, and you have to swap out the recoil system. It is that simple, and it works fantastic.
Exceptional accuracy is assured by its full floated, 16.1” chrome lined barrel and one-piece monolithic upper receiver, suitable for mounting your optic of choice. The fact that most of the operating controls are ambidextrous, including the magazine release and bolt catch makes for versatility and ease of use."

Please don't ask if this is gen 1 or 2 as that shows your lack of research. They have not released a ""gen 2"" KSG according to a rep I spoke with on the phone. He stated that they fixed a few issues along the way, but there is no such thing as a ""gen 2"" KSG. 

I have decided to listen to trades for reputable brands of 1911s. Prefer something with a tactical rail. 

I would also be interested in a set of 20"" rims in 5x114.3 lug pattern. Prefer to have tires on them. Please send pics as I am pretty picky on rims.

This gun is so light and sturdy it is impossible to explain how much fun and accurate this thing is. It has the front and rear fiber optic sights which are bright and grab the light great indoors and obviously better outside. The trigger is light and crisp. If Glocks had triggers like this, we would all own four Glocks instead of one or two. The reset is very fast and short and you can fire this pistol as fast as your finger can pull the trigger.

It was a TN lower conversion with the bolt and piston changed to US made parts to make it 922r compliant. Tbostic from HKPRO did the magwell conversion and swapped the TN stock for a replica KV stock. I like how it looks but the kv does not lock as tight to it and was eventually going to replace it with a g36c stock with riser. Tbostic also cut and rethreaded the barrel from 20 to 16 in. I have 1 magpul mag and 2 g36 mags. I also have the extra magwell so you can us ar15 magazines. It requires the removal of the front mag catch which is just punching the pin out if you are so inclined. I added the rails from hkparts and the top rail is from a g36 purchased off a hkpro member. The flash suppressor in the pic is aac brakeout but i will keep that and put a thread protector back on. Gun is unfired in both sl8 and g36 configurations. Its a cool gun and probably increasing in collectibility since they discontinued the SL8. Comes with the original SL8 parts and sl8 10 round mag and promag 20 round mag and sling.
Not really looking for trades and in no hurry to sell. Trade interests would be a MR556 plus cash depending on the MR556 model and condition. No hunting rifles or shotguns. I will not respond to low ball offers. Thanks for your interest."

here is details from Stoeger- Condor

From the standard Condor field gun to the elegant Condor Supreme, there’s something for everyone in the Stoeger Condor line. All Condors feature a blued receiver sporting a high-polish and machine-turned monobloc sides. Recesses on the monobloc engage trunnion pins on either side of the receiver and pivot on them to allow smooth, solid and secure opening and closing. The Condor Supreme features a cut-checkered American walnut stock with a soft rubber recoil pad, and high-luster blueing on the receiver and barrels. The single-selective trigger and automatic ejectors make the Supreme perfectly suited for competition or hunting.

The 4x magnification is a great selection for hunters and shooting enthusiasts. The light weight optic is crafted from aircraft-grade aluminum, with an anodized finish. The lenes are constructed of hardened glass but is crystal clear.  The fiber optic band works great with the presentation of the chevron and bullet drop compensator (BDC). The optic is capable of target engagement out to ranges of 600-meters plus.  

This optic has been mounted on an AR that has been for lack of better term a ""Range Queen"" from the safe to a carry bag to the range and back into the safe. So the sight has not been in any firefights or other abusive situations. The photo shows very minimal wear on the exterior that will by no means impede the optics use.  

in addition, the ACOG comes with a FANTASTIC A.R.M.S# 15 mount. This mount uses a throw lever to mount to a 1913 Picatinny rail and is rock solid without the oversized knobs that need to be tightened or rubbing against gear or clothing when in transport.  

The kit includes: 
ACOG sight with reflective lens cover.
A.R.M.S Mount #15 Throw lever 
Sight pen and brush 
Cordura storage case with molle attachment straps.

It features the 12.9 MOA amber triangle. It uses fiber optics during the day to light the optic, and tritium at night to make it glow. No batteries are needed. I had this mounted on an AR for about a year and used the apex of the triangle as my point of aim. Zeroed the rifle at 36 yards and I was good out to 300m. It comes with the following bases/mounts. Trijicon RM33: this base is great for AKs and shotguns. It is a little too low to use on a flat top AR receiver. Yankee Hill Extended Riser: you can use this one in conjunction with the RM33. This brings the height of the site up enough to co-witness iron sights. This also extends the optic past the upper receiver and over the handguard, giving you a better sight picture. Daniel Defense offset mount: this one can also be used with the RM33. This mount is useful if you're trying to run the RMR at 1 o'clock with a scope. Everything that you get is pictured above. Price is firm, at this point I'm basically giving the mounts away. I could not get my camera to focus on the triangle, so sorry for the fuzzy picture"
