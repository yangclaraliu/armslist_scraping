For sale, AR chambered in .300 AAC Blackout . Features a Spikes Tactical Spartan lower, Odinworks stainless barrel, Odinworks forend, and assorted Magpul hardware. This is an accurate shooting rifle that uses the increasingly popular .300 Blackout cartridge. It’s pretty amazing to fire a 30 caliber projectile downrange using all the same parts as a .223 rifle, with only the barrel being different.  The .300 AAC was designed to give the ballistic performance of the 7.62x39 in an AR platform without requiring a full redesign. The result is an incredible success, especially when you consider the .300 BO generates 16.7 per cent more energy at 300 meters than the 7.62×39 or the AK round. The .300 BO is a very accurate cartridge, and coupled with the Odinworks barrel it is a great shooting combo. 

My first day firing this rifle, I picked up a couple boxes of Remington .300 BO with 120 grain supersonic hollowpoints at Academy Sports and hit the range in Unioi. It was not perfect conditions by any stretch. It was very windy, and the backstop netting kept blowing around (along with my target). Timing it between gusts as best I could, I still managed a 3.5” group of 10 shots at 50 yards, with the included iron peep sight. I don’t doubt that I could shrink this considerably if I had a proper rest. Throw in a scope, and it would drive tacks. See target picture (last one in the pictures list).  

Condition is very good. There are some scratches from general use on the forend. Internals are just barely getting broken in. Please see larger pictures in the links below.

PLEASE NOTE...I AM LISTING THIS RIFLE FOR A FRIEND OF MINE WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR. HIS CONTACT NUMBER WILL BE INCLUDED. MY EMAIL IS GOOD TO CONTACT FOR I CAN PASS THE INFO ON TO HIM.

Price: $390.00

I am not very familiar with these rifles, however I did some research and found that it appears the ""3"" Chinese symbols before the serial number designate this rifle as a Russian Type 56 that could have been an issue rifle instead of an export. AGAIN, I Do Not Know Much but some of the research mentions these factors. There are many websites with info. I saved some of these if you want to check them for yourself I can email links.

ALL of the numbers are matching. Has the built in 10 round magazine.
Used Chinese 7.62x39 caliber M43 type 56 SKS semi-automatic rifle. Stock does shows use. Bluing is in good condition, there are a few scratches. Using a light in the bore, appears to be a Clean Chrome Lined Barrel. 

Jerry Miculek has a video for the break down and more on this rifle on his web site. He states it has milled parts, again I do not know. The original sling is included with 1 box of ammo and a case and the original manual.

If you have questions, please call or email.

I have a Walther PPS 9mm for sale.  Under a week old.  Bought it for evaluation, put 200 flawless rounds down range on 1-1 but will likely sit in safe instead of being carried as it should.  Comes w everything as new, 7 round and 8 round mag.  Easy to shoot, and was very accurate even at 25 yards.   First few mags I had to adjust to the paddle style mag release, but got used to it pretty quickly.  Would make a great concealed carry gun.

If interested, please contact Don at REDACTED. Please be 21 or older with IN license and permit for bill of sale, or w/out permit we can meet at Warrior Arms in Valparaiso for the transfer and split the fee. Thanks for looking, and have a great night and happy new year.  Not really interested in trades, and price is firm."

It was an impulse buy for me. I think this pistol is absolutely fantastic, I just don't need another 9mm to eat up my ammo pile. I've shot 1 box of Federal Champion through it and that's it. No malfunctions.

I need a used Beretta 9mm for a used price not exceeding $350. Well used, banged up and ugly with scratches, holster wear and other cosmetic issues are OK if price is right.

What's important is that the Beretta is mechanically sound, functions OK and shoots straight.

Reply with full details and photos. Be sure that you offer your lowest cash price the first time, you will not get a second opportunity.

Look at my other ads, I might have something you want in trade.

Unless you are a FFL dealer with a shop, I will only meet near corner of Shea & Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale. My FFL dealer is there and will handle the transfer. That way you can prove you legally sold the pistol and I'll be assured that it isn't stolen.

I have a hearing disability and can't use telephones, provide your real Email address so I can contact you.

I can legally own the Beretta and I'm only interested in a legal purchase.

I have no interest in any stolen firearms or any that are otherwise illegal for any reason."

I bought it about 10 years ago because of the sine condition of the stock and barrels.  Also because Frank Woolner, outdoor writer, swore by it for grouse.  He made modifications on his to increase effectiveness on these quick birds including shortening the barrels for lighter weight and shot dispersion. The gun that I have has (2) barrels: one at 22"" marked Mod and one at 24"" marked Full.  I patterned these barrels and the 22"" shoots like a cyl. bore, and the 24"" like a modified. For grouse/partridge my choice has always been the 22"" barrel as it is perfect for normal quick grouse shot.  The 24"" is great for pheasant.  This gun looks good and shoots good."

Gun has approximately a 1000 rounds through it. I've shot several varieties of both JHP and FMJ ammo without problems. The VTAC model M&P come with tritium/fiber optic sights, 2 magazines, a medium and large backstrap, and a blue Smith & Wesson hard case. There is very little if any holster wear, and the stipple job is clean with very defined crisp borders. It does have some cosmetic damage under the back strap. but it is not visible unless the back strap is removed.  It's a head turner of a gun, and shoots brilliantly. NH residents only. Valid driver's license with current address and NH pistol/revolver license required for transaction. A bill of sale will be provided to both parties. I'm asking $590 OBO cash or trade. This is a $685 dollar gun new, with in my opinion a very professional looking stipple job.

However, the Scam artists never quit. And we've got a few on the local site right now.

Do NOT trust any ad that mentions 'mailing a firearm to you'. It's a fraud. They will answer the phone and really try to get your trust, AND YOUR MONEY. 

You CANNOT mail firearms to an individual. It's a scam. 
A firearm can only be mailed to an FFL (Federal Firearms License holder). 
Any ad promising to mail you a firearm otherwise, is a scam.
The only way to legally mail a firearm (and it is done quite often) is to have the firearm mailed to an FFL, who will receive it for you. You have to send a copy of the FFL to the seller beforehand. NEVER send money to an unverified seller.  

I realize this is elementary to a lot of us, but we need to stick together and protect each other and the new guy, too. 

Thank you.

History: The PT92 is seen by many as a ‘clone’ of the highly regarded Beretta Model 92F, but when Taurus made the first PT-92 in 1980, they didn’t copy or reverse-engineer the Beretta Model 92F as is sometimes believed. Instead, they bought Beretta’s entire Brazilian factory with its machinery, parts and plans and even kept Beretta’s trained workers at their stations. The early Taurus PT92 are, in some aspects, actually preferred by many enthusiasts over the considerably more expensive Beretta due to improvements made when Taurus took over production.( specifically replacing plastic parts with stainless steel )
Testimonial: Chris Dumm writing for thetruthaboutguns.com after
an extensive side by side comparison of the Taurus PT92 and the Beretta Model 92F had this opinion:
“A damned fine pistol and a great value. After comparing and shooting the Taurus and Beretta side-by-side, I would choose the Taurus first”…………
