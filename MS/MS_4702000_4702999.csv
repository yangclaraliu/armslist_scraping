Sonny Crockett had one in season 3 of Miami Vice, now you can have one too.  They are getting harder to find in any kind of great condition.  This one is pristine condition and comes with all the original items Original S&W box (s/n does not match though but the box is correct and in excellent shape for the years), original wax paper the gun was wrapped in, Safety pamphlet, warranty card and statement, 645 owners manual, magazine dis-assembly, up opened S&W cleaning kit, and finally a warning label.  The standard weapon comes with 2 – 8 shot magazines, there are an additional 3 more making a total of 5 – 8 shot magazines all are S&W. 

This 645 is all stainless steel with wood grips and white outline adjustable rear sight plus red insert front sight.  There are no marks on the frame or slide at all it is the best one that I have seen in years.  This one has been shot but it looks new.  This is the most complete package that I have seen and the weapon is the best looking on the net.  Check out the others and you will see.

$795 cash or trade.  The only item I am interested in are handguns.  No Taurus, Glocks, Kahr,Hi Point, Keltec Derringers handgun. Partial trade and cash OK.  Handguns must be in excellent shape as this one is.  Please respond to the email below since I do not always get a timely response from this site.

I paid $975 plus tax (over $1,000) for this scope, and for a cash price, I'd like to get $950 for it, but am open to only very reasonable offers!!! NO LOW BALLING!!! 

For trades, I'm only looking for a Burris XTR2 scope with the new SCR MOA reticle, or an HK VP9 or Gen 4 Glock 19. Obviously it would be handgun plus some cash. So yeah, let me know if you're interested in buying it or doing a trade for one of the above items.

Included with the lower: the single piece, solid forged, non-removable, over sized for gloves trigger guard. A typical six position telescoping stock is standard, along with sling mounts allowing for single or double point sling attachment. There is even a bayonet lug just in case. All of the M&P15 Sport’s parts are interchangeable with the rest of their AR15 product line.The M&P15 Sport’s barrel isn’t an M4 cut. This cut in the barrel will allow to mount a M203 grenade launcher. This additional cut also does not help the harmonics of the barrel. We think this a advantage that will help accuracy but will ultimately come down to the ammo used. The Smith sports a full profile barrel of American 4140 Steel. The bolt carrier and gas key are chromed, and the barrel sports their Melonite coating. Smith claims that the bare bones approach has no effect on durability. There have been reviews with this rifle firing 85,000 rounds of various brands of ammunition without any visible damage to the Melonite finish. We have found this to be a very reliable platform and so have law enforcement and countless other agencies. The engineers at Smith and Wesson made a great call when deciding to reduce the cost of their AR15 by not including a forward assist most shooters don’t use forward assists often, and when they do, it can lead to a dangerous situation. When using a forward assist, there is a potential for an inexperienced shooter to use the forward assist to jam the bolt forward when it is not the right response to a jam. A forward assist on any AR15 could cause the cartridge to get super stuck in the rifle. The original Mil Spec on the AR-15 did not include the forward assist. Smith and Wesson made another good call deciding not adding a dust cover to their M&P Sport AR15. Most AR15 shooters have little or no need for a dust cover because they’re firing from safe and clean environments. The M&P Sport is mostly used at shooting ranges, hunting, etc. In this day and age everyone is looking for the best value out there and with out any doubt this is it, you are defiantly not paying for any unneccessary features on this model. 30 Round PMAG MagazineAdjustable Front and Rear Sights6-Position Telescopic Butt StockChrome-lined Gas Key and Bolt Carrier16"" Barrel 1 in 9” 4140 Steel 5.56 mm NATOReceiver 7075 T6 Aluminum Hard Coat Black AnodizedUPC:REDACTED63MFG:811036"

This sight is smaller than the former N-cell battery sight and runs on a single 123 battery. It also has a longer battery life than the N-cell style sights. Smaller, lighter and always fast with three reticle options. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights or NV mount.- Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length - Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space compared to the 4 inch N battery sights - Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved - Battery compartment is now separated from the base to allow it to hover over the delta ring of the rifle - Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 500-600 hours, 3X battery life of N cell sights - Reticle: 65 MOA circle with 1 MOA aiming dot.

It has the adjustable accutruigger( set around 3lbs right now but can be adjusted down to 1.5 lbs I believe), digicamo accustock with aluminum bedding block, etc. It's a sub moa rifle all day long with decent ammo, and I've only put about 100 rounds through it, all factory match grade rounds with thorough cleaning and maintenance after each trip to the range.

Also included is a Minox ZA5 2-10x40mm scope. It has the XR-BDC reticle, 5 times magnification, a 1"" main tube, it has amazingly clear and crisp German Schott glass, and it's made in the USA. So, you really do get the best of both worlds with this scope. It's mounted in Warne scope rings, and I do have the boxes, manuals, lens cleaning cloth, and everything else that came with all this.

If interested, I also have a ton of all factory/no reloads, match grade ammo too for an additional charge if interested.

For interested parties, shoot me a reply and I'd be more than happy to text or email you detailed pictures of everything. If you're around the area we can meet in person too if you want so you can inspect everything and shoot it if you want before purchase. I'd prefer to do a local deal but will ship in the CONUS through an FFL, as long as you cover those fees.

Im selling this to help fund a different 308 rifle (Semi auto AR10 platform)  for my wife and would prefer to sell the rifle with the scope and everything else on it as a package deal. It has been an amazingly fun, smooth and accurate rifle for me,ands I was going to throw it in an XLR chassis, but life happened and the wife wants another toy...! So, I'm open to reasonable offers but please NO LOW BALLLING!!! This is a pick up and shoot package deal with everything you already need. For everything: rifle, scope, scope rings, muzzle brake, and bipod, I'd like to get $1150. I feel that this price is pretty good for the whole enchilada. For the right offer/price, I can throw in some brand new all factory match grade ammo, either range or hunting rounds, your choice, and a 46"" long Drago soft drag bag/double rifle case. Also included is shooting/drop data for 168gr rounds."

Will mention I had some trouble with the priming system & had to fiddle with a few adjustments. Seems to be fine now, but I've owned some 550s that are just tempermental with regards to priming, (like one of the 2 I currently use), so you have been warned. Worst case a person can always use the ""no BS warranty"" Dillon has.

The Walther Soft Coil gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.The CCPs Soft Coil gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The models barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster.The CCP comes in Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walthers line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation.This single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface.Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide.Specifications:- Operation: Gas Delayed Blowback- Caliber: 9mm- Finish Color: Cerakote® Black- Barrel Length: 3.54""- Trigger Pull: SA 5.5 lbs- Trigger Travel: 0.27""- Capacity: 8 rounds- Overall Length: 6.41""- Height: 5.12""- Width: 1.18""- Weight(mag empty): 1.39 lbsNO ADDITONAL CHARGES FOR CREDIT CARDS.
