I got this brand new and I've been using it for competitions locally but I've decided to limit my calibers so I don't have to stock as much ammo, so I'm going to start shooting 9mm since most of the informal stuff I shoot in doesn't use power factor.  It's in good condition with a little wear on the rotating breach from the action cycling.  Has about 1k rounds through it and is very reliable.  I haven't had a failure to feed since the first 100 rounds and I've been shooting mostly inexpensive range ammo (all new, no reloads though).

Red horsehoe model with bullet drop compensator for 55gr ammo.  No wear at all, bought last Christmas and have not used it since.  Date of manufacture is October 2012 so the tritium inside is as good as buying a new online.  This model is 3x magnification with a 30mm objective lens.  In my opinion, the TA-33 is the best model Acog because it has superior eye relief, making target aqusition much quicker than the Army/Marine Corps' 4x Acog that everyone is familiar with.  Includes all the original items: Pelican case, lens pen, warranty card and manual, and the original TA60 mount.  Glass is crystal clear and everything is perfect.  Will ship for $30 continental US.

Yeah 80 dollars gets you both of these beauties. First is a daisy powerline 88 with a 4x tasco scope. Comes with Allen soft case. I've had it about a year and took it in the backyard once shot less than 50 pellets and put it up. The other is a Crossman c4 with 5 rotary CLIPS. Hard pistol case, 8 co2 cartridges. Modeled after a glock looks, handles, and shoots nice. Comes with a mixed batch of bbs and pellets. Asking for less than half value. The pistol sells for around 100, the daisy for 50 then with the cases, ammo, air cartridges, and scope it all adds up quick. Trade for something else. Wanting a 22 pistol/revolver and pay a little cash. 22 rifle, single shot 12 ga, cold steel or other nice knives, let me know what you got."

Check out all the features and see for yourself why the Fortis REV™ beats the competition.

Each WMD bolt-and-carrier set is precisely machined from high-grade steel alloy to government M16 specs, then given WMD's proprietary NiB-X nickel boron coating that results in a super-smooth, harder-than-chrome surface. NiB-X reduces friction to the bare minimum and is impervious to corrosion and abrasion. The slick finish also keeps carbon from adhering, so clean up is much faster and easier than with standard parts. Ideal choice for 3-gun competitor sand other high-volume shooters

SPECS: Carrier – 8620 carbon steel. Bolt – Carpenter 158 steel alloy. Both have Nickel boron finish, silver. Extractor includes black buffer, black O-ring, and spring. Fits mil-spec AR-15/M16 upper receiver.

I purchased this rifle as a base gun for a precision rifle build, but never got around to it.  I have not fired this rifle since purchasing it in 2008.  It has 190 documented rounds down the barrel.  

These rifles are known to be extremely accurate (easily sub-MOA), and this one has a heavy 24"" cold hammer forged, chrome-lined barrel.  The Pre-64 Win 70-style (Mauser) controlled round feed (CRF) action is known for reliable feeding, and is an excellent alternative to the more ubiquitous Remington 700. 

Features:
24"" heavy contour, cold hammer forged, chrome-lined barrel

recessed target crown
forged receiver with integral recoil lug
one-piece 1913 rail with 20 MOA built in

matte black finish 


I am also including an aftermarket CDI Precision aluminum detachable magazine bottom metal with a 5 and 10 round AICS magazine, in addition to the factory magazine.  The rifle also comes with a Harris bipod. 

Again, this firearm is used, and the previous owner re-painted the stock in a camouflage pattern.  The adjustable cheekpiece does have some damage to the foam.  If the buyer cannot live with this, or the color, McMillan can replace the cheekpiece and re-paint the rifle for a reasonable price.  A good deal, especially when compared to any other SPR on Armslist/Gunbroker.

Price: $1200

SAE 9310 steel has a tough, ductile inner core highly resistant to stress fracturing, with a hard outer surface that resists galling and wear, to ensure a service life of up to 60,000 rounds. This is the same steel used in the transmission gears of Formula 1 race cars, so it’s ideal for high-impact, high-heat applications like sustained full-auto fire. Meticulously machined radiuses on all 90-degree corners on the locking lugs help distribute impact force evenly and further reduce risk of premature wear and cracking. Fully supported extractor face and precise extractor engagement further ensure smooth, reliable cycling.

CARRIER

replicates the normal carrier weight and is preferred for duty rifles or any time absolute reliability is required. Standard weight carrier features a 100% increase in bearing surface for smoother cycling and reduced wear on the inside of the receiver. Both carriers feature JP’s super-hard QPQ finish for maximum wear resistance and minimal friction. Extractor, firing pin, and all other components are included.

Up for sale is my Franchi SPAS-12 shotgun. I have shot it multiple times and its a ton of fun


Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the U.S. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 has been sold to military and police users worldwide, on the civilian market, and has been featured in films and TV shows. The SPAS 12 was designed to function primarily as a semi-automatic firearm, with the pump-action mode used to reliably fire low-pressure ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. The firing mode is switched by pressing a button under the foregrip and sliding the foregrip slightly forwards or backwards until it clicks into position. The SPAS-12 has a magazine cut-off feature, which prevents loading a new round from the internal magazine when the gun is cycled. This allows the operator to load a specialized round into the chamber without firing the entire magazine first. The barrel of the SPAS 12 was externally threaded to accept a variety of attachments, from chokes to gas-grenade launchers. The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS-12 initially led to its ""combat"" designation. Franchi renamed the model the Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun in 1990, after the importation ban of 1989 (when it was called the Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun). This allowed continued sales to the U.S. as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994. Following the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, exports to the U.S. ceased."

 In 1998 Joe Roebuck recognized the increasing demand for a safe, simple to use, and affordable firearm due to political climate changes and most states enacting legislation to allow conceal and carry permits. Joe Roebuck has been in the manufacturing industry for 35 years, and chooses to use his talents as a Tool & Die Maker and Mechanical Design Engineer to design the CPX series of firearms. . September 2003, Joe Roebuck founded Skyy Industries, LLC now known as Sccy Industries, LLC to produce a conceal & carry firearm known as the CPX 9mm. The company's first offices and manufacturing facility was located in South Daytona, Florida and as of February 2010 relocated to a new 21,000 sq. ft. facility located in Daytona Beach, Florida, just a half a mile from the famous Daytona 500 speedway.

Contained in Sccy's new facility are numerous state of the art CNC machining centers of various types using custom tooling and programs designed by Joe Roebuck. The barrel, slide, receiver and all other major metal components are manufactured at the new facility. It was Joe Roebuck's vision that the CPX series firearms could be both cost effective and precisely manufactured to be as good as or even better than other name brand name products, without the high cost to the retail buyer. Sccy is now positioned to continue producing and developing new designs for the CPX series firearms. The CPX series envisioned has been successfully manufactured and sold throughout the United States using its own dealer network. Sccy's success is benchmarked by producing over 70,000 firearms to date. This success continues to grow with the current introduction of the new ""Generation 2"" CPX series. This year, 2011 Sccy will produce CPX‐1 and CPX‐2 ""Generation 2"" pistols and expand its national dealer base to a new all‐time high.

New customer service procedures are now in place to insure fast and personal service to both retail customers and dealers in need of warranty service. We wish to thank every customer and dealer for the trust and continued loyalty to the Sccy brand and products"

All parts from the UMP, including the receiver sections, side folding stock, the bolt, recoil spring/guide assembly, cocking tube assembly, an original .40S&W HK mag, and all small parts are here, except for the trunnion section of the receiver.  All parts are in great shape, and by looking at the wear on the bolt and barrel, this UMP doesn't appear to have been shot much before it was demilled.  

This kit is perfect for converting an HK USC to a reproduction HK .40 S&W UMP.  Will ship.  These same kits go for nearly $1500 from online HK parts vendors.
