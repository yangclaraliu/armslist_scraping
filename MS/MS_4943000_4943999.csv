Smith & Wesson's new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker–fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol's easily concealed one–inch profile to its optimized 18–degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional–grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high–strength polymer frame with a black, Melonite® coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1–inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3–inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker–fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

*I have 2 Shields for sale. One in 9mm, the other in .40 S&W*

You would think this is brand new from looking at it. I can't find any evidence that it has ever been shot. 
It has, as it was purchased for review on Gear-Report.com and shot a few times during the review process. This practically new Smith & Wesson M&P Shield 9 in 9mm is now available for purchase. Comes with everything as new (box, instructions, 2 magazines, fired brass case, lock).
It is a great subcompact concealed carry pistol that has proven to be reliable, accurate and packs the capacity of the 9mm cartridge.
