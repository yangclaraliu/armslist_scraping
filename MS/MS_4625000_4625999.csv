This was imported by Armco of Boylton, MA. I am the second owner. Unkown round count, I've fired 60 rounds through it. This was more of a collector piece for me, I have other AK's I use more, so this one is on the chopping block. 

I bought it without a muzzle break, however if it's really that important to you, I have a beat up cone style 7.62 krink flash hider I'll throw in. The gun will come with a 40 round chinese magazine. The stock has a slight amount of wobble in it, nothing that effects accuracy or function. The rifle all in all is in good shape. There are little marks here and there just from poor storage by the previous owner I believe. I haven't had it long enough to abuse it haha. The rifle runs like a top and is a bit more desireable in my humble opinion, than a mint condition one. At least with this, you can have the reliability and durability of a Chinese built AK47S-1, and not cry when it's used!

Sale price is $1200, my cell is REDACTED. I will consider trades, however, my policy stands on 594. Even if the trade is heavily in my favor, but you want to comply.... You can look for another AK elsewhere. We won't be doing business. 

****Im in need of some more ink. I will trade this rifle for tattoos (professional, no amateurs) at the value of 1300 worth of ink. I will also do ink and cash, or I am specifically looking for a cz75B 9mm stainless model. 

The only types of trades I would consider are modern military style guns, nice revolvers and semi auto common caliber handguns (no .357 sig and .45 gap are not common). Walther PPK/S stainless, Jericho 941 compact 9mm, Etc etc."

Its superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and astonishing capacity combine to put more into a concealable pistol than you will find anywhere else.

The XD 3″ Sub-Compact has all the same features found in the standard XD line, but in a smaller package. The barrel is 3” and the frame is a short, compact size that will let the pistol nearly disappear when you carry it. Like other XD pistols, the XD 3” Sub-Compact gives you great versatility when it’s used with X-Tension magazines. Enjoy 13+1 rounds of 9mm, with standard flush-fitting magazines. Or throw in an X-Tension magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 16+1 rounds of 9mm. You’ll find everything on the XD 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield’s XD’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD.

If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for an XD 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range.

Light rail polymer pistol. Dovetail front and rear sights. High capacity model with magazine extension. XD Gear System includes belt holster, double magazine pouch, magazine loader, two magazines and a cable lock.

This rifle has been heavily upgraded(with actual functional upgrades). It has The FMP G3 4 groove barrel which was from a new old stock demilled FMP. These are some of the most highly desired cold hammer forged barrels capable of full auto fire abuse for 10s of thousands of rounds. This barrel is no longer importable since 2005. It also has a Fleming HK/AR machined trigger housing and a fully customized trigger. This thing is 922r compliant and is built like tank. It also includes a new old stock bayonet with adapter installed.  It has a Bill Springfield improved buffer system as well as a PWS FSC91 compensator. It runs a Rhinemetall G3 bolt carrier which is rare and the best of the best ever made(Rhinemetall is known for building tank cannons and heavy machine guns). No disappointments this thing is built to last and is a sweet battle shooter.

I also have a collection of Parts... enough you could almost build a second rifle if you so desired or backup parts to keep this thing running for a long time.

I have 40+ mags (some new, some surplus. Steel and Aluminum )

Also have between 5-700+ rounds of ammo for it in ammo cans.

I am asking $2500 or trade for quality 4x4 atv of equal or greater value

I'd love to hold on to this one, but need to sell it, and it's priced to sell. Navy Victory Models typically go for way more online, but I'm setting the price where I think is fair. If it doesn't sell and I want to make some money on it I'll put it online later.

I began with a ferrier's file and annealed the steal in a wood fire. I then shaped and shaved the steel with a file and sanding to get the desired profile. Once initial profile was complete I tempered the steel again in a wood fire and quenched in a mixture of used motor oil and transmission fluid giving it a soft but super sharp edge perfect for skinning your price in the field. The handle was made from a sail boat on the lake that no longer enjoys the spray and wind and were pressed together using fiberglass resin to make the micarta. (a messy nasty process I can tell you) Once the handle was installed and shaped with scallops for a superior grip I shaped the final bevel to have two different angles. The purpose behind this was to make a knife similar to those the native americans and inuits used processing their game. The bevel allows the blade to slice along the top of the muscle much easier than with conventional angled bevels. 

Sharpening the blade is as easy as a few runs on a sharpening rod and you are back to shaving your game in no time. 

i have over 30 hours in this project and would like to pass it on to someone else you appreciates a knife no one else on the planet has like it. Will also include a kydex sheath custom made for this blade that enables right or left hand carry as well as a modified scout carry. If you are looking for a quality blade that jim, jack, harry, and dumbass doesn't have then this is the blade for you.

Background:
I am the original owner, and purchased this about a month ago. As soon as I got the gun I ordered an Apex Tactical forward set sear and aluminum flat face trigger. I had never shot an Apex trigger M&P before, but now I know what all the support is about. I've never felt a better trigger on a striker fired gun. It has the reliability of a striker fired M&P but with the smooth and light trigger pull of a 1911. I put 100 rounds through it and it shot great. Super easy follow up shots. I was originally going to shoot USPSA limited 10 with this but chose to continue shooting production with my Glock 34. This gun really needs to be seen, these triggers really are amazing. The gun itself goes for around $600 with the factory night sights. The Apex parts cost me $175. You could always buy this, install the factory trigger and sell the Apex parts and have yourself a great gun and some extra cash.

Price:

Apex Tactical jig
Factory hard case, manuals, spent case
Original trigger parts

Background:
I am the original owner, and purchased this about a month ago. As soon as I got the gun I ordered an Apex Tactical forward set sear and aluminum flat face trigger. I had never shot an Apex trigger M&P before, but now I know what all the support is about. I've never felt a better trigger on a striker fired gun. It has the reliability of a striker fired M&P but with the smooth and light trigger pull of a 1911. I put 100 rounds through it and it shot great. Super easy follow up shots. I was originally going to shoot USPSA limited 10 with this but chose to continue shooting production with my Glock 34. This gun really needs to be seen, these triggers really are amazing. The gun itself goes for around $600 with the factory night sights. The Apex parts cost me $175. You could always buy this, install the factory trigger and sell the Apex parts and have yourself a great gun and some extra cash.

Price:
I am asking $500 firm

Buyer must have valid Ohio driver's license. Buyer must be able to legally own a handgun. I prefer buyer to have valid CCW license.

The ammo is a mixture of both target-practice type and self-defense type. On last count, the total was approximately 788. It is a bit less because I used a box or two the last time I visited the range but I did not fire much. I have since sold my .40 pistol. I no longer have any weapons chambered in .40 so the ammo needs to go. If you're wondering why I have so much, it was all included in a package deal when I initially purchased the .40, which was a Glock. If interested, please reply to this post. All reasonable offers considered. Photos and exact type/brand of ammo available on request. The only trade I would really be interested in would be a revolver (I would prefer a shorter barrel, like a snub, preferably a .357 but would consider a .38).

Very Tactical look and cutting edge futuristic design. SPLIT LIMB, DUAL CAM POWERHOUSE!!
Brand New fluorescent Green custom string and cables.
The Bear Motive 7 compound bow has been released for the 2013 season and uses the same characteristics of the Motive 6 but has packaged it up in a more carefully considered bow. The bow is powered by a new synchronized hybrid cam system that are called the H13 Cams. The cams feature dual stainless steel bearings and provide the shooter with a draw length range of 26.5"" to 31"" in ½"" increments. The efficiency of the cam as well as the nock travel is the same no matter what the draw length is. These cams are used in the new Motive and Method bows. Designed for consistent precision arrow placement. Shot after shot.  Time after time.
From target and 3D shooting or hunting big game.  Definitely designed to tackle any challenge thrown at it by the serious archer!!

Other features of the bow include the Zero-Tolerance Limb Pockets, 4X4 Roller Guard, Adjustable Offset String Suppressors and Max Pre-Load Quad Limbs.

Although most bows are all about the speed, the Motive 7 has that power to compliment a more accurate shot that is easier to control. The brace height of 7"" provides you with the forgiveness that will be appreciated and the compact frame will ensure the bow feels comfortable in the hand.
Bow Features:

H13 Cam system for super smooth draw cycle

High quality components were selected to minimize weight and recoil.  Rifle weighs approximately 6.0 lbs.  Rifle is very accurate and is optimized for shooting heavier 77 grain .223 match ammo, but will shoot mil-spec 55 grain and 62 grain surplus 5.56 just as well.  Recoil is almost non existent and follow up shots are extremely fast.  A set of Troy folding backup iron sights are included which retail for over $200.  The Troy sights feature their revolutionary dual dioptic apertures for quick and accurate target acquisition. The large aperture is for 0-200 meters and the smaller aperture is for 200-600 meters.  The rifle is pictured with a Primary Arms Microdot sight and 6x flip-to-side magnifier combo I'm willing to let go for $200 (a $319.86 value), otherwise I'm happy to use it on another build.  Detailed specs are listed below:

-16"" 1:7 twist Midlength 5.56 chambered free floated barrel
-Spikes Tactical dynacomp short muzzle break
-Midwest Industries lightweight keymod 15"" handguard w/ Magpul angled fore grip and 2"" keymod rail section
-Midwest Industries billet (machined) upper
-Spikes Tactical M16 bolt carrier group.  Bolt is magnetic particle inspected and high pressure tested (HPT/MPI)
-Rainier Arms Raptor Ambidextrous charging handle
-Spikes Tactical Lower Receiver w/ bullet pictogram selector markings.
-Magpul ACS-Light 6 position buttstock
-Spikes Tactical mil-spec buffer tube
-Spikes Tactical ST-T2 Buffer
-Troy Dioptic Aperture rear flip up sight
-Troy HK Style Flip up front sight

I built this rifle primarily for shooting 3 Gun competitions but with SHTF reliability in mind.  She is a real beauty and I always get compliments at the range.  I am asking for $1100 or $1300 with the red dot/magnifier combo.  With purchase I'm including 2 Magpul 30 round windowed magazines.  I also have a Magpul MS4 Quick Disconnect sling which can be configured as either a two point or one point sling with a button press.  The rifle has a Noveske QD endplate and has QD attachments everywhere.  This is the best sling on the market and I'm not really interested in selling it but I'll let it go for an extra $50, which is what it will cost me to buy another.  Either way get one; it works great for this rifle

I'm selling this rifle to fund a different build, so don't waste my time with low ball offers or trades for random stuff.  Please contact me through armslist if you have any questions and thank you for reading!"

I am selling my brand new Hi-point C9 9mm handgun.
I only took it to the range once and I fired about 100 rounds through it.
I purchased it less than a month from today's date 8/21/2015

I'm selling it because I rushed in to the sale when I should have saved my money.
I have school starting and I need the extra funds for this semester.

The handgun functions how it should and looks great too.
It's basically like new in box.
With the purchase I will include the original box, an unopened sight adjuster tool, a small carrying case and for 15 dollars more a pack of Remington Ultimate Defense 9mm hollow points.

This model is a decocker version of the basic CZ 75 B model. The decocking lever mounted on the left side allows the hammer to be easily lowered on a loaded chamber for a safe, ‘hammer down’ carry.

Model# R16M4FTT
Made in the U.S.A.
BRAND NEW – NEVER FIRED

The Windham Weaponry SRC is a sight-ready, semi-automatic carbine chambered in .223 Rem. or 5.56 NATO. Long story short, Windham Weaponry used to be Bushmaster Arms. The owner of Bushmaster sold the company to Remington and then in early 2011, he bought it back and renamed it Windham Weaponry. Windham currently has three AR-15 carbines in their catalog. What makes the SRC unique compared to the other two (MPC and HBC) is that instead of sights it has a Picatinny rail for easy mounting of a scope or optics and it costs about $50 less.  The SRC uses a gas impingement operating system, meaning the propellant gases that push the projectile out of the bore are captured in a tube near the muzzle. The tube directs the gas backwards toward the bolt and ultimately push the bolt back and cycling the action.  Features include 6 position telescoping buttstock, which allows shooters to adjust the stock to his or her liking, and the receiver is made of 7075 T6 aircraft aluminum, which is a corrosion resistant alloy. The material was originally designed by the Japanese in the 1940s for fighter jet frames. Now it’s commonly used to make bikes, planes, boats, cars and firearms.  Also includes black web sling and hard plastic carrying case.
