SPEC. RAILSWe are a retail stocking dealer. All products are new and in original packaging unless otherwise indicated. We do not accept any trades. All listings are for SALE ONLY. All sales are online only and can not be picked up in person. This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comAfter years of searching for the ultimate Quick Detach method for our vertical grips, TangoDown has teamed with American Defense to bring you the best vertical grip yet. Some weapon systems and mission profiles require a quick detach/attach method for vertical grips and other components. Ideally, this design would require a wide range of adjustment to fit MIL-STD spec and out-of-spec rails. It would also require no tools for rapid, accurate adjustment in the harshest field conditions. It would also be bombproof and light as possible. That grip is now available. The BGV-QD series vertical grip.. the latest evolution of our combat-tested and proven BGV-series of vertical grips. The BGV-QD series features an ADM U.S. Patent Pending throw lever system that is steps above anything else available to operators. First, the throw lever locks in place when installed, and cannot be inadvertently unlocked, if caught on web gear, slings, etc. A simple push button releases the throw lever from the locked position allowing lightning fast attachment or removal when you decide. Next, the adjustment system for fitting ANY type of rail, from authentic MIL-STD 1913 to commercial Weaver type is KISS compliant. Adjustment is accomplished in a flash, with no tools. It is simple, elegant, light and strong. No more fumbling for wrenches that may–or- may not be in your kit while you’re on a mountain top in Afghanistan. All hardware is TYPE III hard coat anodized, or given an anti-glare black Melonite coating for superior corrosion protection. The BGV-QD series grips still feature the best heat and impact modified polymers that money can buy. Our proprietary formulated resins take combat abuse in stride, and complete the mission every time without fracturing or shattering from impact, common with some other brands. All BGV series grips are injection molded from fiberglass-reinforced resin, not machined from un-reinforced brittle delrin, for the utmost in strength. Our grips are designed for use on M4S all the way to 7.62mm belt fed SAWs, and routinely pass 6’ drop tests on these weapon systems. The BGV-MK46 vertical grip is one of only two vertical grips in the US Military inventory, awarded NSN # 1010-01-536-4707. BGV-QD series grips also retain our O- ring protected internal storage cavity, good for depths of 66 feet. This cavity allows for easy access storage of weapon spares, batteries and other combat essential items. The BGV-QDK grip is the optimum choice for breaching shotguns, M4S, CQB systems such as the MK18..any system requiring a compact envelope. The shorter length also lends itself to vehicle use, or tight operating environments. The BGV-QDK is available in black, flat dark earth and foliage green. As always, every TangoDown product is proudly designed, tooled and produced here in the United States of America. Our mission still remains to provide the finest possible kit to the U.S. Warfighter.Available in colors: Black and Foliage Green.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: TANGODOWN SHORTY QD VERTICAL GRIP, FITS 1913 MIL.

And you’ll be amazed at how fun it is to shoot.
The XD(M) 3.8” Compact .45ACP has a 3.8 inch barrel mated with a shortened compact frame. When combined with the versatility of XD(M) Gear X-Tension magazines, the XD(M) 3.8” Compact .45 is ready for daily carry or a day on the range. Put in an X-Tension magazine, and you have a 13 round full-sized .45ACP pistol. Use the flush-fitting 9 round magazine, and you have a Compact.
Like all XD(M)’s, the XD(M) 3.8” Compact comes with three interchangeable backstraps, dovetail sights, mega-lock frame texturing, an ambidextrous magazine release, a multi-position frame rail, and a match grade barrel. You’ll also find all the safety features that make the XD(M) a safe pistol in responsible hands.
Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. The rugged Multi-Use Carrying Case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.
Springfield XDM Features
Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.
(M)ould-Tru Backstraps: With the interchangeable backstraps, Springfield has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.
(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System™: A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter’s hand position.
(M)elonite®: Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.
(M)atch Grade Barrel: Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.
(M)agazine X-Tensions™: With an interchangeable Mag X-Tension™, you can personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs.

This is as original as it gets. Completely matching and unmolested 1939 date 27 code K98 Mauser with low serial number 194i. This is original down to the L&F 1939 dated sling, and even have the original cleaning kit issued with the gun in its original leather pouch. Also comes with a factory 1939 8mm ammo box.
Code 27 was formerly S27, which stood for Erfurter Maschinenfabrik (Erma). The receiver, barrel, rear sight group, bolt group including firing pin, bolt release, floor plate assembly, follower, trigger group screws, bands, bayonet lug, and stock are all matching. The stock has not been sanded and has an original K98K sling marked 1939 with maker.
The bore is excellent with no import mark on the barrel and the stock has not been cut. Still has most of the finish except for the butt plate. Erma stopped production of the K98K in 1941, and the serial number of this rifle is #194, making it a fairly early, hard to find variant.

The gun is all matching down to the screws, and cleaning rod. Nothing has been altered or changed since it left the field. Has the original blueing and is in excellent shape.
Gun has all birds intact and no import or Russian marks.

This is not a Russian capture, Yugo, or any of the other imported, mismatched, crap out there. Please don't waste your time or mine with offers not consistent with current, matching K98K prices.

I have for sale a Ruger American rifle in 243 Winchester. The gun is in great shape. It shoots great.

The reason I am selling it is I have 3 Grandkids. The oldest is 10 and is ready to start hunting. The guns length of pull is too long for him. I will be buying him a youth model of the same gun.
There are approximately 30 rounds thru the gun.

The scope and rings DO NOT come with the gun.
I would consider a trade for a  Ruger American Youth in 243 winchester.

I am located in Beaver Dam.
The price is $290 or best offer

From lonewolfs page 

Lone Wolf R&D LLC proudly introduces the WolfPack™ Series Replacement Frame.

If you had the ability to build your own custom Glock frame, this is what it would look like.

The TimberWolf is intended as a direct replacement for your 3rd generation Glock frame or use it as the foundation to build your own custom Glock pistol.  It incorporates all of the most desirable features custom builders offer including: a choice of 2 quick change grips, rounded trigger guard, extended beaver tail, round mag catch, improved checkering, higher grip angle and improved rail system. 

Slap the slim grip on your new TimberWolf frame and you instantly have the smallest sculpted grip in the industry. No grip reduction can compete with this custom fit or feel. Many claim it is better than any double stack 1911 offered! Install the swelled grip and try to decide, is it an XD or a Sig. Either way, it takes less than a second to try them both.

This new, shooter friendly polymer replacement frame works with Gen3 Glock models: 19/23/32/38. The Timberwolf frame includes the basic parts unique to it: round mag catch and two grips. All remaining Gen3 Glock factory parts are standard ""fit and function"". Other than a ""Slim Frame Trigger housing is needed"" Parts # LWD-30275 or GLO-30275 for 9mm, LWD-28927 or GLO-28927 and GLO-4361 locking block. Drop them in, perform the basic safety function test and you are ready to go."

Bought in June of 2014 at Top Gun, after I shot a friends gun, never got around to taking it out to shoot, and probably never woulld. So I will  sell for under current pricing. Paid $1200+ a year ago, will let it go with 3 magazines and 200 rds of .40 ammo for $1100.

Designed both by and for undercover LEO agents, the STI Shadow is a compact aluminum framed pistol with everything anyone needs in a backup pistol.

When Texas undercover narcotics officers started looking for the perfect concealable pistol, they came to the premier Texas pistol manufacturers. Based on their input, STI has come up with the STI Shadow- a light weight pistol that is as reliable as it is concealable.

The classic slide is 3.0"" in length with rear cocking serrations & standard STI oversized ejection port. The 2 dot tritium night sights have been recessed into the slide and, along with the integral sight channel, provide the perfect compromise between easy sight acquisition and snag free carry. The STI Shadow is built on a forged aluminum STI officer sized frame with a stippled front strap. The grip includes a flat checkered polymer mainspring housing configured to provide excellent retention. The controls are STI’s single sided blued thumb safety and STI’s bobbed high-rise, blued, knuckle relief beavertail grip safety. The barrel is a 3.0"" fully supported STI ramped bull barrel. The STI Shadow comes standard with an STI RecoilMaster guide rod system, STI commander hammer, and patented STI International trigger system.

""DO NOT COMPLY"" means exactly that. Do NOT comply. Not for your convenience, not for your ""peace of mind"" (you shouldn't be selling your guns anyways if you're a worry wart about that stuff), not for the deal of the century. Not for anything. Remember what ""I will NOT comply"" really means, and do it guys! Reporters and low-life do-gooder's, that have nothing better to do then snitch and tattle... You guys can kick rocks. Quit being a sell out and stop letting the man (hippies and idiot gun grabbers that means you guys too!) infringe on your rights! Rant over,  now onto the good stuff.

With a striking design and refined details. Besides its renowned reliability, the P30 is especially notable for the completely new design of its grip ergonomics. The easily exchangeable grip shells (right/left) are the only ones of their kind in the world. In combination with the exchangeable back strap the pistol provides maximum adaptability to any hand size – for both men and women.

What is more, the standardized MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail at the front of the P30 frame provides maximum flexibility with regard to equipment with additional tactical accessories."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.
