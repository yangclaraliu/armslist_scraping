The rifle is in great shape, almost new condition with less than 200 rounds through it. If you are not familiar with these rifles they are patterned off the Czech VZ58 rifle, and while similar in appearance it is not an AK clone.  Has a solid forged receiver but is very lightweight despite this and only weighs about 6 pounds unloaded.  Also very accurate and has a side folding stock.  Will come with three 30 round magazines, cleaning kit, and original leather sling.  I also have a little bit of ammo I can include, about 50 rounds.

I hate to see it go but I just don't use rifles much.  Would be interested in trading for a quality handgun in 9mm, such as a Beretta 92, CZ75, XDm, or similar.  Would also consider a 1911 of some sort, or a 38 or 357 revolver with a 3-4 inch barrel.  Not interested in other shotguns, rifles, Tauruses or Kel Tecs.

You are buying the ammo below cost and without shipping fees i have accrued over time. You can use steel AR mags for this but i have 4 alexander arms .50 beo mags.I have way more pictures of the rifle and pictures of the different ammo so send me a line if you want more pics.  If you have any questions please feel free to email.

Yes, this shotgun looks and performs like a $2000+ shotgun, but look at the price. American Tactical Importers (ATI) imports the Calvary shotguns from Turkey and some believe they are made by Yildiz, one of the world's best shotgun manufacturers and sub-contract to big names, like Weatherby. The Turkish economy has seen better days and the skilled workers aren't paid very much. The cost in production is directly proportional to the price tag. Thus, we have a low-priced shotgun that has the looks, performance and dependability of the higher priced guns. Just compare the description items below (even has auto ejectors!), along with the price, with any O/U shotgun and you'll understand why it's so hard to find or keep one in stock. Sorry, but I have the last ONE from my wholesalers. My Cousin, Ronnie or Ron Bob, as he is known up on Ridge Road, doesn't like O/Us of any kind. I think it's because he can't get a double without 4 or 5 shells, but don't tell him I told you.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72 bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the latest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform.
The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
 
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The CZ 75 SP-01 model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005 s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

I've since changed my personal carry gun and this just sits in the safe now. I've shot 200 rounds (Kahr's break in period) of Hornady Critical Defense through it without a single malfunction. Haven't tried any other ammunition so I can only speak for Hornady's flawless performance. I'm very anal about the guns I carry for personal/family defense, and cleaned it after each shooting. This was mostly a summer gun and was carried in a pocket holster in the front pocket of my shorts around town. Wears very easily even in gym shorts with pockets, or the back wallet pocket of any jean pants. 

It is in absolutely excellent condition with no scratches or defects of any kind. It could sell as ""brand new"" in a store and nobody would know the difference. I'm selling this gun for $600 plus FFL fees. It originally came with one magazine, but I've since bought two extra 6 round magazines that will be included inside the case. The pocket holster will also be included in your purchase.

Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the CZ 75 Compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry with checkering in key areas on the front and back straps combined with the redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decreases the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transitions.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting."

""The XO-26™ is a cross over between rifles and pistols.  The 26 refers to the absolute minimum length of the firearm as allotted by federal law.  However, we chose to make the length an inch longer than necessary so that it would still be long enough to qualify as a non-AOW even if the muzzle device was removed.  This length also makes it easier to see the chamber indication.""

I hesitate selling this gun, it's hard to find and I love the caliber, but I need to fund another gun project and don't have a real ""need"" for this gun. This gun transfers with a single shot magazine sled in it, and can be switched out with a 10 round magazine after transfer. I've shot 80 rounds through this gun with zero malfunctions of any kind, and surprising accuracy. It's a blast to shoot with not much more felt recoil than any of my .223's  and I won't be disappointed if it doesn't sell. 

Purchase of this gun comes with all of the following:

Unopened case (1,000 rounds) of Wolf 123 grn FMJ
SIG Pistol Brace- ATF letter included
Two- ASC 10 round magazines

Price is $2,000, no trades at this time. Please email me if you're interested or have any questions. Thanks!"

Purchased this Colt in Feb 2015 with the intent to use it for 3 gun and with young kids I just have not found the time to get to the gun range.  However my kids have shown that they enjoy archery, and getting to the archery range not to mention shooting at home is much easier.  This firearm has had maybe 150 rounds fired through it if even that many.  I sighted it in with the iron sights when I bought it and then once again when I purchased the Vortex 1x4x24 that is mounted on top.  As you can see it is in mint condition and comes with many extras. This is as close to an actual M4 as I had when I was in the Marines, the barrel length  of 16” is the only difference.  Other than that, it is completely mil-spec right down the roll marks.  As you can see if I were to list everything that this firearm comes with, not mention tax/shipping I am upwards of $2000.  I am tempted to even throw in some of the remaining ammo that I have for it.  I bought a case of 556/223 (440rds) when I first purchased and as I said have fired very little of it. 
As I said above this is for a cash sale (dependent on records check) or a trade for a Elite brand bow setup.  The bow has got to be new or right off the shelf with above average components as that’s what's being offered in the firearm.  I would maybe consider a cash and partial trade depending on the setup you have.  Lets talk it over.

Mainly looking to trade it for something a bit smaller and concealable. Looking to do a straight across trade. This gun is simply awesome. It's accurate and consistent, it's just too big for me to carry around. For those of you know aren't aware of what this is, it's basically a Sig P226 clone. These were originally made by CZ (not the Czech company) in Serbia, but the Serbian company was eventually shut down. Two companies then proceeded to buy their equipment and their guns. Israel and South Africa. What I have was made in South Africa, and was one of the primary handguns issued to both South African police and their military. It's great for a shooter, truck gun, home defense, or whatever you may need it for, not only that it's still used by some police forces around the world today, such as: Israel, Bosnia, Serbia, Iraq, Macedonia, Montenegro and Jordan. It's a rare and inexpensive piece of not only fine machinery but also history, it was even used by some of the guys on Top Shot where you can see it's proven accuracy in action. This beast has an all stainless steel slide, sights and barrel, accompanied by a durable aluminium frame. It will come with 3 15rd original magazines.

I'm not picky about trades, to be honest. I would prefer something along the SIZE of a Glock 19, though. Or maybe for sale for $400.

Good chance this one was used for the south. Markings on the barrel indicates the rifle is .577 cal. Crown marking located on the Aft side of the lockplate while the Tower stamp and date are on the forward side of the lockplate. Rear sight still attached, which many Towers have missing due to the sight only being held on by soldier joints. Barrel and lockplate does have some pitting and hammer does not release once cocked and trigger pulled. Nice finish still on wood stock. Own a piece of US history for the 150th anniversary of the Surrender at Appomattox."
