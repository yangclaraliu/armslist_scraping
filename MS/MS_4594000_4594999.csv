NEW, NEVER FIRED

For more than a decade, the Mossberg® 500® pump-action shotgun has served as one of the most practical starter shotguns ever made. Now, with the same standards of quality, dependability, and safety in mind, shooters and hunters will find the 500® Super Bantam™ truly remarkable. Unequalled in practicality and loaded with custom-like features, these new pump-action shotguns provide an affordable opportunity for beginning and growing shooters to get started with a safe and reliable shotgun. The Mossberg® 500® Bantam™ is the choice of youngsters and smaller stature adults - from beginners to seasoned shooters alike. With the same standards of dependability and safety in mind, Mossberg® now offers the 500® Super Bantam™ 20-gauge pump. Like the 500® Bantam™ it is geared for young sportsmen and smaller framed shooters. Its superior versatility however, is what makes this gun truly ""super."" Here's how it works: The Super Bantam™ features a standard 12"" length of pull (one full inch shorter than the standard Bantam™) and it comes with an innovative stock spacer and extra rubber recoil pad to bring the synthetic stock to 13"" overall. When the shooter is ready for a full-sized length of pull, (14""+) just turn in the certificate that came in the box, for a full 50% off the price of the full-sized stock.

**Details/FAQ**
Can be shipped anywhere in the lower 48 states of the US by certified HazMat shipper for a flat fee of $46.00 per package with a maximum weight of 48 lbs of powder per package. This is NOT negotiable and the weight cannot be exceeded as per the DOT regulations. Every HazMat shipment will include a $46 fee to cover the HazMat + Ground shipping fees.

NO exceptions. Don’t even ask. It’s a felony to ship Hazardous Material without proper labeling, identification, packaging, and handling precautions. I WILL NOT do anything of that nature.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insurance can be added at buyers request and will be added to total. If no insurance is purchased, damage to the package is between the buyer and UPS. The shipper or the seller is not liable for their handling of the packages. If you choose to save the money, you accept the potential consequences for those actions. Insurance is based on value of package in $100.00 increments and UPS will have most up to date information on how that is calculated (I believe it is a flat fee to the nearest $100.00 increment value).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To save time, the total of whatever you are interested in is calculated in the following manner:

Price of ALL powder desired up to the limit of 48 lbs total + $46 HazMat/Shipping Fee + Insurance (Optional)

Example: $149.99 for 8 lb keg + $46 shipping = $195.99 total. (No Insurance)
If you want more than 48 lbs of powder, the second package containing the amount over 48 lbs will have an additional $46 HazMat shipping fee associated with that package.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not email asking for a total cost of a variety of items plus shipping to XYZ zipcode. It is the same price, $46, to ship it anywhere in the lower 48 states of the US.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contact me via email to state what you are interested in and I will notify you if those amounts are no longer available OR I will reply with an itemized breakdown of your order and mailing instructions on how/where to send payment.

Local sales will be done on select days depending on my availability at a location of my choosing in Kissimmee Florida. If the powder you want is available and you are planning to wait several weeks for pickup, for whatever reason, payment MUST be sent to secure those items. I cannot hold items that are not paid for."

The Bad: it's a shooters gun, has surface scratches across the stock and the blue is started to peak at the barrel (consequence from shooting with the bayonet on, yeah it has a bayonet and yeah it's awesome.)

414,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4594414,For Sale:  ArmaLite AR-30A1 300 Win Mag  Target Model 30A1BT300 Tactical Match Grade Rifle,"Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 950,"Listed On: Monday, August 10, 2015",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"** ArmaLite AR-30A1 Target Model, .300 Winchester Magnum, 24 inch barrel, 5 round detachable magazine, Adjustable rear stock ( 30A1BT300) ** From ArmaLite , The AR-30A1 is the next generation of ArmaLite's highly acclaimed bolt action rifles - the ULTIMATE long range target and tactical firearm. The new AR-30A1 is the sought after target version and a standard version chambered in .300 Win Mag. On the surface, the AR-30A1 bears a family resemblance to its predecessor, the AR-30. But, every individual component of the AR-30 was scrutinized in the AR-30A1. As a result, only the pistol grip, buttpad, trigger, and a few small components from the AR-30 passed muster for the AR-30A1. All other components are new and/or improved. The result is a firearm that maintains its predecessor’s outstanding accuracy, light weight, and soft recoil while dramatically improving its ergonomics, adaptability, versatility, reliability and ease of use. Features of all versions of the new AR-30A1: Muzzle brake threads on the end of the barrels employ threads that are standard for the sound suppressor industry (5/8 x 24 for the 300 Win Mag, many sound suppressors can be screwed directly onto the barrel without the need for an adaptor. The 24” barrel of the .300 Win Mag balances ballistic performance with portability. A tough, through-hardened receiver means reduced wear and increased smoothness. The bolt-mounted safety mechanism locks the firing pin to the rear. This design is stronger and more secure than a sear or trigger blocking safety because it directly blocks the firing pin itself. The metal cheekpiece is very durable and the elastomeric cheekpiece pad provides a comfortable shooter interface in all weather conditions. The cheekpiece supports contain integral cleaning rod guides that prevent damage to the bore due to inadequate cleaning rod control. Multiple sling installation locations allow simultaneous use of a sling and a bipod. And the rear sling swivel can be moved to either the left or right side. To provide very compact transportation, the entire buttstock assembly can be quickly and easily removed with only one allen wrench. Military grade anodizing and phosphating finishes enhance durability and corrosion resistance. AR-30A1 Target version incudes: A top 20 MOA Picatinny rail that is 18 inches long over the receiver and barrel will support any scope and accessory devices such as night vision devices. Picatinny rails on both sides of the forearm allow installation of other devices. The cheekpiece is vertically adjustable for 1 inch of adjustment without the use of tools so that each shooter, regardless of their facial features, can obtain an optimum cheek weld while still achieving a clear sight picture. The buttstock can be adjusted without tools for lengths of pull from 13.6” to 15.6.” This makes the AR-30A1 ergonomically correct for shooters from the 5% female to 95% male. Shooters can also quickly adjust length of pull to accommodate changes in clothing or shooting position. In addition, with a single allen wrench, the buttpad is adjustable for height. A 1913 accessory rail at the bottom of the buttstock allows for installation of additional accessories such as sling swivels or monopods. Performance characteristics of the AR-30A1: ArmaLite’s testing has proven the muzzle brake to be the best in the industry for both reducing recoil and increasing accuracy. This makes shooting the AR-30A1 comfortable for even the smallest or recoil-sensitive shooter. The competition grade barrel and our patented V-block receiver bedding system are keys to the AR-30A1’s minute of angle accuracy. ArmaLite’s patented V-Block™ Bedding Wedge and V-Block Stock assure absolute strength and repeatability for superb accuracy. The aluminum stock reinforces the receiver like a bench-rest sleeve. The magazine of any mag-fed firearm is critical to reliable feeding. The AR-30’s magazine underwent extensive development testing to assure reliability of feeding. It is made of steel, not polymer or aluminum, to provide years of heavy duty service. The single stack design of the AR-30A1 magazine minimizes the material removed from the receiver for the mag well. This significantly contributes to the strength and stiffness of the AR-30A1 receiver. The deep magazine well under the receiver makes magazine insertion fast and easy, while holding the magazine in exactly the correct position for reliable feeding. An ambidextrous magazine catch is centrally located so that the shooter can release the magazine and catch it with the same hand. Reloading is fast, and the expended magazine won’t be dropped to be lost, damaged or muddied. The powerful ejection system and generous ejection port eject even loaded .300 Win Mag. cartridges rapidly and reliably. The large ejection port also makes single loading of cartridges through it easy and fast. The ergonomically improved bolt handle design and “competition grade” dimensions and tolerances in the receiver allow lightning-fast, butter-smooth reloading"

> Century Trigger Springs
> Century Trigger Retaining Pin
> FDE Tapco Intrafuse Fore-End with Tri-Rail

2) Optic: Bushnell TRS-32 Red Dot Sight, Tube Styled with Flip Up dust covers and medium height 30MM rings. Zero'ed at 100yds. 

3) Magazines: Two 30-round Steel Romanian magazines and Two 30-round Magpul Gen 2 7.62x39 PMags. The PMags insert at a steeper angle so using it with the supplied VFG is very tricky

4) Ammunition: ~800 (+/-) rounds of TulAmmo steel cased non-corrosive 123gr FMJ 7.62x39 ammo. 700 are in 20 round boxes. 90 are loaded in the magazines (2 PMags full and 1 Steel mag full) and about another dozen or so loose rounds. I will give these to you with the items in Mk19 40MM grenade canister. It is about the storage space of 6 .30 Cal cans. Comes with sealed metal top.

At this time I am ONLY willing to sell/trade away the WHOLE lot - unless we come to the right deal. I am ONLY interested in Glocks in 9mm and .45 ACP to exclude the Glock 36. Not to sound like a butthead but I am looking for something very specific. If you only have 1 Glock that I want you will add boot.

If it s a CASH deal then I am willing to lower the price to people who can come near Clarksville at exit 11 or near Joelton. Or anyone on Fort Campbell. Trying to get this sold ASAP as the 2 Glocks I want are on sale at my LGS.

MSRP is $1,220, and OpticsPlanet offers it for $1,037. Get it here for less! Comes with box and papers and everything; box has been opened but again, scope has never been mounted or used at all.

I bought this scope for a rifle build but need to sell. 
I also have an amazing quick detach mount for it, if you need the ring mounts. LaRue Tactical SPR M4 Scope Mount QD LT104, with quick detach lever. They retail there for $210+shipping (http://www.laruetactical.com/larue-tactical-spr-m4-scope-mount-qd-lt-104). I will include for $200 flat, and even have the ""Beverage Entry Tool"" bottle opener and ""Dillo Dust"" dry rub I'll pass on to you.

Willing to drive within an hour or so of Provo, and also willing to ship if desired. Thanks for looking and God bless."

First introduced in 2000, nearly 300,000 CompM2 sights are now in use 
by many Armed Forces including elite Special Forces around the world.

withstand the most severe weather conditions and temperatures. In fact, 
the CompM2 is completely submersible allowing it to be taken up to 25 meters underwater. 
When the CompM2 was released, it became the benchmark against which all other combat optics are measured. While primary utilized by armed forces, hunters and sport shooters who want a professional grade sight can also use the CompM2. 

Unique features of the CompM2™ 
• Compatible with every generation of NVD 
• CET technology allows up to 10,000 hours of daytime operation on 
one battery 
• 100,000 hours of use on NVD setting

Two most notable features is that it is RD85 treated which means this rifles requires ZERO lubrication ever! (In fact the company advises completely against the use of oil what so ever) The rifle will not only stay cooler longer under rapid fire but can also be cleaned with soap and water. 
Don't believe me? Check out the Anderson am15 reviews.

And just to put this bad boy to the test to see how well it could stay cooler under fire. I had watched several videos of builds with bump fire stocks placed on them to see how they would run. I was quite impressed so I put a bump fire stock as well! Have the power of full auto fire and not have to pay outrageous costs for class 3 weapons.

Consider this. Have you ever fired full auto/bump fire? Notice how fast your gun overheard? With the rf85, you can now shoot under cooler temps for much longer. Rd85 is the same material used in some internal parts in NASCAR engines.

Rifle includes many attachments and grip points.
Tactical light, pistol grip, truglo red dot scope which was built to withstand shotgun recoil. Extended charging handle tab, sling, muzzle brake, quad rail, flip up sights. Aftermarket gas block, and 8 fully loaded magazines all brand new. 4 troy battle mags with pull down tab. And 4 metal. All mags are filled with AP rounds

I even have all of the original accessories like the other grips, the 3 original magazines, and the original paperwork/box it came in.

I also have a couple of small but necessary accessories I purchased:

--- it's a nice added security measusure that snugly fits behind the trigger that can be easily pushed and ready to fire

Slug Plug: $7 value. it's a plug for the empty area right behind the magazine on the back of the grip. See pictures

Key lockbox (two keys) that perfectly fit this full size handgun + 2 magazines (1 inside the gun). It's not a super secure lockbox but it's better than nothing. $20 value

If you were to buy it brand new in a store it would cost around $550 + tax and fees easily going over 600, but with mine you get over $40 of aftermarket accessories/lockbox at the cost of having ~150 rounds through it.

Grip Pod is not included and is only in the pictures to help hold the rifle up.  I bought this rifle new in late 2012 and didn’t shoot it for over a year.  I have probably shot less than 200 rounds through it.  This was mainly to test functionality of the magazines.  It is the factory version of the ATI folding stock.  It has some Ruger markings on it where the normal ATI one does not.  It also has a threaded barrel and removable flash suppressor from the factory.  I still have the unopened Ruger factory scope rings and lock that came with it along with the box and paperwork.  I changed out the hand guard to a new old stock one from the 80’s that is a slotted metal design.  This removes the factory top rail from the gun, but I will include the original hand guard as well with the rail.  I think it looks much better with the slotted metal hand guard.  It came with a 20 round magazine when I purchased it but I also added a 30 round Ruger factory magazine I purchased straight from Ruger when I bought the gun.  I will also include 6 thermold brand made in USA 30 round polymer magazines for a total of eight magazines.  I function checked both Ruger magazines and some of the thermold ones to ensure they were working properly and all shot fine.    I really hate to let it go,  but it may be time. Must be a Missouri resident and I will need you to fill out a bill of sale that we will both sign and I will give you a copy of if you want it.  I would prefer a CCW holder but not a deal breaker.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Also feel free to make a reasonable offer.  I would possibly trade for reloading equipment, 223/5.56 or 9mm ammo, or a firearm in 9mm plus cash depending on exactly what is offered."

Bought this gun at Parro's a little over a year ago for around $800 and have put one thousand rounds through it. The gun has never misfired and only a few times failed to completely feed the round in which never happened again after I cleaned and lubricated it the first time. The gun has a rail on the side so you can buy a mount and attach a scope.

If you are 100% going to buy it I will go to a firing range to shoot it in front of you to display and prove it's reliability. Don't waste my time though.

The price is 600. That is not OBO and not negotiable with some form of trade. $600 flat."

Time to thin the heard. Gotta make room for next project. Here is my custom built 10MM. It is built on a Colt Frame, Caspian Slide and Bar-Sto Barrel. Back & front grips are custom made into the handle in addition to the side grips. I put in an ambidextrous safety. The grip safety is custom as well. 

This pistol comes with two magazines. 

I have put between 300-400 rounds down the pipe. She is kept in storage container when not in use and clean. No issues, feels great and shoots even better.

When you price everything out, you will see why $600 is more than a fair deal. I have more invested but I know how this works. So just looking to get something to put towards my next build. Cannot do trades at this time, looking for cash. 

Learn more about Bar-Sto Barrels at https://www.barsto.com 

Must be willing to do BG check at your FFL or mine here in Denver. Buyer covers background check. If out of state, I will keep everything legal and will charge you the same I pay for shipping as this must be sent to an FFL. 

Asking $600 but willing to see what is out there. Please no low-ballers, I will sell my old tools for an undercut price before I do this one so save both our times. I will not respond to anything unrealistic. Go online and price everything out... then you will see there is over 850 sunk into this pistol.

These guns were made by Beretta for FN, and sold under the Browning brand name.  The design is similar to a Beretta 84. They are Double/Single action pistols. This gun is nickel plated with factory walnut grips.

I love this gun but don't use it as much as I thought and would rather have the money for something else. The gun is in overall excellent condition and has very few light handling marks. The finish is in great condition and fully intact with no rust. The grips are also in great condition. You may notice that the buckmark medallion on the right grip was missing when I took these pics. I finally found my extra medallions, and have since replaced the missing one, but haven't updated the pics yet. I will also throw in my last extra medallion in case you need it down the road. 

This gun has been used very little and has been very well taken care of. I bought it from the original owner in 2014. It functions flawlessly and shoots quite well for a small pistol. It comes with two factory 10rd magazines, and the factory box and papers. 

Although there are a lot of BDA's still around, there are very few nickel finished ones in excellent condition like this one. It's a beautiful collector piece and a very fun gun to shoot. If interested, please call or text at 405-eight one eight-6585. Price is $625 FIRM. Thanks!"
