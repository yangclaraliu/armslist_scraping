Product Description
An affordable yet accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is built to bridge the gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets. This introductory level carbine features a 16"" light contour barrel, A3 upper receiver with Picatinny rail, railed gas block heat-dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible, six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.4 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny rail. The 16"" lightweight barrel provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications.

I have one all black Walther PPK/S I'd like to part with. I've only put about 50rds through it. Accurate as all get out, definitely a tack driver (pic to prove it!). Fun little pistol but I need to liquidate some stuff to make room in my safe. Has a threaded barrel so you can throw a suppressor on it and have some real fun. 

Comes with:
(1) Walther PPK/S in .22lr
(1) Walther 10rd magazine
(1) Walther plastic case
It HAD a small IKEA-style crescent wrench to remove the barrel tip (to expose the thread) but I've since lost it. It's literally just a little IKEA wrench, I'm sure you have one sitting in your garage. I can even twist it off with a tight grip when I haven't fastened it too tight.

Looking to get $350 cash OR trade for another small/CC pistol, but bigger than a .22lr. Also really like surplus firearms, German guns and AK/AR pistols. If it's worth more than $300 obviously I would throw cash in on my end. I'm willing to meet F2F anywhere in the Austin metro area.

I have every single piece of paperwork and little nick nacks that come from the factory plus a lot more. It has the factory night sights installed on it now but I have a brand new set of competition sights that are ready to be installed, I put them under the pistol so you can see what type they are.

The slide lock has been tuned from CGW to be very light and smooth for ultra fast reloads.  It comes with a SS guide rod from CGW and a lighter recoil spring from CGW. It has a lighter main spring and extended firing pin from CGW. It comes with a picatinny rail that's made for this gun from the CZ Custom Shop. All of the pins and springs have been replaced with better ones from CGW. Trigger pull is much lighter do to the spring rates. I was going to have the firing pin block removed to eliminate the creep in SA mode but I never got around to it. The gun comes with three mags which are very expensive. They only come with one from the factory. It has the original barrel brush, patch rod, barrel bushing wrench, and a few snap caps with extra rubber inserts. It will also come with a 20 round box of Lehigh Defense Maximum Expansion rounds which are impossible to find and Very expensive. If you've never heard of them I urge you to look them up on YouTube.    The gun has never been dry fired and has been meticulously maintained. If you'rea gun guy you realize how expensive all of these extra modifications are. This gun is an absolute tack driver and is a pleasure to shoot. I'm only interested in trading for other CZ's. I have over $1,450 invested in this pistol. I'm asking $1,000 obo for it. I'm just looking to get into 9mm. I will trade up or down depending on what you have. I have picture taken yesterday of a 97b with the wooden grips and only 1 mag without a box or paperwork that sold on gunbroker.com for $690 so that kind of puts my price into perspective considering evert hinges that you're getting with this gun.

Glock acknowledged that sentiment with the development of the Glock 21. Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the Glock 21 Gen4 delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 Auto round with 10 or 13 round magazine capacity. The modular backstrap design lets the user adapt the grip to hand size, and the frame surface exhibits the scientifically-designed Gen4 rough textured technology. This model features a dual-recoil spring assembly that substantially increases the life of the system, and the enlarged reversible magazine catch easily accommodates left- or right-handed operators. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment. The Gen4 system is the perfect complement to this iconic .45 caliber cartridge.

3/8” AR500 steel is rated to withstand any impacts from pistol ammo from a safe distance (10 yds). AR500 steel is rated to withstand lead rifle ammo at 3200 fps or less at a minimum distance of 100 yds. The stands will withstand pistol ammo but will be damaged if rifle ammo strikes it and it must be replaced. 

6 PLATE DUELING TREE (6” X 3/8” PLATES) $450
Three point “All Welded Stand” (AWS) with a 6 plate dueling tree.  Plates are 6” x 3/8” AR500 steel.  Dueling tree stands approx 5’6” tall and disassembles at the base. Plates are removable for transport. The stand is angled at 22 degrees to assist in plate reset. The dueling tree utilizes heavy duty 1.5 DOM pivot tubes for long life. 

66% IPSC TARGET (12” X 20”) WITH STAND $250
Three point ""All Welded Stand"" (AWS) with a 66% IPSC target. Target is 3/8"" AR500 12"" by 20"" IPSC standing approximately 5 foot high. The AWS disassembles at the base for transportation. AWS and Target weight is approx 54 lbs. AWS is designed to reduce the risk of fragmentation deflection due to its design of its base and the 15 degree off-set. Off-set helps deflect fragmentation towards the ground and assist with target longevity.

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.
The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

A polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame. Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights and Hogue black Diamondwood grips complete this package."

This pistol is truly one of a kind. If you know you CZ's, you know how hard these are to come by. This pistol is used but doesn't have ANY signs of wear or blemishes of any kind other than the wear marks on the mags. There are a lot of upgrades on this gun and I'll try my best to list them all. I have every single piece of paperwork and little nick nacks that come from the factory plus a lot more. It has the factory night sights installed on it now but I have a brand new set of competition sights that are ready to be installed, I put them under the pistol so you can see what type they are. They come with extra fiber optic rods in green and red, also comes with sight installation tools. It has the CZ Custom grips installed along with the factory walnut grips that are in 100% condition. The slide lock has been tuned by CGW to be very light and smooth for ultra fast reloads. It comes with a SS guide rod from CGW and a lighter recoil spring from CGW. It has a lighter main spring and extended firing pin from CGW. It comes with a picatinny rail that's made for this gun from the CZ Custom Shop. All of the pins and springs have been replaced with better ones from CGW. Trigger pull is much lighter do to the spring rates. I was going to have the firing pin block removed to eliminate the creep in SA mode but I never got around to it. The gun comes with three mags which are very expensive. They only come with one from the factory. It has the original barrel brush, patch rod, barrel bushing wrench, and a few snap caps with extra rubber inserts. It will also come with a 20 round box of Lehigh Defense Maximum Expansion rounds which are impossible to find and Very expensive. If you've never heard of them I urge you to look them up on YouTube.    The gun has never been dry fired and has been meticulously maintained. If you'rea gun guy you realize how expensive all of these extra modifications are. This gun is an absolute tack driver and is a pleasure to shoot. I'm only interested in trading for other CZ's. I have over $1,450 invested in this pistol. I'm asking $1,000 obo for it. I'm just looking to get into 9mm. I will trade up or down depending on what you have. I have picture taken yesterday of a 97b with the wooden grips and only 1 mag without a box or paperwork that sold on gunbroker.com for $690 so that kind of puts my price into perspective considering evert hinges that you're getting with this gun.  You can call or text anytime at REDACTED my email is not working so either call or text. I'll be more than happy to send more pics if you would like. Including the one of the pistol that sold yesterday. Thanks for looking and God bless."

These are popular for the match grade accuracy and the steel core penetrators within.  These are no longer imported and very sought after.

As for why I am parting with them...I sold my dragunov over a year ago and the purchaser wished to pick up the remaining ammunition at a later date.  Since he has been not heard of for over a year, they are back up for sale.

I will not open a case since the bands are intact but if you wish to open upon purchase for inspection I'm completely comfortable with that.  I will not split a case.  I would prefer not to ship.  Local sale only.  $700 a case firm (2 tins).  No discount for purchasing all 4 cases.  I can meet in the Bonney Lake/Buckley area.

For those who do not know what the 7N1 is, this is not your common 7.62x54r.  Here's a tin (1 tin, not a case) on gunbroker as an example.

Purchase will include Keltec KSG, Magpul Angled Foregrip, Sightmark Reflex sight(needs new batteries), and original box for keltec ksg.
The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

PRICE IS $850 only trades are something in 7MM or 300winmag bolt actions."

Will still use facrtory Saiga mags as well.  The Vepr 12 BHO lever allows the button to release the bolt on this Saiga juts like its supposed to as the factory Saiga BHO lever did not allow this function.

Key to this are: an all new elastomer extractor spring, new extractor material, dual ejectors, and a steel insert feed ramp. These components fundamentally change the way the conventional MSR functions. The result: the most consistent, efficient, and reliable Extraction and ejection pattern of any MSR.The biggest revolution to the GII might just be the smallest. Improved extractor & elastomer Extractor spring. Through countless hours of research, testing, and tens of thousands of fired rounds, DPMS has selected a new extractor material that is nearly impervious to breaking, and a patent pending elastomer extractor spring. We ran tens of thousands of rounds through during testing without fatigue, breakage, failure, and the new materials resisted temperatures from -60˚F to 650˚F+ as well as every gun cleaner, solvent, oil or degreaser we could get our hands on.Dual Ejectors The dual ejector system reduces the ejector spring fatigue. Through duplicity, the likelihood of a failed ejection is significantly reduced.Steel feed ramp. GII incorporates an inserted steel feed ramp, allowing a lighter, smaller barrel extension and receiver, while improving feeding of more ammunition types. Enlarged ejection port Lengthened port allows for better, more consistent ejection.Link to the new G2 Recon at deguns.netLink to the DPMS $50 Rebate"

Condition is excellent as shown in photos. I bought this from the original owner who fired less than 300 rounds total. The firearm has no significant scratches or blemishes. Obviously this has seen very little use. 

Included is the rifle and one 30 round Yugo BHO magazine. These have really increased and the two places I could find them in stock list them at $590-$599. 

Must show both an IN-DL and a LTCH. Otherwise buyer pays for a transfer through FFL.

FTF around Evansville, say within 45 minutes or so. 

I can add additional mags at $15 each and a case of ammo, 1,000 rounds, for $250."

Key to this are: an all new elastomer extractor spring, new extractor material, dual ejectors, and a steel insert feed ramp. These components fundamentally change the way the conventional MSR functions. The result: the most consistent, efficient, and reliable Extraction and ejection pattern of any MSR.The biggest revolution to the GII might just be the smallest. Improved extractor & elastomer Extractor spring. Through countless hours of research, testing, and tens of thousands of fired rounds, DPMS has selected a new extractor material that is nearly impervious to breaking, and a patent pending elastomer extractor spring. We ran tens of thousands of rounds through during testing without fatigue, breakage, failure, and the new materials resisted temperatures from -60˚F to 650˚F+ as well as every gun cleaner, solvent, oil or degreaser we could get our hands on.Dual Ejectors The dual ejector system reduces the ejector spring fatigue. Through duplicity, the likelihood of a failed ejection is significantly reduced.Steel feed ramp. GII incorporates an inserted steel feed ramp, allowing a lighter, smaller barrel extension and receiver, while improving feeding of more ammunition types. Enlarged ejection port Lengthened port allows for better, more consistent ejection.Link to the new G2 Recon at deguns.netLink to the DPMS $50 Rebate"

For sale is a brand new in box Saiga 12 shotgun IZ-433 Taktika imported by Legion.  I have made some upgrades to this gun as well.  I added a magwell, BHO lever, and mag release from a Vepr 12 shotgun.  This Saiga shotgun will now accept any Vepr 12 magazine without any modifications whatsoever.  Will still use facrtory Saiga mags as well.  The Vepr 12 BHO lever allows the button to release the bolt on this Saiga juts like its supposed to as the factory Saiga BHO lever did not allow this function.  This is a great gun and the most highly sought after version of the Saiga 12 in my opinion.  Comes with one 10 round SGM Vepr 12 mag, original box, and paperwork..... Price is $900"

Just for melting some dots in your frame with a soldering iron!? Well I don't believe in gouging people, so I figure Id offer to do your gun for anywhere from $50-$65 depending on what you want me to do (Writing initials/words, certain patterns, if you need me to do a grip reduction, how much of the frame you want covered, etc). I just did the frame of my Springfield XD 9 and I think it came out fairly well.

Only had 40 rounds threw it. Comes with box, rear peep sight, one mag and a lock. It has pink UBgrips on it(not painted or dipped!). I dont have the factory black grips. Trust me I dont need a lesson on the gun or the price or anything of the nature. No need for comments pertaining to Hi Points being bad, ugly or whatever. The fact of the matter is the gun functions flawlessly. As well as every other caliber of Hi Point we have owned. This is a good starter for someone who is recoil sensitive. Due to the size there is hardly any felt recoil at all. Asking for $150 and it comes with a box of critical defense jhp. They sell locally for $159.99 plus tax(so over $170 out the door) and $24 plus tax for the defensive rounds. Pickup is in West Lafayette. REDACTED text only!!!"

It's the crocodile color and medium size so it will fit most, it's also extremely adjustable and the waist belt can be removed and adjusted up or down. The top pouch is removable and the bottom houses the lowering line attachments and straps for STRLLS if you want to jump the bag static line or MFF.

The pics of the bag on the steps are the actual bag, the other pics are just to show detail from the manufacture.

Intended for long operations and extended patrols Arc'teryx LEAF designed the Echo backpack to be tough, durable and fully loaded for any mission parameter. Featuring a tubular main compartment with a top lid eliminates failure points and increases durability. In addition, it allows longer, awkward gear and weaponry to be carried easily and comfortably. Features include hydration pocket, MOLLE compatible PALS, one large pocket and multiple strap management systems for a clean pack free of loose webbing. This true 3-day pack is outfitted with a thermoformed hipbelt and V-frame suspension for comfortable and effective weight distribution, decreasing pressure points and muscle fatigue so your endurance won't depend on your gear. For HALO/HAHO operations, the Echo has a simple and clean attachment system for the lowering line that eliminates the need for an additional drop bag or harness. The line is connected directly into the packs with high-strength, climbing-harness grade webbing.

Only trades considered would be knives, benchmade, zero tolerance, or towards a CRK, Hinderer, or Strider and I would pay the difference."
