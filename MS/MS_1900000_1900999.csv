This rifle is pristine and 98%.  The 39A has been in continuous production longer than any other rifle in America and is often referred to as the cadillac of 22 rifles. This Is a beautiful pre Remington model which exhibits the original Marlin craftsmanship. The Marlin lever action’s swift pointing characteristics, lightning-fast follow-ups, reliability and inherent accuracy have made it America’s favorite. And what started with the invention of the first flat-top, side-eject receiver in 1889 has led Marlin to pioneer every major advancement in the lever-action category since. The Golden 39A is still considered one of the finest examples of a lever .22 rifle, and one of the most accurate .22 rifles ever produced. It is also the best-selling lever rimfire in U.S. history. The 39A and the AS are the same rifles, the AS designation the S was added in 1988 because Marlin added a hammer block safety and a rebounding hammer.

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel
(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

SMITH & WESSON 610-3 10mm REVOLVER

DESCRIPTION
Up for your consideration is a Smith & Wesson model 610-3. This Model 610 is a 10mm/.40 S&W caliber stainless steel round butt N frame 6 shot revolver with a 3 7/8"" barrel and fluted cylinder (barrel is actually 3 7/8"" - S&W manufactured this series to assure that it meet the under 4"" qualifications) for competitive shooters.

1/8"" pinned serrated black ramp front sight and adjustable rear sight. The gun shoots beautifully. The only reason I am parting with it is due to a very high end 1911 project that I need funds for. The trigger is sweet & smooth both in single action and double action. The timing is perfect. It has some handling marks but overall looks great. Comes with the original factory box, paperwork, lock, internal keys, 3 metal moon clips & 6 Rimz Plastic moon clips, etc. 

Has been stored lubed with Frog Lube & stored in humidity controlled safe. No New York or International sales.  It is your responsibility to know if this gun is legal in your area.  Please do not bid if it is not legal to own in your area.  Actual images of item for auction are listed. Manufactured with a stainless steel frame, the six-shot revolver features a satin stainless finish and Hogue rubber round to square conversion grips. 
*RARE NO LONGER MADE!*

The 4-inch model measures 9 ½ inches in overall length with a weight of 42.5 ounces. The Model 610 revolver uses full moon clips and can be used to shoot .40 S&W ammunition.

There are a few of these floating around, but not many. They made 210,000 Winchester model 77's in the 1950's and 60's, which is quite a few.. But only 10 percent of those were tube-fed...that's 21,000. This is one of those Tube-fed models. I saw one sell on GunBroker last week for $455.00.
This one is in very good condition...very good, and it functions perfect and has every modern feature. They stopped making the Model 77 in the 1960's.
It is grooved for mounting a scope. (same size groove that is on the Ruger 10/22 and all .22 rifles). It has fully adjustable iron sites also. The bolt is on the left side, which is one of the tell-tale model 77 characteristics. It functions flawless and looks great. It will shoot cheap bulk ammo as fast as you can pull the trigger without a hiccup. This is a collector's gun BUT, it is ready to be an everyday shooter also. It looks and feels better than a Ruger. It is a Winchester, back when they were the best. It's not overly heavy and it lacks nothing that a brand new .22 rifle has. You don't feel like your holding or looking at an old, outdated gun.. Model number is 160694  \\Trade ideas are below//"

This Radom has been a safe queen for the past six years. I never put a round through it. 

After retiring from the military I found a few guns that I really liked but I also found that I didn't want to shoot them. I'm selling one of my more pristine WWII weapons to fund other projects. I purchased this gun with the finish you see. 

The finish is beautiful with some wear marks near the front of the upper near the barrel, the front strap, the de-cocking lever and frame and a few other places you can see in the hi-res pics. I am going to assume that the finish, because of its sheer beauty is not original...only because I can't state 100% its authenticity. A man has gotta have his word or he has nothing. 

Here's where you are going to cry....when I originally stored it in my safe near the bottom where the golden rod is located I took off the original grips and put them away for safe keeping. I didn't want any deterioration of the finish where the grips come into contact with the frame. Well, the grips are nowhere to be found. After a week of tearing up every box of military accessories and stuff I'll never use...they are not to be offered with the sale. I apologize. Instead of purchasing another set of original grips and then selling it....I figured someone out there has a pristine set of original grips without a gun...this would be the perfect marriage. Marrying up!!!! 

I'm not a dealer so this is a face to face transaction, cash only.  

YOU MUST HAVE A VALID ALABAMA CCW AND DRIVER'S LICENSE OR THE TRANSACTION IS A NO-GO! 

I don't want trades- 

Contact me if you have any questions. I will only take ...cash! 

Drop me a line if you want any additional photos. I reserve the right to end this auction at anytime due to it being listed on other sites.

This is one of the smoothest semi-autos that you'll ever rack the slide on....That's another reason I liked it when I purchased it....felt like a Hi-Power and acted like a 1911.

Will trade for guns, let me know what you have.  I am a valid WI CCW holder.  

The AVR-4306 delivers high-impact home theater with lots of audiophile extras. With 130 high-current watts per channel and advanced surround processing, you'll enjoy rich, enveloping multichannel sound from all of your movies, music, TV shows, and video games. Denon's heavy-duty construction includes an anti-resonant chassis and massive power supply for rock-solid performance at all times. And this sophisticated receiver is packed with cutting-edge technologies that greatly expand your home entertainment horizons.

For starters, the AVR-4306 includes a new auto setup and room calibration system called ""MultEQ XT,"" developed by Audyssey Laboratories. All you need to do is place the included microphone in each seat in your home theater — up to eight seats total — and the '4306 takes care of the rest, fine-tuning the level, delay setting, and EQ for each speaker in your system. Thanks to MultEQ XT, precise response isn't limited to a single ""sweet spot,"" but is available across a wide listening area, so everyone in the room can enjoy perfect home theater sound.

Advanced digital video switching lets you hook up three high-resolution video components via HDMI connections for the best possible picture quality (HDMI is a digital output available on many HDTV tuners and high-end DVD players). And analog-to-HDMI video conversion allows you to send all of your video sources to an HDMI-capable TV using only a single digital cable. This greatly streamlines video switching and preserves maximum picture quality for every source in your system.

The '4306 also offers digital video upconversion, a feature that goes a step beyond analog-to-HDMI conversion. It can upgrade any non-HD video source to an HDMI digital signal with your choice of 720p or 1080i resolution, to more closely match the capabilities of your HDTV. This gives your DVDs and older video sources an exceptionally crisp, vivid look."

I am in a pretty rough spot financially right now due to a recent lay off and a pretty expensive separation , so I need to raise some cash asap. Some of the stuff is automobile related, some of it isnt.

See below:

Brand New Campbell Hausfield 85 Gallon 2 Stage Air Compressor
I have used it less than a dozen times, it was $1499 new.I t will run ANYTHING. I work in the automotive field and have access to air anytime I want, so it doesnt get any use.
It has the air/water divider, pressure regulator, 100ft of hose, a new hose and reel set, etc.
Sell for $1000 complete with all hoses, regulator, reels, filters, etc.

Mac Tools Tool Box/Cart
I bought this when I bought the compressor, and along with the compressor, it has seen little to no use. It has 3 drawers and a stainless work bench top that opens side to side, and the left side lifts up for storage of small parts and tools. It is Vitamin C Orange.

Tools in the box: I have a large assortment of impact sockets, regular sockets in all drives, 1/2 gun, 3/8 gun, grinders, ratchet wrenches (Gear Wrench Brand), Mac and Cornwell Screwdrivers, star and hex drivers, P/S pulley tools, etc.
The box was $750 new and I figure I got about $1500 in tools in the box, so I'd let this go for around $1500 complete. Box only would be $500, but I dont want to split them up.

Inside the man cave:
Reloading Stuff:
Now I spent some serious money on this package, and I just bought it less than 6 months ago. See below:

RCBS Rock Chucker Supreme Press
RCBS Power Case Trimmer
RCBS Chargemaster Digital Scale and Dispenser (AWESOME)
ALL RCBS EXTRAS
RCBS .308 Die set 
RCBS .223 Die set
Funnels, O-rings, all the little extras that doesnt come with the kit
Bullet Remover Hammer With full collet set
Reloading Manual (Can get on internet too)
Lots of powder: I have H380, Reloader 17, IMR4895, IMRXBR8208, etc.
CCI Large Rifle Primers
Hornady .308 Bullets (and some Sierra Match Kings, Barnes, etc.
LOTS of once fired Fed GMM Brass .308
9mm Brass
40 Brass
45 ACP brass
10mm Brass
35 Rem Brass
300 Win Mag Brass (Not much)
Cabelas Media Case Tumbler
Extra Media
................................and more. This is by far the best reloading setup I have ever used, and I have seen a lot of them. The digital chargemaster scale and dispenser makes measuring and loading so easy it makes you shoot more because reloading isn't as tedious!!

All said and done I would say I have near $2500in this setup, I would let it all go for 18-1900. 

NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT CALL ME AND ASK ME TO SPLIT THIS UP. IF IT DOESNT SELL, I WILL KEEP IT, BUT IF I PART IT OUT, I CANT EVEN USE IT MYSELF. THESE ITEMS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND NOW AND MOST ARE ON BACKORDER. IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN BUYING THE COMPLETE SETUP,  PLEASE DO NOT ASK ME TO SPLIT. 50 DOLLARS HERE AND 50 DOLLARS THERE GETS ME NOWHERE. THANKS!

Sony Bravia 60"" 3D HDTV
Well, what can I say. It's a Bravia. I just bought this 3 months ago. Like new, no flaws, was almost $2200 new, I'd cut it loose for $1500 dollars.

That's a total of roughly $6000 dollars in household and automotive items. All of it is in mint like new condition.

TRADES: 2005-2008 GSXR-1000 ONLY. DO NOT offer me any of your 1980'Japanese street standards or anything else besides a LITER CLASS SPORTBIKE. CBR1000, R1, ZX10, are all ok, but I prefer a GSXR as I have owned 2 and I really liked them. Earlier GSXR are not out, but I really like the newer style better.

My goal here is to either raise enough money to buy another mode of transportation, or trade for another mode of transportation.

The only other thing besides a motorcycle that I would trade for is cash, obviously, or a really nice Jeep Cherokee Sport or Wrangler. MUST be 5speed 4.0L and if it has rotted rockers or door hinges keep on looking.

Motorcycles: ZERO SALVAGE TITLES. DONT CARE. DONT WANNA HEAR IT.

CASH is GOOD TOO

This is the M48 with all milled parts. The rifle was a hand pick from an unfired bunch (excluding factory testing of course) and was de-cosmolined by me. The rifle has a total of 25 rounds through it all match or sniper ammo.

There have been a number of questions about the work that was done to the rifle so I will explain it in more detail

The rifle was brand new, unfired, handpicked.

The Zrak mounts are genuine from the factory 

To mount them properly is not simply a matter of drilling holes, the rear base needs to be milled to tailor it to the contour of the receiver where it curves upward to become the stripper clip guide. It is cheaper and easier to simply grind off that portion of the receiver for the mount, but it does not look nearly as nice. 

Next the bolt was turned down and the stock relieved so that the bolt locks down and fits flush. The finish was then matched so that there is no major irregularity in color 

Sure one could save money cutting corners, but this was not just a thrown together hack job. This was a professionally done rifle. 

The wood on the rifle is excellent with only minor surface dings. It is the prettier dark grain. 

The finish on the metal is near perfect as seen in the photos. The only blemish is that the buttplate could stand to be polished. 

The bore and internals are mint. The rifle was thoroughly cleaned after each session. The barrel itself is bright and shiny a la new rifle. The lines from when the bore was cut are still present.

Overall this is an excellent example of a firearm with all the professional work done to it. It was not a nice used gun, it was bought brand new out of the box. I am only selling because I have decided to move into the German Mauser Realm.

This is a real kevlar ballistic helmet, not some fake air soft toy.  Most pistol bullets, and glancing rifle rounds in some cases will not penetrate it.  Think of it as in a nutshell level IIIa protection.  This was military issue for a long time until recently.  (This exact helmet has been worn in the war on terror)  The new helmets issued simply have the lip on the front of the helmet removed, there is a hole drilled for mounting night vision, and there are pads inside the helmet rather than a suspension system like this older PASGT.    When the zombies start weilding 9's, .40's, .45's, .38's, .357's, .380's and frag grenades,this will do a great job of guarding your noggin.  For 50 bucks, you can have a bullet resistant brain!  Take that, zombie Rambo!

Disclaimer: please don't shoot yourself in the head to try this helmet out, unless you are hopelessly liberal, or are a staunch believer in Darwainism.  For real though...  Don't do it.  Even though it may stop the round,  it won't stop the energy transfer.  You might as well smack yourself in the forehead with a mallet.  Ps: don't do that either."

I don't want to let any of these firearms go, but I have to. I will consider cheaper prices for multiple gun purchases only. Thanks.

Don't no a round count assuming its up there as it is a police trade in.
The pistol has a lot of holster wear also and some marks on the frame. 

The slide has engravings that says OPPD (overland park police department) and a shield that says Overland Park police officer state of Kansas. The gun has night sights not new but still glow.

In .40 S&W Caliber Shooting Industry Masters Auction Benefiting First Shots More than 350 industry representatives, ranging from top administrators and factory personnel to professional shooters, will compete in the 2013 Shooting Industry Masters shooting competition July 19-20 at the Cody Shooting Complex near Cody, Wyoming. A major component of the shoot will be fundraising events to benefit the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) First Shots program, which introduces thousands of new shooters to the shooting sports each year. The Robar Companies have been customizing and finishing firearms for decades, and have developed a world-wide reputation for craftsmanship, customer service and aerospace-grade metal finishes. Robar uses their same high-tech plating process used on space vehicles and demanding industry applications, to create custom finishes on firearms that can withstand any extreme you could ever encounter. 
NP3+ (applied to the metal parts of this custom gun) has five times the ability to withstand corrosion as the original NP3, and up to ten times more resistance than regular nickel. 
Benefits of NP3+ are: EXTREMELY CORROSION RESISTANT: A 1mil (.001) thick coating of can withstand a salt spray corrosion test of 1,000+ hours per ASTM B-117 SELF-LUBRICATING: PTFE is deposited throughout the coating so for most firearms no additional lubrication is needed after initial break-in. ACCURATE PLATING THICKNESS: Coating thickness can be predetermined for nominal tolerance to suit your weapon system. VERY ABRASION RESISTANT: NP3 Plus is a very hard, abrasion-resistant coating with an as-plated hardness of Rc 35-50. In certain applications it can be heat treated to Rc 68-70 EASY TO CLEAN: NP3 Plus is easy to clean; in most cases wiping with a rag will suffice (We do NOT plate the inside of barrels; these need to be cleaned conventionally). LONGER FIRING PERIODS: NP3 Plus allows for longer firing 
cycles as the dry, self-lubricating PTFE-rich surface makes it harder for powder residue and debris to adhere to surfaces PLATES TO MOST GUN ALLOYS: NP3 Plus can be plated to almost all alloys used in the firearms industry. This includes steel, aluminum and stainless steel. SERVICE LIFE IS EXTENDED: NP3 Plus has a high lubricity and low coefficient of friction; therefore, the life expectancy of a firearm will be greatly increased due to less frictional wear. NO COROSSION MIGRATION: In cases where the coating is damaged and perforated, the corrosion shows no tendency to spread or migrate under the coating. EASY TO REPLATE: NP3 Plus is chemically strippable and can be re-plated without any damage to the substrate. Weapons subject to heavy use can be refurbished to as-new condition. SAVES MONEY: Taking all the attributes of into account, it is easy to see that service life, hours in service, low maintenance and ease of cleaning combine to make this a money saving addition to any firearm. Robar gunsmiths crafted a custom trigger job on this pistol, then carefully test-fired it for functionality and reliability. The final result is a hard-knocks semi-auto right at home in a duty holster, as a personal defense pistol or an “ultimate” personal handgun for any situation. The subtle two-tone look of the black polymer and subdued silver-grey of the NP3+ yields an over-all look of competency and authority. An added value 
is the fact Robar coated all three supplied magazines in NP3! Ths S&W M&P 40 has been specifically customized for this special auction benefiting the NSSF First Shots program, and is an opportunity to both own an uncompromising defensive semi-auto — and to help keep our shooting sports growing! GunBroker.com clients can participate in the excitement of the Masters, and substantially support the NSSF’s First Shot’s Program by bidding on this very capable .40 S&W auto!
