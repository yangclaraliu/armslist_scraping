This rifle was imported by C.J.A. SFLD, MN.  It is in pristine condition and is considered one of the best and most sought after AK's.  You'll be hard pressed to find a nicer one.  It has a 1.5mm thick receiver vs. 1.0mm receiver on most stamped AK rifles and comes with a chrome lined barrel.  Unlike your standard MAK 90's, this one comes with a spring loaded firing pin, a much more pronounced feed ramp and a heavy duty recoil assembly with a thick steel rod vs two slim wire rods that are interconnected at the middle of the assembly.  I've been told that with the spring loaded firing pin etc, that it ""probably"" started as a Poly Tech but was ""neutered"" when it reached the US, but I can't confirm that so I am selling it as an exceptionally nice Chinese Mak 90.  It will also include the original sling, (1) 30 round metal magazine, (1) 30 round Tapco magazine and (1) 40 round metal magazine.  You won't be disappointed!

This gun is in very good plus condition with just a few minor handling marks. You can use your imagination as to what the CYA means, but it actually came from the California Youth Authority where it was carried by case workers. These guns were not shot much except for annual qualification. They are very accurate and the action is typical S&W tight and smooth. This gun will make a nice addition to any S&W or LE collection or can be used as a concealed carry or house gun. Comes with original factory PC magna grips that are also in very good condition showing only very minor wear. Sorry, no box or papers."

It has all of the functionally of a normal Ak47: semi-auto fire power, the ability to accept standard detachable ak mags, an accurate 20"" barrel AND a milled receiver. However the cool thing about this model is that it has the firepower of an AK47 without the look of one to your average person. With a small 5 round ak mag this rifle is hard to distinguish from a standard deer rifle. This makes this a great shtf/civil unrest rifle for those that are looking to blend in but also have AK firepower at their disposal, with the ability to swap in a 30 or 90 round mag in quickly. I am the second owner of this rifle, the first owner purchased in the early 90's and stuck it inside the closet. I have shot it very little, with that being said it is 20+ years old so it does have blemishes but functions flawlessly, with all matching numbers. With the milled receiver and 20"" barrel it is very accurate and I know you with enjoy shooting it. Oh and cash only, no trades, thanks"

I took it to a Gunsmith when I bought it...he said ""as good as a new one"".... it has a straight stock....no round knob.. There was about 2.5 million + of these Guns made...Most that are for sale are much later guns.  1st year production and before #500 commands a premium. Browning told me that it is definitely 1st year production, which adds 100% to ""book"", but I realize book does not matter .There weren't many records up thru 1939...and by then there were 10's of thousands made.....John Moses Browning was alive and most likely in Belgium when XXX was made.....Pure History....One of the first semi-automatic shotguns ever made.......firearm history is about Browning.....He passed away in 1926 at the workbench....in the shop where this shotgun was made.

Remington 700 AAC-SD chambered in .308 with the 20"" threaded barrel. The factory barreled action was purchased from Red Hawk Rifles in grand Junction. They lapped the bolt lugs, polished the feed ramp, and ""tuned"" the factory trigger. They also installed the Badger Ordinance oversized bolt knob.

The stock is an XLR Industries Element chassis with a custom rattle can finish. If you don't like the paint job a little paint thinner and some elbow grease will take it right off. 

The Badger Ordinance 20MOA scope base was bedded with a thin coat of JB Weld. It is not stuck or glued to the receiver and can be removed just like any other scope base. 

I also installed a Silencerco Trifecta muzzle brake. The brake is timed with shims and secured with Rockset. If you have a Silencerco Spec-War suppressor it will thread right on.

You will need a scope and rings and a bipod of your choice. 

Here is what I have invested in the rifle as it sits.

Remington 700 AAC-SD action in XLR Element chassis $1,395
Badger Ordinance oversized bolt knob installed $85
Ten round magazine $75

Offered for your consideration is a very nice, complete, Mossberg Model 144, .22 caliber rifle. It is chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. This model was the first of the 144 series of rifles to be produced by O.F. Mossberg & Sons and was manufactured from 1949 until 1954. The examples, such as this one, which features the “T” bolt handle were only manufactured during the first year of production in 1949. The 144LS, 144LSA, 144LSB, and the 144US were the models which followed when the production of the 144 ended.

This is a Small concealed Carry Pistol, chambered in .380 (smallest round the FBI will use for use of extreme force, so it'll get the job done!).

External safety only, works exactly like a 1911 (its a mini 1911 in its design), so simple and easy to use, easy to disengage safety, and no bite upon firing (due to .380 round) so very easy to train with and get used to pulling.  Has about 500-600 rounds through it.

It comes with 3 Sig Sauer magazines (6 round, 7 round maximum with a round in the chamber), original case, original lock and keys (unused), paperwork included in box.

Also included is a Nate Squared Tactical Professional Inside-Wasteband Holster.  This is easily the best holster I could find on the market (not just for this gun but any carry pistol).  It requires a very slight twist of the wrist upon gripping it to dis-engage itself from the holster (very very easy to get and to train for, even for those with a bigger statue as I am).  With this ability, it allows for all sorts of activity and use through-out the day, and never once has the firearm came close to moving in the holster (shoot, I did handstands and cartwheels to see if I could get it out, didn't notice).  Holster is made of polycarbonate for the firearm, and the rear on the body material is suede, which is incredibly soft and I forget I have the holster on after about 5 minutes of getting ready in the morning.

Also comes with 100 rounds of .380 FMJ.

Asking $550 O.B.O.

Included is a Laser Products tactical light fore end and Mesa Tactical 4 shot butt stock shell holder. This is a police trade in gun, which normally means it was carried often and shot little. 

The receiver is stamped HK, however the bolt and barrel are stamped Benelli. I don't believe this is the barrel that was originally on it. There is no rear sight and it looks as if the front sight was removed to allow it to shoot point of aim, which it does. All the sight parts are available as Brownell's and Midwest Gun Works. The receiver will need to be tapped. The fore end light does not have a bulb or batteries in it, so it has not been tested. It appears to have everything else to work. The last time I bought an LED bulb for one of these fore ends it was less than $30.00 on Amazon. 

I put about 30 rounds through it without failure, as should be expected from a Benelli shotgun.

720,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4240720,For Sale:  ** SOLD ** British No.2 Mk.I* Enfield Revolver  (“Tankers Model”) / C&R OK,"South East Virginia, Virginia, United States",$ 325,"Listed On: Sunday, April 19, 2015",Handguns,no type,38 S&W                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"NOTE: Make sure that this firearm is legal to own in your state and/or locality BEFORE PURCHASING !! 

This item must be sent to a FFL or C&R Licensee

We ship firearms to the Republic of California !!

Offered for your consideration is a British No.2 Mk.I* Enfield revolver, (“Tankers Model”), chambered for the British .38/200, (.38 S&W), cartridge. It is in very nice condition and features matching numbers and a mirror bright bore with crisp lands & grooves. The lanyard loop is present; however, it is installed upside down within the grip frame. This can be seen in the pictures. Why this was done, or who did this, is anyone’s guess. 

The No.2 Mk.I revolver was developed at the Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield in 1926 - 1927. The design is based on scaled down Webley Mark 6 ""break-top"" frame, with cylinder chambered for 6 .38/200 caliber rounds. 

The Enfield No.2 Mark 1* was developed in the late 1930s for British Tank Corps, and is distinguished from early Mark 1 by spurless, Double Action Only hammers, lighter mainsprings, and re-shaped grip side plates. The spurless DAO hammers were required by Tank Corps command to avoid snagging the hammers on tank internals. Thus the term “Tankers Model” came to be used to differentiate this model from the No.2 Mk.I. 

The Enfield No.2 Mark 1** appeared in the 1942 as a simplified, wartime design. These guns were similar to No.2 Mark 1*, but without the hammer stop. After 1945, all those revolvers were recalled and converted into No.2 Mark 1* configuration. 

One interesting fact about this particular No.2 Mk I* is that it is one of a limited number which have the short lived second variation of the Mk.II stock pattern and bears the dubious honor of being the last of the finely finished wooden patterns. This was most likely in an attempt to utilize the existing stores of the Mk. I stock nut. Royal Small Arms Factory, (RSAF), Enfield temporarily switched away from the brass marking disc standardized on the Mk. II stock in 1941-1942. There were only a few thousand of this pattern grip stocks were produced as this particular style of stock is quite uncommon.

****LOWER PRICE**** Offered for your consideration is a Mossberg 200K Slide Action 12 Gauge Shotgun that is in very nice condition. Manufactured from 1956 until 1959 this was the forerunner to the now extremely popular Mossberg 500 Pump Action Shotgun. During its’ brief production life span there were a fairly limited number of this model produced. Because of this, examples of this model are becoming more and more difficult to find in good and useable condition. With this being said, this particular example is in overall outstanding condition. 

It features a twenty-eight inch barrel with a 2 ¾ inch chamber, a factory installed adjustable C-Lect-Choke and is also factory side ported. It also features a two round detachable box magazine, walnut stock, and a black nylon slide. 

There are a few minor handling marks on the stock and metal. A very small chip of wood is missing where the action joins the stock. This can be clearly seen in the pictures. The stock has no cracks or splits and is very solid. I would conservatively rate the original finish on the stock and metal surfaces as being around 90%, or a bit higher. 

The red and green safety pegs will be replaced before being shipped to the winning bidder of this auction. This 200K will make a very nice addition to a collection of the early Mossberg shotguns as well as one that would be a pleasure to use in the field.

Additional Pictures upon request.

772,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4240772,For Sale:  Ms. Clean Kit,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 39,"Listed On: Saturday, December 12, 2015",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"COPS Gun Shop is happy to announce we are now dealers for the Ms. Clean kits.  Ms. (Magazine Shaped) Cleaning Kit.  This is some cool stuff.  One MS Clean kit containing sectioned steel rods, T-handle, steel patch eyelet, military to civilian thread adapter, all purpose double ended brush, 5.56/.223 chamber brush, 5.56/.223 bore brush, 7.62/.30 bore brush, 9mm bore brush, dental pick, patches, and 5ml Slip2000. Available in Black and Flat Dark Earth.      FAQsWhat is the advantage of the Ms. Clean over existing kits?  Soft pouches can be crushed in the field, so we designed a case that resistant to impacts and crushing forces in order to protect lubricants and tools. The standard A2 fixed stock where the M-16's cleaning kit was stored has been replaced by collapsible stocks with no storage. We designed our case so that it can be stored in readily available pouches. It is necessary to have a set of steel cleaning rods that are strong enough to remove stuck cases and barrel obstructions that a pull through cable or snake cannot remove. The Ms. Clean can be easily removed from gear to be used for field maintenance. Small rifle parts can be place in case during disassembly to prevent their loss.  Why is it in the shape of a magazine?We wanted it to fit into readily accessible pouches that are prevalent and not proprietary. Will it fit into the magazine well?No. When are you going to make one for the AK-47 and friends?Probably never.  The AK has a clever cleaning kit hidden on it plus you don’t really need to clean it.  Why do you use steel rods? What if I scratch my barrel?Steel rods are the strongest available and are strong enough to remove squib rounds or other barrel obstructions. Most AR barrels are chrome lined and are resistant to damage from steel rods.  What is the best way to keep posted on updates?You can check our Facebook page our Youtube or Instagram. What happens if I am in the dark and I go to change my magazine and try to put my cleaning kit in my rifle and get myself killed?You won’t. You are a professional soldier or law enforcement officer, you have undergone months, if not years of training and you would never be so daft as to put your cleaning kit among your actual magazines. You would put it in somewhere else on your gear that wasn't on the front of your vest. Even if you tried, your smarter leaders will stop you and hopefully punish your stupidity. If you are a civilian and plan on defending your home with an AR style rifle, the chances you will need more than 30 rounds or be wearing your chest rig when you are awaken from your slumber by burglars is slim. Even still, if you do manage to find yourself frantically inserting a MS Clean into your rifle you may want to consider that we purposely engineered a level of natural selection into our product."

Product Description
The LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly, is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle. 

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group, a Magpul MIAD pistol grip, and the new Magpul ACS stock. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots. 

The SPR comes with LWRCI’s new Skirmish Sights. These sights can be raised using gross motor skills and without pressing any button. The sights lock in the up position and are lowered by pressing a button on their left sides. The sights are extremely low profile and stand less than ½” tall when folded. All of the sharp edges have been smoothly radiused, nearly eliminating the possibility of snagging the folded sights or cutting the shooters hands when being deployed. The sights are constructed of 7075 aluminum, which is Type 3 hardcoat anodized, and 4140 steel, that is treated with our NiCorr surface conversion technology. 7075 aluminum is much harder and stronger than the 6000 series aluminum used in our competitor’s sights. The bearings and detents are all industrial hard chromed. The sights are nearly impervious to corrosion. As an added benefit, all of the surfaces on the rear of the sights post and its protective wings are grooved at either 20 or 40 lines per inch to eliminate glare.
This is one of the best AR15 platform rifles on the market today. Very few rounds ever fired though this mint condition rifle. If your looking for a superior Sub MOA AR then look no further. Serious inquiries only. Thanks for looking."

This is a 1992 Jeep Wrangler 2.5 4 cylinder 5 speed manual trans. It runs great and I just drove it to Nashville, TN and back.

It has 162000+ miles on the odometer. The motor has 70,000 miles on it and came out of a 1996 Cherokee. I rebuilt the transmission a year and a half ago, it has about 1500 miles on it and shifts like new. Has complete new brakes on the rear including steel lines and wheel cylinders.

Has a 3"" body lift, Goodyear Wrangler 9.50X30-15 tires with great tread, hard top, hard doors, center console, nerf bars/side steps, new drivers seat.

Now, the CJ7 part:
I started to make it ""The Retro Wrangler"" and make it look like a CJ. The best of both to me - CJ looks, YJ on the fly 4X4 and good MPG. It has a CJ7 hard top, fold down tailgate, swing away tire carrier and front clip. It needs a few more things done and a little body work and paint to finish. If you like it great, if not, you'll have to find another Jeep or change it back. I don't have any of the original body parts, I sold them to fund the CJ parts.

Runs and drives great right now. Has current tag, insurance and clean title in my name.

Believe it or not, I got 24 MPG on a trip to Athens last month.

The Chiappa Model 911 is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The original M1911 was a single-action, semiautomaticpistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun.
