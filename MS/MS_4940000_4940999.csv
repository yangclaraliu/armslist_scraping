It is a 16"" carbine with gray Magpul furniture, including an MOE+ pistol grip, MLOK handguard with vertical grip, MOE buttstock, Magpul ambi sling mount, Magpul enhanced trigger guard, and MBUS rear flip up sight. The rifle has a nickel boron coated bolt carrier group (photo below) and includes the mounted Streamlight TLR-1 HPL weapon light, Vortex Strikefire 2 red/green dot optic, and a 200mw green laser, which is much more powerful than any laser you will find locally. It can easily be seen at 200 yards in broad daylight. The rifle also has the BCM Gunfighter charging handle. I will include a Pmag. I think my asking price is fair. I have a ton of money in this gun. The MSRP on this gun without the nickel boron BCG and other extras is $1,300 (https://www.bushmaster.com/firearms/MOE_series.asp). Now, obviously you can find them cheaper. They run right around $1,000 online, but I am including at least $800 in extras. Just to give you an idea of the value here, I will break down the money I have in the gun:

Vortex Strikefire 2 - $180
TLR-1 Streamlight - $120
BCM Gunfighter charging handle - $50
Nickel boron BCG - $200
200mw green laser - $100
Magpul furniture - $150

So as you can see, I'm losing money here. The gun has maybe 200 rounds through it. It is sighted in at about 100 yards. The laser, red dot, and iron sights all co-witness. The gun is in perfect condition. It has mostly just sat in my closet. I would do $1,000 for the gun without the optic, light, laser, and Pmag.

It is a 16"" carbine with gray Magpul furniture, including an MOE+ pistol grip, MLOK handguard with vertical grip, MOE buttstock, Magpul ambi sling mount, Magpul enhanced trigger guard, and MBUS rear flip up sight. The rifle has a nickel boron coated bolt carrier group (photo below) and includes the mounted Streamlight TLR-1 HPL weapon light, Vortex Strikefire 2 red/green dot optic, and a 200mw green laser, which is much more powerful than any laser you will find locally. It can easily be seen at 200 yards in broad daylight. The rifle also has the BCM Gunfighter charging handle. I will include a Pmag. I think my asking price is fair. I have a ton of money in this gun. The MSRP on this gun without the nickel boron BCG and other extras is $1,300 (https://www.bushmaster.com/firearms/MOE_series.asp). Now, obviously you can find them cheaper. I believe they run around $900, but I am including at least $800 in extras. Just to give you an idea of the value here, I will break down the money I have in the gun:

Vortex Strikefire 2 - $180
TLR-1 Streamlight - $120
BCM Gunfighter charging handle - $50
Nickel boron BCG - $200
200mw green laser - $100
Magpul furniture - $150

I bought all these from the same shop about 7 years ago. They have lived in an ammo can ever since with silica packs present, this is what's left. Shot a bunch of this with 0 failures. Boxes are bunched up and rough due to stuffing them into ammo cans but these are not collectors items and you cant shoot the box unless its down range, in which case who cares what it looks like. No low ballers please, I know how much this goes for when its available.
