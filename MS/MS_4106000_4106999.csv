The gun is in excellent condition. I don’t have an exact round count, the estimate is under 150 total. Standard Glock fixed sights. The gun runs great, but I’m funding a build project and would like to gather some cash. This one isn’t getting used, so it can go.

For full disclosure, note that the serial numbers on the slide and lower do not match. This was a simple ‘build’ version. I bought a complete barreled upper originally to go on top of a Gen3 G20sf so I could swap calibers. But someone really wanted that G20sf of mine, but not the slide, they bought the G20sf but not the G21 barreled upper. So, I bought a new G21sf lower to mate to it to make a complete pistol. Then I bought a complete G21sf hard case with all the goodies. It’s a complete pistol again. 

What you get:
•	(1) Gen 3 Glock 21sf with fixed Glock sights
•	(4) Glock 13-round Magazines
•	(1) Glock hard-side case with cleaning kit, loader
•	(1) Retention Paddle Holster

Cash price is dropped to $425 for this weekend only!

Very small and discreet import mark by CAI on the right side of the barrel. More is super super nice, sharp, and bright. I bought it unfired and unissued condition. The seller had refinished/ varnished the stock however he did a great job with it. Other than that is is untouch and I fired about 100rds thru it. Asking $430.

Here is a nice 45 year old Winchester model 100 .308 Semi Auto Rifle that I believe was made in 1970. This rifle has a 22"" barrel with a clean bright bore and strong rifling. This rifle shoots and ejects as it should as I fired 5 rounds thru it with no issues. The gun has a great set of open sights and a set of 1"" SEE THRU Scope Rings. There is a detachable magazine that holds 4 rounds. The gun was used to hunt here in Vermont so it has some wear from use. The gun is used but not abused and it will be a great hunting gun for many more years to come!!! High Bidder gets the gun!!! See the pictures as they are part of this auction's description."

Description: New Colt AR6720 (AR-15) 5.56mm/.223rem semi-auto rifle!

Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor.

The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twist gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability.

The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones.

The AR6720 is a hybrid of Colt’s Government Carbine model AR6520 and Colt’s Flagship M4 Carbine model LE6920. This Lightweight Law Enforcement Carbine has a roll mark of AR-15A4- recognizing Colt’s newest designation of an ORC (optics ready carbine).

The pistol is a 1986-era Mark I .44 magnum model with the original cardboard box, magazine, and little tools that were included in the box. Mag is marked 2-86. Also included are three more mags, two of them are factory IMI(one marked 7-95 and one marked 7-08), and one is a ProMag clone. I have 20 rounds of MagTech 240gr. JSP and 24rds of PMC 240gr. TCSP left after the range session last weekend, and both brands run reliably in the D.E..

The gun is in great mechanical condition but has some typical finish wear on it for an almost 30-year old gun. There is no rust but the edges, front of the grip, and high spots are thin, and the finish has that slight purplish-tone that they all get after a few years. The bore is a mirror and the internals are clean and show little wear.  It's a reliable blaster and a lot of fun to shoot. The three factory mags are 100% reliable, the ProMag isn't if loaded with more than five rounds, so consider it a 'gimme'."

From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness P offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull.

I see on here someone selling Carl Gustaf ammo that's steel core...(big freakin deal)  for $750 for 1000 rnds.  Well before you buy from him let me know and I will order it for $600 (plus shipping) off of AMMUNITIONSTORE.COM where it is currently in stock and put a retarded mark up on it then sell it to you.   Sounds stupid huh?  Come on people.  Please research this stuff before you buy from these idiots that are trying to get rich off of ammo.  I guarantee that If these ammo price gougers where in a debate against banning this steel core ammo that's all the sudden a frenzy, they would argue that there is nothing special about it and its stupid to ban it,  which would be correct.  Yet,  They wanna act like its special on here to make a few dollars off someone and prey on there fears.  If people keep ripping themselves and others off on this stuff well then no wonder the gun grabbers think they have us by the balls.  This steel core 223 is a joke.  ANY lead core .308 or better yet, 7.62x54 (mosin nagant ammo) will go through twice the stuff that it will!   Wanna pay out the nose for that?  I have some to sell!  I'm sorry to rant but Jesus Christ.  This is ridiculous!  It's making it hard on all of us and making a mockery of our stand on the second amendment! When these gun grabbing nuts wanna ban something, instead of trying to hit one another over the head....try this.  ""Go ahead and try"" then follow necessary steps with your congressman to let them know that you WILL NOT tolerate it and refuse to pay these numb nuts twice what they paid for it.  I promise you that the price and availability will go back to where it should be.  I'm not trying to be rude but enough is enough.   Thanks       Jeremy"

    This is a very nice overall condition (90-95%), Dan Wesson, Model 15, .357 Magnum, revolver. All mechanicals are 100% and it has obviously had very little in the way of rounds fired through it. Lock up and overall tightness are as-new. It is pretty much a brand new gun, the cylinder is barely marked from spin wear and it has an incredible (miles deep) darkly blued finish that is almost perfect in every way. The only flaw on the whole gun is a scratch on the left hand side of the frame which is visible to the naked eye. I tried to photograph this but had little luck. It is otherwise perfect in every way and would make a fine addition to anyone's collection. It is a VERY accurate handgun and I would dare say has the best single action trigger that I have fired. It is beyond my capabilities and I am just not a big wheel gun guy. It needs a good home.

A high-efficiency LED generates 170 lumens of brilliant white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with good reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The LED has no filament to burn out or break and generates tactical-level light—enough to overwhelm an aggressor's night-adapted vision—for 2.4 hours per set of batteries. The 5-milliwatt, 635 nanometer laser sight, located below the primary light, is nearly twice as bright and much more visible than the nearest competitor. The laser's adjustment mechanism uses Nylok® screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. The white light/laser combination makes the X400 effective in close- to medium-range engagements, ideal for law enforcement, military, and self-defense use. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof.

It is characterized by its distinctive design and outstanding performance ratio. But Duralyt offers more: uncompromising ruggedness and accuracy in optics and mechanics - the essentials for successful aiming and safe shooting. The sleek and compact Duralyt 2-8x42 provides bright images in twilight and allows for accurate shooting even over distances exceeding 200 m. It is as short as the Duralyt 1.2-5x36 and offers the optimum medium magnification range. This is why the Duralyt 2-8x42 is preferred by experienced hunters when hunting in difficult terrain. The extremely fine, daylight-capable illuminated dot of the reticle 60 can be activated when needed and impresses with its high light intensity. It can be continuously dimmed, making it ideal for any hunting situation. Its positioning in the second image plane ensures minimal subtension - only 0.8 cm at 100 m with 12x magnification. The progressive design of the Duralyt features a unique dark gray, anodized surface with deep black rubber operating elements to ensure that the scope blends well into natural surroundings. The Conquest Duralyt scopes are also nitrogen filled to remain water and fog proof for years of hard use and enjoyment. The distinctive design, durability and outstanding value of the Conquest Duralyt 2-8x42 Riflescope sets it apart in the premium segment. The model features the mechanical precision that you expect from Zeiss, large fields of view and image quality that is absolutely outstanding for this class.Free Shipping"

The TaylorMade RocketBladez, or R Blades, iron set takes the concept of the RBZ Speed pocket from the fairways and hybrids and incorporates it into irons (3-7 irons). This RBZ Speed Pocket combined with an ultra-thin face and new inverted cone design promotes consistently higher ball speed and peak trajectory, especially on mis-hits low on the face. It also produces a steep, soft-landing, quick-stopping approach angle and reduces dispersion to promote increased accuracy. The result is higher, longer, straighter and quicker-stopping shots. That's RocketBladez.

Clubs in Very Good Condition have been played with and cared for in an appropriate fashion. The markings that you will likely find on Very Good Condition products will show typical wear of models of its age. All of the wear is purely cosmetic, and will not in any way affect the performance of the club. Among the wear that you may see on clubs in Very Good Condition: NOTE: Some irons are designed to rust over time. This is not considered adverse wear. Normal ball marks on the faces; minor scratching on the soles; no significant dings on the heads; no significant wear on the shafts."

I purchased the gun new in 2014 - has seen minimal use with maximum care. The front sight insert (white) fell out while at the range and was replaced with green, night-sight paint for better viewing. Other than this, gun is completely stock and comes with case, (2) mags, case, etc. and some high quality ammo.

The XDm is an excellent gun for the price. Looking to sell ASAP only because I personally want the slimmer XDs for carrying purposes. This gun has made me fall in love with Springfield and this particular gun is priced to sell.

The newer versions are being sold by Colt WITHOUT the LE901 Adapter Block Conversion Kit and they are making the kit available for purchase separately.
Be it prairie dog hunting in Texas, whitetail hunting in Maine or elk hunting in Colorado, the Colt LE901-16S™ is the rifle for the hunt. At first glance you would think that the Colt 901 is just a .308 Win./7.62 NATO version of a standard AR-15, much like any other .308 AR out there, but it is a lot more than that. The Colt LE901-16S is a “Modular Carbine,” which means it can be adapted to any AR-15 platform upper. This isn’t a new concept, because there are of course a whole bunch of different caliber uppers for ARs. The difference is in all the other ones, they have adapted a standard size AR magazine to boutique calibers and cartridge designs. The Colt 901 is different. It can be adapted from .308/7.62, using standard P-Mags, to .223/5.56, using standard AR mags, and back again, in literally seconds. The design uses one proprietary part, and you have to swap out the recoil system. It is that simple, and it works fantastic .

Initially, small quantities HK-91 “clone” rifles were produced, mostly from surplus parts acquired around the world. From 2002-2006, the reputation of the PTR-91 rifle grew considerably along with the market for it. PTR was organized in 2006 to meet that demand. Over the next few years, the company consistently grew its capabilities. Expanding beyond the original 91 “clone”, PTR began to introduce many other models and variants to suit different shooting applications. Today the company is known affectionately as just “PTR”, due to the fact that the product offerings have expanded well beyond the original PTR-91 rifle. In 2011 PTR stands light-years away from its humble beginnings.
