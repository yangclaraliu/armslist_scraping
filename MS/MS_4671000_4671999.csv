1,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4671001,For Sale/Trade:  German (Bavarian) WW1 Sawback Bayonet,"East Arlington, Jacksonville, Florida",$ 350,"Listed On: Monday, September 7, 2015",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"German (Bavarian) 1916 98/05 Butcher ""Sawback"" Bayonet (S98/05 nA S)

One of the best remembered German bayonets from the First World War, said to be inhumane due to the Saw teeth on the 14-inch blade. It was even said that German Soldiers captured with these Sawback bayonets were shot immediately. This was only a rumor, but many German soldiers removed the Saw teeth as a result. The Sawbacks were intended for Pioneer work like artillery emplacements and were never intended to mete out a gruesome death.

The truth is the British invented the saw back bayonet back in the middle of the 19th century.  My example is marked on the blade as being made by Fichtel & Sachs in Schweinfurt, which was made famous in WW2 as a target for our bombers.

I obtained this ""evil babykiller"" bayonet from an elderly neighbor who's father brought it home from ""The Great War"".  Made for use with the Gewehr 98 rifle, it's Bavarian (Crown over ""L"" for Ludwig III) and dated 1916 with a steel scabbard and working release button. The saw teeth are quite sharp, and there are no cracks in the grip panels, just some light rust on the scabbard and pommel. As can be seen in the photos, the blade has some staining but no active rust. I've cleaned up the blade a little with Flitz and a cotton cloth, but I didn't want to do too much to it as I was told that it might be blood staining. I then applied a couple coats of Eezox as a preservative. The edge was sharpened at some point in the past.

It was appraised at between $425 and $450, and a very similar bayonet is currently for sale on a popular militaria website for $395, but I'm making it available here for $350 cash in Northeast Florida. I'm also willing to consider trades for firearms of similar value FTF in NE FL. Just let me know what you have to trade!

I purchased this rifle for myself and customized it. It came with the factory composite stock and composite trigger guard. I restocked it in hardwood and free-floated the (factory contoured) barrel (completely to the action). It also has the savage ""Chief"" in brass set in the grip cap. Sling studs have been set. The action screws have been properly torqued. The trigger guard was replaced with a factory metal trigger guard to match the barrel and action. The bolt is jeweled and the barrel is luster blued (not the terrible finishes you see these days!). It also comes with a Bushnell 3x9x40 scope (with flip caps) that I have bore sighted for 100 yards (it will still need final sighting in). It also comes with a leather Savage sling with quick detach sling rings. It also includes a rifle sock for protection, a padded rifle case with shoulder strap and accessory pouch. Also, included is the original composite stock, a metal trigger guard to work with the composite stock if you wish. It also comes with the original composite trigger guard. Last, it comes with 120 rounds of ammunition (new, not reloads!). 3 boxes of Winchester 100 GR Power Point, 2 boxes of Federal 100 GR Soft Point and 1 box of Remington 80 GR PSP. The rifle alone cost 644.99. The sling cost 45.00, padded case, 43.00, sock 9.99, stock 150.00, trigger guard for wood stock 25.00, trigger guard for composite stock 23.00, flip caps 40.00, the ammo 171.00, etc. The custom work I did on this rifle I normally charge 300.00. 

I have over 1,411.00 invested with my labor. Originally I bought this rifle as a custom build for myself as a Varmint rifle. However, with bills to pay I need to sell it. It is new, not fired, not carried, etc. All accessories are new! ...Everything is absolutely new, so please do not ask.

The custom work is not cheap as anyone who has had custom work done knows (...and I do not do cheap work). This is a great deal for someone. It will not last long. My loss is definitely someone's gain! 

Note: This is a regular size adult stock, not a youth. The .243 was never created to be a youth cartridge (even though many use it as one). It was created to be an intermediate cartridge both for deer, varmint and black bear (which it does work!).


No trades, so please do not ask. I need to pay bills and this is the only reason it is being sold.

I will sell to only those who are able to legally able to own. Must have a valid CCW. Ohio residents only. 


Thanks,
Sincerely
John"

Text/call REDACTED info for questions/to see the bike. No spam please. I will sell the bike & the gear in 3 different packages. They are listed below. To see more pics, email or text me. 

Highlights:
*Low insurance, Comfortable riding position, R1 engine with upgrades, Low miles
*Over $1,000 in high-end riding gear
*$1,500 in Accessories/Upgrades to the bike.

I bought the bike to be able to park in downtown Auburn easily for class instead of trying to maneuver my heavy 1100 V Star.. I am graduating now and no longer need it. My wife prefers to ride on the back of my V star instead and I have no reason to keep two bikes. It was previously owned by a Jet Pilot for the Air Force and was very well taken care of. I have had it for this summer and purchased it from him exactly as it sits now. I only used it to travel a few miles to class. It is a great bike. It has never been wrecked, is in like new condition, and has high quality tires in good shape. It is ready to go.

Also consider:
INSURANCE ON THIS BIKE IS NOT EXPENSIVE. This is because it is considered a ""Sports Touring"" which means it is just as fast as a sports bike (or faster) and you do not have to lean uncomfortably or pay high insurance. You are basically buying a Yamaha R1 with aftermarket parts that is much more comfortable and cheaper to ride. These bikes are meant to have a ton of miles on them and to be ridden for long distance thus accumulating a lot of miles. It is rare to find one of these without very high miles. This is your chance, this one has just under 13,700 (not even broken-in yet).

This bike has all the right accessories:
1. Two Brothers Racing Carbon Fiber Exhaust (great deep sound)
2. Aftermarket Sprockets to give it amazing mid-range power (this is not a beginner bike, Very Fast)
3. Zero-Gravity Windshield (you feel no air resistance)
4. Top Sellerie Gel Seat ($700 ordered from France, yes it is amazing)
5. Integrated Turn Signal Brake Lights (so you can remove the tag holder with blinkers)
6. K&N Intake & Filter
7. Ryder Clips Shift Sock (protects your shoes from shifting)
8. Spare Key (never been used)

Built as a result of numerous request by the hunters who wanted a slightly shorter barrel and lighter swing weight in a carry rifle for predator hunting/calling, this 20 inch barreled version of Bushmasters Varminter will deliver all the accuracy you have come to expect. The 20 inch barrel is fluted 4150 chromoly vanadium steel with sharp 1 x 8 inch twist rifling for heavier bullets typically used on bigger varmints and predators. Predator features include a hybrid SAAMI Spec. chamber, two stage competition trigger (3 1/2 lb. take up and 1 lb let off); a vented aluminum free floater forend with bipod stud; B.M.A.S. 1/2"" mini risers for optimum scope positioning and cheek weld; Hogue ergonomic, ambidextrous pistol grip and a 5 round magazine (legal for hunting in most states). Shipped with safety block and operators manual in a lockable, foam padded, hard case.

After initial testing by the IDF, the Ordnance Corps ordered 8,000 units and the love affair with the world’s most iconic pistol continues today. Since 1963, the renowned UZI® brand has had sales of over 2 million units worldwide. The UZI® PRO Pistol is the latest evolution of this storied design, featuring the most advanced firearms technologies. Based on the famous UZI® SMG, the UZI® PRO Pistol is purpose-built, with only one goal - uncompromising performance and reliability on a simple and robust design. This 9mm Luger Parabellum version for the American public sports an advanced polymer pistol grip that incorporates an integrated magazine release button for fast and easy magazine changes. The cocking handle is located on the receiver side thus allowing for a full-length Picatinny rail on the top receiver cover. A short Picatinny rail is also mounted below the barrel for additional accessories.  Safety is always a primary concern with the UZI® brand and the new pistol features three safety mechanisms; a conventional manual safety, a firing pin block and a proven grip safety that must be fully depressed before the gun can be cocked or fired.  Simple maintenance on the UZI® PRO Pistol requires no special tools for quick and easy field stripping. The UZI® PRO Pistol comes with one 20-round and one 25-round magazine in states that permit magazines with these capacities."

If trading dont ask me for a ptp I dont apply for them anymore nor would I apply for a carry permit, the US constitution grants me the right to bear arms and both state and federal laws require nothing to sell or trade firearms to another in the same state other than to verify residency. A bill of sale is just security to protect the seller and buyer in case a seller or buyer is a felon or if the firearm is stolen. I am a longtime armslist regular and am getting sick of people not knowing the laws and will paste this message in every ad I post. If you are not a ffl you have no business asking for permits as they are only issued for ffl purchases and for law enforcement to verify state carry status."

CZ-USA 550 Medium Battue 

CZ USA 300 Winchester Magnum Bolt Action w/Blue Barrel & Turkish Walnut Stock 

A battue is a driven hunt, popular in much of Europe for hunting large game, especially wild boar. Opportunities for a shot are typically close, fast and fleeting. Everything about the CZ 550 Battue is built for speed... a quick pointing 20 1/2"" bbl and a detachable magazine. The ""hog-back"" comb of the stock aligns the eye perfectly for the red fiber optic front and quarter rib mounted rear sights. The battue sight features a long ramp with a white contrast line leading the eye to the large v-notch. The red fiber optic front sight is protected by a steel hood with three lighting windows to illuminate the fiber.

FINAL THOUGHTSThe Aero Precision uppers and lower I used are outstanding quality and I completely understand the resounding positive comments made by Aero Precision’s customers. There are a plethora of AR brands out there and I see the questions about various receiver brands online here and there. Some of those posts ask whether Aero Precision is a good receiver brand. Based on my experience with the three Aero Precision products, I can state that they are of exceptional quality and I would certainly not hesitate to buy any of their products after all, some of the biggest names in black rifles consider them the best.

 By far, the best for any builder. I have built over 2500 rifles with branded company parts and AP ranks right up there with Spikes and Stag and other high-priced parts (probably because they make them). If you want performance and excellent price, go with AP. You can't go wrong. Customer service is exceptional.
