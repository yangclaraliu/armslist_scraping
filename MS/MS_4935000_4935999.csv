The enhanced takedown pin and pivot pin are CNC machined from Grade 5 titanium bars. Low profile pin heads are ambidextrous safety compatible. An added tip length noticeably aids in starting/pushing the pins out from the left side of the receiver. A cone shaped recess at both pin tips prevents accidental bullet or tool slip. Kit includes two KNS hardened stainless steel detents, two 17-7 nickel plated stainless steel pin springs and one high-strength neodymium magnet for hassle free magnet assisted installation. The titanium pins are 50% lighter than a Mil-Spec pin set. MADE IN THE U.S.A.NOTE: The enhanced pivot pin is NOT compatible with the AX556 receiver due to the receiver's proprietary design (enhanced takedown pin will work). May not be compatible with the KNS anti-walk sear pin without modificaiton to the sear pin."

If you have ever wanted and never had an AR-15 or just want another, I have a few more all in .223/5.56 that I have built to trade. They are the most simplistic platform on the planet. I can build it with you or just have it ready for you to take home and fire away. Everything I have is MIL-SPEC.
Optics available, (optional) are Nikon P223 3x32.

A 16"" HBAR 1/9 twist, carbine length, .750 at gas block, w/birdcage flash hider. Micro gas block and carbine length tube. 10"" vented free float handguard. Palmetto upper and BCG. Forged charge handle, dust cover assembly, forward assist assembly. Omega E3 Arms lower with oversized trigger guard and lifetime warranty. Topped with a Nikon P223 3x32 w/butler creek flip lens covers mounted with Nikon P-series mounts. GL Shock 6 position adjustable buttstock on a commercial buffertube w/ mil-spec buffer and spring.
Everything is mil-spec from top to bottom except the buffertube. I like using them with the GL shock since it is a little more snug of a fit and does not have any jiggle noise.
Everything is mil-spec from top to bottom.

-Hey everyone, I wanted to note that, aside from one moron who contacted me this weekend to tell me I'm stupid for saying Obama would ban everything, most of you understood this was a fine attempt at AdSpeak and just some good ol' fashioned American snake oil and bunghole smokery. So imagine my surprise when I read the news today and learned that, in fact, Obama DOES want to take everything away! Was I psychic? Did I channel my Inner Kommunist? Or was it just an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of underdone potato...

New Gun Control Bill Hits Congress: “To Ensure That The Right To Keep And Bear Arms Is NOT Unlimited”

In the wake of the Sandy Hook shootings we warned that sweeping changes were in the works for Americans’ right to bear arms. It started with ammunition tax proposals, restrictions on firearm accessories imports and most recently Governors began bypassing Congress altogether by banning gun ownership for those on any of the government’s many watchlists. The Obama administration has also targeted licensed firearms sellers across the United States by forcing banks to treat them like pornography businesses and impeding their access to transaction processing systems and business banking accounts.

States like California already ban “assault weapons” and outlaw “high capacity” magazines that can hold more than ten rounds of ammunition. But the kinds of restrictive laws that strike at the very heart of the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution have thus far been limited to just a dozen or so heavily liberal states.

Until now.

While Americans anxiously prepared for their Christmas festivities, anti gun proponents in Congress were hard at work drafting a new bill. If passed H.R. 4269 would literally redefine the Second Amendment as evidenced by the bill’s description, which in no uncertain terms clarifies its ultimate goal:

“To regulate assault weapons, to ensure that the right to keep and bear arms is not unlimited, and for other purposes.”

The bill directly targets every semi-automatic firearm in the United States including handguns, shotguns and rifles. It specifically mentions certain firearms and manufacturers, including the popular AR-15 and AK-47 rifles.

Because the law is Federal it would blanket the country with new restrictions, including making it illegal to own any magazine that exceeds a capacity of ten (10) rounds.

And here’s the kicker, even if your weapon has a legally-defined low capacity detachable magazine but is modified with any of the following accessories, it is considered an “assault rifle” and would be outright banned in the United States.

Semiautomatic rifle that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and any 1 of the following:
“(i) A pistol grip.
“(ii) A forward grip.
“(iii) A folding, telescoping, or detachable stock.
“(v) A barrel shroud.
“(vi) A threaded barrel.
…
“(B) A semiautomatic rifle that has a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds, except for an attached tubular device designed to accept, and capable of operating only with, .22 caliber rimfire ammunition.

“(C) Any part, combination of parts, component, device, attachment, or accessory that is designed or functions to accelerate the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle but not convert the semiautomatic rifle into a machinegun.

To be clear, the new bill puts all half measures aside and goes for the jugular.

This is the worst case scenario that many Americans have feared.

If you own a weapon on the ban list or have accessories as described by the bill, your firearm will be outlawed in the United States of America.

SEC. 3.RESTRICTIONS ON ASSAULT WEAPONS AND LARGE CAPACITY AMMUNITION FEEDING DEVICES
(a) In General.—Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, is amended—
(1) by inserting after subsection (u) the following:
“(v) (1) It shall be unlawful for a person to import, sell, manufacture, transfer, or possess, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, a semiautomatic assault weapon.
…
“(37) The term ‘large capacity ammunition feeding device’—
“(A) means a magazine, belt, drum, feed strip, or similar device, including any such device joined or coupled with another in any manner, that has an overall capacity of, or that can be readily restored, changed, or converted to accept, more than 10 rounds of ammunition;
…
“(w) (1) It shall be unlawful for a person to import, sell, manufacture, transfer, or possess, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, a large capacity ammunition feeding device.

The bill was introduced in Congress on Decemeber 16, 2015 and currently has 123 co-sponsors – all democrats.

We know that gun bans don’t work but one can’t help but think the agenda goes much further than the notion that they want to make us safer. If that were the case then our lawmakers wouldn’t allow drug cartels, gang members and Islamic terrorists to cross into the U.S. through our porous southern border.

The reality is that a cloud of tyranny has descended upon America. For it to be successful the American people must first be disarmed.

As history has proven time and again, a disarmed populace can easily be led to slaughter. But unlike the tens of millions executed in ethnic, religious and political cleansings of the 20th century, Americans have a rich tradition of personal liberty and the right to bear arms. It is embedded in our culture and our founding document. And as Texas police chief Randy Kennedy recently warned, if the government pushes too far they may well incite a revolution.
