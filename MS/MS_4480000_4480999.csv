You can choose between light only, laser only or both. It's in like-new condition. The light output is 160 lumens - which is right about the sweet-spot. Not so bright that it bounces off everything and blinds you indoors, but more than bright enough to illuminate anything you need illuminated within pistol range (and temporarily blind anybody who looks into it!). 

It will fit any standard 1913 style Picatinny rail or Glock rail (so pretty much any gun with a rail).

These are some of the best weapon lights available! They sell new for $265+ on Amazon. I'll take $175 for this one. No trades at this time.

I will ship at buyer's expense (Lasers cannot be shipped to New York City; D.C.; MA; Canada or Puerto Rico.) KNOW YOUR LAWS. I can't possibly determine or list the places where these are legal for civilian purchase/use so YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN on that issue."

This is my baby...You won't find a scratch or blemish, it has only been fired toughly 8 times and I am the kind of guy who can shoot 20 bullets all day and be happy as hell.  This rifle will do quarter MOA at a 100 and usually a bit better.  I am a bench rest guy and spent hours an hours perfecting the load this rifle just loves and will give you the recipe plus a few hundred rounds of its favorite snack.  
The rifle has a fluted barrel, muzzle break, accutrigger, accustock, and had the internals  coated with a heat treatment of Frog lube (cause that stuff is amazing!!) You have to see and hold this behemoth....to bad savage phased them out for a cheaper version for local police departments....this thing is getting to be scarce since they aren't going to made anytime soon and there is a demand from experienced long range shooters and decorated police trigger pullers alike because of the accuracy and weight...the heft makes it a great bench rest rifle and you can run hot loads and it wont move a millimeter off of target. 
I have topped this beast with a Bushnell Elite 6500 4.5-30 x 50 Matte Fine Multi-X Reticle with Rainguard Riflescope which I dropped $870.00 on. The rifle was 1k and there is the ammo, and if you reload I have over $2,000 worth of bullets (bullets only sold all powder and brass) if your interested. There is also a Harris SBRM 6 - 9 inch bipod with S-lock as well as a Caldwell ""The Rock"" Deluxe Shooting Rest - 383-774 includes the backrest and I will add the Caldwell Deluxe Universal Rear Bag 
So down to brass tacks....The original investment for everything except the bullets is just under $3,100 for this entire package.  
Good offers will not be turned away, but with over $300.00 in match grade ammo free don't waste my time.  This will not last....I actually have a meeting tomorrow morning at 8:00 am but the price isn't there,,,,,and he isn't getting all the extras....so you get close to  $2,500 and its yours and I will throw in $200.00 in match grade bullets.....man this is harder than I imagined......hell maybe i'll keep the damn thing...jk ( maybe)"

Installation is simpler yet - just slide the barrel into the upper and twist until it locks. The takedown mechanism provides a repeatable point of impact. MSR shooters that desire a larger cartridge will be excited to find that a replaceable barrel kit chambered in 300 AAC Blackout is available on ShopRuger.com. This range-ready barrel's headspace is set at the factory and comes complete with a metal flip-up elevation & windage adjustable front sight and two, 30-round metal magazines marked with ""300 AAC BLACKOUT"" to ensure easy differentiation. Ruger® patented chrome-plated, two-stage piston with multi-stage regulator provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. The two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The Ruger® Elite 452™ AR trigger is a two-stage trigger that offers a smooth, crisp, 4.5 lb. trigger pull. The Ruger Elite 452™ features a full-strength hammer spring for consistent primer ignition and a lightweight hammer that enables a 30% faster lock time over standard MSR triggers. With front and rear folding iron sights, the SR-556® Takedown is ready to go to the range right out the box. The front sight is both elevation & windage adjustable, meaning that when you swap barrels, the zero stays with the barrel. The lower receiver is fitted with the Magpul® MOE grip and MOE SL collapsible buttstock on the mil-spec buffer tube. With a length of pull ranging between 11.1""-14.4"" the fit can be perfect for most any shooter. Precision-rifled, chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel ensures accuracy and longevity. The SR-556® Takedown also sports the shorter Ruger® flash hider on the 1/2""-28 threaded muzzle. Supplied with three Magpul PMAG® 30-round magazines (a lightweight 556 NATO magazine). Also includes a rugged, ballistic nylon case; three rail covers and lock."

This is my baby...You won't find a scratch or blemish, it has only been fired toughly 8 times and I am the kind of guy who can shoot 20 bullets all day and be happy as hell. This rifle will do quarter MOA at a 100 and usually a bit better. I am a bench rest guy and spent hours an hours perfecting the load this rifle just loves and will give you the recipe plus a few hundred rounds of its favorite snack. 
 The rifle has a fluted barrel, muzzle break, accutrigger, accustock, and had the internals coated with a heat treatment of Frog lube (cause that stuff is amazing!!) You have to see and hold this behemoth....to bad savage phased them out for a cheaper version for local police departments....this thing is getting to be scarce since they aren't going to made anytime soon and there is a demand from experienced long range shooters and decorated police trigger pullers alike because of the accuracy and weight...the heft makes it a great bench rest rifle and you can run hot loads and it wont move a millimeter off of target. 
 I have topped this beast with a Bushnell Elite 6500 4.5-30 x 50 Matte Fine Multi-X Reticle with Rainguard Riflescope which I dropped $870.00 on. The rifle was 1k and there is the ammo, and if you reload I have over $2,000 worth of bullets (bullets only sold all powder and brass) if your interested. There is also a Harris SBRM 6 - 9 inch bipod with S-lock as well as a Caldwell ""The Rock"" Deluxe Shooting Rest - 383-774 includes the backrest and I will add the Caldwell Deluxe Universal Rear Bag 
 So down to brass tacks....The original investment for everything except the bullets is just under $3,100 for this entire package. 
 Good offers will not be turned away, but with over $300.00 in match grade ammo free don't waste my time. This will not last....I actually have a meeting tomorrow morning at 8:00 am but the price isn't there,,,,,and he isn't getting all the extras....so you get close to $2,500 and its yours and I will throw in $200.00 in match grade bullets.....man this is harder than I imagined......hell maybe i'll keep the damn thing...jk ( maybe)"

 I'm cleaning out the rest of my commie stuff, so I thought I'd go ahead and take a shot at throwing this out as a package.

Anyway for $850 you get everything listed below plus anything else I find between now and the time of sale(loose ammo, parts, tools, clean kits, etc)

1.  Izhevsk M44 still in cosmoline. Has very few stamps on receiver and no visible date mark, I asked the guy from 54r.net and he said it he's seen them without dates before.

2. 1934 Izhevsk Hex receiver.  Unfired since it was rearsenaled, still has internal cosmoline.  Includes sling and bayonet

3. 1938 Tula round receiver in a gorgeous laminate stock and it also has factory color fill on the rear sight and a little bit of the receiver.  Unfired since it was rearsenaled and still has cosmoline.  Includes sling and bayonet.

4. 1942 Izhevsk 91/59 this one needs a fair amount of work done but can be a really nice rifle.  It has cleanable corrosion in the barrel(shoot, clean, repeat....its up to you. There is a lot of info online on how to make it pristine) and the bolt needs to be disassembled, polished and put back together. 

5. One sealed 800 round crate of Czech ammo(well, I'm 99% sure it's Czech silver tip. I'll dig it out tomorrow to make sure) I'm using a stock photo of the ammo.

6. 68 loaded stripper clips(a total of 340 miscellaneous rounds)

7. 6 double pocket ammunition pouches

8. boyd scout stock and metal Harris style bipod 

9. Additional wooden crate that I'm packing the stripper clips and other small parts in. 

10. A Mosin Nagant rifle crate that holds up to 20 91/30's(great for storing surplus)

Up for sale is a Savage Arms model 93R17 FNSXP .17 HMR bolt action with Bushnell scope.

I purchased it March 2013.  I have put exactly 100 rounds through it.  Then cleaned it & put it away.  I want to sell it to buy a different firearm.  This rifle was cleaned using a “PRO-SHOT” one piece rod w/PRO-SHOT jag, swab, & brush, aided with the “RVB-PRECISION .17 HMR BORE GUIDE.”  (www.rvbprecision.com)  Then placed in a silicone gun sock & locked away in my safe.  All paperwork, original gun lock, manuals, etc. are present.  The rifle is flawless, ready for a summer of fun target practice.

Prices as follows:

1. Rifle, with scope & 1 magazine. $300.00 (that is a $35.00 savings over new!)
2. Second magazine $10.00  (New sell for $20.00)
3. “Savage Arms” black leather sling w/ swivels $25.00
4. Bore guide & cleaning rod w/ extras $50.00  (You save $20.00 over retail.)
5. 1000 rounds of ammunition in ammo can $220.00  (That's .22 cents a round!)

ITEMS # 2-5 ONLY AVAILABLE WITH THE PURCHASE OF THE RIFLE, AND WILL NOT BE SOLD SEPARATELY!  DON'T ASK!  IF YOU BUY THE RIFLE, YOU CAN BUY ANY OR ALL THE ITEMS LISTED IN # 2-5.

Shoots great, just need the money since hours got cut down at work.  If interested, call or text.  If I don't answer, leave a message and I'll get back to you.  I bought this rifle brand new about 6 months ago and shot about 200 rounds through it.  I did paint it cammo, which turned out really nice.  
Also comes with folding bipod and scope as shown in the pictures.  At 300 yards, I can get a shotgroup the size of a quarter, so it's definitely a consistantly accurate rifle.  We can meet at a range so you can try it out if you'd like, but you would provide the ammo and range fee.  

Low ball offers will be ignored.  Will throw in some ammo if negotiated in sale.  I have regular fmj, rapid expansion hunting rounds, armor piercing, and some hp.  This is a great hunting rifle and also fun just to take to the range.

Everything is in LIKE NEW condition. My only reason for selling: I have been shooting Glocks since I started shooting, and can't break my Glock habits. This P220 is great to carry, and easy to shoot. DA is almost easier to shoot than SA. This is the P220 carry, it takes the normal full size 8 round P220 magazines, but has a shortened slide and barrel. Still shoots like a full size P220 though.

The rifle has one small gouge on the stock that is not very deep, just enough to remove finish. The bluing is worn on the moving parts, like the bolt contact surfaces etc. but otherwise is in great shape.

Included, and installed is the Ultimak scout mount, and a set of Tech sights. The Ultimak has been used with an Aimpoint micro dot, and was an excellent combination. As far as iron sights go the Mini 14s are always lacking but the new Tech sight rear sight makes a world of difference. I do not like peep sights, but I have no issue using the Mini with the new rear sight. There is also a M14 style flash hider installed to give it that A-team feel. The original parts, sights, and heat shield are included.

According to Ruger the Ser# puts it at a MFG date in 1985, and with a 1:10 twist barrel. Mini 14s are chambered in 5.56, and I have fired 62g green tip ammunition with great results, and no key holing.

The rifle has one small gouge on the stock that is not very deep, just enough to remove finish. The bluing is worn on the moving parts, like the bolt contact surfaces etc. but otherwise is in great shape.

Included, and installed is the Ultimak scout mount, and a set of Tech sights. The Ultimak has been used with an Aimpoint micro dot, and was an excellent combination. As far as iron sights go the Mini 14s are always lacking but the new Tech sight rear sight makes a world of difference. I do not like peep sights, but I have no issue using the Mini with the new rear sight. There is also a M14 style flash hider installed to give it that A-team feel. The original parts, sights, and heat shield are included.

According to Ruger the Ser# puts it at a MFG date in 1985, and with a 1:10 twist barrel. Mini 14s are chambered in 5.56, and I have fired 62g green tip ammunition with great results, and no key holing.
