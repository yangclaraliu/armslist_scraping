It doesn't have to be 300... could be less.. maybe a tad more. Basically if you have been holding onto something and want to cut a deal... have something your looking to get out of quickly. Maybe your tired of dealing with the idiots that make deals and turn out to be punks.. Put a great price on it and let me know. Want something functional that maybe I can tinker with.

Very low round count. Includes everything from the factory, box, paperwork, lock, 2-15rd magazines. You will not be disappointed.

Each metal frame P95 series pistol with rail is made of hard coated A356T aircraft quality aluminum alloy; Ruger's proprietary Terhune Anticorro stainless steel (chrome-molybdenum steel in blued models); nearly indestructible resin grip panels; custom, compounded polymer frames of the P95 andP97; and long strand fiberglass filler that is a natural shock absorber. P95 series pistols easily field strip for cleaning, without the use of special tools, into five major subassemblies. Ruger offers several ambidextrous variations on the proven P95 series double-action design. Operating features on all centerfire models include a firing pin block that prevents firing unless the trigger is completely pulled and held fully back. Manual safety models incorporate a manual ambidextrous lever that, when engaged, prevents firing unless the lever is in the ""fire"" position. Decock only models allow safe return to their ""at rest"" mode when either ambidextrous decocking lever is depressed.

exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to 
create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of 
shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he 
likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy 
Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result 
in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model, 
at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs.

Includes everything pictured except TROY BUIS. 

The specs below are from Larue. Larue PredatAR 5.56 Overview The PredatAR 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle. 

The barrels are Stainless Steel, lightweight-profiled, Wylde chambered and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). The handguards on the PredatAR extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. 

Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section. Comes with a 6-position Magpul MOE Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with max-staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies. The lower assembly has the proven Geissele Two-Stage trigger. XTRAXN™ is a proprietary chamber feature added to reduce frictional forces caused by pressure-expanded cartridge cases bearing against chamber walls. Facilitates reliable extraction through a wide range of temperature / chamber pressure extremes. XTRAXN™ extends extractor life, while having no effect on the firearm's accuracy. All this, and it dovetails well with the OBR's world-famous accuracy. 

Caliber: 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Rifle Weight: 6.25 lb. (based on 16.1” barrel version, unloaded without optics) Barrel Length: 16.1“ Barrel Material: Stainless Steel, Blackened. Rifling Twist Rate: 1/8 Muzzle Thread Configuration: ½ x 28 * Barrel Life: 10,000 (approx) Gas System: Mid-Length Direct Impingement Trigger Group: Two-Stage Geissele trigger. Buyer responsible for knowing their local laws and confirming this rifle is legal for them to own. Buyer pays Shipping and Insurance. Certified Money Order/Bank Check accepted.

This wasn't from me, this is from whoever repaired it, though I will put a pic of this for you all to see. This is a exact copy of a Remington 870 and accepts Remington 870 stocks, foregrips, and so on. Comes with 9 shot buttstock sleeve, hard plastic case, and I want to say 10 to 15 00 buckshot and 10 to 15 slugs. Also comes with 25 target loads. Firearm does fire, when I sent it in to get repaired the person that fixed it did a test fire after.

Looking to sell or possibly trade my 1969 4"" Colt Python in nickel. Includes original mint safe queen gen 2 stocks and aftermarket grips shown.  Fired rarely, only twice by me, about 30 rounds total from me.  No muzzle wear, never holstered, but a small bit of light hard to see flaking on forward edge of cylinder, otherwise flawless.   I did take to the range and put 30 rounds through it and it performed flawlessly. Actual round count unknown, but appears to have been fired very little. Perfect lock up and timing, trigger smooth as wiping your ass with silk. Two inch group at 75 yards. No box or papers.  TRADES WELCOME (see below)

However, cash plays!  

FIRM:  $2250 shipped FFL to FFL INCONUS (both sets of stocks), $2200 face to face (both sets of stocks), $1850 for python with aftermarket stocks only (I keep the mint stocks), face to face, or $1900 shipped with just aftermarket stocks.  

For face to face, no transfer fee, no taxes, no hassles, but yeah, you must have a FOID card and all the rules apply.  Will need to fill out an IL firearms transfer form for this beauty, but this is as cheap as you are going to find such a nice Colt Python specimen.
Make offer on trade. Trade would need to be a good multi-gun trade of quality firearms."

I am using a stock photo from Davidson's

From the KelTec website:

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens.

The slide has been factory ""cerakoted"" O.D. Green and the frame is black.

It has a motorcycle chock installed and 2 removable shelves at the front. It has D-rings in all four corners of the floor and has the strips along both sides similar to a semi trailer for securing. I also have about 20 attachments for the side rails. It takes a 2"" ball. It is white and in excellent condition. The tires are hi speed radial tires and have less than 4000 miles on them. The spare tire is brand new and never been mounted. It has a 4 way light plug and all lights work. The only defect I can think of is the tail lights are slightly cracked from the previous owner backing in to a wall. I swear it wasn't me...hahaha. It doesn't affect how they work. As I stated all lights work perfectly. Also, the stabilizer leg needs to be repaired. Again that doesn't affect the function of the trailer. Everything else is in working condition and I literally just pulled it from Fort Bragg to Fort Hood Texas and back with a Harley Softail and everything we need for our trip and it pulled perfectly with absolutely no issues what so ever. It is a 2005 Loadrunner by interstate if you would like to look it up. I have a 100% free and clear NC title for it as well. I bought a permanent tag for it and we could also possibly have that transferred to you. I don't know exactly how that would work. I am asking 1400 cash or trade.

Great condition, beautiful polished barrel, houge grip (which makes a huge difference on the purchase on the grip due to the thinness of this small pocket pistol), extra mag, lock, original box, paperwork,  and even the factory test fire casing. I bought this approximately a couple months ago for $425 without the Houge grip, or extra mag ($40), or polished barrel. I love the reliability,  the size, even the looks. I've taken about 5 trips to the range in Dillsburg with it and put a box of 50 through it each time. So 250-300 rounds total. The reason I need something else is because I keep dropping the magazine due to either the placement of the mag release,  or because of my big thumb. The purpose of this firearm was to be my main carry gun, though can't trust my life to a tool that I have this issue with. Some people have trouble with this issue, and some never have this problem. I'd like to trade for another 380. (Bodyguard, cw380, p3at, 738 tcp, etc.) Open to a small 9mm too. Thanks and email with questions."

Its served me well and I dont really want to part with it. However I am interested in getting a Sig 220 Extreme and I cant fund it without selling a firearm.

Included with this c is the oem case and all that came with it new (3 mags etc.). I will also include a Crossbreed IWB holster, and a Foxx IWB mag holster. The Mag Holster was made for a Glock 30 however I have added a small amount of tape to the inside and the 9mm mags fit snugly. The night sights are all green and bright. I will include the original Glock sights. The ghost springs are installed, and I can also include the original glock parts if you want. The trigger pull is crisp and much better then the stock springs. I will also include a Korean 33rd magazine. Mag feeds great and I have never had an issue with it. 

If your interested I also have an XL tactical belt that doesnt fit me properly, and I bought just the L size. Just mention that please if your interested. 

This gun has been well maintained, and has been cleaned after every shooting. If your looking for the most popular glock, ready to go with all the goodies look no further.

No kits like this were ever imported en masse. The parts used were sourced from a rare European deact kit and reassembled here on a NDS-2SF receiver using a pulled Bulgarian barrel and Tapco G2 trigger group. The kit is one of maybe 2 or 3 1980-dated Russian 74 kits known to exist in the US. The trunion, top cover, and gas tube are original matching numbers. Unfortunately, the matching bolt carrier did not make it with this kit. A later Russian Bolt/carrier combo are in its stead. There are several nuances present with this build that you won't find in a ""cloned "" pieced-together Russian AKS-74. The stock assy has Russian proofs, the mold numbers on the barrel hardware are unique when compared to the common '83 kits, the top cover is the earlier-style, etc"

This pistol has all matching serial numbers and was manufactured completly in the United States as it has a NM serial number. Look it up and you'll see these are harder to find. It's only flaw is a dummy scratch from the previous owner. Fires great and very accurate. I'm by no means desperate to lose this pistol and am fine with having it up for awhile. Make an offer cash or trade but no low balls. Just trying to see what else is out there. Text REDACTED"

I can cold re-blue barrels,  refinish stocks, and scrub years of residue out of your barrel with my special solvent.  I have refinished remington 740's, 7400's, bolt action remington 700's, winchester 70's, and a few shotguns.  I have turned remington 7400's into tactical sniper rifles, cut down shotguns to legal limits for home defense.  Instead of dropping hundreds now on a new gun,  let me clean it up fully for a negotiated price.  I would say that most refinishes could be 40-70 bucks depending.

 Kinematic Drive™ SYSTEM
In its simplest term, kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The new Browning A5 makes better use of kinetic energy with its powerful, short recoil-operated Kinematic Drive System. Kinematic Drive harnesses recoil energy and converts it into the mechanical motion needed to operate the action. This concept is tried and true, and now perfected by the company that broke ground first with autoloading shotguns. The beauty of Kinematic Drive is the simplicity of design for consistent, reliable function with any load and under the full extremes of weather, temperature, moisture and grime. We believe the new Kinematic Drive is so reliable that the A5 is the first ever autoloading shotgun to carry a 100,000-round or five-year guarantee. This gun is designed to work, come hell or high water. Operation is clean because gases are sent out the barrel and away from the action. There’s also extreme load versatility. The extensively tested Kinematic Drive offers reliable performance with virtually all loads down to 1 ounce field loads with no adjustments."

Kinematic Drive™ SYSTEM
In its simplest term, kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The new Browning A5 makes better use of kinetic energy with its powerful, short recoil-operated Kinematic Drive System. Kinematic Drive harnesses recoil energy and converts it into the mechanical motion needed to operate the action. This concept is tried and true, and now perfected by the company that broke ground first with autoloading shotguns. The beauty of Kinematic Drive is the simplicity of design for consistent, reliable function with any load and under the full extremes of weather, temperature, moisture and grime. We believe the new Kinematic Drive is so reliable that the A5 is the first ever autoloading shotgun to carry a 100,000-round or five-year guarantee. This gun is designed to work, come hell or high water. Operation is clean because gases are sent out the barrel and away from the action. There’s also extreme load versatility. The extensively tested Kinematic Drive offers reliable performance with virtually all loads down to 1 ounce field loads with no adjustments."

I have a set of offsett sights to go with it.  5.45 carbine upper comes complete and is ready to go into any mil-spec AR-15 lower.  Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome.

The 5.45x39 caliber bullet matches high muzzle velocity with excellent sectional density, resulting in a flat trajectory and good penetration. The standard ball cartridge will penetrate 5mm of steel plate at a distance of 350 meters. The lowered recoil impulse of the 5.45mm cartridge (verses the 7.62x39mm) has a beneficial effect on accuracy. The 5.45x39mm cartridge is an excellent round that offers comparable penetration, accuracy and lethality to anything fielded by NATO. More importantly, 5.45x39 ammunition is less expensive to shoot! This upper has been designed to handle dirty and corrosive surplus ammunition. The bolt and bolt carrier have been protected by an ion-bond finish. These processes make the parts more corrosive resistant and harder than hard chrome. Now you have the ability to shoot the inexpensive corrosive mil-surplus ammo without the fear of the parts being unduly worn. Each upper also comes with a Wolff Extra Power Hammer Spring to ignite the older hardened primers. 

The melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrel provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. The melonited barrel has higher lubricity, lasts longer and is just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chamber is speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber.

It was manufactured in Poland and is an almost exact copy of the HK P2A1 pistol. The serial numbers on the frame match those on the barrel. This particular one is somewhat unusual in that it is in new/unfired condition. Most of these were issued before they were imported into the US, and they typically show the signs of that use.

 Pistol comes with it's original cleaning rod & lanyard, a weather resistant flap style holster with shoulder carry strap. Holster can carry the pistol, cleaning rod, 26.5mm flare cartridges, sub caliber adapters, and even a box of .22 ammo (see pictures).

Additionally there is an adapter that allows for any .22 short, long or long rifle ammo to be safely fired, and another adapter for firing the less expensive 12 gauge flare cartridges. Please note that you must never attempt to fire any 12 gauge ammo other than flare cartridges as to do so would be disastrous.

Finally the following ammo is included:
(2) 26.5mm orange smoke shells
(2) 26.5mm red rain shells
(2) 26.5mm brilliant white parachute illumination shells
(1) sealed package of Orion 12 gauge super red flares 
(150) rounds .22LR ammo - 100 rounds Mini-Mag, 50 rounds Aguila Super Maximum & 50 rounds Aguila Sub Sonic Sniper with special 60 grain bullet 

Price is $225. Pickup in Brandon. Because .22 adapter turns this flare pistol into a firearm when installed - you must be 21 to purchase. Thanks for looking."

Springfield Armory® has just introduced a new 1911 designed for 
 people interested in shooting competitively. It is called— The RO™, 
“Range Officer™”. The RO™ is designed to give the shooter 
 exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to 
 create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of 
 shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he 
 likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy 
 Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result 
 in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model, 
 at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs.

This is a mechanically fine, cosmetically poor revolver. It's accurate with a surprisingly smooth trigger, and crisp single action. There is obvious finish wear with signs of pitting (as shown) by the trigger guard. It isn't currently rusting, so I'm assuming the pitting was an old wound, if you will.

It was originally a Chilean Security Services pistol, and it's one of the older models. It's a good, solid revolver that could use an aesthetic touch up that I'm not capable of doing."

Thanks for looking

Be prepared to present legal proof of right to purchase (Indiana ID and Carry Permit)  I have no interest in selling to unqualified persons. *no exceptions unless you pay a local store to do full background workup while we wait, I'll split cost with you*

I realize my G19 vs. the G21 & G30 is at about a $50 disadvantage in MSRP.  If your trade is in the same condition as mine (99% as new) I would be willing to add the $50 difference with my trade.

The barrel and magazine retain full blue coverage, the barrel is a dark plum blue. The receiver is mechanically excellent and has that very desirable ""smooth as glass"" operation when you cycle the bolt. This smooth operation was a hallmark of Winchester's early rifles when they spent the time to hand finish the internal working parts - nice! It feeds, chambers and ejects smoothly and properly. There is little original blue remaining, mostly a nice dark plum patina. The screw slots are still sharp and not buggered up. The take down is snug and functions correctly. The wood is tight and solid on both the forend and buttstock. Overall this Winchester is all original and correct and in excellent operating condition. It has not been cleaned or fooled with, a rare, vintage Winchester for your collection."

This is partially because they were a 100% Bulgarian-made Kalashnikov with a milled receiver, and partially because they had the traditional 45 degree gas block and vented gas tube just as the original Type 3 AK-47 (AKK). Aside from being a semi-automatic rifle, the only real difference from the military AK-47 was the stock set, lack of a lower tang, lack of a threaded barrel, and lack of a sling loop on the left/rear of the receiver.A parts kit means you will have to assemble this kit yourself or have a qualified gun smith do it for you.You can do this yourself at home with a minimum of tools.All numbers match.All the parts are in great shape.Small parts Refinished in duracoat.The furniture looks great with some very small handling marks.This AK comes with the factory 5 round mag.(not in pics)The only part missing is the trigger guard and you can get it at apex gun parts on the net.I am in lake mary florida.Msg me if interested.$600.00.I can ship this parts kit anywhere in the USA.Will take a US postal money order or paypal."
