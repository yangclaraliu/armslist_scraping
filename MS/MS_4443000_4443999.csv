Upper has some use marks/noticeable wear

Works flawlessly, ~500 rounds through it and its never given me issues using wolf, WWB, or green tip 5.56

Upper: YHM 
Barrel: 7.5"" pistol gas system with set gas block
Muzzle Device: YHM muzzle break and QD suppressor adapter - reduces felt recoil to about half that of a 16"" AR

Hand guard: YHM Diamond carbine length hand guard http://yhm.net/accessories/forearms/diamond-series-ar-15.html
On the hand guard there is a troy QD sling mount

A YHM suppressor has an outer diameter of 1.5"", the hand guard has an inner diameter of 1.75 inches, with the muzzle device recessed 3/8"" into the rail, your suppressor will seat neatly inside the hand guard with no break between the two, looks very nice.
There's wear  and no BCG/Charging handle - got it, but this is already set up with all the high speed cool guy stuff you want and 'need'

I've taken good care of it, cleaned the receiver, star chamber, and bore after every firing.

Can provide serious offers with more pics.

With all the modifications, this upper would easily sell for $600 brand new - I'm practically giving it away at $400, but I'm open to any realistic offers. 

I'll trade for a snubnose 38 or 357, S&W 9mm shield, S&W 380 body guard, something along those lines

Product description from CZ-USA website:

The Valor series is our flagship line, meaning it’s the best we have to offer. Frankly, we feel it is the best built production 1911 on the market.

The Valor is loaded with features, including a forged frame with 25 LPI checkering front and back, an undercut trigger guard, tactical ledge night sights, VZ slim line G10 grips, EGW carry bevel bushings as well as our tool-steel fire controls and other premium small parts. Every piece that goes into the Valor series is hand-fit, polished and blended to provide you with not only the best functioning gun we can provide, but also the best looking.

The Valor can be had with either a matte stainless glass bead finish or our super durable black Duty finish. This finish is a revolutionary treatment process that actually bonds to the components and creates a super-durable matte black skin. Our Duty Black finish beats any of the spray-and-bake finishes most companies use today, hands down. Our durability testing proves it and our customers love it – which is proof enough for us!"

It comes with two 15 round magazines.  No Box no papers.  Sig night sights, double action/single action with de-cocker.

This is a beautiful full sized 40 caliber pistol.  Finish is 100%, only marks are on outside of the chamber from the slide action.  This gun is as good as you will get for a used gun.  The front site is fiber optic with internal light, and the rear sights are illuminated with white outlines.  Only determent is the night lights might be starting to fade or dim a little.
I have fired the gun it works perfectly, it shoots like a dream, almost makes me a good shot!!!  

I rate the gun’s condition at approx. 99.9%.  Book value is between $925-$1050.  I would like to sell this gun and I am asking $775.00.  
   I am 100% firm on the price.  I would consider trading for a gun of equal value.
   I am specifically interested in Martini-Henry rifles, mark I through III, or carbines, in good shape and must be 100% shoot-able.  Or Webley .455 revolvers, not modified for .45APC.  I can add cash for something really good.

Cash only and a FTF meeting only. Ohio DL required, and CC permit preferred. I will do a bill of sale if desired, (please let me know in advance if you want a BOS). In my opinion this is a good gun, and to the best of my knowledge 100% functional and as described above.  I am offering No warranty or guarantee, this is an AS-IS sale. I am willing to meet within about 25 miles of Parma Ohio. I will answer all messages first-come-first-served.
I reserve the right not to sell this gun.  All most all of my Armlist encounters have been great, but one guy weirded me out, I ended up not selling to him.  Apologies if this seems harsh, but I will not sell if my substantial gut tells me not to.
I work nights so please excuse any delays in returning your messages.

I am primarily a NRA Highpower and prone shooter, so this was mainly used for winter practice to keep sharp with those guns. I recently had a new palma rifle built on a 2018 Precise stock, so I've decided to go with a 2013 in a precise stock for my smallbore gun. That leaves this rifle without a purpose. Rifle shoots great, and is in excellent shape. Some minor rub marks, etc from normal use - purely cosmetic. Front sight/riser in picture included in sale.

The Gun is lightly used(has about 150-200 rounds through it) and in perfect condition. It has also never jammed on me. Its honestly the most fun I ever had with any gun, and well worth the money if you can afford it. Nothing can compare to the joy of shooting a Semi-Auto 50 BMG with the recoil of a .308. You really have to shoot it to understand. Unfortunately I can no longer afford it as I just lost my Job and have a new sports car to pay for, so heres your chance to get awesome package for a good price.

This same model rifle, but has a better scope included with it. The scope is a Redfield 20X long range scope with extreme accuracy.

I was a member of SAFE and other organizations. I believe in MIL SPEC quality items....BUT you pay a hefty price... Recently I was asked to put together a kit made from NON MIL SPEC items. These items, cover vital areas: tools ( knife, etc), water and food collection/storage, fire for heat and to cook food, boil water, thermal protection, and other items. I have put together a kit made from IMPORTED items. I would not jump into the Amazon jungle with this but one of these items COULD save your life in a SHTF situation. You will have light, heat, basic tools, food & water, etc. Here it is:.... 1)...Pack Lantern..Just like a big lantern, but small enough to tote. 7-LED lantern stands 5-3/4"" tall x approx 2-1/2"" diameter at its widest, and weighs 8 ounces. Runs on (3) ""AA"" batteries that come with it, and has off/low/med/high/high-flashing modes. Stands up by its self, or has a hanging loop. Also has a switch guard so it won't turn on in your pack and wear itself out. 2)..Hand Shovel...This one's easier to tote, because it folds in half. Our folding shovel is a 5-3/4"" x 2-1/8"" when inside its black canvas belt carrier, but opens and locks to 8-7/8"" long. All stainless steel, so there are no rust problems. 3)..Compass...More compass than you usually get for the price, Transparent plastic, liquid-filled version is 1-15/16"" diameter with a black outer ring marked every 5 degrees and knurled for easy turning. Bottom has lines and an arrow for ease of plotting. On a 17"" long neck cord. 4)..Water Bottle, Aluminum...This big aluminum bottle was made to hold food grade liquids. Use it to carry your water. Measures 10"" tall x 3-1/2"" diameter with sloping shoulders and a 1-1/16"" ID mouth. Includes a screw cap (with a pull-out plug) . Holds 42 oz and is unbreakable. 5)..Flint and Steel...A jumbo emergency fire starter is 4"" long with a 2-3/4"" long x 5/16"" diameter flint with a handle, on a wrist strap with an attached 2-3/4"" long steel striker. You should never to run out of fire starting fuel. 6)..Key chain flashlite...One bright-white LEDs at one end; a 1"" slip ring at the other for hanging on your keys. In between will be a company name and/or logo and/or address, as these were made for various business promotions. Measures 2-1/2"" long x approx 1/2"" diameter with a push-button and (4) replaceable button-cell batteries. 7).Poncho...Always be prepared. Even if it's not raining, toss one of these one-size-fits-pretty-much-everybody (they're 61"" x 65"") assorted colored polyethylene hooded ponchos in the car, another in your backpack, a third in your coat pocket or purse. They're thin, emergency-type protection and come folded up in a packet about 3"" x 5"" x 1/2"" thick. 8).Candles...You will survive with this Survival Candle, a 3-wick burner made of soy and palm wax in a 3-1/8"" diameter 2-3/8"" tin can with a lid.

Very accurate(adjustable 3 dot competition sights), fit and finish is great and it's a smooth shooter with a good trigger. Gun is LNIB and comes with both factory mags.

This semi-auto gun is about 50 years old and in remarkably good shape for it's age and use (No, it hasn't been shot to death). It has been thoroughly cleaned and tested for function. It works. The feed latch is secure. This is a common complaint about the 1100s not wanting to feed or complete the firing cycle. It has pressed checkering on the stocks that is not beat up. There are some pressure dents, but none are severe and if you want to remove them, a wet towel and a steam iron should do the trick. There are no scratches or gouges in the wood. There are two or three very small places where rust was, but have been cleaned and are hard to see. The bluing is not worn and there are no dents or dings in the metal surfaces. 

Price is $400.00 picked up in midtown Houston, or I will ship to your FFL for $35.00. I'll entertain offers and trades. Please don't be offended if I decline to accept your offer.

The rifle is in great condition, and shoots great. Barrel rifiling is strong. I have 40 rounds of factory ammo specially designed for the Garand, and 6 enbloc clips. Really fun to shoot, functions flawlessly, and a great piece of history to own.  I will not ship. Face to face transactions only. May consider trades, but prefer to sell.

A little history, these rifles were American GI rifles that were sold to the Danes after the war. Many of these rifles like this one were restocked and re-barreled by the Danes. The Danish VAR barrel is known for its accuracy and is highly desirable among M1 Garand shooters."

First, is the Charter Arms undercover, weighing in at a scant 16 oz.  Comes with a Tyler T-Grip, barami hip grip, and an extra spurless hammer, this pistol represents an awesome deal for an easy packing self defense pistol.  $225

Next, you have a matching Charter Arms Pathfinder, weighing in at ~17 oz.  This pistol makes an excellent trainer for the Undercover as the frame is exactly the same.  In addition it is a superb kit gun for the backpacker/fisherman.  It has adjustable sights, double/single action, and a six round capacity.  $275

These were both manufactured in the late 70's and this was the heyday of Charter Arms when they were first manufacturing them in Connecticut.  The build quality is excellent and hasn't been matched by the company since.  

Buy them both for $450.  Again, check gunbroker.com to verify that you are getting an awesome deal on these two revolvers.

Everything you need to build a quality AR well under the $500 threshold depending on which lower receiver you buy.  An Anderson lower receiver will cost you $43 in Bixby.  If needing someone to build it, my gunsmith will charge a $25 flat rate fee, so for $463 out-the-door you can have a good reliable AR for $463 ((or $438 if you can do it yourself)) that already has the backup sight and MOE stock.   (then it's optics and rails to choose, I figured I'd leave that up to personal choice) 

The stock PSA kits will run you $389 without the better stock and upgraded LPK on their website.  Only reason for selling this off is I decided to downsize.  $395 is firm no trades, and only seriously interested buyer with a good phone number.

If you are reading this, it's available.  Great Father's Day gift for yourself or ??"

M92 454 Casull Stainless

I love this rifle, but I have decided to down-size.
This is a beauty! I have never seen one like it.
Accurate, Hard Hitting, Versatile- from 45 Long Colt Light Loads to full-house 454 Casull.
Did I mention it is Beautiful? Smooth Action, Fast Target Acquisition.
Effect on target is always a treat! At 100 yards it effortlessly burned through my 1/4"" steel Gong, but was big fun. At 140 yards I up-ended a 200# Hog.
The 20"" barrel gives opportunity for the 454 Casull cartage to shine. 
Just a great all-around hunting and plinking rifle. That's right, I actually plink with 454.
