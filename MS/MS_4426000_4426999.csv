My grandfather, who served in the South Pacific, brought it back with him when he returned from service.  It lay dormant for many years until two years ago when I had it examined by a gunsmith and fired.  The gun is in good shape considering its age.  There is a small crack in the stock near the bolt towards the top edge.  It didn't affect the firing or cycling of the weapon.  I'd like to see it go to someone who appreciates and will use the rifle.   I also have a sword that it approximately 2.5' long with leather and bamboo sheathing in another list.  I'd be willing to do a package deal for the right buyer.  This too was brought back from the South Pacific."

These were Spanish made and then imported into Germany.. after the war they were surplussed and stockpiled by Russia. THen imported to the US for sale as a plinker or collector.

The factory original ejector cracked on the spur/tooth part. This is a common failing from Russian arsenals replacing parts with softer steel. Needs a new ejector. Will still cycle but jams. Still have the original ejector. Have some tool steel that I was going to machine a new ejector out of but never got around to it and don't have time (will include). Also new ejectors can be ordered online for around $30. Everything else functions like new."

I am currently trying to thin out my collection and move the firearms that literally just sit.
Altogether, I have put somewhere around 300 rounds through this rifle, which has left it in like new condition. It is a piston operated platform and is much, much cleaner to shoot than any of my gas impingement guns. It comes with a nickel boron bolt carrier group and trigger group, which by the way, is extremely smooth. I hate to see it go, but again, I just don’t shoot it and could really use the money to fix the intake manifold in my VW (dealership fees…grrr).
I just went into Everything Weapons in Franklin to see what this exact rifle goes for new and they had them listed for $1,699. Make me an offer and lets make something happen. I have recently gotten into cerakoting, so if you like the rifle but black isn’t your color, I’ll coat it at cost (after you have purchased the rifle).
To sweeten the pot a bit, I am going to include a Redi-Mag (~$80), which I cerakoted black to match the rifle. In addition to that, I am going to leave the AAC Muzzle Brake (~95) which helps to mitigate recoil and muzzle rise. Both mods come with the gun and are both good looking, and functional.

Rifle is in real good shape with just the usual used gun dings and small scratches in the wood/metal. When I bought it someone had literally ""ground"" the diopter sights off front and back to fit a regular scope mount. I just happen to have a set and I put them on the rifle with silicon glue. That way they can be ""popped off"" in an instant if not wanted or put back on temporarily (see pics for full illustration).The back sight I didn't ""pop off"" because the silicon glue has held it on so well but it can be removed with a little work. A regular scope ring set would then work okay otherwise high mount scope rings to go over the rear sight should work. These diopter sights could be affixed more permanently with devcon/liquid steel or welded like originally done without doing any damage to the rifle. The rifle has a front barrel band sling mount. Included is one 5 rd. and two 20 rd. mags. Rifle has not been shot that much. A low serial # of 29xx for dating. Everything in the pics is what goes with the rifle. Thanks for looking. Capt. John."

This is a modern remake(not a replica) of John M. Browning's original design.  It is a real pleasure to shoot, and for a 45/70, it's very manageable.  I even worked up some light loads that I can recommend.  The bore is a mirror, nothing is worn.  I've only shot cast lead bullets out of it for the last 30 rounds.  The rifle was nearly unfired when I got it.  Comes with the soft case.  I do have a bunch of reloading stuff for it, minus projectiles.  I also have a lee loader kit, so you can reload in the field without having to use a press.  The extras I'll throw in for $150.  The price is firm, I will not lower it at all as these go for over $1000 all day long.  I am willing to take a part trade, but understand that the trade will need to be in my favor.  I wont take advantage of you, but I'm not going to just let this one go out of desperation.  I'm in Tenino, and would prefer to meet somewhere close.  If I do need to drive, that's fine, but know that I'll want some reasonable reimbursement for my time and gas."

    The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 AUTO offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands.

I'm sick and tired of these low life scam artists stealing people's pictures and trying to steal money from honest people. Before you even waste your time contacting these people, look at their listings and photos. Go on Gunbroker.com. If that same photo in their listing is also in gunbroker, it is very likely they are scam artist. Flag the posting right away and do us all a favor

You can also look at the listing description, take a few sentences and look it up on google, if google returns that the description from a past listing, highly likely they are scam artists. Also the one thing that screws it up for all of them is that they are lazy, they won't take the time to actually make a good description, sometimes they just put $1 or maybe hardly nothing in the description, those guys did us service that we can easily flag their listing.

These low life POS scam artists use a google phone numbers and some of them have claimed to be from Indonesia and Nigeria. They also have weird emails. Sometimes the name they give you is not a very common American name like ""Bingham"" or some other BS name. Also look at their English grammar, if its bad, they are most likely scam artists

All you scam artists, I hope one day karma catches up to you."

It has a reticle that lights up red and green, and it is crystal clear.  And the reticle itself is etched in the glass, so no worrying about a reticle coming loose or knocked out of position.  I mounted this optic to my 223 REM AR (no heavy caliber use), zeroed it, and fired 50 rounds...that is the extent of use this particular optic has seen.  I sold the black gun this was on, and now it's here for sale.

Receiver, internals, and trigger group all smooth and rust-free: oddly ""new"" looking for the age. Receiver shows minimal finish wear from usage in small areas near chamber/barrel extension area. 
Inside bore is shiny with strong rifling, which happens to be Micro grooved. This rifle is very accurate.
Outside of barrel was painted (?) as previous owner allowed rust to begin forming on outer portion of barrel. It isn't unsightly, but does reflect in price. The remainder of the rifle does not, I repeat, does not show evidence of pitting. I have personally fired this rifle as have my small children. It is a safe, accurate, reliable carbine.
Its too big for my boys, however, any way other than rested. Yours at a good price.
Comes with a sighted-in Weaver 4x6x28 rimfire scope, 100 rounds HV ammo, 40 rounds CCI Stingers.

This one has had some mods to make it a little more useful without breaching into any NFA or AOW territory.  This has become a real issue with the SIG stabilizing braces that many of these were sold with, so this is the best alternative to make this a controllable and usable firearm without getting into any potential grey areas with Uncle Sam.  This is still a pistol according to the BATFE (I can provide a copy of a letter stating that the Stark SE-5 grip is legal as it is an angled-fore grip, not a vertical which would make this an AOW).

The parts list, with retail prices, are:

$500 - Base pistol w/ Yugo Hold-open mag
$20 - Extra Yugo Hold-open mag
$120 - Midwest Industries Rail System
$35 - Stark SE-5 Foregrip
$20 - Hogue AK Pistol grip
$20 - Tapco FDE Polymer Mags (not the greatest mags, but I have had no probems out of them)
$30 - Tapco G2 Trigger
$50 - Manticore Nightbreak Muzzle Device (made a HUGE difference in muzzle rise)
$20 - FDE rail covers
$6 - Tapco retaining plate (makes complete disassembly/reassembly a dream)

Not pictured but included is a $50 UTG Micro Red/Green dot.  Not exactly a high-dollar optic but it definitely makes it easier for newer shooters to use this thing.

As you can see, retail NOT INCLUDING tax or shipping on these items, this entire package is worth almost $900.  I will also include the stock parts (wooden foregrips and plastic pistol grip) in case you want to go back to the traditional look.

The gun has probably had about 500 rounds through it, with no functional issues to report of any kind.  It is a very well made AK with no wobbles or rattles that cheaper AKs can suffer.  The Zastava AKs are some of the best bargains in the AK world.

I am mostly looking for a sale, however I would consider offerings in 308 including PTR-91s or Remington 700s.  Not interested in other trades.  Will take offers on the firearm. Feel free to email or text me at 423-Six seven six-1881"

From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past.

The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability.

You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

I do not have 6mm AI dies so I have only fired 6mm Rem ammo out of it. It shoots very well even with this ammo- about 1/2-3/4"" at 100 yards with cheapo 80 grain softpoints. I do not know the round count but I believe the barrel has plenty of life left. I harvested 2 deer with this rifle on my family farm back in Tennessee. It absolutely flattens them with little meat loss. The rifle will come with 1"" rings and bases as well as a 20MOA base and a remington synthetic stock and the original ugly wood stock as well as a few boxes of fireformed brass and a box or so of federal ammunition. Please contact me for pics. I will work on getting some up soon. Sale price for this one is $550. Buyer pays transfer. NO TRADES

2) Savage Model 12 .204 Ruger- This is a great shooter. I bought it used in Alaska and have had it for a few years. It has a nice cerekote job and the bolt has been microslicked. The rifle shoots sub MOA and is a great varmint gun. It comes with a vortex diamondback 3.5-10 BDC scope and is wearing a nice custom stock. I believe it is manners or McMillan. Price for this one is $750 and I'll throw in some brass and ammo. If my asking price is met I will pay the transfer fee. NO TRADES- contact me for pics until I get some up

3) Savage Model 12 .223- This is a bone stock model 12 wearing a Vortex Diamondback 4-12 BDC scope. I bought it used but I am 99% sure the round count is super low. I have put about 100 rounds through it and it stacks them into 1 ragged hole at 100 yards. So far this thing has shot well under MOA with everything I have fed it from 50 grain Vmax's to 55 gran FMJ's up to 69 grain SMK's. I adjusted the trigger pull to be as light as it can go otherwise nothing has been done to this one. Asking $650 with the scope or $550 without (No I will not sell the scope by itself for $100). NO TRADES contact me for Pics. Buyer pays transfer."
