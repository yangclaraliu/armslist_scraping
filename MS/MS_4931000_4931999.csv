Many extras , 2 extra mags , three total . complete Apex trigger job , trij. night sights.
This kit is a combination of the Apex Tactical Shield Duty/Carry Action Enhancement Kit and the Shield Action Enhancement Trigger.

The APEX Shield Carry Kit Kit (SCK) was designed to provide the M&P Shield pistol owner a smooth, consistent 5 - 5.5 lb trigger pull with the advantages of shorter over-travel and more detectable trigger reset. All of the components work together to provide a pull weight within the acceptable range for a top end, service pistol. The kit itself is engineered to be drop-in and should not require further gunsmithing. However, armorer or gunsmith installation of the USB into the Shield slide is strongly recommended**.

The Shield Action Enhancement Trigger Kit directly replaces the factory hinged trigger with a solid aluminum trigger body. The trigger reduces Trigger pre-travel and over-travel by approximately 20%. It features a flat face with a center mounted pivoting safety. The center mounted pivoting safety bar prevents unintended operation by creating a trigger block that will not disengage unless the shooter places their finger directly on the trigger face. The flat, smooth face trigger causes the shooter to place their finger on the center line of the trigger and encourages trigger manipulation directly in line with the bore axis.
  No Trades , do not waste yours and my time. If serious leave phone #in message .  Also have custom kydex holster for $35."

147,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4931147,For Sale:  Loaded Custom OD Green Tactical Machining AR pattern rifle.,"Riddle, Roseburg, Oregon","$ 1,250","Listed On: Wednesday, December 9, 2015",Rifles,Iver Johnson Arms                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"How loaded?  How custom?

Matched Tactical Machining upper and lower.  If you have never seen Tactical Machining's receivers, they have a finish that is smoother than most and blacker than most.  If you ever wanted your black gun to be black, Tactical Machining is the way to go.  Fit to that is a Fab Defense adjustable ejection port cover that is a perfect match to the Tactical Machining receivers.  The parts inside are CMMG.  The bolt carrier group is an RSM.  The carrier is 8620 and the bolt is 9310.  This is the first 9310 bolt I've ever used.  The carrier and bolt are Nitride black.  I did remove the RSM firing pin retaining pin and replace it with a Colt pin.  The gas tube is a WMD/Spike's Tactical and it is Nitromet black.  The barrel is a 16"" Bergara BB0251 mid-length with a 1 in 8"" twist also Nitride black.  The flash hider is a standard A2 and is mounted with a Primary Weapons muzzle alignment kit, not a crush washer!   The barrel is marked .223 Rem though it is actually cut with a .223 Wylde chamber so it can safely handle higher pressure mil-spec 5.56 ammunition while giving better accuracy than most 5.56 barrels.  You can see the barrel here:  

http://www.bergarausa.com/Store-View.php?id=871

The grip is a Hogue and the selector has been properly relieved to clear the grip without dragging.  The forend is Magpul, as is the rear quick detach swivel.  The QD in the rear allows the two halves to still be separated for cleaning with the sling still in place.  The buttstock is a Fab defense GL-MAG on a Bushmaster receiver extension and it comes with a 10 round magazine.  The rear flip sight is a GG&G A2 style (GGG-1005).  The front sight is an A.R.M.S. (BL-41) which folds up into the traditional triangle shape has the mil-spec front sling swivel properly installed.  You can not buy those with the swivel preinstalled.  It has to be done after mounting.  The sights give a 1/3 lower cowitness through the red dot.  The red dot is a C-MORE Railway with a 4 M.O.A. dot.  Being a C-MORE, you can easily swap out the dot for a different size any time you wish.  With these iron sights it gives a sight picture the same as a C-MORE ATAC, but with the added advantage of having both sights fold completely out of the way!  The furniture and red dot are all olive drab.  

Finally, this gun comes with a generic 1.25"" nylon sling (like the one DPMS sells) as well as a Bulldog lockable floating case and 4 Lancer Systems L5-AWM 30 round magazines, 3 of which are unopened.  The case and magazines are also olive drab.  

Things to know: 

1.  We WILL be doing a background check.  I know the new Oregon law is stupid and I do not agree with it and I do hope it is overturned by the people or the state Supreme Court.  But, the law is the law and I am not going to become a criminal just because you do not want to spend $10 of your money and 20 minutes of your time.  Besides, to be completely honest, I don't want a rifle this nice going to a douchebag.

2.  Don't try to low-ball me.  I'm not price gouging.  I already had one joker tell me he could ""get an AR for $600"".  Not like this one, you can't.  This gun has a $25 grip, $35 handguard, $90 stock, $100 rear sight, $150 front sight, and $250 red dot sight on it!  I'm not gouging on those prices either.  You can look them up yourself, assuming you can even find the parts in green.  Magpul is discontinuing the OD parts, so good luck with that!  That's $650 in upgrades to your ""$600 AR"" and that's not even including that it comes with a sling, case, and 5 magazines!  The 4 Lancer magazines are worth $60 alone!  I know every component in this rifle and I know what it cost to build and what it is worth.  There is no Amazon or eBay junk on this gun and no Chinese copycat parts!  So yeah, don't waste my time.  

The rifle has had 40 rounds through it for rudimentary sight-in and function testing.  The bolt carrier group has had about 200 more rounds put on it in a full auto gun for break in."

Grips made of glass fibre reinforced polymer with corrosion proof metal inserts. Ambidextrous safety with separate de-cocking lever for the hammer. Steel magazine with 12 round capacity. Integrated support rail for aiming units. Open square notch rear sight with contrast points. The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns - yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more. One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1. During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole! Features: Threaded O-ring barrel with polygonal bore profile Match grade trigger One piece machined steel slide Frame mounted decocking lever and separate ambidextrous safety lever Can be carried ""cocked and locked"" in single action mode with the safety lever on Patented HK recoil reduction system Corrosion resistant blued finish Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories Ambidextrous magazine release lever Extended slide release Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator Patented Lock-Out Safety device This is gun is used but is in excellent condition.

I have had a several INOX models over the years and this is the cleanest one I've owned or seen yet with all INOX controls.

I don't need anything, but I may look at trades only if it's a good deal, If it's not a good deal, I will politely pass. Mostly interested in semi-autos(AR's, AK's), but will consider others.  Again, if it's not a good trade offer and your value is not there, please do not offer it, just trying to save everyone some time. About the only want now is an AR-10 like the DPMS Recon G2 or similar and I can add cash or? I would even consider the cheap Sportical model as a straight trade if it comes with some mags, and/or ammo.

Given it being almost a century old and was issued and used by the US Army, it is in pretty good condition.  It retains some of its original war production finish.  I've also fully detail-stripped the gun and can confirm the mechanics function fine.  I've replaced the main spring in order to lighten cocking the hammer and the trigger pull, but I'll include the original main spring with the gun as well.

Included with the revolver are: a WWI-era original lanyard in excellent condition considering its age, a replacement and original mainspring, a replacement and original ejector rod, a cartridge removal tool (for helping to extract cartridges from a moon clip), 10 moon clips, a carrying case, 7 rounds of .45 ACP, and an original 1918-dated leather holster."

Lower: Olive Drab Polymer GWACS CAV-15 chambered in 5.56/.223

Upper: DPMS Sportical Upper with matching olive drab Magpul MOE hand guard and DPMS bold carrier group. This upper is currently sold out most places.

Barrel: 16"" chrome-moly with teflon coating

V2 Mount-n-slot bipod mount (just attach to a bipod)

I'll throw the PMAG magazine pictured and a box of 5.56 ammo. Just add an optic of your choice, and take her shooting! 

 Please email/text me with any questions. $550 or best REASONABLE offer.

I bought the rifle this summer in unfired condition from the original owner. I didn't like the factory brake very much, so I had Lee Baker shorten the barrel to 20"" and thread it for suppressor use. I added the two piece bases instead of the 30 MOA Farrell base that the PO had installed (I'm including that base too). The rifle shoots great, MOA out to 300 (the farthest I seriously shot it), with both factory ammo and handloads, about 80 rounds fired total. I really like this rifle and the caliber, we had great success on an antelope hunt with it this fall. I'll pass along my reloading data too if you are interested in rolling your own. Just raising funds to build an ultra lightweight mountain-style rifle for next season. $600"

Here is the opportunity to purchase a deluxe autoloader with all the features you need to have a reliable, successful day in the field. Its semi-humpback design, which refers to the pistol grip and rear of the receiver area, allows a sure grip for smaller hands. Additionally, the lightweight profile barrel helps pick up the ivory front sight bead very quickly. Shouldering, the grip, sight plane and weight are all critical factors when selecting any shotgun, either for youth and ladies or for adults. The Silver Hunter Micro Midas becomes the only real choice because of its compact and lightweight handling. The finely cut checkering on the grip and forearm also help to better control the gun."

Its a free market.  Let people attempt to get what they want and if someone overpays that's their fault. 

When prices and demand shoot up again are you going to sell your expensive weapons lower amount than you want?  

Armslist is already cluttered with posts (this one included). Please feel free to ignore posts you don't like and do not buy items you think are overpriced

If anyone overpays for a firearm its their business. I urge all people to fully research any weapon before purchase, especially if you're new to firearms. 

I for one have overpaid before and gotten amazing deals.  Buy within your means and have fun.  Don't stress over things you cannot control
