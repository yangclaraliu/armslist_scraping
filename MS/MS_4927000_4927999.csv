The Century AKMS is a U.S. made AK assembled from U.S. parts and a Polish military PMKMS under-folder parts set. With a swap of the pistol grip it can be a near exact copy of a AKMS which is the folding stock variant of the AKM.

These rifles are use a Nodak Spud receiver with the correct dimples, unlike Century Arms' cheaper Romanian under-folders. The quality is very high and the folding stock locks up very tightly.

Caliber - 7.62x39mm.

Receiver - Stamped with correct magazine guide dimples and lightening cuts. The receiver is US Made by Nodak Spud.

Butt Stock - Under folding stamped steel stock with correct dimples, rivets. The stock is functional and not pinned open.

Pistol Grip - Black Composite. This U.S. made grip can be replaced with a red or plum composite U.S. made grip to match the color on the military PMKMS.

Hand Guards - Laminated wood with correct palm swells.

Barrel - Chrome lined with bayonet lug and slant compensator.

Built around Beretta's latest Px4 modular technology, the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact delivers concealed-carry handling with large frame firepower. The Px4 Storm Sub-Compact uses a very reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more compact and lighter weight system. A stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant, perfectly suited for concealment close to active, perspiring bodies. The pistol adapts to different hand sizes easily with the included interchangeable backstraps and an ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. A standard Picatinny Rail allows for an array of aftermarket accessories.

This Beretta comes with the backstraps and its case.  No magazine.

I picked up another 250 and don't need two of them. Had plans to rebarrel but don't feel like messing with it and trying to sell this barrel. Barrel on this is completely fine and has less than 400 rounds on it. It was shooting 52 gr amax at .3s to .5s all day and 40gr Winchester value packs around .75 or better. The stock has a few marks from use but nothing crazy. I am the original owner and this has been maintained extremely well. Id expect many more rounds down the tube and hate to rebarrel it and waste a good barrel with lots of life left. This gun is a pleasure to shoot and its taken me a couple months to decide to list it. If it sells great but If not I'm not going to be upset. The rings and base in the picture are not included. 

I'm asking $750.00, and will ship for actual cost to a dealer with an FFL. Any questions just ask. I am willing to swap barrels with either a .308 if someone is wanting to do the same. Must be in same condition or better. I'm also willing to sell just the barrel for $250 if anyone is interested."

IMO it is in great shape for the age.  According to the serial number it was manufactured in early 1890.  It is a good shooter or great wall hanger(or both)!  There are some nicks and scuffs on the stock as could be expected.  I cannot find an inspectors cartouche but a VERY faint circle P is behind the trigger guard.  There is NO rust that I can see on the metal.  It has a very nice mottled look.  The bore is bright and shiney with maybe a little pitting from the black powder.  It is the cleanest barrel I have seen for a trapdoor.  It has the BUFFINGTON rear sight calibrated for the rifle. Any questions please feel free to ask.  I am by no means an expert but I will try to answer your questions.  There is a small defect in the stock by the very front.  There is no cleaning rod either.  Outside of that it is good.  After all, it is 130 years old! Thanks for looking.."

Based on the Old West stagecoach guard’s weapon of choice.
Stoeger Coach Guns are short and handy and pack a potent punch. Originally developed as traditional, double-trigger models for Cowboy Action Shooters, this single-trigger model with gold-plated trigger not only provides a competitive edge but will also serve as an effective home security gun.
It is chambered for 2.75” and 3” shells. It has 20"" blued barrels with extended chokes, with traditional satin-finished walnut stocks. Features a blued finish with a corrosion-resistant, stainless steel receiver. The butt stock and beaver tail fore-end steps up to AA-grade American walnut with border-point checkering, and sports a recoil-reducing rubber butt pad. It comes with an engraved receiver, 3 chokes (1 full, 1 modified, 1 improved cylinder), choke wrench and a box.
Less than 100 rounds through the gun and it is safe kept. Price is $375. Cash only and only serious LOCAL buyers please."

Got a great Black Friday deal on it, so I’m passing that on. One range trip (today) with 80 rounds fired (60 FMJ and 20 JHP, with zero hiccups), and It’s a real shooter. I’m not, but photos show what even I am capable of with it on a 2 1/2” circle at 5 yards. I simply prefer all-steel pistols; the LH9 is aluminum-alloy framed, and does have a little heft to it (about 26 ounces), but it’s just not my cup of tea. With the 13-rd mag, even though my pinky is on the grip, it just doesn’t feel comfortable; with the 15-rd mag, though, the grip is excellent.

These things are like white elephants these days. Why??? Because people that have them keep them. these are not just varmint guns. these guns have the ability to pierce a deer's scull at 150 yards without ""Popping the top"" and destroying the trophy. no body shots and chasing your prey for miles. throwing away 10, 15 pounds or more of good venison due to bone and bullet fragmentation. and no bullet pass though

Some calibers more of interest than others but let me know what you have and your bottom dollar. I will not haggle, sorry.  I'll be interested or not without any hard feelings intended or felt.

Being honest up front.  I'm looking for some better deals on nice to pristine 700 short action BDL (only) rifles and thought someone may need the cash. Not looking to rip anyone off so I'm saying up front I am looking for lower, cash prices.

The 700 BDL..........has a wood stock, no butt pad unless on a 6.5 or 350 Rem mag from the late 60s, a Black fore-end tip and sling swivels.  NO plastic or synthetic stocks are of interest.

My interest lies within those with NO prefix letter before the serial number to those with  A, B and C prefix numbers only.  I will pay extra for any with original DUPONT (printed on the box) factory boxes in super shape.

The 300 price listed is just something I stuck in there since it requires something for a price. There are versions that exist that I would pay 700 dollars for in good condition and more for as new in original box.  ***added due to ""haters"" reading into this something other than I am saying......whom by the way, is now blocked from my email.  I've no time for dealing with such and nothing will be gained by it. Anyone wishing TOP dollar is welcome to list their rifle in gunbroker in an auction...where I buy most of mine. I've no problem bidding on such, this is simply an option for those wishing to move something without hassle, and is local.  I apologize if it appears otherwise to some. People see what they want to see......then stop looking.***

Let me know if interested and hopefully you can send me photos.  Cannot drive long distances. I am located South of Plymouth.

God Bless you and yours!! (even the haters)."

No box or paperwork, but obviously not shot much and no holster wear. The magazines are both 12-round holders and both have the curved finger base.

Very very hard to find this Generation 3 in a 97+% finish, so better act fast! I am asking $475 including shipping to the lower 48.

I can accept cash, check or USPS money orders, but gun will not ship until check clears. Not available to any state with 10-round magazine limits, know it is legal to own where you live before you buy it! Must send me your FFL certification to ship to, and if your FFL will not accept a transfer from a non-FFL holder, add $30 to have my FFL ship it.

First emailed ""I'll take it"" gets it, with payment plan and let me know if additional pics are needed.

EOTech OPMOD Holographic Weapon Sights are an exclusive holosight design available only from OpticsPlanet! In conjunction with EOTech, we are pleased to present two exclusive holo sights, offered under the OPMOD (OpticsPlanet MODification) label. The EOTech OPMOD Holographic Sights w/MOA Dot combine input from our customers - military, law enforcement and shooting sports enthusiasts alike - with the expertise of the world premier L3 EOTech Engineering and Marketing Teams. These holographic gun sights have been carefully tailored to the highest performance standards. Being end-users ourselves, we understand the rigors and abuses that firearm sighting equipment must withstand day in and day out. OPMOD Limited Edition Holosights maximize functionality, ergonomics, and reliability in any adverse condition.
The OPMOD EOTech Water Resistant Sight offers instinctive two-eyes-open shooting with a transversely mounted 123 battery, and a 7mm raised base offering a lower 1/3 co-witness with iron sights. OPMOD EXSPS-2 L3 Eotech red dot scopes (EXPS stands for Extreme-XPS HWS) feature easily accessible side buttons and a single quick release throw lever for easy and instant attachment and removal.
Similar to EOTech XPS-2 red dot sights, OPMOD EXPS-2 sights are smaller than Eotech N-cell battery red dot sights such as their popular EOTech 550 Holosight. The OPMOD red dot sight has a shortened base that only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space, compared to the 4 inch N battery sights. L3 Eotech OPMOD EXPS-2 Sight features two reticle options: 0 - a 65MOA circle with 1 MOA aiming dot (EXPS 2-0 OPMOD sight)"

•	Is at the time of possession serving a term of imprisonment in any correctional or detention facility;

•	Has been found incompetent, and not subsequently found competent; or
•	Has been found guilty except insane.

Arizona also prohibits any person who was previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult, from possessing, using or carrying a firearm within ten years from the date of his or her adjudication or release or escape from custody if the person was previously adjudicated for an offense that, if committed as an adult, would constitute:

Private Sales of Guns in Arizona
Arizona has no law requiring a background check on the purchaser of a firearm when the seller is not a licensed dealer, although no person may knowingly sell or transfer a deadly weapon to a prohibited possessor. All sales are also subject to Arizona’s age restrictions. Arizona has no other laws regulating the manner in which guns are sold. 

Arizona prohibits a person from knowingly possessing a firearm if the person:

•	Is at the time of possession serving a term of imprisonment in any correctional or detention facility;
•	Is at the time of possession serving a term of probation pursuant to a conviction for a domestic violence offense or a felony offense, parole, community supervision, work furlough, home arrest or release on any other basis;
•	Is an undocumented alien or a nonimmigrant alien traveling with or without documentation in this state for business or pleasure or who is studying in this state and who maintains a foreign residence abroad, subject to certain exceptions;

•	Has been found incompetent, and not subsequently found competent; or
•	Has been found guilty except insane.

Arizona also prohibits any person who was previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult, from possessing, using or carrying a firearm within ten years from the date of his or her adjudication or release or escape from custody if the person was previously adjudicated for an offense that, if committed as an adult, would constitute:
•	Burglary in the first degree;
•	Burglary in the second degree;
•	Arson;
•	Any felony offense involving the use or threatening exhibition of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument; or
•	A “serious offense.”"

The shortest of the non-NFA models with a removable muzzle device, the PWS MK216 Rifle is perfect for those wanting to suppress their MK2 rifle. The MK216 is designed for a multitude of uses and retains lethal capability out to 800 meters with varying types of ammunition.

The PWS long-stroke piston system combines the agility of the AR-15 with the reliability of the AK-47 into a sleek and efficient design.

the four position adjustable gas block restricts gasses, rather than venting them from the side. This allows the unused gas to exit from the front of the gun, rather than the sides of the gas block, resulting in a more quiet operation.

A floating piston head, detachable for charging handle replacement, is attached directly to the operating rod, which in turn is securely attached to the carrier.

With only one moving assembly, the PWS long-stroke piston system offers a lighter recoil impulse, while at the same time providing increased longevity and durability.

  Made in 1943 and refurbished sometime after the war,  this rifle has seen action for sure, it has a couple arsenal stock repairs that prove it. All matching parts including scope. Awesome bore, awesome shooter, was able to keep a 2"" group at 100 yards with my terrible shooting. I also reached it out to 600 yards at a steel silhouette and it did pretty well at that.  I'm sure someone more capable will be able to squeeze more accuracy out of it.
  I love this rifle,  but it's a duplicate so I don't have a need for it anymore.
