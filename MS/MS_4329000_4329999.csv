From my personal collection. This is one of the last SKS's produced by the famous Jainshe Arsenal Code /26\ with the bakelite® handguard (commonly referred to as the ""French-tickler"" handguard).

SKS - Type 56 - Never Fired. Basically this is a NEW rifle. Mfg. in 1979 OR 1980, the wood is in perfect condition. The fact that there has never been a round sent down range from this gun means it is in absolute 100% working condition. It has a blade type bayonet. 

This SKS is a real nice piece of firearms history.

Reliable security measures a rugged 1/4"" thick steel body provide massive resistance to all manner of attack. An honest fire rating gives peace of mind. Heavy duty protection is ever present with a Browning Pro Series Home Safe Deluxe safe.These new Pro Series safes have been designed with the home in mind. Elegant colors and finishes compliment any homes decor and MAX Locking Bolts combine with durable fire ratings to make them as functional as they are beautiful. Three sizes are available to secure jewelry, heirlooms, documents and other valuables.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEMThe Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.DPX STORAGE SYSTEMIncludes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access. Pouches and pockets organize other valuables.DPX SCOPE SAVERWith the Scope Saver, long guns with optics now fit on the DPX rack without taking up space inside the safe body. The optics are also protected from the bumpsand dings of guns going into and out of the safe.MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTSMAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. Browning ProSteel designed most of their Locking Systems utilize a cam and linkage system that diverts pounding and prying forces away from the lock.HARDENED PIN LOCK PROTECTIONThe heart of a safe's securty is its lock, and that's why all Pro Series safes feature Hardened Pin Lock Protection. The lock is protected by two 1/4"" hardened steel plates and features four 1/4"" hardened steel pins designed to deflect or break drill bits during a drilling attack.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.BROWNING PRO SERIES HOME SAFE DELUXE 12 DIMENSIONSExterior Dimensions [HxWxD]: 30""x31""x22""Cubic Feet: 12Weight: 575 LBSLocking Bolts: 6 MAX Bolts, 4 SidesSECURITYBody Thickness: 1/4"" SteelDoor Type/Thickness: 1/2""Locking System: Force DeflectorLocking Bolt Size: 4""x 1"" MAX Locking BoltsLocking Bolts Side Coverage: 4-8 MAX Locking Bolts on all Four SidesLock: UL Listed Mechanical, Electronic, or BiometricLock Protection Feature: Hardened Pins & RelockerFIRE PROTECTIONInsulation Thickness [Door & Body]: 2""Fire Seal: Triple-Fin PalusolFire Rating, NEW ThermaBlock: 1680F/100 MinutesAPPEARANCEHinge Caps: DecorativeInterior: FabricHandle: 5-Spoke, PolishedFinish: Automated Grade Gloss Finish in Five ColorsCONVENIENCE180 Degree HingesLED LightingElectrical OutletStorage Solution: DPX Door Storage SystemAxis Accessories Included: Jewelry Box, Drawer, File Box, & Fill Plate"

Check out this rifle on GunBroker, its going for $800 and that is what I paid for it brand new on special order.  I have fired 9 rds thru it. Rifle has Accu-Trigger, deep blue finish, laminated  hardwood thumb-hole stock, knurled bolt knob, polished steel magazine floor plate, and I installed Burris Xtreme Weaver/Picatinny type scope mounts. One tiny nick in the stock, no other issues. I was going to use this rifle for varmints but I shoot mostly rimfire nowadays so I am going to let this one go. I also have about 300 rds of .243 Varmint and Deer ammo I would be willing to sell cheap as part of the deal. Buyer must be MD citizen and not prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms. I am in Southern MD, will travel as far as Upper Marlboro to meet buyer. Not interested in trades."

This is a high quality factory upper that was professionally built by Seekins Precision. The 10.5"" barrel is Black Nitride / melonite treated which is more accurate and lasts longer than chrome lined. The extremely lightweight 10"" MCSR V2 Keymod rail is $200+ and has a 1.8"" inside diameter to accommodate suppressors. The Seekins adjustable gas block is over $60 alone and offers you complete tuning capabilities (see below).

This is an awesome package and it is brand new, never fired, $500 cash. Or I might trade for a decent 1911, S&W .357 or larger caliber revolver, NIB Glock if I like the model, CZ or other quality pistol or revolvers, Mossberg SPX, AK, Mini 14, or ?

From the manufacturer:
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block lets you to fine tune your rifle's gas system for smoother cycling and operation. Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability.
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block.
Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes.

The MCSR V2 rail is comfortable, extremely light weight modular rail system that will work in any situation as well as comfortably fit a suppressor inside the rail. The MCSR V2 was designed to make using a quick mounted suppressor easy to install or remove while inside the rail.
The MCSR V2 rail is designed so that the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions will accept all keymod accessories and have two anti-rotation QD positions per side (6total). The internal dimension has increased to 1.8"" to accommodate most suppressors on the market."

I normally charge $20 as a processing fee to do a transfer. I am dropping that price down to $10. So the total would be $20. That is $10 for State Police and $10 as the processing.

I can't tell you much. In the late seventies I made maybe a half dozen similar pistols from CVA kits and sold them. Two of these I hand filed to octagon to round barrels. As I recall, I shortened the barrels and stocks on all of them. I never liked long pistols. I believe I reset the barrel lugs where the front lock bolt would secure the barrels. The nose cap is poured pewter. The inlayed rings in the barrel are brass. Not gold.The silver wire was from pure silver, and I still have some of it. Been a long time. As to value, I would not know what to say. These are all pre-1980, and all were percussion. I did not make the box that one is in. Thank you. That brings back fond memories.

Has all the features of a classic S&W revolver like a pinned barrel, hammer mounted firing pin, pre MIM parts and of course its pre lock. The 2"" barrel paired to the round butt frame is one of the desirable and less common pairings, most are on a square butt frame. Was rated in its day for beyond the modern equivalent of +P. Comes with a HKS speed loader, new ambi IWB/OWB soft holster and a 40rd box of Remington SJHP. Makes a great addition if your a collector or it still makes a excellent EDC gun.

The ""Taurus Judge®"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target.

The Model 597™ is easily the most advanced autoloading rimfire rifle ever built, and the most technologically advanced breakthrough in autoloading rimfire rifle technology in 35 years. The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy.

Of course, we didn’t stop there. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597™ all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot “hold open” magazine feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine.


Key Features:
•Bolt-guidance system features twin, tool-steel guide rails
•Sear and hammer are Teflon®/nickel-plated for crisp, smooth trigger pull
•Non-glare matte finish
•Adjustable big game iron sights
•Patented drop-out staggered-stack, detachable 8 Shot Mag.
•Last-shot ""hold open"" bolt for added safety
•Unique attachment system rigidly joins barrel to receiver for perfect alignment and enhanced accuracy
