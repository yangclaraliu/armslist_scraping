I don't know what has happened to this site but it use to be a good place to meet people and buy a firearm for a good deal. Now you have no idea who you are meeting to buy or sell to. I also have a neighbor who is an ATF agent and he told me last night that ATF was going to clean it up this summer and start conducting buy stings. He also told me that 70% of the guns on here are STOLEN and Armslist has turned into a haven for criminals in the Charlotte and surrounding city's. I think its a shame that the good people are gone for good from this site and pretty much all that's left are a bunch of IDIOTS SCAMMERS AND SCREWBALLS!!!!!!!!!!!

I could easily lie and tell you it's new and you would never know the difference. This gun retails for around $850 if not more. So I am looking for $650 cash 
 Here is the details on this gun:
USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."

I have a couple of optics up for sale. Both are in pristine condition with no problems whatsoever. 

1. Burris AR-536 w/Extension 
This Optic is unbelievable. I hate to get rid of it, but it need something else for a tournament that I have coming up. This optics has 5 settings of brightness, 5 on Green and 5 on Red. It is an MOA scope that has and can easily be adjusted distance, wind, and elevation. This is probably one of the best scopes that I have ever used in the $450-$500 range of scopes. It is extremely clear, parallax is very easy to correct and I have never had a problem zeroing it in. If you need help on how to dial this scope in, just let me know, but it's such a great scope that even a novice will be able to dial it in and start shooting 1 MOA or better from 100 yards and 1.5 MOA or better from 150 yards. This scope has only been owned by myself, I am a Captain in the United State Marine Corps, and has been well taken care of. I have never dropped any of my AR-15's with the scope mounted nor will I ever. I paid $410.00 for this scope about 8 months ago, it has been used in tournaments only and has only been mounted on one gun (pictured). I am looking to get a Leupold HAMR and those are around $1200, so I need to sell this optic in order to purchase a new optic. I am looking to get $325 for this scope, I think it is a very fair deal, I have the box somewhere and if I can find it, I will give it to you, however everything that was in the box is sitting right here. $325. Call me to buy it. You will love it. 

2. The other optic that I am selling is a Vortex Strikefire II. I haven't mounted this optic all but one time but I have never taken it to go shooting. If you have heard the about this optic, you will know that this is one of the best Red Dot MOA optics that you can buy on the market today. Same with this scope, you can dial it in very easily, I just haven't had time to do mine. Optic will come with the original box, I just bought it from Turner's a month ago, and they are very strict about their return policy with optics. I am looking to get $165 for this scope since it's brand new. 

Should you decide that you want both of them, I will sell them both as a package and give you better pricing. Give me a call or text, please do not block you phone number. I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have, otherwise these optics will sell themselves, and I promise you they will go quick. 

Thank you for looking,

Daniel Defense Lite Rail III 12.0‚Äù (Rifle length) free float hand guard. I bought this rail used, so I don‚Äôt have the box. However, the rail is in good condition. It has minor mounting marks visible in the pictures, but other than that it is in great shape. No bends. Comes with FDE and black rubber rail covers. There is enough FDE to cover the whole rail, but I am not sure if there is enough black. The barrel nut started to wear through on the threading, so I contacted Daniel Defense and they sent me a brand new one.


This rail has treated me well, we‚Äôve just grown apart and I just think its time that we went our separate ways. I‚Äôm open to different types of payment, but I suppose I prefer Paypal. As long as it doesn‚Äôt feel super sketch, it should be okay.


Need more pictures? You got it. But keep in mind I go to school and have two jobs. I try to reply as timely as I can.
Have a question that wasn‚Äôt answered here? Ask me, no problem.
My price isn‚Äôt in your wheelhouse? Let me know, I try to be fair.

Daniel Defense Lite Rail III

- 12‚Äù Rifle length

- Free floating

- Black

- FDE and black rail covers (not enough black to cover the whole rail).

- Brand new barrel nut

- Barrel nut bracket to mount the rail

- 4 bolts to do the mounting

- Brand new Daniel Defense wrench

- Hex wrench for the 4 bolts

- Free shipping



A few things to be aware of:

- I‚Äôm not particularly interested in trades, however, I never say never. 

- Asking $270 shipped. 

- The ID is pretty small, not a lot of clamp on gas blocks fit under this rail, that being said Daniel Defense makes a clamp on gas block that fits wonderfully under it. 

- I have personally tested SLR rifleworks adjustable clamp on gas block, and it does not fit. The set screw version fits uncomfortably close. 

- In case it isn‚Äôt obvious, you‚Äôll need to remove your current stock/barrel nut to install this rail. 

- There are minor mounting marks that are visible in the pictures.

- There isn‚Äôt enough black rail covers to cover the whole rail, only FDE.

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles. Simple rugged Garand-style action with breech bolt locking system, a fixed-pistol gas system and self cleaning moving gas cylinder gives unparalleled reliability under harsh operating conditions. Heavy , hammer-forged barrel for extra rigidity and accuracy. Accurate sighting system with ‚Äúghost ring‚Äù adjustable rear aperture sight and a protected, non-glare post front sight. Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings. Eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field. Flat, rifle-style butt pad for recoil reduction.

The short grip frame is noticeably thinner from the backstrap to the trigger and it incorporates the Glock Rail. It has an ambidextrous magazine release. The redesigned magazines will function in both designs, but the old magazines don't have the necessary cut out in the front of the magazines to function in the redesigned weapon.

There are a couple specs of dust on the barrel in these pics, they are not imperfections. It is new and is a beautiful gun. The bolt carrier group is the coveted high quality, long life Nickel Boron BCG. The 16"" barrel is a 1 in 9 twist and the upper and slotted quad rail forearm is a monorail which is desired for great accuracy. It is also free floating to help with accuracy as well. You can also see the full bull barrel through all of the slotting and it looks great along with the color matching BCG. The new charging handle is in FDE and contrasts well also with the matching rail covers. The fully adjustable stock, pistol grip, and magazine are aftermarket official MOE Mag-pul. The lower is a new mil-spec Palmetto State Armory, no cheap polymer lower here. It also has a fold-able forward grip with storage compartment. This rifle can shoot either .223 or 5.56, so no worries about your ammo choice. It has a Tasco World Class 3.5x10x50 PLUS scope with new rings. It also has 45 degree flip up iron sights that are push button activated and fold down to stay out of the way when not in use. They are fully adjustable as well. This rifle has been sitting in my egg crate case and is unfired at this time. 100rds of ammo included. Hate to get rid of it but am looking for an extra vehicle. I am mainly looking to trade for an older vehicle or possibly multiple firearms. Pic coming."

It Has Also Been Gently-Used, With Absolutely No Signs Of Holster Wear! The Caliber Can Be Changed To .357 SIG Or 9MM Simply By Installing A Sig Sauer Factory Barrel...No Conversion Necessary! You Just Do A 30-Second Field-Strip, Drop In The Factory Barrel, And Hit The Shooting Range, As The .40 Caliber Magazines Even Work With .357 SIG and 9mm Rounds! You Can Practice With Cheap .40 S&W Ammo At The Range, Then Use The More Powerful .357 SIG As Your Self-Defense Ammunition! It's Like Getting Three Sigs In One, Just By Buying Two Extra Barrels! For Left-Handers, The Mag Release Is Ambidextrous, So Let Me Know And I Will Gladly Switch It Over So You Can Depress It With Your Left Thumb.


The P239 Is One Of Sig Sauer's Most Reliable, Thinnest, And Easiest To Conceal Carry Pistol Sold Today. At Only 1.2 Inches Wide It Fits Wonderfully In All Hands, Large Or Small, And Recoil Is Very Manageable...It Feels As Though You're Shooting A 9mm, Not A Larger Caliber, So This Makes A Great Choice For Both A Carry Weapon And A Home Defense Weapon, As It Is Much Easier For Lesser-Experienced Shooters To Control Than Polymer-Framed (Plastic!) Weapons. Many, Many Police Officers Use The P239 As A Back-Up And An Off-Duty Carry Weapon. The P239 Is Very Versatile As Well, As The Caliber Can Be Changed By Swapping-Out A FACTORY Sig Sauer Barrel In Either .357 SIG Or A 9mm! Again, It's A Great Choice For Either Carry Or Home Defense, As The P239 Is A Compact Weapon That Shoots Like Its Full-Sized Cousins! Sig Sauer Quality Is One Of The Best In The Weapons Industry...It's The Rolls-Royce Of Pistols! I Assure You That You'll Not Be Sorry That You Bought A Sig Sauer!

The Price On The Weapon Is $595 FIRM, Including Two Extended Magazines With The Kits Included To Make The Magazines Flush With The Grips If You Prefer). 

Buyer Pays Actual Shipping To A FFL Only...It Should Be @ $25-$30 Max To The Lower 48. Post Office Money Order Is Only Method Of Payment.

The action is smooth and it shoots beautifully. The Remington 721 is a classic this one dates to 1953, it has the ZZ on the receiver on the left hand side of the gun. The Redfield scope is a 3x9 vintage scope with Denver stamp on the eye piece. I have seen similar scopes selling on places like e-bay for $250.00 plus dollars.  The Remington 721 in 300 H&H is scarcer, fewer of them were made and is harder to find than the 30-06 or 270. I am willing to discuss trade I hunt and fish and do a lot of outdoor writing, and I also am interested in tactical guns and equipment and pistols as well. I am willing to discuss part trade and part cash as well.  I have seen this rifle selling nationally starting at $675.00 for the rifle itself to $975.00. The scope I believe adds a lot of value to this gun and its condition is really great, I would say excellent plus. If you would prefer to text my number is REDACTED."

I fired 5 of the twenty Federal to make sure they fed without any issues, and they did. Also included is a talon grip wrap, which can be easily installed.

Price for everything above is $525. Just the gun and what it originally came with $475.00. These prices are firm. Must have Nevada I.D. and I would greatly prefer CCW.

As you can see, there is over $1100 dollars worth of upgrades on this rifle. Also, this model of AR-15 is not the crappy ""sport"" model offered by S&W.

So, you're getting almost $2600 dollars worth of stuff for $1300 obo. Please don't offer me 900 for all of this. It's a ridiculous deal as it is.
I would be willing to sell the scope and rifle separately, I would take 1000 for the rifle and I'll still throw in the free ammo. The price is negotiable, Please feel free to call or text anytime, day or night: REDACTED"

I have a synthetic stocked handi rifle in 45/70 caliber. I bought this years ago when I thought I was going to be doing some hog hunting. It never happened, so it lived a short life as a truck gun, then was retired to the gun safe. 
When I last had it out (3 years ago) I went through 22 rounds.  20 of them fired, 2 had light primer strikes.   The 20 that went off were 405 grain lead, the two that didn't were shorter 300 grain rounds. I haven't had the gun out to try since. 
Now, this could indicate that the hammer spring is weak, it could mean that the firing pin didn't go down far enough to hit the shorter rounds solidly, it could mean that the gun is ammo picky, or it might just need disassembly and cleaning in the firing pin channel. I don't know which it is, but as I had that problem last time I have to sell this as-is, and cannot 100% guarantee function with all ammo. 
It's in good, but not great shape. It's like shooting a shoulder mounted howitzer with 500 grain loads, and ammo is spendy if you don't hand load. 
It comes with 38 rounds of ammo, which if you bought it from bi-mart or similar would run you roughly $70.  
Trying to price this fairly due to the 2 failures to fire 3 years ago."
