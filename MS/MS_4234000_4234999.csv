This one is close to 100 years old. It was supposedly manufactured some time in the late 19-teens or early 1920s, It is not made of Damascus steel, so modern loads are fine. The fact that I am only asking $200 tells you a lot about its condition. It would probably score out as good condition, but it does have some minor pitting in the bore and the stock was repaired with epoxy resin. I'm going to call it fair condition to avoid arguments. It is certainly suitable for fun at the range."

The fact is these guns have increased in value year over year and will continue to do so. If you would like to sell your preban tec 9 to me for $400.00 please contact me- I will make a great margin.

I modified this rifle replacing the Magpul MOE buttstock with a Mil-spec Magpul ACS stock. I also took out the factory trigger and put in a Geissiele SSA-E trigger one of the best triggers on the market. The rifle shoots perfectly and has about 150 rounds through it. I also added Knight's Armament micro front and back iron sights. The same ones used by the USMC. The rifle also comes with a magpul sling. I also took off the factory grip and replaced it with a magpul grip. There are no physical deformities the rifle is basically factory new. 

Rifle will also come with 5 magpul P-Mags

It also comes with two pocket holsters, an ambidextrous IWB custom kydex holster and the newest model Alien Gear IWB holster! The Alien Gear holster is left handed but the company will replace it with a right handed model if you call them!

I bought this pistol after reading a bunch positive youtube review on it (Nutnfancy, Sootch, GunsAmerica, GunBuyer, Bangswitch ect.) It is an awesome import of the Tokarev33 type pistol. Ive put 2 boxes for 9mm Winchester white box through it. It shoots awesome, feels awesome, handles awesome. 1911 style pistol.

Maybe 100 rounds through the barrel. Great handgun – has been my personal concealed carry gun for the last three years!  The spurless hammer is great for concealed carry - no exposed hammer to snag on clothing when you need to draw your weapon.  I'm just moving on to something different for my concealed carry handgun - just ready for a change. I love the feel and handling of the SP101. In fact I just bought another one with a longer barrel and exposed hammer to keep around for a target handgun. Great gun - I just don't need this one anymore for a concealed carry.

Like new very little round count. Its a Dan Wesson what more can I say.

As it comes from the factory, DW Box and two magazine box books all the goodies and I will throw in 5 additional magazines. This wont last long.  Bought a DW CCO and no longer need the ECO. Racking on this gun is amazing smooth is butter and no slop.

 Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the Officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability.  We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer. The gun wears Tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide.  The ECO barrel is a flush cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing.  This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring for easier operation and less felt recoil.

 Trigger pull, like all of our 1911’s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson.  The frame is anodized aluminum and features an under cut trigger guard and 25 lpi checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealabilty and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line, DW carry, G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow up shots and recoil control.

If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed.

S&W 340sc AirLite 357 Magnum,  Scandium Frame with a Titanium cylinder  with 2 new, never worn Holsters + larger Hogue Grip. This is not the lower priced PD model. This gray model was designed for the Federal Government and used quite a bit by members of DEA. It was made to meet exacting standards. The black PD model was made cheaper to be available affordably for the civilian market. They are fine apples versus unsweet oranges. 

For Sale or High End Trades considered like HK, S&W 22 revolvers, Gold and 5.56 quality uppers. Maybe something else... surprise me with an offer. Maybe even an HK MP5 or SP89 that I would add toward. 

Scandium is an extremely expensive, rare earth element with only about 10 pounds mined per year going to commercial, non military/aerospace uses.
The 340sc is very hard to find. This one is worth having.
*Will shoot 357 & 38.
A perfect CCW that will never threaten your life with a jam like an auto can. I don't think there is even 20 rounds fired.

Also included is a DeSantis 002-T2 custom OWB two position adjustable holster that's in perfect shape. The pistol has HK night sights front and back and they are crazy bright! Firearm has both a thumb safety and de-cocker. Also, included are four HK barrel o-rings. All manuals, boxes, tools and instructions are included. The firearm is almost mint. It was ""Frog Lubed"" the day I brought it home. I have fired exactly 150 rounds of FMJ through it (no BS) Its an HK so don't even think there was any sort of issue at all! I have polished the feed ramp and barrel till they look like a mirror and am so crazy meticulous on cleaning its not funny. If you have read this far than you know what an HK 45C is and will agree there are thousands of cheaper guns on Armslist. these are not and they are worth every penny, especially this one! I don't need to sell by any means but my safe is getting a little tight and I am starting a 1911 build. I would prefer face to face with a WI CCW holder or with a legitimate ID. The price is the price, $700.00 firm. I just went on line and priced it all at over $1225.00 shipped and that's not the paperwork and transfer fees! Its a fantastic deal! There are some others out there( but not as mint and clean as this one) on Armslist! I have many more hi resolution pictures if you would like to see them just ask. Thanks for looking and have a great day."

It's in nee condition just purchased in Feb 2015. It's been out of the original box twice, with less than 100 rounds fired by the gunsmith who polished the trigger parts and seer. See actual photos of the gun (all are actual pics of this gun, and not downloaded or otherwise edited). 

I have all accessories, and it comes with two extra mags. They're brand new and never used. (VP9 mags cost $45 each). I haven't even had a chance to file the HK lifetime warranty, to the gun is essentially new for you. 

(All photos are of actual equipment, taken on 4/10. Please contact me for more)

I'm selling this handgun (along with a few others) because I encountered the need to liquidate and increase my available cash. I own over 30 handguns, and there are five (now four) that I've never fired. This is a nice one I'd like to keep, but it's also one that helps me reach my goal more quickly. I'd much prefer to keep them all.

I purchased the VP9 two months ago from a local Gun Store. I paid over $835 for the gun (with fees and tax). With the holster and two extra mags (5 total), the total value is just over $1000.00. I know it's a used item, and it's priced that way. It's still essentially the same as it was two months ago, and this is the type of unused ""used"" gun you really hope to find. The slide is milled to a perfect tight fit, and still need to be broken in. 

The COM-TAC Holster is a Flatliner iWB/OWB, kydex model with all heavy duty interchangeable accessories. I own one for all of my carry guns. Since trying one last year before they became one of the bigger high end companies, I haven't purchased another brand. They sell for $100.00-$140 on Amazon, and this one arrived last week (all paperwork, original box/bag, etc included). i like that the Gun Brand and make is forged on the Kydex (see photo). It's new and unused.

As I'm sure you're aware, the VP9 was named Handgun of the year in 2014 by Guns & Ammo and numerous other publications. It was the most highly anticipated 9mm handgun released late last year, and HK is a weapon brand renowned for its precision engineering and durable construction. The VP9's trigger has been met with critic's accolades as one of the best  Stryker Fire Triggers in the industry, and it's a weapon of choice for local LEOs (Pewaukee, Occonomowoc, Waukesha, etc). If you're looking for a GLOCK or HK, I'll assume you know what you're buying, but I provided a quick spec summary below.

It is a 30 round magazine, but I would only load 20 to maintain spring tension.    I believe I am the second owner because of the date on the original owner's receipt that I found in the case.  I purchased it through a ffl dealer in Raymore. 

I noticed some surface rust in the finish and after around 150 rounds I've noticed excessive wear on the upper, it looks like the first owner may not have shot it much because the finish comes off inside the upper when you shoot this MPA.

April 25th - I've put another fifty rounds through it today, the only problem I had was releasing the magazine once when using both hands.

I don't like the amount of play the the magazine has when installed in the gun.
I don't like the play the upper has in the receiver.  I was surprised at my accuracy with it, but that is probably because there is very little felt recoil.

A side cocking upper with pictanny rail is available for around 140 before tax and shipping and MPA makes a carbine upper for this too."

With factory original “Skeet” barrel.  While most Remington 58s are engraved on both sides of the receiver, this upgraded shotgun also has the original gold inlay.  In addition, this “skeet” model has a different comb than the standard grade and includes the Cutts compensator with original chokes, including the sought after scatter choke.

This firearm has been well cared for, it has no cracks or gouges in the furniture.  Included is the original paperwork from the 1960s and 1970s for small parts/repairs.  This shotgun recently was gone through by a Remington Armor / Gunsmith and it functions flawlessly.  The shotgun is vent-rib barrel and dual bead sight.

It is an excellent clay crushing precision shotgun, with the accessories to get you out hunting.  This shotgun has taken a lot of Doves and Quails.

Here is some background on the 58:
“The model 58, sometimes referred to as the Sportsman 58, was the first gas operated Remington shotgun.  It was introduced in 1956, discontinued in 1963.  It used basically the receiver section of the 870, a modified 870 barrel, and somewhat the marriage of the action slide/forend system of a 11-48 recoil operated gun, converted to make it gas operation.  The Remington 58 was made in 12, 16 and 20ga 2 3/4"" chambering plus a separate 12 ga 3"" magnum version.  The barrel sported a ventilated rib, with no plain barrels supplied.  This model only holds 2 rounds in the magazine as the recoil spring is inside the forward end of this tube.
The gas system was not self regulating but required the shooter to adjust the regulator to match the loads used.  This regulator also acts as a magazine cap has a Hi and a Low setting.  This is regulated by twisting the end cap to where the marks line up for Hi or Low. This means that if you are using a ""trap load"", your should use a Low setting, where a heavy duck load is used the Hi setting would be more appropriate.  
Since the complete rear section and receiver were 870 origin, therefore firing pins, extractors, extractor spring and plungers and many of the trigger group parts are the same as for the current model 870.  Operating handles are the same as the model 1100 or the newer 11-87.  Much of the trigger group will be the same as the 1100.  Buttstocks off an 870 will fit as well as the stock bolt and washer.   Forearms will be a problem to find, as any of the newer models do not interchange.  And used 58 forearms come at a premium price.”

To be totally honest, I love the rifle except for the sights, which I hate.  That's the sole reason for selling.  If you plan to attach any type of optic to the machined aluminum rail, you're all set.  You can use the sights, but I'm sort of picky I guess.  I never could get along with them. If you're as picky as me, you'll notice some marks on the flash hider.  I didn't put them there, but they're there.  Otherwise, pretty well as new.

The SIG Mosquito is a blowback-operated, semi-automatic pistol based on the SIG Sauer P226, but 10% smaller in size and chambered for the .22 LR cartridge. The pistol is manufactured with an aluminum-zinc alloy slide and polymer frame. The controls are similar to those present on full-size models and include (from front to rear) a left takedown lever, a left decocking lever, reversible magazine catch and ambidextrous manual safety. In addition, the pistol is provided with an integral safety lock located at the rear of the magazine well which when enabled prevents cycling of slide, hammer fall, and trigger action."

The Bushmaster company sold out in 2006 and as a result the current rifles carrying the Bushmaster name are no where near the quality as before, you can hold my Bushmaster lowers next to new Bushmaster lowers and visibly see the differences in the wall thicknesses and where the new company was trying to save money by making a flimsy product. 
I have built this rifle to shoot 3 gun, there is nothing that needs to be done to this rifle except for you to zero the optic to your eye. I have fired this rifle about 200 rounds, enough to test the different upgrades and tune the rifle.
Here's the list
Bushnell AR223 1-4x First Focal Plane Illuminated optic
Cantilever optic mount
Heavy Recoil Buffer (reduces felt recoil and keeps you on target)
Magpul MOE  FDE angle foregrip
Magpul MOE FDE short vertical foregrip
Magpul MOE FDE Trigger guard
Magpul MOE FDE 6 position buttstock
Magpul MOE FDE pistol grip (rubberized)
Low profile gas block with new gas tube
45 degree flip up back up iron sights
15' Full length free float rail with pronged end cap for corner grip
Timney 3lb single stage trigger
Nickel Boron Full auto bolt carrier and bolt
Titanium firing pin

I have almost $2800 invested in this rifle, the old style Bushmaster rifle  is going for around $1500. I have done a lot of research and I know what works well on the m4 platform, and this rifle shoots very well. If you know what your looking at, you know this is a quality set-up with a lot of money and time invested. If your looking to upgrade and improve your 3 gun game then this weapon system will do it. 

If you did not want the magpul furniture, I could probably lower the price a little.

Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gokun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories.

I'm looking to sell so that I can get into a S&W M&P instead. So the only trade I'm interested in is an M&P 9mm or an M&P Pro 9mm. I might also accept a gun over relatively low value (Mossberg Maverick 88, Sig Sour Mosquito or maybe a Taurus of some kind would all make the list) plus cash.

I bought this shotgun to try and get my wife into the sport... didn't work. My loss, your gain. Shotgun shoots great, fun to shoot and would be a great budget O/U.

The shotgun comes with five chokes and tool. Some quick features of the shotgun are mechanical trigger, ejectors (not extractors), tang safety and barrel selector. It will come with the original box and paperwork. Shotgun has been in a safe since July and has only seen about 75-80 rounds with zero failures. 

Shotgun has some damage to the stock as you can see in the picture. The wood is scratched, so no cracks, breaks, or serious damage. If you plan to put a thicker recoil pad on then more than likely it will be cut off and it won't be on there anymore (so just an option if you're not familiar with refinishing wood). No other damage is on the shotgun. 

If you have any technical questions about the shotgun please refer to the CZ USA website (you'll find your answers quicker).  Other than that, please feel free to contact me. I guess I can only upload one picture now.... contact me for others.

Cycles modern and surplus ammo great. Ive also refinished the stock I bought it a few years back and payed 140 for it and the stock was in awful condition the importer told me that it was a non refurb stock that had obviously seen extensive service and was real beat up covered in dents mud and scratchs so I refinished it in a rusty walnut with tru oil by birch wood Casey and it turned out beautiful. And with the tru oil finish the wood is completely weather proof water just wicks right off of it.  I've probably put around 300-350 rounds through this rifle with no problems whatsoever. It shoots great sights are dead on at 100-300 yards with ironsights. The only reason I'm selling it is because I've got to make some room in the safe for some other rifles. Also I've got plenty of 54r Ammo Available Surplus and commercial if you need any. 

Priced to sell hex recievers will run you at least $250 today so I'm not trying to make a lot off of it just the money and effort I've put into refinishing it. Comes with cleaning kit, oil bottle, ammo pouch, sling and matching serial number bayonet.

Location: Dandridge 
Price: $1200 obo or trade
Trades: Arsenal slr107cr slr107ur slr104ur slr104cr

I am thinking about selling my Saiga 12 imported by legion usa, the gun is very nice and has had alot of work done, I will go over that after I list the items is has since it has been fully converted.

The gun was originally a 4 port gun, however the gas block covered one hole completely, gas block was removed and enlarged, all 4 gas ports were enlarged to be oversized since they were all undersized and not consistent from factory. 

The gun WILL shoot low brass without any issues.

The bolt and carrier have been smoothed in certain areas to allow it to perform better.

I have only used or or two of the magazines, 2 of the 5rd are new and never shot, 2 of the 12rd I've also never shot. You can load all of the mags on a closed bolt with a bit of effort. (If you don't like to the bolt hold open does work though)

Css saiga 12 Quad rail $100
Css performance recoil spring $6
Css Axis pin retaining plate for s12 $8
Css modified bho lever $15

US palm grip $26

Sgm tactical 12rd mags from Css $46 x4
Saiga 5rd magazines $37 x3 (one came with the gun so I can't count that one.

This means I have somewhere right near $772 just in conversion/upgrade parts plus the original cost of the gun.

Around 100 assorted rounds included, including birdshot, 00 military grade buckshot, and slugs.  

The only cons to the gun is that the finish was matched instead of re-coating the whole gun, so it doesn't match perfect, and it's showing wear on the edge of the receiver near the rear trunnion and flaking a bit.

For sale by the Round for $4 per Round, $20 per 5 rounds etc. If you want all 40 I will sell them for $150.  These rounds were made in 1966 in Poland which at the time was under the control of the USSR. 

These rounds contain a incendiary element most commonly Phosphorus and Tetryl which detonate upon impact of a hard target such as steel, and hardend concrete. At temperatures in excess of 5000 Degrees, Then after the incendiary activates the Hardend Penetrator passes through the target. Most commonly made of tungsten or depleted uranium.  They will penetrate 3/4 + inches of milde steel and 3/8 inch Ar500 and 1/2 Ar500 after multiple impacts.

These rounds are extremely powerful and need to be fired in a controlled environment because they will start fires. And if you hit a target that will defeat them they can send frag and ricochets.  EXCERCISE EXTREAM CAUTION WHEN FIRING THESE ROUNDS. 

I've placed adds for other lots of this ammo and it always goes quick.
