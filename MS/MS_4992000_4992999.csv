AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope. Box is not in the best shape.

The reflex sight pictured is not included, if interested in the sight, ammo or mags see my other listings. I will throw in a scope that I have but it needs the proper rings to mount to this rifle. Thanks for looking."

I am the second owner of this 7 shot semi-auto pistol. My friend's mother was the original owner. It's small, slim, and easily concealed in any attire. Perfect for pocket or pocket book carry. It has obvious wear marks from being carried so often but overall it's in excellent shape. I clean and lube it monthly. It has about 100 rounds through it total. 
 It is easy to take apart for cleaning, very simple. It's very fun to shoot for people of any age. It comes with everything seen in the photos below (IWB and Pocket Holster by Uncle Mike's, 100 rounds of Remington hardball and approximately 40 rounds of Winchester carry ammo). Asking $250.00 for all. The ammo alone is a $75 value and the holsters are about a $25 value, that puts the pistol at $150.00 which is a very fair deal for the package."

I'm offering an as new Para Ordnance Black Ops Recon in 9mm for sale. I purchased one of each caliber offered and I've only had a chance to shoot the .45 once in the last 8mo. It was great and accurate. I only put 2 boxes through it. The gunsmith shot the 9mm(3 rounds for safety and function) and said,""That's a very quiet set-up."" Here's the breakdown of what I did with this pair of handguns:
I bought Para OEM Stainless Match barrels and had Ten Ring Precision cut, thread, and fit them to each pistol with a new GI recoil system, barrel bushing, and recoil lugs. (Standard barrels and full length guide rods are sold).The Recon model is a commander length handgun. The 9mm holds 18 + 1. I paid $1199.00/ea for the gun. Bought the match barrel for $175.00, Ed Brown recoil plug $10.00, Wilson recoil spring guide $8.00, Wolff spring $9.00, threading, fitting, and testing $215.00(sold the full length guide rods and barrels for $95). I bought a couple of additional OEM mags $25/ea. $1666.00-$95.00(spring & barrel)=$1571.00 invested in the pistol.
Gun shown with TiRant mounted(suppressor NOT included). I'll ship the pistol to your FFL outside of Texas that accepts from individuals. Within the state with a valid CHL. PP gift preferred or you cover fees. Otherwise, USPS money order.

It can be used with modern 2 3/4 ammunition and it shoots just fine (I recommend using low brass shells). The barrel is heavy and it is NOT damascus steel, it's solid. It makes a great closet/barn gun to keep around just in case, but other than that don't expect to shoot it a lot. It has some life left in it, but she's old. Action locks up tight and the hammer will not accidentally push off. Bore is pretty bad, but not totally awful. It'd make a great wall hanger if nothing else. Still a fully functional single shot shotgun. The only problem is that the hammer spur broke off at some point. I made a new spur but I haven't gotten around to welding or gluing it to the hammer. It is still easy to cock the hammer even without the spur.

The grips have been replaced and should be converted back to
the bakelites for full value, but still has apprised for $1200,
with the grips replaced is a $1400 pistol as is in such perfect shape.
All numbers match and is fully waffen marked and has not been
mishandled nor does it have any pitting.  I am no expert on P38s
but assume this is a Spreewerk.  My granddad got it at the end
of the war in trade from a Russian for American cigarettes.  It
does not appear to have any Russian markings though.  Only the
German waffen markings and matching numbers.

This is a family bring back item, if you know how to get replacement copies
of the bring back papers can give you his info. His personal documents and 
Bible where he kept them are in unknown family members hands.

I have held on to this for a long time and has risen a lot in value over the
last 25 years have owned it.  Our local gun guys wants to take it, buy
a set of the remade Nazi SS officers grips and put on it and stick it in a 
P38 presentation box with an Iron cross and says he can sell it for $1899 
to someone easy.  Not what wish to do here.

I am not offering this for sale, but only for trade for items want as am 
semi disabled and not able to go out and do trades as use to when younger.
Things can enjoy with our family younger members.  This is an item you dare
not let anyone touch or handle.  Wants things we can target shoot with.

Am looking for the following 3 items:

Walter P22 Pistol with target barrel (used ok) Value $350
S&W M&P15-22 .22 LR Rifle (used ok)  Value $365

First person to offer me these items in trade gets this pistol.
It will go up in value year after year and is amazingly accurate
and dependable pistol that has been lovingly well kept for
all these years.  My granddad used this many years to win a 
holiday Turkey at the Turkey shoots each Nov with it.  Is the
only time he would ever fire it as he had enough of war in 
WW2 he said for a lifetime.

I used this gun as my primary concealed carry gun for about two years.  I shot around 1,000 rounds through this gun and have not had one feed/eject problem ever.  I read about problems with some of these guns.  So after I bought it, I took it apart and cleaned it very thoroughly and mirror-polished the feed ramp before I ever shot this gun.  I used mostly Blazer Brass, Winchester, and PMC Bronze 9mm full metal jacket ball ammo for target shooting.  I also put Hornady Critical Defense 9mm hollow points through it as this is my carry ammo.  I added Pearce grip extensions to the magazines and this allows me to get three fingers on the grip.  I added a Crimson Trace trigger guard mount laser (LG-447).  I also like that this gun has a round-in-the chamber indicator, trigger safety, and a thumb safety.  Always carry it ""cocked and locked"" (7+1). It has been a great carry gun.

The Sightron SII Series represents the middle ground of Sightron rifle scopes; they're not quite as feature-packed as the SIII models, but they're not beginner's or bargain scopes like the SI series. The Big Sky series of Sightron riflescopes takes the SII to the next level with fully multi-coated optics and an array of other features. The Sightron SII Big Sky Variable Power Scope utilizes Sightron's unique ExacTrack technology to create an incredibly precise windage and elevation system that is finger adjustable and securely pops back in to the scope when you're not using it. An adjustable objective lens makes it easy to focus your rifle scope, even when you're using the scope at its maximum 14x magnification. The main tube of this scope was constructed from aircraft-grade aluminum for a fog proof, shockproof, and waterproof body. For a feature-packed rifle scope at a highly affordable price, pick up the Sightron SII Big Sky 4.5-14x44 Side Focus Riflescope.

I have a Piranha Excaliber out the front knife for trade or dell. I would say the knife is new because it has zero marks on it but I did put it in my pocket a couple times but never cut more than a small string. The knife is made in the USA and Piranha has excellent service. This is one of three production high end out the front knives made in the US. The other two are Benchmade and Microtech. Out the front auto knives do need cleaned now and then and the Piranha is by far the easiest one to take apart and put back together. They are also very rugged and can be used like a regular pocket knife.
I am in my 60's and have been a knife collector for many years. 

I paid $400 for this knife but will sell for $330 or trade for one of the following.

I obviously couldn’t use all of these if I lived 1,000 years, so I am listing them on here for you all.  I have gone through these and tried to verify their contents as complete and accurate, but mistakes can happen. Please ask any questions or clarifications before setting up a time to meet to purchase. In addition, please bring the item that you are purchasing the holster for when purchasing to verify fitment as there are no returns or exchanges on these. Retail on these is substantially more than I am asking. I would also consider discounting if you bought larger quantities. Some of these may have been testers, returned, or simply opened. May or may not have original packaging. I would also consider trades for Cmr30/Pmr30 magazines/holsters/cases, linear compensators in 1/2x28, 7.62 HP ammo, 22 magnum ammunition, certain red dot optics, 458 Socom ammunition, firearms, etc. Honestly, just shoot me a text only at REDACTED and we can go from there. Please be patient with responses as this is a very large number of items to sort through. Thank you in advance. These are for pickup in Norman only.  Here is what I currently have on hand, I do not have others so please do not ask. Please refer to the list on if i have something only.
