The Sig Sauer M11A1. The civilian version of the Navy and Army issued M11. New and improved. The M11A1 features the SRT (short reset trigger) and SigLite tritium sights. This particular piece has neatly color filled trademarks, the regular ""fat"" trigger from the stock P229 because it feels better in SA, and has a stainless steel hammer. The barrel's black finish has its fair share of wear, however the rails and finish on the gun are still in excellent condition. Has three 15 round mags. Includes a Safariland 070 Lvl III Duty holster and a Bianchi Minimalist Holster.

I paid much more, but want to buy a kayak, so something's gotta give.  Will consider partial trade for 44mag revolvers, lever actions, or 9mm handguns.  But mostly need cash.  Planning to bring to next Bill Goodman gun show in Dayton so should be gone by then...

This POF has a crispy single-stage trigger on a 14.5"" 1/8 barrel with 1.5"" compensator (for overall 16"" barrel length) and a large heat sink that runs *much* cooler and shoots flatter than my other AR's.  It's been my prized ""safe queen"" for a couple of years now, but willing to let it go at very fair price so I can buy a nice kayak and accessories.
Located in Dayton."

The bull barrel is stainless steel, free floated and non-fluted. Only about 300 rounds have been put through this gun since it was purchased (new)

Comes with 2 matching USGI 30rnd magazines, Centerpoint 2-7x32mm already zeroed scope (it holds a zero very well), plastic gun-case, and an adjustable bipod. 

The scope is currently zeroed for 25m - 375m and there's a bullet drop reference table on the side of the butt-stock for convenience. 

I would prefer cash, but I will consider trades for a .300 Win Mag setup, (other long range setups), PVS-14 or 7, and AR10s. I'll listen to other trades too.

I will check responses to this listing quickly, feel free to ask questions.

The bipod has a small issue when it's retracted (parallel with the barrel), one leg will continue to go up and touch the barrel some. Looks kinda weird but will pop down and lock into place like it's supposed to when you go to use it. If I remember correctly, it's a blackhawk bipod."

If wanting a trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I will consder trades if it makes sense on my end, otherwise I will pass on trades and wait for cash.

In great shape with no issues.  Will come with two 7 round magazines (they only come with one from the factory). Has an excellent trigger as most know and this is the Pro model so it doesn't have the hated magazine disconnect or a manual safety.  
 Would consider trades.  I like revolvers in 38 or 357, a lever action rifle in 357, a complete carbine ar15 upper, Kel Tec SU16, 40 caliber handguns, Glock 42, or a pistol caliber carbine in 9mm or 40.  Maybe a large amount of 5.56 or 9mm ammo.  No Kel Tecs or Taurus aside from the SU16 or Kel Tec carbines.  Looking for an even trade, have a move coming up so I can't afford to add anything to it.

If you'd prefer to buy I'll sell for $360, price is pretty firm.

one has a third magazine and is perfect in every way, the trigger is amazing ""just from dry firing it, the reset is short and tactile, it kills my glocks and I love my glocks. It is close to a 1911 trigger. I want $600 for it which is less than I paid, minus tax and call in. ""you get that for free"". If you added the 3d mag, and tax + call in in, you would end up paying $700 and change for this Beauty. So someone jump on it please before I sell something else instead. thanks,

Has adjustable rear sight, 3-dot sights, and a chamber loading indicator. In addition, I'll throw in half a box (around 25-26 rounds) of leftover Winchester ammo with the gun. Plus, I'll throw in a brand new leather holster with the deal. Excellent pistol for CCW. I like this gun a lot, but I want something else.

The weight is 6 lbs 10 oz empty with a magazine capacity of three. The rate of twist is 1:9 1/2 inches.
Features of the Browning ABolt III, courtesy of Browning, include:
 - A Button-Rifled barrel is triple-checked for straightness and interior finish and then air-gauged to ensure a consistent diameter throughout the bore’s length. Every barrel is individually finished with a hand-reamed chamber for tighter tolerances and more precise headspace. The barrel has a target-type, recessed Crown that insures the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in trajectory. 
The free-floating barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the barrel to perform consistently and accurately and reach its full accuracy potential.
• The receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mounts using two 8-40 screws for each base to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform.
• The AB3’s unique integrated trigger design provides a crisp 3½-pound pull.
• The fast 60° bolt allows for smoother an quicker cycling of the action.
• The bolt body is plated with matte electroless nickel for smother operation and added corrosion resistance.
• The Bolt Unlock Button allows you to unload the chamber with the safety in the on-safe position for an added margin of safety. The top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. You can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
• The detachable staggered box magazine."

RATINGS (out of five)

Style * * * * *
Brutal. (That’s a good thing not a bad thing.)

Ergonomics (carry) * * * *
Finally, a “right-sized” FN for everyday carry. Like all double-stack compacts, it’s a little fat around the hips. But who isn’t? One star withheld for the lack of immediately available holsters.

Ergonomics (firing) * * * * *
Silky smooth take-up, brick wall breaking point and firm, positive, early reset – a trigger to die for. I mean, to make the bad guy die for. She shoots high. Then again, so do people in Colorado. Adapt, improvise, survive.

Reliability * * * *
GLOCK reliability [almost] meets Belgian ballistics. Over a thousand rounds of every kind of 9mm ammo imaginable, no cleaning, no lube, nothing untoward to report in terms of feeding or firing. Star deducted for three failures to lock back the slide on empty.

Customize This * * *
Gizmo gun guys and suppressor Sallys will appreciate the FN-9C’s under-snout MIL-STD 1913 accessory mounting rail, but there’s not a lot else available for customization – especially compared to the customization cornucopia available to owners of Gaston’s gats.

Overall * * * * *
For those who like their carry gun to conform to the brick-you-know-what-house school of self-defense, the FNS-9 Compact is a better looking alternative to the market leader. Just don’t buy one with an external frame-mounted safety."

In excellent condition. Has very few rounds through it. Blued with color case hardened action and wearing Pachmayr Gripper Grips. Fires and functions flawlessly. Still as tight as new. All matching numbers. Traditional DA/SA six round medium sized ""snub nose"". Production date of 1973. Has all the features of a classic S&W revolver like a pinned barrel, hammer mounted firing pin, pre MIM parts and of course its pre lock. The 2"" barrel paired to the round butt frame is one of the desirable less common pairings most are 4"" or on a square butt frame. Was rated in its day for beyond the modern equivalent of +P. Comes with a HKS speed loader, new ambi IWB/OWB holster and a 40rd box of Remington SJHP. Makes a great addition if you collect or it still makes a perfect EDC option. Only trading because I have a couple other medium size 38s I have more of a attachment to and want something different. Would rather trade but would sell for $550.00 or best reasonable offer. No shipping. Transfer on EFA10 or split fees at a FFL. Must have a Mass ID, LTC and follow all laws."

It was refurbished by the Czechs in 1981. It is in overall good condition with two blemishes, one internal and one external. The first is where the rollers lock up and contact the frame and they have worn two circles into the frame, and I can post pictures of that if you'd like. The second, the previous owner tack welded the trigger pivot pin in place. This can be ground down and touched up. These two are purely cosmetic and will not alter the functionality of the firearm. Everything else looks good, and in good shape. I replaced the barrel with one that is almost brand new, so the rifling is strong and shiny. The frame and slide match, but the barrel does not. I'd be happy to answer any questions or provide any pictures. I will need to see your AL Drivers License for my bound book, or a C&R License if you have one. I can ship, and this can be shipped to a FFL 01 or C&R, and through UPS Next Day Air at actual cost. You can email me through Armslist, or call or text me at 256-four3one-42five7.

The new GLOCK 42, in .380 AUTO, is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training. Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable single-stack .380 GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42."
