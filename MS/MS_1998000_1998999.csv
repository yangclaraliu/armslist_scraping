Kimber 84M Classic in 7mm-08. $1000 sale, $1050 trade
This rifle was purchased new in Lexington in June. Less than 40 rounds through this rifle, it's only on the block because I purchased a Kimber Classic Select in .280 AI for a Utah Elk Hunt. Includes remaining ammo, including 2 boxes of Nosler Trophy Grade Accutip 140gr, 3 boxes of Winchester Silvertip 140 gr, and 2 boxes of Federal 140gr. The rifle itself has only ever been on a range, and it is spotless! If you know Kimber, you know you're getting a great deal on this rifle with the exras. Price is firm with ammo, Kimber Bases, and Leupold rings included.
Zeiss Conquest 3-9x40 with Rapid Z 600 reticle.  $500 sale, $550 trade.
This has been mounted (on the Kimber listed above) and has never seen use outside of the range.   Zeiss’ website has a tool that shows the actual ranges each of the ballistic marks is good for based on which ammo you’re using.  Great glass.

H&K MP5-22 - $600 sale, $700 trade
Purchased in 2012, this is a genuine H&K, not the GSG replica. Only 10 rounds through it, I need the money or ATV more than I need the rifle itself. Gun itself is mint. It includes the following extras:
-500 rounds of 22LR
- H&K MP5 sling (paid $45)
- H&K MP5 armorers' manual (paid $25)
- original magazine, plus 2 H&K-made magazines. (paid $39 each)
- Fore-end Picatinny Rail (never mounted, paid $120)
- Front pistol grip (never mounted, paid $41)
Sig Sauer P250 9mm - $450 sale, $500 trade
Purchased in 2010, this has been a safe queen.  Includes Sig case, lock, and 2 mags.

Mossberg 500 Tactical Marauder - $350 sale, $400 trade
This was purchased new in Lexington in 2011, and has never been fired. I've upgraded the stock pistol grip with a Blackhawk Spec Ops Folding Stock.

PWS FSC556 Flash Suppressing Compensator

The Flash Suppressing Compensator (FSC) Series of muzzle devices from PWS provides superior compensation characteristics combined with enough flash suppression to keep the flash out of your optics and line of sight. Designed for both competitive and tactical use, the FSC Series allows for superior muzzle stabilization and aids the shooter in faster follow-up shots and accuracy.The unique port design of the FSC Series yields muzzle control that meets or exceeds the performance of the best muzzle brakes on the market without the teeth-rattling overpressure indicative of other brakes and compensators.All of the FSC Series muzzle devices have been classified as a non-flash suppressing device by the BATFE, thus removing any restriction from assault weapon ban states or provinces. A copy of this document is available upon request or on our website at www.primaryweapons.com.A PWS signature product, the FSC 556 ships standard on the FNH® SCAR® 16S. Coupling flash suppression with muzzle control, the FSC 556 is an ideal compensator for putting a high volume of rounds on target. The FSC 556 is a mounting option for the Gemtech Halo.SpecificationsCaliber: .223Length: 2.33"" (59.2mm)Diameter: .865"" (22mm)Thread Pitch: 1/2x28 RHWeight: 2.5 oz (70.8 grams)"

The Tavor uses a bullpup design. Bullpup rifles are configured in a layout in which the bolt carrier group is placed behind the pistol grip; this shortens the overall length but does not sacrifice barrel length. The TAR-21 provides carbine length, but rifle muzzle velocity. The bullpup design is also used to minimize the silhouette of soldiers and to maximize effectiveness in turning corners in urban warfare."

Ok so my point is that the finish is lightly pitted,there's small patches of rust on the barrel and the tube, the barrel has scratches from what looks like a saw brushed up against it and also scratches on the reciever from a scope mount,.and the finish in general is worn. Being in its condition, would it have any collectors value in another 50 yrs? Or would it be ok to strip it down and re blue it? I just need some re enforcement on my decision. I know it would loose any future collector's if I do it,  but I think with its condition that it wouldn't have any future value anyway, am I correct?"

For the condition the gun is in I feel this is a very fair asking price. Email me or text/call REDACTED.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace."

Best thing about the AK74 is the ammo, the 5.45x39 is a very destructive round and only costs about $180 for 1080 Russian surplus (@ .16/round). More accurate than an AK47, and nearly zero recoil. I have had other AK74s, I have 2 now, and this is the nicest I have ever seen. Features a G2 fire control group, true AK74 muzzle brake / flash hider (removable), and a side scope rail mount installed from the factory. It has the super durable Gun-Kote finish with beautiful Grade A natural wood furniture, not the polymer or painted crap-brown that some models have. Comes wrapped up and new in the box, unfired, and with (1) 30 round mag, same as I got it. I purchased this rifle new myself and I have $800 in it, so at $750 I will be losing $50 and that is the least I will take for it. That is the CASH price and it is firm. I am only selling it because I have 2 and don't need them both. I am not looking for any trade but I will consider a partial trade plus the majority cash to make up the difference, only if you have something good and want a very reasonable used gun trade-in value for it.

ATTENTION!!!!!!!! PLEASE READ!!!!!!!!
The inside of the barrel is damaged. I ended up getting a large piece of paper towel stuck down there while cleaning it. i ended up getting it out but at the cost of damage to it. I do not know specifically what is wrong, i just know when i look down the barrel there is a spot about couple inches wide, towards the front that just doesn't shine anymore like the rest of the barrel. Other than that only 200 rounds have been shot from it, stock, bolt and trigger assembly are in perfect condition."

Beretta  21A Bobcat 22 LR 2.4"" 7+1 pistol	
The ultimate in concealability, the Beretta Bobcat in .22 LR
may be tiny, but it is a reliable defensive arm. The tip-up barrel of this
double-action pocket pistol allows rounds to be loaded directly into the
chamber without slide retraction. Precisely rifled for accuracy, the barrel
is forged out of high strength stainless steel. This compact, rugged frame
measures just 4.9 inches overall and weighs only 11.5 ounces. It features a
lightweight, alloy frame, blued steel slide and a 7-round magazine for
.22LR ammunition, or an 8-round magazine for .25 caliber cartridges. The
Inox Bobcat model has a black steel slide and barrel with an
exceptionally corrosion-resistant and durable black frame to match
the color and finish of the black components. The other metal parts
(trigger, hammer, trigger guard, safety, magazine, etc.) are black finished.

 When it comes to AR-15 rifles, Colt sets the standard. This is the brand that the US Military has relied on for over 40 years. The Colt M4A1 SOCOM Carbine was designed specifically for light weight mobility, speed of target acquisition, and potent firepower. The Lower is stamped with the Colt Logo, M4A1 CARBINE, and SERIAL NUMBER that starts with LE. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Colt Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 32 inches in length and weighs only 7 pounds, making it ideal for tactical deployment, traditional patrol, and sport shooting. 

 Features of this carbine include a Knight's Armament M4 Carbine RAS quad rail handguard, Matech flip up rear sight, side sling swivel at the gas block, 16 inch barrel with 1 in 7 twist 6 groove with a heavy ""medium SOCOM"" profile under handguards, ambidextrous safety and the upper receiver is stamped M4. The barrel is chrome lined and has the M4 feed ramps and the bolt carrier is the M16 type. Behind the bolt is an H2 buffer.

XPS2
Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery.

Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.


Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space 
Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours
