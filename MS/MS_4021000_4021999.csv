The 32 ACP auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society as a defensive cartridge, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 32 ACP suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and examined nearly all available 32 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.

Here's the problem. The current 32 ACP frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks sufficient penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face, with modern, frangible 32 ACP ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek. I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the pain, as that frangible bullet would have stopped somewhere in my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible bullet and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and won't know that part of his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So, whatever 32 ACP ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 32 ACP is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down instantly. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your loved ones, is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed this 32 ACP+P load to keep you and yours alive under the worst of scenarios.

This 32 ACP+P ammo will better all American made 32 ACP+P ammo by 110 fps to 150 fps with a heavier bullet than any other American made 32 ACP ammo.

Item 30A/20 is a 75gr. HARD cast bullet with a flat nose. It is traveling over 1,000 fps out of my 3.4 inch Beretta Mod. 70. We've used a flash suppressed powder so that you won't be blinded by your own gunfire in the dark. This is significant as well over 90% of all civilian shootings in America occur in low light when the criminal element is out and about. Also, this flat nosed, nonexpanding, hard cast, bullet will penetrate deeply and will do much more damage than the typical round nosed FMJ bullet. Round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through living tissue, doing little damage as opposed to a flat nosed bullet. The flat nose not only wounds much more than a round nosed bullet, but it actually keeps the penetration straight and thus deeper. Notice the below velocities from my personal 32 ACP pistols. These are real world guns and thus the speeds are realistic and not the exaggerated speeds you'll see produced from laboratory test barrels. What you see with Buffalo Bore Ammo advertising, is truly what you get in the ""real world"" where it matters. You can expect 20+ inches of straight line penetration in flesh and bone with this load. If you are worried about over-penetration with this load, DON'T! You chose to carry a tiny under-powered 32 ACP pistol and the trade off is that now you are going to have to stay alive using this pistol and over-penetration will be the least of your worries if you end up needing this gun to save yourself or your family.

A. Berretta Mod. 70, 3 inch bbl.- 1001 fps

B. Kel Tek, 2.5 inch bbl - 910 fps

C. Seecamp, 2 inch bbl. - 856 fps

The above bullet speeds are 110 fps to 150 fps faster than the Winchester 71 gr. FMJ ammo on the American market. Not only is our bullet heavier than any other American made 32 ACP ammo, but it is moving about 15% to 20% faster - with that heavier bullet!

This gun has been in about 3 battles and has performed excellently. The bbs reach farther then most top of the line $500 airsoft guns. I've been able to regularly hit targets out to 60 yards (180 feet) easily on flat terrain. More on elevated ground. It's shooting at an average of 375-400 fps with .2 bbs which is perfectly within the limits of most airsoft fields. The 1600 mAh 9.6v battery included has only been used once and ramps of the ROF to around 20 round per second pluslasts for about 4 hours of continuous play (Around 2-3,000 rounds) vs 1 hour with the original battery. This auction also comes with a Full Metal Dual Mag Clamp which gives you about a 2 second reloading time, perfect for any combat situation, a brand new 100 round speedloader, and about 1,000 bbs to get you started. The Electric Blowback is also an added plus for realism. Aside from airsoft this gun has also been used as a prop in a few action movies. (See included screenshot) The reason for the sale is I simply no longer have the time or money to play airsoft so I have decided to move on and sell my gear. This gun comes in it's original box and is in perfect working order with around 10,000 rounds put through it. There are a few scratches on the wood finish and outer barrel but other then that the gun looks like new. 2 of the non metal magazines need new springs and are not loading bbs right now. The full metal mid cap mag is missing the bottom plate but is in full working order. The Tenergy 9.6v battery has only been used once and is about 2 months old. The mag clamp has never seen a battle and has no scratches or dents on it. The full metal flash hider is also brand new and I bought it specifically for this sale to replace the silencer this gun was mostly used with. I probably should hold onto this gun either for if I get back into airsoft or end up going back into the movie business but I need the money so hopefully my loss will be your gain.

during that time they made several variations of the rifle to fix consistent issues they were having. when we shot it (about a year ago) we fired almost a 500 round brick of federal 36gr ammo out of it with maybe 5 failure to feeds so overall I say this one works well.
it has been in my safe for almost a year I cleaned and oiled it before putting it in the safe and pulled it out every now and then with the others to get a good wipe down.
this is a great little rifle but its time for it to have a new home.

overall the metal is in good shape but a lot of the bluing is gone the wood it in great condition for its age there is a rivet missing on the side but took it out to Rick Miller at Millers Gun Shop and he said it did not effect the function that it was basically a cover plate.

First thing I look at when I pick up a 1911 is the gun a 70 or 80 series. There's a big difference! The 80 series has an internal safety that I don't believe is necessary and it's just one more thing that could go wrong, it also makes the gun more difficult to tear down completely. If it ain't broke then why fix it! So I stick to the 70 series 1911's. Another thing that is good about the 70 series is if you ever want to get a trigger job it is a hell of a lot easier for a gunsmith to work on a 70 series trigger and lighten the trigger pull and take the creep out of it. Also does the gun have a full length guide rod or a standard GI guide rod. That subject is so controversy that I don't care to go into details all I have to say is 1911 makers such as les baer, wilson, Ed brown, sti they all tend to stick with a stand GI guide rod and there's probably a reason for that. The second thing I look for is how well the gun is fit. For instance does the bevertail safety look like a proffesional fit it or does it look like Ray charles fit the thing, also I rack the slide and feel for burs and feel how smooth the slide travels across the frame, also I pull the hammer back and try to wiggle the slide and see how tight the fit is   Same goes with the bushing to barrel fitment. Is there a lot of play in either the slide to frame or bushing to barrel.   If i pull the hammer back and the 1911 rattles like a child's toy I set it back down and walk away.  Some other things are does the 1911 have a single or ambi safety   I am not left handed so I don't buy 1911's with a ambi  safety I have no use for them. There a pain to take out and put back together, when you carry the gun in condition 1 the ambi safety always gets caught on something such as clothing or the holster itself.    I don't want to have to worry about my safety Beeing caught on something and Beeing clicked off with out me knowing when my firearm is cocked, locked and ready to rock.   So if your not left handed y bother with the ambi crap.    Another thing is some 1911's these days have external extractors idk why but some companies choose to take that route.   Once again there a pain in the ass to take down and just something else that could go wrong. If it ain't broke y try and fix it.     With all that said in my opinion when you are at a gun store looking to buy a 1911 really pay close attention! There not cheap and I'm sure you want a reliable gun that will shoot thousands of rounds and last a very long time.   


Now I have a dan Wesson heritage the gun is like new with very low round count. I have fired 50 rounds threw it just to make sure the weapon functions properly then got home tore it completely down and cleaned it from head to toe.    This will make some one a very nice dependable 1911.   It has front trijicon night sight, checkered front strap, checkered mainspring housing, serrated top of slide. The gun is 70 series, single safety, and has the GI guide rod.  Also has a match grade barrel.       I buy and trade guns for a hobby that's the only reson I'm parting with this weapon.       I would consider trading it for another dan Wesson 1911 in stainless finish, full size colt 1911, springfield 1911 etc...   Shoot me an offer only interested in 1911's.

Since it took the same cartriges as the Luger and P-38, but with higher capacity magazines and enhance handling characteristics, they were popular with many frontline troops such as the Waffen SS and paratroopers. 
This example has all matching numbers, nazi stampings and proofmarks, and is in excellent mechanical condition. The grips and the magazine appear original. The finish is all but gone, common with the thin wartime blueing of the era and 70 years of age. Someone scratched a name on the frontstarp, just below the triggerguard, thus lowering the price accordingly.
This gun is part of a modest collection of mostly older items inherited by a friend when his father passed last year. We will have a table at the gun show this weekend in Ladson  to move these items so, please, come out Saturday or Sunday and take a look."

It consistently shoots 3/4 MOA or better with match grade ammo and the action is extremely smooth.  BIG BONUS:  This rifle comes with approximately 200 rounds (worth $375)  of hand loaded precision ammo made specifically for this rifle.  The Norma brass is yours to keep.  In addition, this rifle will come with a whole bunch of data regarding my load testing and development and a couple of target proofs showing what it's capable of.  I have over $4,000 into the rig just in parts and labor.  Email me with any questions or if interested.  You're welcome to come take a look at it.

Since it took the same cartriges as the Luger and P-38, but with higher capacity magazines and enhance handling characteristics, they were popular with many frontline troops such as the Waffen SS and paratroopers. 
This example has all matching numbers, nazi stampings and proofmarks, and is in excellent mechanical condition. The grips and the magazine appear original. The finish is all but gone, common with the thin wartime blueing of the era and 70 years of age. Someone scratched a name on the frontstarp, just below the triggerguard, thus lowering the price accordingly.
This gun is part of a modest collection of mostly older items inherited by a friend when his father passed last year. We will have a table at the gun show this weekend in Ladson to move these items so, please, come out Saturday or Sunday and take a look."

The rifle is in very good to excellent condition. No dings or rust or any of that.  Low millage gun that has been in a safe for years.

I am selling my 1975 Nova. It is a 350 SBC with a TH350 transmission. The body is in decent shape, but it could use some interior work. The frame is solid as are the floors. It has some rust on the edge of the deck lid but and the back left corner above the bumper. The motor runs strong and has never given me any trouble. The true mileage is unknown as the motor is not factory for the year. She was my daily driver until the transmission seal went on me. It looks like it was the seal but I have neither the time or money to fix it. Still shifts fine with fluid in it. I am moving out of state at the end of the month and need her gone. Good solid project or driver with the tranny issue fixed. Email me or CALL if interested, I check multiple times a day, so I will respond in a timely fashion. Cash transactions only, I will not do electronic payments or personal checks. My number is REDACTED (cell phone) My posting says $3K/obo but I will level with you as I WILL be gone by April 1st so any interest needs to be acted on before that date and as such I'm willing to go $1500/obo Thank you for your time.

Here is what the manufacturer calls a faithful replica of the famous open top, iron frame receiver patterned on Oliver Winchester’s key employee Nelson King, who hit upon the loading gate and wood forend development, an important step between the 1860 Henry Rifle and the form that traditional lever action rifles embody even today. Manufacturer was Chaparral Arms of Brescia, Italy, an Armi San Marco successor company that was briefly connected to Charter Arms and a German Corporation. Barrel marking on the top flat reads Chaparral ~ Repeating Arms / King’s-Improvement-Patented-March 29, 1866. October 16, 1860. 2 O’clock flat is marked by the importer, Tri-Star S.A. of NKC, MO. Specimens are not date coded, but we estimate they were manufactured in 2005 or 2006. This well balanced carbine weighs in at only 7 pounds 7.5 ounces, and its center of gravity is the juncture between barrel and receiver, exactly where it’s supposed to be. Barrel is nicely blued with a hint of purplish hue, marking is Chaparral ~ Repeating Arms / King’s Improvement Patented March 29, 1866, October 16, 1860, in front of the traditional military two leaf type rear sight, with the words Cal .45 Colt behind the sight. Receiver is blue steel with original Henry style plates. On the bottom of the receiver beneath the Italicized serial number is Cat. 16166. Upper tang is marked Model 1866. Receiver, 10 shot magazine tube, barrel, screws, trigger, hammer, lever, and lever locking key are all dark blue steel. Shell carrier mechanism and ammunition storage plate on the buttplate are solid brass, and the carrier of course mates at the bottom of the receiver. Forend and buttstock are Italian walnut with plain oil finish. These rifles have been displayed, but never loaded, fired, or transferred; they are in their original boxes with all their papers. We only have a handful of them. Similar Italian-made rifles from competitors Uberti and Navy Arms command prices upwards of $1000 - $1500 per unit.

The P30 is one of the most advanced police pistols of all time. During its development the most important requirements were flexibility, functionality and safety. Ergonomics of the grip have been improved by interchangeable back straps and side panel inserts. In combination with the ambidextrous operating controls, this pistol can be individually adapted to almost any user. No compromises have been made regarding safety. The P30 V3 has a traditional double action/single action trigger system with a decocking button at the rear of the slide and a firing pin block safety that eliminate the need for a manual safety. Its advanced loaded chamber indicator, which is easily seen and felt, positively indicates a loaded chamber. Another feature is the SuperLuminova 3-dot sights with non-tritium luminous dots, allowing an exact target acquisition even under poor lighting conditions.

This laser has momentary-on switch which is activated by your middle finger's grip on the pistol and does not require you to leave the laser on all the time.  I think it is the best operating laser going, and its small size keeps the pistol pretty concealable.

Here is what the manufacturer calls a faithful replica of the famous open top, iron frame receiver patterned on Oliver Winchester’s key employee Nelson King, who hit upon the loading gate and wood forend development, an important step between the 1860 Henry Rifle and the form that traditional lever action rifles embody even today. Photos show a specimen from a small lot we got on a distributor closeout, a 20 inch Octagonal Barrel Carbine chambered for black powder or Pyrodex® loaded, .45 Long Colt caliber. This well balanced carbine weighs in at only 7 pounds 4.5 ounces, and its center of gravity is the juncture between barrel and receiver, exactly where it’s supposed to be. Barrel is nicely blued with a hint of purplish hue, marking is Chaparral ~ Repeating Arms / King’s Improvement Patented March 29, 1866, October 16, 1860, in front of the traditional set-screw anchored dovetailed traditional buckhorn type rear sight, with the words Cal .45 Colt behind the sight elevator. On the bottom of the receiver beneath the Italicized serial number is Cat. 18166. Upper tang is marked Model 1866. Right side barrel flat reads with the import mark, Charles Daly KBI H’Burg PA Made in Italy, barely visible above the forend as photo #10 shows. The 10 shot magazine tube, like the barrel, screws, trigger, and lever locking key are blue steel; and the receiver, forend cap, lever, hammer, and buttplate are color casehardened steel. Shell carrier mechanism and ammunition storage plate on the buttplate are solid brass, and the carrier of course mates at the bottom of the receiver. Forend and buttstock are Italian walnut with occasional shelfwear creases like the photo specimen shows only one of, on the left side of its buttstock. These rifles have been displayed, but never loaded, fired, or transferred; they are in their original boxes with all their papers. We only have a handful of them. Chaparral Arms, of course, is an Italian based company with relations to three great companies, KBI, Charter Arms, and Armi San Marco. Similar Italian-made rifles from competitors Uberti and Navy Arms command prices upwards of $1000 - $1500 per unit. We have not been able to offer any quality 1866 or Henry type rifles in this price range for many years, not since the 1970s.
