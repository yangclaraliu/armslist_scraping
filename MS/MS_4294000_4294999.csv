I bought the pistol for $1,150 + tax. All together I have $2,200 into everything. The rail has been re wet sanded for a better look, full trigger job, sights, 2 sets of grips.. I have the slim black grips too just not pictured but will be part of the deal. The feed ramp was worked and so was the internal rail for tighter tolerance. You won't find a better pistol out there.. this gun was built to be the best runner ever if needed, but I only take it out to show her off.. I HAVE ONLY SHOT 1 10RD MAG AND 1 8RD MAG THROUGH THIS GUN!! The KYDEX holster was built for this gun and the TLR 1 flashlight it comes with. It has the FBI cant on the holster for faster draws. Also comes with 5 mags. I might have more but can't find them. $1,350
Is a steel but I'm open to offers. 
The shop that built the gun will be handling all of the FFL paperwork, so I can ship it to anywhere.

Built off of a Remington frame but that and the barrel are the only Remington parts in it.

All internals are a perfectly blended gluten free smoothie of STI, Les Baer, Ed Brown, Caspian, and Wilson Combat. Sourcing only the best parts for the pinnacle of design meets function, all parts were dutifully hand fitted to eliminate any drag or grit whatsoever. Trigger pull is 3lbs and with limited pre travel and over travel, but it is still a series 80 so you do have that brief staging for the firing pin block safety.

All milling and Cerakote work was done aftermarket and the slide is a one of a kind design with the radius being converted to 5 trued flats, aesthetic and lightening notches on the top, window cuts, and a recess on either side for contrast highlighted with Cerakote. Rear Novak sight cut and a set of brand new bright Trijicon night sights. Extractor/ejector blended to slide/frame.

Comes with 2 8 round mags and hard case. Can meet locally, drive to meet within 2 hours of Denver, or ship to your FFL

It will have 1 or 2 fail to eject and/or feeds per mag.  Those that do eject only go about 8"" or so out.  I have had the bolt, carrier, and hammer all radiused and polished, as well as a low power recoil spring and 3-position aftermarket gas plug.  All of it helped, but none fixed it completely.


From what I have read there is a very good chance that the factory gas ports are undersized and/or the gas block is blocking some of them.  It seems straight forward enough to remove the block and drill the ports and what not, but at the same time I would rather have someone that has done it before look at it, since any screw up would be pretty tough to fix.

Any suggestions on where to take it locally, or at least on this side of the mountain?  Thanks!"

The IZ132Z brings the Russian aK47 into the 21st century with designed functional modularity. The transformation of the reliable Izhmash saiga into a modern firearm begins by stripping the saiga down to the bones, moving the trigger group forward to install the pistol grip, replacing the forend and modifying the front trunion to accept the standard aK47 magazines. Utilizing 922(r) compliant parts in the rebuild; the IZ132Z is outfitted with caa furniture to update this classic for the 21st century user. This provides the user with a six position collapsible stock and a vertically and horizontally adjustable cheek piece for comfort and proper eye alignment with the sights. The forend includes four Picatinny rails to facilitate the mounting of lights lasers and forward grips. The comfortable ergonomic vertical forward grip with storage and a rubber backstrap provides control over muzzle rise. The pistol grip has six interchangeable rubber finger grooves and back straps to provide a sure grip for any size hand plus a capped interior storage compartment. The extended magazine release guarantees quick magazine changes from either side of the rifle.

The rear tang has been removed and the rear of the receiver has been reshaped and an internal support block has been installed to support the ACE hardware.
ACE SOCOM stock with Foam cheek weld and ACE Push Button folding mechanism with a 1"" ACE Butt pad really pads down recoil. Couple that with a Scorpion pistol grip and a Tromix Shark brake which alone reduces felt recoil by 15% and the gun is a dream to shoot. The gun can be fired with the stock open or folded. We then drill a 4th port in the barrel if there isn't one already there and slightly enlarge all the gas ports to aid in the gun's ability to cycle low brass ammo such as bird shot and the low recoil stuff. We then open the gas block port to clear the 4 gas ports and add an adjustable gas knob that has been modified to work with our gas port work. A RAM ambidextrous mag release extension is also added. An after market reduced power recoil spring is also added. Fire the gun, release a mag, lock open the bolt, all without taking your hand off the pistol grip.The gun handles flawlessly as all guns modified by our gunsmiths go to the range for testing, in good condition and will ship."

Up for sale is my very last Mauser; this has been in my collection for a long time, but now it's time to make space.


    It is an absolutely gorgeous rifle; wavy wood grain that I rarely see in a Mauser, almost perfect metal, though the finish is worn in places. Includes two WWI bandoliers of Turkish origin, with 140 WWI rounds, still in perfect condition. Also includes 28 stripper clips. Finally, includes an original M48 bayonet with scabbard. These all have been cleaned of cosmoline almost completely, though the stock still needs some work.

I have a heat gun for sale upon request to finish the work on the stock. Only $25.


   Mausers are getting more and more rare; I was lucky to find a batch of three still in cosmoline. The other two sold like hotcakes, this is my last one!

Serial number is 330642. It was manufactured in 1920. 

It was the first 1903 I purchased. I got this firearm because I wanted to better understand the 1903/1908 Hammerless Colts.  This is a gun I carried on occasion, shot often, and let friends shoot it without worrying about messing up the finish. This is a good 1903 to have if it’s your first or if you have a couple of them safely tucked away this is one you’ll want to enjoy at the range.

I judge this pistol to be in good shape for being 95 years old. The slide and receiver have matching serial numbers. There is no rust or pitting on this firearm. The left side has a pronounced retention holster scratches above the trigger. The right side has minor scuff marks above and to the right of the grip. The pictures show these wear marks well. They are less noticeable in person. The slide has a dent in it on the right side above and ahead of the ejection port. It looks like someone before me touched up the dented area. They did a good job, as I just noticed it when I was photographing the firearm for this listing. Grips are in great shape with no chips or cracks. Barrel has strong rifling. The magazine is the original two tone. For me the firearm feed ammo well and shot well. 

The pictures show the condition of this gun.  For me, this firearm function properly but as with any curious & relic have it checked out by a gunsmith before taking that first shot.

Serial number is 404264. It was manufactured in 1937. 

This pistol is in excellent condition. The slide and receiver have matching serial numbers. There is no rust or pitting on this firearm. You will see some sock drawer wear on the left side of the slide. It is more pronounced in the photo than it is in your hand. The grips are in excellent condition with sharp checkering. Note the back half of the right grip. This seems to be a manufacturing defect. I guess times were tough in 1937. The barrel and rifling are in outstanding condition with sharp pronounced grooves and lands. This firearm has the original 2 tone magazine that is in great condition. I have shot this firearm but not often. It was just too good looking to be taking it to the range. It functioned flawlessly for me.

The pictures show the condition of this gun.  For me, this firearm function properly but, as with any curious & relic, have it checked out by a gunsmith before taking that first shot.
