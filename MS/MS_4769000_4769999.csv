The finish is almost identical to a blued barrel and other than the light weight it takes a double take to see that it’s synthetic.  

The receiver is engraved with a Bird dog and pheasant scene on one side and a waterfowl scene on the other.  The Wood stock has checkering on the hand grip and forearm and the trigger guard is gold colored. There is a small nick on the top of the receiver.

The gun's finish is stainless steel with the flats on the slide brushed while the rest of the gun is bead blasted to a matte gray.

The handgun shows some use and wear, mainly to the rear of the black grips, but is in good condition. 

Will try to get pics up by tomorrow.  

For local FFL PPT sale only, this is an off-list pistol. California law says NO shipping on this one.

Wikipedia can introduce this handgun better than I: “The Makarov was the Soviet Union's standard military and police side arm from 1951 to 1991. It remained in wide front-line service with Soviet military and police until and beyond the end of the USSR in 1991. Today, the Makarov is a popular handgun for concealed carry in the United States; variants of the pistol remain in production in Russia, China, and Bulgaria.” 

Most of the markings are on the left side of the pistol:
The frame and slide both are marked with a circle inside a diamond, which I understand is the stamp I.D. of the Thäelmann arsenal.  
Serial # BT2xxx, marked ""K100"" inside a box, and an ""a"" surrounded by four dots.
The right rear frame shows the very small import mark 
""Makarov 9X18 Germany, CDI Swan, VT""

 Chambered in 9mm Makarov(9X18), traditional double action (DA/SA) semi-automatic pistol with decocker & 8-round agazine. 
Optics: The front sight is a fixed blade site and rear sight is square notched dovetail set to the slide. On top slide has a full length rib with fine wavy serrations to reduce glare. 
 The pistol has a polished dark blued finish. The finish is bright and completely original, with some light wear to the metal, more to the rear of the plastic grips.
 The action functions correctly. Pistol has a safety/decocker which also blocks the firing pin in the safe position. There's a visible loaded feature that you can see or feel. The double action trigger pull is smooth, as is the SA pull.

if you're local send an email and we can set up a meet.

When buying a belt, it is important to select the correct size based upon an accurate measurement. Your belt size is not the same as your pant or waist size; because your belt goes around you and your pants, tucked in shirt, and your underwear. Your belt size is usually 1 or 2 inches larger than your pant or waist size. G-CODE belts are primarily designed as an outer load bearing belt to carry your holster, magazine carriers, blow-out kit and any other essential items needed. G-CODE belts can also be worn in your belt loops just to hold your pants up. That in mind to get a proper measurement for your belt size using a tape measure, measure around what you will be wearing to determine what size belt you will need in inches. G-CODE Belts are measured by the actual usable length of the belt inside circumference, with a 4 inch adjustment parameter. Example a Large belt inside minimum circumference is 36 inches and can be adjusted out to 40 inches. If your measurement is between 36 and 40 inches you will need a Large."

I own two of these badboys for the simple fact I wanted one for myself to play with and one to hold onto. Wouldn't be selling if I didn't need the cash.  
  This rifle has never been shot, however its identical brother bought at same time out of same lot I have put close to 2000 rounds through it. Have never had one issue what so ever with it. Its light, tight and fits just right! Great shooting rifle out of the box and once I put my optics as opposed to the factory optics( still very doable) on my current shooter made it even better. Was sold day one on this rifle. Company gets a bad rap due to some later models with issues and that's too bad as the ones I have and the one up for sale is original first gen and the only gen that did not have issues. They never should of tried to fix or improve something that's not broken IMO!..  so  With alu aside I am a firearms instructor and shoot many many rifles and handguns. If your wanting in on a bullpup rifle that's only going to go up in value.....contact me and lets get ya set up and pay down some o my bills! 

Rifle as said before has never been shot. Is NIB condition and I have many many aug mags so I will throw in 2 of each cap that they take to sweeten the deal. 2x42rd 2x30rd 2x20rd 2x10rd aug mags for your taking to have fun with it. Also have owners manual box etc etc.. Just a sweet ass deal that your not going to find anywhere else for cheaper for what im throwin in. 
I am selling the straight out of the factory one I have not shot so it has the stock optics on it, not a big deal. Very easy to find a flattop to add whatever it is you want to mount. I find my EOTech l3 to be ideal for it or you can go for the 5 if your down for spending more on batteries. 
All in all great deal on a collectors that I know you will keep in your collection after enjoying it at the range! 

Price is $1500 , but will possibly take trades as I am always into building my collection to ensure I get on every watch list there is!... HA
Buyer needs to have on them a permit to purchase and have Iowa DL or ID for Proof of Residence of the State of Iowa. Otherwise we cannot do business!  Its a  private sale and need to cover my butt!

The new Les Baer CustomThunder Ranch 1911 is a serious, no-nonsense self-defense pistol conceived by Clint Smith, Director of Thunder Ranch, one of the premier training facilities dedicated to teaching people how to survive in a tough, unfriendly world.
Clint Smith cares about good guns and he's concerned that his students are equipped with reliable, accurate guns they might one day have to trust with their lives. That's why Clint Smith approached Les Baer about developing a dependable, combat-proven 1911 with which he and his students could feel completely confident.

So, Clint Smith specified the features he wanted and Les Baer built it. The result is a distinctive yet practical 1911 that's ideal for personal defense and a source of pride for the owner. Features include:

• Baer steel NM frame • Baer steel NM slide with front and rear serrations • Slide fitted to frame • Baer NM barrel with stainless match bushing • LBC deluxe fixed combat rear sight with Tritium inserts • Baer dovetail front sight with tritium insert • Lowered and flared ejection port • Baer checkered slide stop • Baer extended ejector • Combat extended safety (extended ambi for left handed shooters) • Baer aluminum match trigger • Baer deluxe Commander hammer and sear • Crisp 4 lb. pull • Baer tuned extractor • Baer beavertail grip safety with pad • High checkered front strap at 30 lpi • Flat checkered mainspring housing at 20 lpi • Beveled magazine well • Polished feed ramp and throated barrel • Complete pistol rounded for tactical use • Blued finish on complete pistol • Deluxe special slim line grips with thunder Ranch logo (not available with extended ambi safety) • (3) Stainless steel 7-round premium magazines • Special Thunder Ranch logo engraved on slide • Special serial numbers with ""TR"" prefix"

This gun comes with 2 clips, a speed loader, Laser/Flash light with strobe light feature, a tactical holster that will carry the pistol while the laser/flash light are attached.

I also have an ammo carrying type of case that you can see in the photo that comes with its own plastic carrying case for a gun. So that's 2 gun cases total that it comes with. At Gander Mountain I paid somewhere between $640- $700 for the gun and everything inside the Sig Sauer case. Then I paid $40 for the ammo case and the extra hard case about 2 weeks ago.

It's time to let this one go. I bought this Bersa Thunder .380 Plus just over 2 years ago. I've tried as hard as I can to love it, but when it comes to small framed handguns, I'm a revolver guy at heart. 

Let me be clear, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this pistol. It's not the gun...it's me. I have put somewhere in the neighborhood of 1000 rounds through it. It shoots wonderfully and cycles perfectly!

Because this is the only .380 this is a package deal. Gun, original box/paperwork, extra mag (an impossible to find $50 value!), ammo (about 300 rnds, 50/50 mix of ball and personal defense), and the cheap holster it has been riding around in. 

Will consider trades of equal or slightly higher value (with some cash on my part). Please understand that I don't have to sell this, I want to. So please no low ball offers and long drawn out negotiations."

- DeSantis Super Fly Holster (pocket carry with removable cover for less printing)
- 94 Rounds of Winchester FMJ .380acp ammo

Got it before a deployment a couple years back, only took it out to the range a couple times, put maybe 100-150 rounds through it. Was planning to use it for daily carry but only took it out with me a dozen or so times. So, it's very lightly used. I don't have any other .380 guns so I'm selling the ammo I have left, the holsters, and the gun all together as one package.

Along with the Spencer, Burnside, Maynard, and Sharps, the Smith was one of the ""Big Five"" main issued Northern carbines during the Civil War and was issued to several Federal and state units. Condition is excellent overall ....almost mint except that the casecolors have faded to a swirly grey for the most part ....and there is a bruise on the forestock from being bounced against some hard object at one time. Other than that it has 99% of the military soft blue finish on the barrel, 80-90% of the glassy blue on the triggerguard and related parts, a mint unfired (I think) bore, and wood that would rate near-mint if not for the one small area of forearm dings. Excellent deeply struck Federal acceptance cartouche on the left wrist. Overall, this is a carbine that will be VERY hard to improve on without getting into the five-thousand-dollar and over price range; definitely investment grade and quality. Excellent. $1995."

This is one of the fastest and hardest hitting rounds you can get, and it will effectively drop deer, wild hogs and brown bears. As previously noted, these are factory loaded rounds but, if you choose to do so, they can be reloaded.

These rounds are Winchester’s Dual Bonded Jacketed Hollow Points. According to Winchester, the dual bonding welds the inner jacket to the lead core then takes a heavy outer jacket and mechanically bonds it to the inner bullet which results in deep penetration, exceptional knockdown power and weight retention close to 100%. Upon impact, the outer jacket deploys into 6 equal segments for quick and massive expansion. After penetration, the inner jacket opens into 6 segments to create a total of 12 segments for double the amount of expansion. This gives the hunter a round that delivers a clean, quick kill.

If you have ever priced these rounds, you know they sell for $58.00 - $69.00 per box. I don’t have a 460; I bought these for my nephew, but then found out he sold his gun and no longer has a need for them either. So, they are just taking up space in my safe that I can use for other ammo. As such, I have these priced to sell.
