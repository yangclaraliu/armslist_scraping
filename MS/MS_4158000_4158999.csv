Why am I selling this:  I was trying to sell a Ruger LCR-22 revolver, and the previous owner offered to trade for this.  Since I wasn't having any luck selling the LCR, I bought this with the intention to sell it, hoping to have better luck than I did with the Ruger.

Caveats:  the frame is not uniformly colored.  It's as though somebody applied some type of black finish (over the black plastic) and the finish is wearing off.  The previous owner claims it's just ""holster wear"".   Also, I shot 50 rounds out of this to test it.  It's an extremely accurate gun at 7 yards, but I did have one failure to eject.  I don't know if it's an issue with the gun itself, or that I might have been ""limp-wristing"" it, since I was concentrating on taking pictures of me shooting it (gun in one hand, camera in the other) instead of paying attention to my grip.

18,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4158018,For Sale/Trade:  LIKE NEW HK VP9 V1 W/CUSTOM STIPPLE GRIP....,"shelton, Washington, United States",$ 600,"Listed On: Friday, March 20, 2015",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"I HAVE A LIKE NEW HK VP9 VARIANT 1 UP FOR GRABS. THE STIPPLE JOB IS THIS HK IS OUTSTANDING AND WAS MUCH NEEDED AS THE STOCK TEXURE IS WAY TO SLICK. 110RDS DOWN RANGE. COMES WITH BOX, 2 MAGS, PAPERS ECT... PM OR TEXT REDACTED FOR FASTEST RESPONSE...

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014.

The 740 Slim has been praised for its smooth cycling and comfortably compact design by many reviewers. Named “Slim” because of its thin frame. 

Features include three-dot sights that are adjustable for elevation and wind. Several safeties including a trigger safety that prevents the firing pin from punching forward unless the trigger is actually pulled, so if it’s dropped no accidental discharge. A safety switch, just in case, and a lock safety that renders it functionless with a turn of a key. A thumb and index finger groove make for an interesting ergonomic design. There is a thumb indent for the action-hand’s grip and a finger groove along the frame just below the slide to place the passive hand’s index finger.

One nut on the BSA scope mount is mia? It may be in the Plano but not sure. When I installed the scope and mount I only hand tightened the nuts and this is the result. It felt more than secure at the time. I took the rifle to sight it in and came home either without it or its in the gear somewhere. Scope is still very secure and accurate. Everything else between the two rifles and storage box is present and functions just as they did on the dates I purchased them.
I have never broken down or disassembled either rifle and only ever mounted their gear once.

 Avoid the intrusion and hassle of being photographed, fingerprinted, and obtaining chief law enforcement officer (CLEO) sign off

 Legally allow others to use your NFA firearm--without a NFA Gun Trust, you cannot let a friend shoot your NFA firearm at the range

 Legally allow others to possess your NFA Firearm--without a NFA Gun Trust, your spouse or roommate cannot have access to your NFA firearm, meaning Your NFA firearm must be locked up in a safe or other secure location which your spouse or roommate cannot access.

It has an ATI Dark Earth stock on it that has an adjustable shoulder stock similar to that of an AR15, and the stock also has the ability to fold the shoulder portion over for a pistol grip. Paid $150 just for the stock.  Comes with 3 - 30 round magazines, 1 metal, 2 polymer.  Price is $475 obo.

The second is a Stainless Ruger Mini 30 Thirty.  It is the nicer style to me with a beautiful wood stock on it and nice stainless flash hider. It comes with 1 factory stainless 10 round magazine.  These rifles are difficult to find.  You can find Mini 14's all day long, and sometimes you can locate a newer Mini 30 with a polymer stock.  But its harder to find the nicer looking stainless barrel with wood stock combo.  Shoots great, looks great. Price on this one is $850 obo.

The armor actually fit majority plate carriers. Upon Request I will coat the plates if you want.
*Note: If you should decide to contact me please be a serious buyer and someone who is interested. I am Legitimate and real as I would expect you to be the same.* Thank you this is my contact information 480-228-eight one nine-five

If you want and if you live too far away. I am able to ship inside of Arizona so that is an option as well. MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

NOTE: I have six test shot plates if interested to use them for target practice I am selling them for $20.00 Each let me know if you want them thanks."

The armor actually fit majority plate carriers. Upon Request I will coat the plates if you want.
*Note: If you should decide to contact me please be a serious buyer and someone who is interested. I am Legitimate and real as I would expect you to be the same.* Thank you this is my contact information 480-228-eight one nine-five

If you want and if you live too far away. I am able to ship inside of Arizona so that is an option as well. MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

NOTE: I have six test shot plates if interested to use them for target practice I am selling them for $20.00 Each let me know if you want them thanks."

I have here a running and driving 1983 Jeep Cherokee that Im looking to sell or trade. This is the last of the FSJ's(full size jeep), they continued to make Wagoneers but changed the design of the Cherokee. It has a 4.2 straight six(has had emissions bypassed and miles of vacume lines removed), Tranny shifts smooth, four wheel drive engages and works flawlessly. The body is in good shape. Has some minor surface rust throughout the vehicle on the outside. Only spots where there is rust through holes is behind the rear wheels(you can get cut out panels off the internet for $75 a side) also 1 bad spot on passenger side above rocker. The underbody is scaly, but not rusted out. Body is actually in great shape! Interior is all original, the floor pans are in great shape. The rear hatch has some minor rust and the back bed has 2 little rust through holes. All glass is intaced and functioning, this model does not have electric windows, it is crank windows all the way around including rear. Tires are in good shape. Heat works, but no AC. I love this truck, but am going a different route. She will go through anything, It is in way better shape then most you will find around here. Odometer shows 149xxx. Previous ownwer had it painted flat black and there is some primer shots covering where surface rust areas had been, interior paint is a light metalic blue so Im guessing thats the original color! Tabs are current and she drives down the road just fine(You could drive home). Make me a offer, I have people stop and ask about it all the time!!! Needs some TLC but is a F***ing awesome truck!! I can send more pics upon request(this is all I could fit)

Approximately 200 rounds through it.

New these are $579 at Gander Moutain and $599 at Cabelas, plus taxes, background check fee, and 48 hour waiting period, plus I bought an extra mag and extra CCW holster.  I'm not expecting all that for a used gun, but please don't try to lowball me.  If you can buy it elsewhere significantly cheaper, do so.

I'm really looking to do a straight trade for an XDs .45.  I may consider a couple other things as listed below, but I really want the XDS or cash.  Yes, I will accept cash so I can buy what I want.  I will ignore stupid offers and e-mails asking if this is still for sale.  I'm willing to travel as far west as Johnson Creek, and as far north as Cabela's in Richfield/Germantown for the right deal.  I may travel a bit farther for deals heavily in my favor (much higher value gun, extra cash, accessories, etc).

I have my CCW and will sign a bill of sale if you want to document the transfer."

From manufacturer website:

ENVIS is a rugged hand-held night vision system designed specifically to meet SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape) requirements. In combat operations, aviators and other special operators must be prepared to survive and evade in hostile territory. For obvious reasons, night movement is the best choice for evasive movement, but it is generally discouraged because the evader can stumble into unfriendly hands or get lost. NVEC's ENVIS is the survival tool designed specifically to overcome these hazards. . It is a lightweight night vision pocketscope that fits in one hand for direct viewing. It can easily convert a standard still or video camera into a high quality night vision recording device. It attaches to the objective lens threads of most cameras for temporary nighttime applications. The removable objective lens can be replaced with any C-Mount Type lens for increased range and magnification.

Adjustable gas block and the longer 12"" SPR style rail system. The IC-A5 has a low profile 2 position adjustable gas block  which allows the user to compensate for running a suppressor while getting the added benefit of our longer modular rail system. A spiral fluted version of our cold hammer forged barrel is standard on the 14.7"" and 16.1"" barrel lengths. The spiral fluted barrel is approximately 15% lighter than an unfluted barrel of the same diameter. The increased surface area also speeds cooling. The upper rail section of the IC-A5 is an aesthetically pleasing special cutback version which allows us to use the low profile gas block and at the same time keep the full 12"" modular rails available on the sides and bottom of the hand guards. This IC-A5 brings together features of both the IC Enhanced and the IC-SPR in one package.SPECIFICATIONSCALIBER: 5.56 NATOBARREL LENGTH: 16.1""WEIGHT (UNLOADED): 7.25lbsLENGTH (OVERALL): 32""-35.25""RATE OF FIRE: Semi Auto or Select Fire 700 rpm (+/- 100rpm)RIFLING: 1/7"" RHSTOCK/PISTOL GRIP: LWRCI/Magpul MIADSIGHTS: LWRCI Folding BUIS Front and RearMAGAZINE: Magpul 30rd.

It comes with the original wood furniture and original 10-round magazine in the original plastic bag in the original box (although the box has survived many cross-country moves so it's getting pretty beat up with a hole in one side).  I can't find the original manual or accessories (sling, etc) although I can include a Russian sling with it if you want.  It does have the original cleaning rod in place, and has a rare threaded barrel (with the thread protector still welded on over the top as imported).

I took this in trade and was told it was new, but it shows some minor wear to the butt plate on the stock, and a little inside the receiver.  However, the usual safety arc is only just starting to appear, which usually happens after flipping the safety a couple times, so it really could be unfired still and the previous owner just didn't take good enough care of it.  I have never personally fired it, but I found a different AK-47 variant so I don't need to keep this one anymore.  If you know anything about these, you know they sell in decent used condition without the original extras for $750-1000.  This is NOT a Century WASR, so please don't send me similar offers, but cash talks.  I can also accept a credit card in person for no extra fee if you'd rather pay that way.

It will take most, if not all, double-stack AK-47 mags including Romanian and Korean drums, Magpul mags, etc.

If you send me an e-mail with a lowball offer, asking what my bottom dollar is, if I'll accept something else in trade, or if this is still available, you will not get a response.  I am willing to travel as far west as Johnson Creek or up to Cabela's in Richfield if you're not local.  I will also ship this on your dime (directly to you if you live in Wisconsin, or to an FFL in another state as allowed by Federal law)."

H&K  USP45 Compact  45ACP 3.8"" 8+1 Modular Synthetic Grip Blued

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most
powerful cartridges. Based on the full size USP models, these handy pistols
combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. The
reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability
and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semi-automatic
pistols that use a difficult to shoot two finger grip frame, the USP
Compact uses a narrow, full hand grip frame. Easy to shoot, simple to
maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate and highly
concealable pistol. Variant 1 Double action/single action with ""Safe""
position. Control lever (manual safety/decocking lever) on left side of
frame.

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014.

Not sure of exact year of manufacture. 1950's I believe. In good condition. I believe the stock has been refinished.  The barrel looks pretty good. Some minor inperfections.  The magazine has a tendency to want to not stay in place. I put a little electrical tape on it to keep it in place. Holds 3 20 gauge shells and one in the chamber.  My son used it a few years as his first gun.  I paid 100.00 for it a few years ago.  Hours for 75.00

I want to sell it. And it is the worst, most unreliable, jam-o-matic piece of crap pistol possibly ever devised.

It won't feed anything reliably. Probably not even small marbles.

I've smoothed the feedramp. 
Replaced the trigger reset springs because the trigger sometimes wouldn't reset.
Replaced the striker spring as it was hanging up. 
Bought two new factory mags.

The only thing I didn't do was replace the recoil spring; that may help. But I doubt it.

The warranty card has not been filled out so if you are a tinkerer or genius and you can't fix it, maybe Diamondback will. Taurus owns them now so perhaps that's your path to sanity.

I'm done with it; I have an LCP and a P238, both of which actually go Bang! when you pull the trigger. Someone else needs this turd. I don't.

Includes 3 factory mags; two brand new. One 10-rd Pro-Mag. And the box, which unlike the gun, actually works.

I will provide a Bill of Sale. Must be 21, non-felon, meet in the Kingwood / Humble area. All sales final and don't gripe if you learn to hate this thing like I do now.

I originally bought this rifle from a guy a couple years ago, and he did a trigger job complete with brass shims. I don't have a way to measure it, but it's light and extremely crisp. I believe (can't remember 100%) that he also polished the action, but if not, it's still very, very slick. I added Brno sights from Denny Jakubec, took off the modified walnut Varmint stock and replaced it with a new beech Ultra Lux stock. 

Included you'll get:

CZ 452 Lux w/Ultra Lux stock
Brno match sights
Gehmann box with two new apertures and the original front sight parts
Brno steel single-shot adapter
Three steel five-round magazines
One polymer five-round magazine
Modified walnut Varmint stock bedded to fit the action
Original owners manual

I've tried to take enough photos to get all areas of the gun so you know exactly what you're buying. There are no mechanical problems with the gun, just some minor aesthetic issues on the action and front sight base. Also included the only target photo I have, from when I was sighting in the gun (which is why the group is nowhere near the center of the target). That was a five-round group shot with Federal #510 ammo at 50 yards.

I'm asking $600 or best offer, including shipping via USPS priority mail with $600 of insurance. Take off $50 for a face-to-face deal within 30 minutes of Greenville, Texas.
