The Primary Arms Mil/Mil 4-14x Front Focal Plane HUD DMR features the patented ACSS HUD/DMR reticle that stays true through the scope’s entire magnification range of 4x through 14x. The revolutionary HUD/DMR features quick ranging, wind holds and leads calibrated for deer and coyote sized targets using .308 or .223 chambered rifles. No math needed, no digging through the data book. A side mounted parallax adjust knob keeps the reticle parallax free and the target image sharp at extended ranges. This tough scope is shockproof, waterproof, and fog resistant, and comes with a 3 year warranty. The illuminated center reticle features 6 brightness settings with an “off” notch between each setting. Optional sun shade PA4-14SS sold separately. A “cat tail” scope lever is also available from 3 Gun Stuff (product code GS-440).

It comes in a custom-cut Pelican case, with a Blackhawk Sportster holster with trigger-guard retention device.
I'm asking $850 or best offer for the gun and all accessories.  I need to pick up a competition belt rig and this is going to be how I pay for it, as little as I want to part with this beautiful and functional gun.
It does have some surface wear along the slide and frame, as would be expected, and the blackhawk holster doesn't fit the gun with the compensator on it, but everything is there to take the compensator off, reinstall the original recoil spring rod and then use the holster in the stock configuration.

Description from Vortex Website:
Designed specifically for the AR platform, the 1x Spitfire combines an impressive array of high-performance features into a rugged, ultra-compact package. When fast target acquisition in close- to medium-range shooting applications is a priority, the Spitfire excels. Laced with advanced features, the sophisticated prism-based design allows for a more compact optical system without sacrificing optical quality. The DRT (Dual Ring Tactical) reticle is etched directly on the prism to assure consistent point-of-aim at all times with selectable red/green illumination of five intensity levels to match specific conditions."

HISTORY OF THIS RIFLE
The MAS-49 is a French semi-automatic rifle that replaced various bolt action rifles as the French service rifle that was produced from 1949. It was designed and manufactured by the government-owned MAS arms factory. The French Army formal designation of the MAS-49 is Fusil Semi-automatic in 7,5mm Model 1949 (""semi-automatic rifle of 7.5mm model 1949""). The MAS-49 semi-automatic rifle was produced in limited quantities (20,600 units), whereas the shorter and lighter variant, the MAS-49/56, was mass manufactured (275,240 units) and issued to all branches of the French military. Overall, the MAS-49 and 49/56 rifles gained the reputation of being accurate, reliable and easy to maintain in adverse environments. All the MAS-49 and 49/56 rifles feature a rail on the left side of their receivers to accommodate a designated rifle scope. The MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 were replaced as French service rifles by the FAMAS assault rifle in 1979."

Great gun.. Has a few blemishes near the end of the muzzle, but nothing major. As far as the action and timing, it is great. I have had no issues with it's performance. It has the original 22lr and 22 mag cylinders. It has not had the ruger work done for the transfer bar. So it is still original on the inside.

 The only part that is not original is the BNR Dragoon grip frame. The grip is the size of a Super Blackhawk and has the squared off trigger guard. It was a customized piece that was equipped back in the 70's. It's a cool gun. I love it, but I'm getting into cowboy action shooting and am looking for something in a higher caliber. But could be open to other single actions in 22."

Dropping this kit into your S&W M&P will set the trigger break point farther forward than the factory trigger assembly as well as significantly reduce the uptake and over travel (varies). It produces a trigger pull as close to a 1911 trigger as possible in a polymer frame pistol. The Forward Set Trigger body is machined from aircraft grade aluminum and black hard anodized to last a lifetime. The flat faced trigger comes assembled with a center pivoting safety. The Forward Set Sear & Trigger Kit boasts a smooth trigger pull throughout the break. The kit comes with 2 trigger return springs; one designed to produce a 4lb trigger pull, and one to produce a 5.5lb trigger pull. These two options give the end user the ability to customize their trigger pull for their specific needs."

The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. The results are astounding – with very serious implications for every coyote, fox or bobcat that crosses its path.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.

The R-15 VTR Predator Rifle has a 22"" barrel with a fixed stock and pistol grip. At 7 3/4 lbs, it’s extremely stable – the best choice for long shots.

Comes with case, 2 5 round magazines,  approximately 25 rounds fired. Chambered in .223 Rem

The SCAR rifles in the brown finish all vary a little in hue, you are probably aware of this if you have been looking at these rifles. These always look better in person, I personally like that they don’t match exactly.  According to FN, the US military requested that the rifle be somewhat multi-colored to help break-up the profile of the rifle, which helps the weapon blend in with a soldier and his surroundings. 

Also known as the SCAR-H or SCAR heavy for those of you video gamers who play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, and also Black Ops 2.  Awesome gun!  Chambered in 7.62x51 or .308 Winchester.

Completely ambidextrous, the FN Scar has a fully free floating barrel. The receiver integrated MIL-STD 1913 optical rail plus three accessory rails enable mounting of a wide variety of tactical lights and lasers. The side folding polymer stock is fully adjustable for comb height and length of pull, and is colored authentic USSOCOM Flat Dark Earth.

SCAR—Special Combat Assault Rifle…if you think this weapon won’t be included on an inevitable Assault Weapons ban, think again.  This is about as good of an investment as a person can make, prices will go through the roof when new legislation is passed.

I have seen that people on here are requesting a CCW or pistol permit from Law Enforcement Officers and refusing to sell to them without having one of the two. These people need to do some research before selling handguns. Law Enforcement Officers DO NOT need a CCW or a permit. Their credentials act as their permit to purchase a handgun. I'm not sure what the confusion is but I feel like if people are going to sell a handgun on armslist and are a responsible party, then they should do their research on general statutes before hand."

It is incredibly clear though.

Simply put, the Caldwell AR Mag Charger revolutionizes the way ammo is handled and loaded into AR magazines. It is designed to accept 50 loaded rounds directly from any common 50 round ammo manufacturer box or from aftermarket 50 round plastic storage boxes. Simply align bullet tips and dump a box of ammo into the Mag Charger. The ammo is automatically aligned without touching a single round. Once filled with ammo, insert any AR magazine into the Mag Charger just as you would into a rifle. Then actuate the plunger back and forth loading 5 rounds per stroke as the spring loaded ammo carrier automatically advances aligning the next five rounds until magazine is fully loaded. The entire process of filling the Mag Charger with ammo and loading all 50 rounds into two magazines takes less than 15 seconds. An Ammo Transfer Tray is included to invert ammo that is positioned in boxes with the bullet tips oriented down or to stage bulk ammo for dumping into Mag Charger. Highly durable Polycarbonate construction, compatible with.223, 5.56 and.204 ammo.

The CZ 2075 RAMI is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ 75 line of pistols. Just like the 75, the RAMI is double action/single action, allowing it to be carried in different conditions depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety. Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI ships with a 10 round flush-mount magazine and 14 round extended magazine in the 9mm Luger version. With a 3” barrel and an unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the black polycoat, alloy-framed RAMI is ideal for concealed carry."

I'd keep it, but I'd rather use the funds to buy (or trade it for) a 300 Blackout rifle or parts to put one together.  I'd consider any AR items on trade; mainly a flat top upper, 300 AAC barrel, red dot or holo, complete upper, or even complete rifles.  Any combination plus cash, or cash only is fine too.

Also including 180 rounds of assorted ammo.

Since it's a handgun, if we make a deal I'll need to see your valid NC driver's license and have the pistol purchase permit from your sheriff's office, or see your NCDL and valid NC concealed carry handgun permit.
