Really fun to shoot, Beretta's rotating barrel design decreases the recoil of the .45 and makes it very accurate too. 
 This is a Stoeger, not Beretta, they sold the design to Stoeger and it's the same gun with a different label, but that wasn't an option on the list to choose.

See my photobucket site for a bunch of photos.

The cup is a repro, no markings or pin.

Custom made inner barrel liner.

Outside barrel is probably a repro but frankly I'm not sure. I see no markings on it so I expect it's a repro. Inside diameter is 2.359""/ 60mm so maybe it is original. The liner is 1.935""/ 50mm.

The legs are WWII. See dataplate; 1945 dates.

The base plate is original.

Sight is USGI; can't recall the date. With aluminum case, strap.

Two web / leather carrying straps; one for show, one for go.

Custom made storage / transport crate. It all fits in there.

I have about 100 ready-made custom rounds for this mortar. They each consist of a flame-lit fuse that ignites the propellant charge, which propels the plastic bottle full of sand and fused explosive charge. Kind of like an M80 internal charge but it's not really loud or dangerous as it is enclosed in sand, all inside the small plastic bottle / 'mortar round'. These are NOT INCLUDED IN THIS AUCTION but will be made available to the winner. I do not want to make a tough shipping scenario worse by trying to also ship fireworks – which is also very troublesome and costly.

Folks, I really do not want to try to ship this. It's heavy. I'd probably need to make a crate, which makes it even heavier and more expensive. Some sort of direct pickup would be best. However, if it needs to be shipped, the mortar and crate will need to go freight. This is up to the buyer to arrange. You pay the first $150; I’ll pay up to $100 after that. If it costs more than $250, all the rest is your responsibility.

Thanks, and send me your questions."

The rifle is new and has never been fired.  Includes original box, manual, etc. Please contact me regarding any questions.  

The VEPR Rifle in 7.62x39 is the top of the line in Kalashnikov action semi-automatic rifles. With features such as; Hammer forged heavy barrel, (including a chrome lined barrel bore, chamber, gas block and gas piston), 1.5mm thick receiver, RPK front trunnion, spring loaded firing pin, side scope mount, hand made walnut thumbhole stock. The VEPR is simply the highest quality rifle based on the Kalashnikov design. The VEPR Rifles and Carbines are sporting arms based on the famous Soviet designed RPK. VEPR rifles are manufactured at the historic Vyatskie Polyany Machine Building Plant (a.k.a. ""MOLOT""). Molot has been building excellence into their firearms for over 50 years.

• 7.62x39.
• RPK-type receiver with extra reinforcements and a thicker receiver and barrel for superior accuracy.
• Bore is chrome-lined.
• Threaded Barrel with welded thread protector.
• Thumb hole wooden stock.
• Side rail.
• Comes with (1) 10rd and (1) 5rd mag Vepr mag.
• SGM makes 15 Rd Saiga mags that work with this rifle.
• Comes with manual and cleaning kit.
• 16-1/2"" barrel length.

Veprs are built for extreme demands above and beyond all others with extra heavy duty receiver, extra heavy duty reinforcement each side and an extra heavy hammer forged chrome lined target like barrel. The combination of years of proven design with attention to detail has produced legendary dependability and legendary accuracy from the jungles to Siberia!

Enhanced against weather and mechanical wear the cartridge chamber, barrel bore, gas cylinder, and bolt- support rod are chrome lined.

A vepr goes through a thorough inspection process at every part, every step of building and must pass the final thorough examination by a quality control committee before any vepr ever leaves the arsenal.

1.	Why the Vepr is better than the average AK
2.	Hammer-Forged, Russian Chrome-Lined, Heavy Barrel.  Most durable AK Barrels Made.
Hammer Forging is a process whereby the lands and grooves of the barrel are formed by hammering the barrel material against a mandrel. This process not only creates sharp and well defined lands and grooves but also leaves an excellent surface finish on said surfaces. An additional benefit is that the barrel material becomes work hardened. The chrome plating helps prevent against wear and corrosion. We don't believe you can buy a better barrel on any rifle.
Rifles based on Kalashnikov's operating system have not been known for their exceptional accuracy. The renowned AK47 rifle was designed to function flawlessly in all environments and temperatures. In other words, functionality was more important than accuracy. However, because the VEPR has a stiffer receiver than the AK47, better accuracy can be expected.
3.	Most Accurate.  Consistently better groups than other AKs.
4.	True RPK Receiver.  Stiffer and longer wearing than any other AK receiver.  Made for Soviet Squad Automatic Weapon.
5.	The VEPR costs more for a reason - It is simply the finest Kalashnikov based rifle available in the U.S. market"

I have put together a nice builders kit for the shooter to purchase most of the core items needed to build an AR. The last time I did this I ran out in less than a day!

I have purposely left out things such as the buffer tube, buttstock and barrel as those are items that builders often want to customize to their own tastes. You will also need your own lower as well. Here is a list of what the kit contains:

- Non-blem Forged and Anodized Stripped AR Upper
- High Quality Mil-Spec BCG, MPI'd and Properly Staked
- LPK and UPK
- ALG Brand ""Quality Mil-Spec Trigger""
- Magpul Pistol Grip in FDE
- Magpul Trigger Guard in FDE
- Magpul B.A.D. Lever in Black 
- Rousche Charging Handle with Extended Latch 
- Set of 2 X 45 deg offset ""iron"" sight holders
- Low Profile Gas Block
- Gas Tube - YOU pick the size and tell me (i.e. Full, Mid-Length, Carbine or Pistol)
- 1/4 Oz of Shell 33MS Grease for Barrel
- 6 X AR Star Chamber Cleaning Mops (if you've never used these, they are incredibly useful!)
- 2 X 1/2 Militec Cleaner and Lubricant

Add up the value, and I don't mean MSRP, I mean what these items are actually selling for and you get between $450 and $475

I am trying to move some inventory as well as continue to get my name out, so I'm willing to take only a very small profit on these. Plus I don't own a storefront, so I can afford to make a lot less per item.

Until I run out of these (I have several sets) $379!
Yes, $379. The last time I did this I ran out in a day. I'll keep this sale up for at least a few days and we'll just see what happens.

Local pickup available in Barrington NH. Or I'll ship this anywhere in the 48 contiguous States for $14. Payment through PayPal (you don't need a PayPal account to pay someone.)

Thanks!

It was the first commercially successful revolver to use rimfire cartridges instead of loose powder, musket ball, and percussion caps. It is a single-action, tip-up revolver.
As Samuel Colt's patent on the revolver was set to expire in 1856, Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson were researching a prototype for a metallic cartridge revolver. When they discovered that a former Colt employee named Rollin White held the patent for a ""Bored-through"" cylinder, a component needed for this new invention, the two partners approached White to manufacture a newly designed revolver-and-cartridge combination.[2]
Rather than make White a partner in their company, Smith and Wesson paid him a royalty of $0.25 on every ""Model 1"" revolver that they made. It would become White's responsibility to defend his patent in any court cases which eventually led to his financial ruin, but was very advantageous for the new Smith & Wesson Company.
The Model 1 3rd Issue represented a substantial redesign for the Model 1, with a fluted cylinder, a round barrel and a rounded ""bird's head"" style grip. Finishes included nickel plating (on both the frame and barrel) and blued steel. Produced from 1868 through 1882, the 3rd Issues were serial numbered from 1 through approximately 131,000
The Model 1 was in popular demand with the outbreak of the American Civil War as soldiers from all ranks on both sides of the conflict made private purchases of the revolvers for self-defense. So much that orders for the Model 1 revolver outpaced the factory's production capabilities, forcing Smith & Wesson to expand into a new facility and began experimenting with a new cartridge design more suitable than the .22 Short in 1860
This popularity led to numerous knockoffs and patent infringements by other armsmakers. Rolin White and S&W brought infringement cases against Manhattan Firearms Company, Ethan Allen, Merwin & Bray, National Arms Company and others. The courts mostly allowed these manufacturers to continue production runs, with a royalty on each revolver paid to White. In some cases, Smith & Wesson bought the revolvers back to remark and sell; these are marked ""APRIL 3 1855"" as a patent date."

This upper is 100% complete and ready to attach to a lower.

I have never fired it but chances are it's not brand new, the bore is nice and shiny and it passed a headspace gauging. I am a veteran with several years of armorer experience and I have gone through this upper thoroughly, it's in great shape and ready to go.

I was going to use it for a retro build but after an awkward encounter with a bear last month I'm in the market for a large caliber revolver... so I'm interested in partial trades (cash on my end of course) for a S&W 460 or 500 Magnum. Possibly interested in a shorty lever action in 45-70GOV but mostly looking for something I can keep my hands free for fly fishing and gold panning. 

Plenty more pictures available via email.

I accept cash, gold, or silver as payment.

Price is $450, look these up online before you offer me something ridiculous like $200; my price is lower than most.

I bought it from a legitimate auction house, had it transfered to a gun store were it was personally inspected by the dealer owner, had two sheriffs deputies measure it and everyone agrees that it is 26 1/2"" overall length (26 is the law) and has 18 1/4"" barrels (18 is the law). This a classified as a shotgun. It started as a savage model 311A 12 gauge side by side with a vent rib. These are good side x sides and have a tight action. The barrels we shortend and finished so they look factory and a new sight bead installed, the but stock was also shortned down and finished off. Very cool gun for display or protection. Is very functional as a defense weapon due to its small size, smooth edges with nothing protruding and the fact that it is a 12 gauge. Makes and awesome gun for a vehicle to slip under or between seats. Asking $275 cash, would maybe trade for guns or ammo, just have to make an offer. Call text or email, REDACTED"

The 2nd box is full with 20 rounds of Nickel plated, black FailSafe bullets so I am asking $35.00 dollars for that box of rounds.
Next we have custom reloads that were purchased from a dealer at a gun show that all have new, Winchester unfired brass casings but have several combinations of bullet types & weights to chose from as follows:
20 - rounds Speer 200 gr bullets - $30.00 dollars cash.

This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3"" barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal.

The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System all work to make the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol.

I have the original box and everything that came with it.
The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-packaged size usually reserved for smaller calibers.
