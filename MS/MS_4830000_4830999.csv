If you are not familiar with this conversion please Google ""Mossberg PGO"" there is quite a bit written about it. The link I found very useful is from Shockwave Technologies. They are the maker of the pistol grip on this weapon. If this gun is for you then contact me with your offer. 

It comes with the brass bead front sight and a very nice Voodoo Tactical case. The case has 4 pockets on the side that will hold 12 shells each. Also has a pocket where I keep my paperwork and letters that I downloaded from the Shockwave Technologies Web site, from the BATF. I have put less than 25 rounds through it. It functions perfectly and is very manageable due to the angle of the pistol grip. I also have the J.I.C. waterproof and airtight tube that came with it but those alone go for $100 plus on ebay. I will include it for the right trade or cash offer. A transfer must be done on this gun. If you are not willing to do one then dont contact me. See below for trade interests. Text preferred 3o3 9o two 563o. I will reply to all emails and texts. Thanks for looking."

Traditional side ejection is not ambidextrous and forward eject, like in the FN 2000 or the Kel-Tec RFB, is quite complex. The RDB (Rifle Downward-eject Bullpup) features a rotary bolt with a spring loaded ejector and an extractor facing down. The spent case is pulled backwards along the top of the magazine and then ejected through a vertical chute. The hammer is U-shaped and runs outside the chute and above the magazine. Obviously, the bolt travel is longer than traditional designs but well within the ergonomic constraints of a rifle. Other advantages are gravity assisted ejection, higher bolt energy at feeding and a slower full auto rate (when applicable). The RDB is built around a common steel skeleton formed by the receiver and barrel sub-assemblies. Bolt, bolt carrier, firing mechanism, ejector chute and bolt stop are identical for all variations. The short stroke gas operated piston is fully adjustable for different ammunitions and muzzle attachments."

 This is the some of best self defense ammo / hottest round available to Law Enforcement - yes I can legally sell this private sale to non LEO.

 Very hard to find LE ammo. If you can even find this in stock some dealers may require Law Enforcement credentials to sell this to you ( I do not require that as a private party ).

 I am looking to sell at $40ea box ( 50 rnds per box ). 

 Buy 1-2-3 or more boxes. I have 2 cases ( 40 boxes for sale - 50 rounds per box ). Buy 10 boxes and I will give you 2 FREE boxes. Price is $40ea - private sale so no sales tax. Good luck finding a local gun store that would sell to you at this price. Cabelas has the same ammo in 20 round boxes they are selling for near my price and I am selling 50 round boxes !!

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.Action - Semi-automaticBarrel Length - 2.72""Capacity - 6RdFinish/Color - BlackFrame/Material - AlloyCaliber - 380ACPGrips/Stock - PlasticSights - Fixed Night Sights"

The .45acp cylinder looks not to have been used, and the .45lc cylinder has a very faint turn line on it. Original box/docs/lock with it as well. I guess the one positive about these guns always coming with that ridiculous cable lock is that you're always guaranteed to have at least one target!

Buy now: http://www.calibersusa.com/beretta/beretta-92gsd-special-duty-j92gsd1m-51560One of the most prized features of the 92G-SD is its Brigadier slide. This slide configuration is instantly recognizable by the two swells on either side of the barrel, located roughly in the center of the pistol, which add weight to the slide without altering the balance. The two main benefits of this slide configuration are 1) that it makes the pistol even more durable and rugged and 2) that it minimizes felt recoil and muzzle jump, making follow-up shots even quicker on target. The Brigadier slide of the 92G-SD accommodates two important features. One is the G-style decocker-only lever that many combat professionals favor over a more traditional safety-decocker function. The reason for this preference is that a decocker-only lever eliminates the need for one additional action--disengaging the safety--upon unholstering and firing. The other is the replaceable night sights, which are dovetail-mounted and offer the user the capability of replacing them with a variety of after-market variants. This model comes packed with a variety of additional features usually found in customized combat handguns costing much more in terms of money and lead-time. To make magazine changes quick and intuitive without taking your eyes off the target, the magazine well is aggressively beveled and the mag-release button extended for a positive feel. Gripping the 92G-SD is also positive, thanks to the deep, crisp grooving and checkering on the front- and backstrap. A Picatinny rail extends in front of the trigger guard, enabling the attachment of a variety of tactical accessories. And lastly, the crowned target barrel offers premium-level accuracy right out of the box. All this, plus the obsessive attention to detail that goes into producing a Beretta tactical pistol, make the 92G-SD a jewel among combat handguns, a joy to own and an experience to shoot."

Both rifles function flawlessly and I've put a sizeable amount of money into each. The ruger is near 700 rounds and the PSA is sitting at 180 rounds. There is also a cheap sighmark eotech clone that can go with either one. I will also switch around any interchangeable parts that you like. I'm not really looking to sell either one, unless you make a offer that I can't refuse, but I would prefer to trade for a high end or multiple hand guns, or more exotic tactical firearms.  I know what I have invested in these, I do not have to sell, I won't take a loss. Don't low ball me, and I won't low ball you. Text me with offers/trade proposals. REDACTED -Nick"

Arsenal SAM7SF-84 AK47
7.62x39, Milled Receiver, Bulgarian Made, Side Folder
The Arsenal SAM7FS is a truly unique AK47 rifle, from its right-side folding tubular buttstock to its 24x1.5mm muzzle threads with muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7SF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7SF rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.
SAM7SF-84/SAM7SF model 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 24x1.5mm muzzle right hand threads, muzzle brake, bayonet and accessory lugs, right-side folding tubular buttstock, black polymer pistol grip and handguards, stainless steel head shield, ambidextrous safety lever, scope rail, sectional cleaning rod, 1x 10rnd mag, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.
Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7SF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.
Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability
Features of the Arsenal SAM7SF-84:
100% new-production parts and components.
Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger

The XD(M)® includes a number of features that will change your perception about what you can expect from your pistol. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly.

I have a new-in-box Remington 783 in 30-06 for sale. Just in time for opening day of RIFLE SEASON!!! I got it a while back, but have not had time to do anything with it. So, here's your chance to pick up a quality rifle without all waiting! This rifle has the adjustable Crossfire Trigger. It has a Pillar Bedded stock and Free-Floated Barrel. Right now it has nothing on it, but I can throw a Nikon prostaff 3-9x40 (BDC) on it for the right price. Again, this gun has not been fired, I just have NO need for it right now. Asking $325 obo (rifle only) or $450 (Rifle and Scope).

It's seen a few range days and has comfortably lived it's life in a drawer as my ""what was that noise"" home defense cannon.  No holster wear since it's never been holstered or carried. No pitting or rust or anything like that.

The only modification is some stippling on the front, right side, and backstrap of the grip. The left side is factory stock in case you want to carry it you won't rub your side raw with the grip.
I'd prefer to trade outright for a nice .357 revolver but could do cash either way depending on what you want to trade. Or, if you're in the market to buy go ahead and make an offer, the worst I can do is say no. You're not going to hurt my feelings.

very presentable spreewerk manufactured p38 9mm pistol . ""cyq"" as can be seen on the left side of the frame indicates this P.38 was manufactured at Spreewerke G.m.b.H. Metallwarenfabrik, Berlin, Germany. CYQ was simply the code the Germans used for that factory so that Allies could not target specific small arm factories (similar to ""ac"" for Walther and ""byf"" for Mauser)
all matching with original magazine, serial numbers on frame, barrel, slide, & locking block match correctly' this is not a russian capture frankenstein pistol', rather being an original wartime nazi issued pistol possibly being used for post war police/military having replaced walnut grips. Minimal internal wear, shiny bore with strong grooves. decocker works fine as well as loaded chamber indicator, crisp break on the trigger, all in all a rock solid piece!
holster reads wunderlich berlin 1963. only issue being import marked very discreetly on the backstrap under the beavertail. 'very minute you wouldn't even notice' 


orvel L. Reichert who knew something about war time P-38s, produced a list that rates 1939 to 1953 P-38s from 1 to 10 based on how desirable they are. Most Spreewerk [cyq] have a letter after the serial number [ suffix }and are a 1. this p38 pistol has a letter [ a ] before the sn [ prefix] and rates a 3 as a 6th variation [a-b prefix]. The increased value of a prefix gun is also reflected on page 1434 of the 35 edition of BLUE BOOK OF GUN VALUES. The"" CYQ late production second alphabet series"" is about $300 more than a suffix.
