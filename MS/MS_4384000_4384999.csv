Polish PPS-43C semi auto pistol ATF approved incl. 2x35rd. magazines.UPC: REDACTED58Caliber: 7.62x25 mm TT Weight: 3.67 kg loaded, 3.04 kg empty Length: 615 Barrel length 250 mm Magazine Capacity 35 roundsEffective range:200 metersThe History...The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG). The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42. The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43. This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946). The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied."

Serial #227xx, This gun absolutely pristine. Shoots exactly to the point of aim and even have ammo and dies to go with. What makes this gun so rare is the characteristics of a 99B vs. other model 99's is full Octagonal barrel 26"" long. Straight grip with a ""Perch Belly"" Steel rifle butt that is curved, schnoble tip knife edge dovetail. As you can tell in the pictures this gun is beautiful. This gun has never been drilled and tapped..

Model 99b's are rare and in this condition its even more rare. Model 99's used a rotary magazine to hold the cartridges. The rotating magazine uses a spring-loaded spool with grooves to hold the cartridges. It also has a counter to indicate how many shots are left. This guns counter works perfect and functions flawless.

The rotating magazine design allowed the rifle to be one of the first lever-action rifles to use spitzer bullets. Previous lever-action rifles used tubular magazines, which placed cartridges of ammunition end to end. Another safety feature was that upon cocking the rifle, a small pin protrudes above the top receiver to indicate the rifle is cocked and ready to fire. This design was ahead of its time. This is a very early model 99.

This is a great deer rifle or collector piece. This gun will not disappoint. Email or text if interested 918-four02-0854. FTF in tulsa area only."

I love P38's, and my dad was given this (along with the revolver) for helping a someone sell off an estate. While it's a great example of a war-time pistol, as we were told by the woman this was brought back by her father, it is not in good condition. Pitting is clearly visible, and I would not shoot this gun. I kept it for the historical significance, as any gun used in WW2 is appealing to me. 

2) The revolver is a .32 (from what I've researched), and I've seen Smith and Wessons that look pretty identical, but is weird in that there are no markings I can find. It's definitely old, and came from the same person as the P38, but I would not shoot this either. I'm just throwing it in with the P38 because I got them together, so figured I'll just sell/trade them off together.

SCOPE 
The Nightforce NXS 3.5-15x56 is the top choice for police snipers. A large objective lens increases resolution and exit pupil size for quicker target acquisition and optimal light performance in twilight conditions. These features make this an especially useful Nightforce NXS configuration for tactical teams that may not have a dedicated night vision system or scope. This superior optical design also benefits hunters and sport shooters who want a scope to perform in the shadows. The Nightforce NXS 3.5-15x56 offers a full 110 MOA of adjustment and a practical magnification range. With a large field of view, the shooter will be able to quickly recover from recoil for a second shot.

EXTRA
Has had only about 300 rounds through it. Built it 3 years ago. Great gun, was set up to be a 1000 yard gun.
When it was dialed in right I put 5 rounds in a soft ball at 965 yards. Has been well maintained. I just don't shoot that much any more. Trying to build a Rat Rod!"

You can get more information on the rifle at http://www.issc.at/produkt/mk22/
Made in Germany, All metal upper receiver (rare for 22 military pattern rifles).
Gun is in great shape other then some paint coming of around where the rounds exit the gun. It fires great for about the first 200 rounds each time I use it, then starts having light primer strikes and has to be cleaned really well and then it fires perfectly again, some people modify the firing pin spring to alleviate this, but I haven't changed anything on mine since it works fine again once cleaned, and I clean it every time I use it anyway. I have fired around 600 rounds through it. 

Picture shows the ""cheap"" but perfectly visible / reliable red dot I have on it, and a sling.
Comes with 3 magazines for price. Sling is extra $10, red dot is an extra $25."

This pistol comes with 1 8rd magazine. This gun has a 6"" Barrel.
The Weaver style accessory rail located on the barrel runs from the chamber area to right behind the front sight allowing the use of scope rings (optional) and aftermarket optics. The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up. The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired. Safety The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters. When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged. Construction Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel."

So if you’re interested, let me know what you’ve got…..the worst that I could say would be no.  As far as pistol, my preference is 9mm.
Here is the information on the M400 Enhanced Sig Sauer:
“The Sig M400 Series Enhanced rifle, is designed for use in law-enforcement, military operations, and the sporting field. The Sig M400 is a true AR platform tactical rifle with unparalleled accuracy. A 16"" chrome-lined and phosphate-coated barrel provides superior corrosion resistance and a 7075-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability that users come to expect from Sig Sauer. This FDE version comes with a flat dark earth Cerakote upper and lower receiver and a flat dark earth polymer Magpul MOE forend, grip, and collapsible stock. 1 in 7"" twist. 30-round magazine.”"

This is NOT a WASR or a century put together. This is a like new (maybe 100 rounds fired thru it) Zastava Arms OPAP 7.62x39 AK. The OPAP's are much harder to find and much more desirable than the commonly found NPAP variant. This gun still appears as new finish wise. It does have Yugoslav military furniture. The handguards are M70, the buttstock is from an M76 sniper. The straight comb of the M76 stock eliminates the so called ""cheak slap"" that is common on the M70 and NPAP variants and positions your head properly on the sights. Not only that, it looks nicer (IMO). This rifle comes with one Yugo bolt hold open 30 round mag (I have many others listed seperately). It also comes with a cleaning rod, original Yugo sling, and 2 muzzle brakes - borth a slant brake and a birdcage brake (both Tapco). This gun is 922r compliant, as it was made for Century at the Zastava arsenal in Yugoslavia (with the exception of the M76 stock which was added). It is matching - except for the M76 buttstock of course.

9mm Luger 9x19mm For Sale.

Packed in 50 round boxes.

147 gn subsonic total metal jacket. This is a great all around ammo. It’s remanufactured ammo, loaded with CFE pistol powder. It’s quiet through a silencer because it doesn’t break the sound barrier. It’s 131 power factor through a 4.25″ barrel so its legal to use in USPSA, IDPA, and three gun matches. This is not self defense ammo. This is for shooters who like to shoot it’s low recoil and is very accurate. This bullet has proven to be the most accurate of all bullets I have purchased. Hate to see it go.

Several years ago I was one of the scared ones who thought the ammo shortage was going to last forever so I purchased more than I needed. I would like to sell
some off and get some of my investment back. I have very large quantity of this fantastic stuff.
