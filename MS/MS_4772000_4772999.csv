About the only want I can think of right now is a Sig P938.  I've seen a couple models that sell new in the low $500's, so one of those would be perfect.  Let me know what you are adding to the deal in cash or another firearm etc.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants(Saiga, VEPR, PSL) in 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51 and 7.62x54.

Quality AR-15 & AR-10 lowers, uppers, stripped, assembled, rails, BCG, nice trigger groups etc. 

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP mainly, but may consider other calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag mainly.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44 mag mainly) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590, 590A1 models & 930 SPX, others?), depending on the deal and values etc.  

Silver Eagles and 1oz. silver bars or rounds, maybe gold in grams, I check prices daily.

Maybe quality optics like Vortex or others, mid level models, not cheap, but not crazy expensive either, 4-16x or maybe greater power range.  Maybe ammo to help make a deal happen in 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 & .44 Mag, .22lr, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54 tins, .300 Win Mag, 12ga. ""00"",""000"" buckshot and slugs.

Last thing I have is a dazzler laser. This is a class 3 laser. You can not purchase one of these. It is not illegal for you to possess until it hits class 4. So it is as powerful as you can get with a good reason for it. 
Made by B.E. Meyers this is a 532-pm, I will not let you come play with it. Serious buyers with serious cash. Comes with the bag, manual one filter and lens cleaning tools. This laser was purchased by the Army for $15,000. Yes your hard earned money that you lossed from taxes paid for this thing. I am not asking 15k that would be retarded. I have done my reseach and this thing sold once on armslist for $2200(no it wasn't the one I have). Again I am not going for $2200. I would be willing to negotiate or trade for something.

This model has history:
In 1960,  US Air Force Lt. Gary Powers was somewhere that never existed in a plane that wasn’t on the official record. His plane, the U-2 recon aircraft was shot down over the Ural mountain city of Sverdlovsk in the Soviet Union.  Placed on public trial in Moscow, Powers admitted that his craft was in fact a CIA operated top-secret spy plane. In the trial, the Soviets produced a silenced Hi-Standard model USA-HD caliber .22LR, serial number 120046. The serial number is not listed in High Standard’s books and it has commonly been surmised that it was sold on spec to the CIA for operatives in the 1950s. Others were reportedly made without any markings whatsoever to be ‘sterile’ and thus deniable.

I submitted pics to John Stimson for his opinion. He stated these are far more scarce than thought based on production numbers. Especially in the original box with accessories. 

I dug into his website and found that he had listed serial number 64455 as being manufactured on 9/14/1940. This is 64457."

Marlin only made the MR-7 from 1996-1999. It was chambered in .25-06, .270, .280, and .30-06. It features a 3-position safety, a bolt face encircled by three rings of 4140 steel, a shrouded striker and high-visibility cocking indicator. It has an adjustable 3-6 lb trigger, A forged, machined and heat-treated receiver and an extra-strong bolt lockup. The Mr-7 has a hinged floorplate with a removable yet securely mounted 4-shot box magazine. It has a 22"" barrel with 6-groove precision rifling and a recessed muzzle. It also has a classically configured, cut-checkered American walnut stock. This rifle is in Excellent condition, metal finish rates at 95%. The wood has some small scratches and dents which I have shown the worst of and most visible in the photos. The bore is perfect. You dont see these available on the market anymore as they have become a collector type niche, and at time of posting this is the only one listed on Gunbroker for sale. Marlin mimicked many legendary bolt action with this model, the safety of a Winchester Model 70 the locking lug and positive cartridge engagement of the Remington 700, the bolt handle design of the Ruger M77 and the box magazine of a Browning A-bolt, and they actually faced a few lawsuits I believe for some of these infringements which was one of the reasons the production run was so limited. I have owned this rifle since new, and it has been well taken care of and has not been shot for the last 6 years. The few marks on the stock came when I loaned it to a friend of mine for deer hunting one season, and after he returned it with the shown scratches I retired it from anything but occasional admiring.This also comes with Weaver bases for a scope.

In anticipation of SPECTRE, the James Bond film scheduled to be released this year, OMEGA has created a limited edition Seamaster Aqua Terra 150M model inspired by the Bond family coat of arms. Among the most striking elements of this 41.5 mm stainless steel timepiece is the oscillating weight. This component has been cut and shaped to resemble a gun barrel, a design feature that is associated with James Bond. The Bond family coat of arms is repeatedly interlocked to create a dynamic pattern on the watch’s blue PVD dial. The symbol is also found near the tip of the yellow central seconds hand. The limited edition number of the timepiece is engraved on the caseback (XXXXX/15’007), as is the proclamation of its magnetic resistance. Powered by the completely new OMEGA Master Co-Axial calibre 8507, this timepiece is resistant to magnetic fields greater than 15,007 gauss. OMEGA has been firmly on 007’s wrist for nearly two decades now, reliably serving in its key supporting role and looking the part of the perfect spy timepiece through thick and thin since GoldenEye in 1995. The world's favourite secret agent is defined not only by his sense of adventure but by his role as the ultimate style icon – a combination that makes OMEGA and 007 perfect partners. 

This is a brand new watch with all paperwork and accouterments, including factory warranty. I will ship world wide and include full insurance and adult signature required for $100.

Where as the manufacturer offers a warranty I do not, all items are sold in an AS IS condition and no refunds are given"

This model 1898 is in great shape. Hopefully the pictures show bluing, general condition, etc., as I know often grading these can be subjective. More pictures available upon request. I shot it a few times and it is accurate, but the extractor didn't work several times. I know less than a lot of people, so I don't know the cause of the problem exactly; however, I have heard that this is a common problem with modern casings. Rifling is good up until the end of the barrel, where the muzzle gets very worn. Not completely shot out, not awesome. However, she was still accurate at 100 yards, where I was able to keep good 3"" groupings. Wood has a clear cartouche and is in good shape save for a little scarring shown in the picture.

The trigger play spring was clipped by the issuing department to eliminate that point of failure, though if you want to put it back in it's a $5 part (for those who don't know this just removes a little free play in single action and is only really noticeable while dry firing.

I can ship to an out of state FFL for around $40 including insurance.

This gun is in great condition.  It has probably had around 500-600 rounds through it with no issues.  I have run hand loads through it most of those rounds.  I always run 20% to 60% within the recommended powder charge, so this gun has had it pretty easy.  Like all my guns, it gets cleaned after any range trip.  It shows the normal rubbing between the barrel and slide, as you can see in one of the pictures.

Although this gun has worked flawlessly and has been very accurate, the simple fact is that I rarely use it.  My babies are my 1911's.  This Mod.2 doesn't get out very often.  I had a major tent failure recently and now need a new one.  Without the budget for that presently, it is time to sacrifice one tool for another.

If you're looking for a convenient carry gun that still offers reliability, power, and cool looks... this is it!  I'm not going to give this gun away, so please no low-ballers.  I am ONLY willing to trade for a Tentsile tent.  Otherwise, it is a cash-only deal.  I will only sell to someone with an AZ license and/or CCW and will create a Bill of Sale.

Thanks for looking,

Its phenomenal versatility makes it the premier choice for Law Enforcement Professionals as well.  PVS-14’s can be mounted on helmets for hands-free use, behind weapon optics, or simply as a handheld device.  As a monocular, the PVS-14 provides Gen3 night vision aid to one of the operator’s eyes, leaving the other to retain its natural night-adapted vision.  This is important when changing light conditions in the field cause the user to go back and forth between aided and un-aided vision.  Military and Law Enforcement operators need the ability to instantly switch between night vision and white light as the situation develops.

775,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4772775,For Sale:  Hoyt Pro-Elite LH 50-60 Compound Bow,"Holland, Toledo, Ohio","$ 1,000","Listed On: Tuesday, October 13, 2015",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm selling a 2004 Hoyt Pro Elite LH that I have barely shot.  What you see is what you get.  The first photo pretty much sums up what is included in the package but here is a list of what is included: 
*Hoyt Pro Elite (2004 Model)
*Shibuya Caruno Long Stabilizer Light Weight- 28""-White
*Carter Target 3 Release
*CR Apex 3-D Scope
*CR Feather Vision Verde Glass Lens
*Sure-Loc Challenger 550 Target Sight
*Original Brite Sight Clarifier Peep
*Sure-Loc Carry Case
*Vapor Trail Limb-Driver Pro Rest
*Eight Vaps 400 Series .166 Micro Diameter Arrows ( Some due need to be repaired)
*Easton Orange Multi-Pocket Quiver
*Sure-Loc Orange Scope Sights
*Sure-Loc Allen Wrenches
*One Extra Insert for Micro-Diameter Arrow
*

The poundage on the bow right now is at about 52lbs. but can go up to 60lbs. max.   Also the draw length is right at about 29.5"".  Sight is nice and clear, which the clarifier clears up most of the blurriness of the 6x scope.  The release is still as crisp as when I bought it, only about five to six hundred shots through it.  Sure-Loc Adjustment sight was great for shooting far distances and you could dial it back for the shots that were as close as ten feet.  No Complaints with any of the equipment that is on this bow except for the rest.  It slipped on the limb and screwed with the drop distance, so a little electrical tape fixed it right up, no problems have occurred since.  Also the Sure-Loc carrying case comes with a couple of other stick-on sights and Allen keys for the whole bow.  All of these items plus the bow was shipped out and at MY door step for $1600 dollars. But since most of the parts have been used a little the value has depreciated and I'll sell it for $1200.  Price it out yourself and see what numbers come up.

It appears mostly complete but will need new plastic for the hopper and I can't seem to find the primer slides anywhere in the pile of parts. So, it's a minor project but I've priced it accordingly.

Comes with dies and shell plates and additional bushings for: 9mm, 380, and 40 S&W. I'm not parting things out, it's going as a set and you can recoup your costs selling off the parts you don't need. (That's $75 in shell plates and $60 in dies at used prices) Has primer tubes and a couple of case retainer springs. Some very light rust here and there that will clean up easily with rust remover (I have a couple recommendations of what to use if you don't have a preferred method) Looks to be in time and very smooth lever throw so very little reconditioning needed to get this into service.

1 full container of 40 brass
2.5 containers of 9mm brass (2 of them are not in the picture)

CHECK YOUR LOCAL LAWS AND WITH THE ATF BEFORE ORDERING THIS BARREL. Melonite Nitriding treatment turns a standard chrome moly steel barrel into a very slick, hard and corrosion resistant barrel. Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life.

This is an amazing build and the rifle shoots extremely accurately. Only about 100 rounds through it. This is a really good deal on this build. I posted links to the build components so you can check and add up prices yourself. I can't find it at the moment, but I have a picture of 3 shots at 100 yards with a group inside the size of a quarter. This is a sub-MOA rifle.
