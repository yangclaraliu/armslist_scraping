I build them so I know anyone who tells you this is overpriced has either not had the privilege to fire one or can't afford one.  
The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.
This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers."

 Howa rifles outshoot well known rifles costing hundreds of dollars more. Many Howa Rifle retail dealers say, ""The Howa M-1500 is the most accurate rifle  right out of the box."" Gun Tests, the independent testing organization for the firearms industry, rates ""Howa Lightning most accurate, best trigger pull and most evenly balanced over Remington and Savage."" The American Rifleman states, ""Many of the groups pack three shots under 1 1/2,"" and one group with Winchester ammunition put three shots into .30. Accuracy makes this gun worth a closer look."" Whether you hunt, shoot targets, or just enjoy plinking, the Howa Rifles M-1500 has the superior accuracy, rugged durability and dependable quality craftsmanship to get the job done.

The heart of the M-1500's superior action is a one piece, bind-proof bolt forged from solid steel. The fully adjustable Howa rifle trigger is famous for consistent, crisp let off. All models are drilled and tapped for standard scope bases and come with solid rubber butt pads and sling swivel studs. Howa rifles provide accuracy and reliability at an affordable price"

The Glock 23C is the mid-size or compact .40 caliber handgun. Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the Glock pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the FBI and countless police authorities for introducing the Glock 23 as their official service pistol. Now you can own this same gun for your self-defense, personal protection, competition and target practice. Model G23c

I'm not in a position where I need to sell it so I will only entertain realistic offers.

I may be willing to trade for specific H&K or Sig Sauer's. I require two forms of ID- a driver's license and a concealed carry permit I also require the buyer to sign a bill of sale.

She is a little rough. I'll try to point out all of her bad parts as I can. I took as many pics of her imperfections as I could so that you could see and know what you're getting. Ok, here goes:

Missing sight ramp on the barrel
Trigger has rust
Hammer has rust
Cylinder push ejector button has some rust
Faint pitting along the Pachamyr grip line on the logo side
Pachmayr grip is a little worn

For all I know the rusty areas could be cleaned up by someone who has time to brush her down over time by someone who is a Smith person and knows what to do. 

Other than that, she actually shoots and functions perfectly. Lock-up and timing are both superb. Barrel is shiny inside. DA/SA trigger pulls are clean crisp and break great. Shot about 75 rounds through her with no problem and actually if you use the fixed back sight you can get a pretty good aim on her.

Listen, this would be truly a truck gun or a woods gun or an out of the farm gun. Could even be your range gun for just shooting some .357's or .38's out of just to have a revolver for whatever. She's not beauty queen and I've stated that.

Here are some pics and go from there. If you decide you'd like to make a deal on her then contact me that's fine. If not, that's fine as well.

I have this bersa .380 cc model. I wanted to like it but I have a problem with it. Often times during firing, the last round in the magazine will go nose up and jam. This is actually my second one because it was already replaced by Davidsons because I had the exact same problem with my first one. I have had other people shoot it without it jamming for them and people think it's just me but I'm not convinced. I have the original flush fit mag and an extra mec gar brand mag with pinky extention. This one was manufactured in 2014. I also have a nearly new Desantis iwb holster. I have not used the holster. I am looking to trade for another .380 or a .22 possibly plus cash on my end. I paid 300 for the gun, 26 for the extra mag, and 25 for the holster. I don't expect to get that all back. I'm open to reasonable offers. I could get this replaced again through Davidsons but I would bet the next one does it too. Shoot me an offer."

Strange request, but I'm looking to buy a few non-functional guns for converting to classroom training guns for home firearms safety courses that I help teach in the Boy Scouts.

These will become something like the ones that are sold by Mossberg where I'll be stripping them down and refinishing the wood with bright neon orange duracoat so they are clearly training firearms.

Looking for a pump action shotgun, a bolt action rifle (and long shot, but would also like to get a lever action rifle and a semi-auto shotgun or break open shotgun, but these last 3 are wishlist items - priority are the 1st 2).

I am not looking to spend a lot of money - if the barrel is rusted out and unsafe to shoot, this is what I want to get my hands on since I'll be plugging the barrels anyway.

If you have one that's sitting in the closet eating dust because you didn't want to pay for the repairs, I'd like to find out what you'd like to get for it - again - DO NOT want anything that is working since I will be making sure they are non-functional for my classes (unless you're willing to part with it for dirt cheap).

Don't care about brands or age, just had to be in at least good enough condition where my students won't need a tetanus shot form the rust :)
These will be used to show them true handling of the guns as well as operations (pump and safeties for example)."

Ever since Colt marketed pocket revolvers, their handy size has proved to be very popular for self defense and, whilst it is valid to say that the Colt 1862 Model Police revolver was meant for those individuals engaged in a security role, its attributes made it equally desirable for the outlaw alike. Consequently, as this was to be Colt's last offering of a cap and ball pistol before their arms production went over completely to metallic cartridges, the model 1862 Police has always been in short supply.

Even when metallic cartridges were first available, not everyone could access them, preferring to make their own balls and continue muzzle loading.

In this transitional period, Colt realised that the metallic cartridge was the way forward so only 30% of the components produced for the 1862 Police revolver were ever assembled into cap and ball pistols. The majority of the barrels, cylinders and frames were instead utilised in the production of their equally popular pocket rimfire revolvers. With that, Colt's percussion era drew to a close and today, this Police revolver has become a rare pistol for collectors to find.

Presented in very good and crisp condition, this Colt 1862 Police revolver is a superb looking piece for the collector - totally original with matching serial numbers throughout. The action is also working very well, with smooth operation and indexing of the cylinder as well as tight lock up and strong mainspring. The bore and chambers are all in good order too with clearly stamped address and patent dates.

Presentation Grade .442 Webley No.1 Gate Loading Revolver

This is a superior presentation grade No.1 gate loading revolver, made by Webley c.1868. This would have been made to special order, all hand engraved at their factory and then nickel plated and finish off with the ivory grips before being retailed by T. Miller of Sunderland and marked on the top strap. No doubt this would have been made for a well heeled gentleman, possibly serving as his personal protection revolver, quite likely accompanying him on travels overseas, where the smooth cool grips and protective finish would have been an asset in a hot climate.

This type of Webley revolver seldom comes to the market and in this condition, it would prove to be a fine addition to a collection. Fully working with positive lock up and good spring action, the revolver retains much of its original finish. The bore and chambers are all in good condition throughout. Only the grip has an old well executed period repair to the right side.

Chambered for the obsolete .442 calibre, this Webley may be owned without a certificate, provided it is held as part of a gun collection without ammunition.

When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.Price is a discounted cash price.  If you wish to pay by credit card, please add 3% to the sale total.  To pay by credi cardt, telephone REDACTED.Specifications  Forged Slide and Frame Model: 1911SS-1 Finish: Stainless Steel Caliber: .45 ACP UPC: 7-25327-60246-0 Capacity: 8 +1 Weight: 32 oz Rate of Twist: 1:16"" Barrel Length: 5"" Frame: Large Action: SA Grooves: 6 MSRP: $944.8 Rear Sight: Heinie Straight Eight Grooves Turn Left  Buy any new Taurus firearm and get a free 1-year NRA membership: a $35 value.Buyer is responsible for USPS Pririty Mail fee of $12.65."

If I remember correctly from my research when I first bought it a few years ago, it is from 1984 or so.  It looks like a bush gun or old 30/30 without the lever action.  Uses the old primer caps (11s I think).  Solid wood (maple I believe) stock and foregrip.  Heavy duty, well build weapon.  Works fine.  Used it up until last year and have gotten a few nice deer with it.  I just purchased a newer, more modern ML this past season that just ended so I just have no need for this one. Does come with the leather strap. No scope. Images are sample photos from internet, but look just like it.  Normal scuffs and such for a weapon of that age. Would make a great first ML for someone who wants to see if they like black powder hunting and doesn't want to spend a lot of money, or for someone who just likes the older and more classic muzzle loaders than the ones today.  Disclaimer: although it fires fine and accurate, I cannot get the nipple off to replace it.  It has been this way since I bought it a few years ago.  Still fires fine, but it could use a replacement eventually.  From what I could find, the Scout had a nipple wrench specific to that make and I never got one.  I'm sure a gunsmith or a person with more experience than me with them will have no issues getting it off and/or replaced.  Will take $60.00 cash or 3 troy ounces of silver as payment. Less than half of what most people are asking for these. Prefer texts, but will also answer emails as I see them.  Will also include some caps, bore butter, and some ball ammo and some TC mini or maxi ball bullets to get you started.  The included accessories come to almost as much as I am asking for the gun.

This is a high quality factory upper professionally built by Seekins Precision. The 10.5"" barrel is Black Nitride / melonite treated which is more accurate and lasts longer than chrome lined.

From the manufacturer:
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block lets you to fine tune your rifle's gas system for smoother cycling and operation. Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability.
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block.
Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes.

The MCSR V2 rail is comfortable, extremely light weight modular rail system that will work in any situation as well as comfortably fit a suppressor inside the rail. The MCSR V2 was designed to make using a quick mounted suppressor easy to install or remove while inside the rail.
The MCSR V2 rail is designed so that the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions will accept all keymod accessories and have two anti-rotation QD positions per side (6total). The internal dimension has increased to 1.8"" to accommodate most suppressors on the market."

Only selling because I'm too lazy to carry this when I can slip a .380 in my pocket. It deserves to get some use and not just collect dust in a safe. Includes 2 mags - 7rd and 9rd, and the usual accessories from Springfield. Also includes 2 Pierce grip extensions.

NOTE: THIS IS A PRE-RECALL XDS9. You can research the voluntary recall issue; IMHO, the grip on this is short enough that you'd have to really make an effort to keep your hand OFF the grip safety and induce the issue (or have midget hands maybe). Anyway, to me, it was a non-issue, so I never sent it in. But you could send it in if you want; Springfield covers shipping both ways - turnaround time is pretty short now (about a week) and they give you a free mag.

All laws apply; must have NC DL and NC CHP (or pistol purchase permit); I'll ask for a bill of sale that we'll both get copies of (only info on bill of sale is firearm info and name, CHP/DL numbers - NO address/tel).

If you want the gun but would prefer I send it in to Springfield (though it really doesn't matter - the current owner can send in, no proof of original purchase required), that's fine - put down a deposit, I'll send the gun in and you can pick it up when it comes back."

I had assumed it was a stainless model, however, after speaking to the Custom Shop Director and Senior Gunsmith at SIG SAUER learned it is in fact a low-glare nickel variant of which very few were ever produced. As you can see it does not have the contrasting controls as the models produced today, instead it is all nickel.

It is super clean, functionally flawless, and remarkably accurate. No stains, scratches, or blemishes of any kind. If it is not a rare piece, it is certainly hard to find. Zero defects. Comes with hard plastic carry case and three factory mags."

Depending on what you have I also have a leather Tagua IWB holster I can include. I would be interested in trading for an LC9s or possibly similar single stack, pocket or subcompact 9mm's. Just looking for something a bit smaller and have been wanting to try out an LC9s for awhile. Will trade straight across for an LC9s with two magazines. Might consider similar single stack 9mm's, such as a SIG p290rs, XDs 9mm, Kahr CM9, or similar, but primarily interested in the LC9s. Would also be interested in 38 special S&W j frames, no Taurus or Charter please. Depending on what you have I may be willing to add a little cash.

I had my gunsmith cut 6 inches off of the barrel and give it a new recessed crown (pictured).  I removed the wooden stock and replaced it with the black Arch Angel stock with adjustable cheek piece, buttpad, and detachable magazine.  I bedded the front lug and back of the stock with Acraglass bedding compound.  A low-profile steel Jmeck scope mount was installed, and the stock had to be fitted to accommodate this mount - then I partially bedded the area to assure a rock-solid fit.  I sent my bolt off to Max Shepherd for a custom bolt job with a satin finish.  The drop-in trigger system by Timney was installed, which GREATLY improved the rifles performance, as well as adding the top thumb safety lever.  Burris XTR 1-inch low scope rings were added, to firmly secure the Nikon Monarch Mildot 2.5-10x42 riflescope w/ sunshade (scope alone is worth $375).  No lapping was needed when scope was mounted, and all screws were torqued to spec with a torque limiting wrench system and BLUE loctite.  I also added a front screw for a bipod.  Czech surplus ammunition rendered the best results from this weapon system, creating 3-round cloverleafs at 100yrds (1/2 inch groups).  However, I have NOT tried any 7.62x54R MATCH ammo or handloads in this rifle..  so who knows how accurate this system can truly become.  I just wanted to create a powerful tactical rifle that I could afford to shoot all day with hardly any worry about ammo costs.  The Archangel magazine provided with the stock does not function well (as is the story with almost all of the early runs of this stock).  There is a fix on youtube that involves baking the magazine in the oven but I have not attempted this or bought one of the new magazines - I simply loaded single rounds from the bench.  I will NOT part-out this rifle and its accessories, so don't ask.  Price $450 for the entire system.

First off it's a new in the box/never fired NAA Guardian chambered for the awesome .25 NNA round! NAA only does a very limited run of the 25 and the bigger 32NAA Guardians. If you don't know the .25naa is a bottleneck cartridge based off the .32acp. But shoots a .25 cal bullet at around 1250 fps!!!!  I had mine on special order for 9 months(also about 20 calls to LGS/NAA). Then I had the pistol engraved by one of the worlds best master engravers. I had the useless factory sights removed, extreme high polish to all surfaces and engraving to at least 70% of the pistol. If your looking at this ad I'm sure you know something about engraving. And I wouldn't have to tell you about the quality of this work. You will also know that my asking price is about what the engraving alone costs. This particular engravers work has been doing this full time for over 40 years. And the value of his work goes up every year. And I know there is an extremely long waiting list and for new work. The pistol comes with a signed letter of authenticity from the artist. I am also including an extra pinky extension mag, Desantis ankle holster, a genuine shark skin wet molded pocket holster and 3 boxes of Corbon .25 NAA ammo. All those extras were well over $200. This would not only make an amazing investment but also a great CCW/Back-Up pistol. Serious LOCAL buyers only!! I have many more pictures and info on engraver for serious buyers. I will only consider face to face transactions for CASH ONLY.  Please email with any questions.  Asking $650 Obo."

This is a Model 64-3, the stainless steel version of the model 10.  Heavy barrel, +P rated, exceptionally accurate, and has the excellent double and single action that Smith's are known for.  It is older so cosmetic condition isnt perfect but I'd say its around 80-85% with typical scuffs and scratches but no rust.   This is a squre butt model and comes with pachmayr grips on it, speedloaders clear them and work fine.

I love old K frames but I far prefer a round butt model for concealed carry.  I would be interested in trading for a round butt Model 10 plus a little cash, or I would trade straight across for a round butt model 10 with a 3 inch barrel.  Would also be interested in a model 36 or 637, or a Ruger SP101 2-3 inch or GP100 3-4 inch which I would be willing to add some cash to.

I far prefer to trade but if you'd like to buy I'd sell for $400, price is pretty firm.  While the Model 10 is still relatively common the 64 is getting harder to find.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 if interested, texts preferred.
