I've done a lot of digging on this shotgun, and here's what I know: It was manufactured in 1911, it's in the first generation of the ""last"" 1897s made. I.e. this model is the final product, Winchester made no improvements or tweaks to this line of shotguns from the time this one was made till they ended production in 1957. It has a 30"" barrel and 5 round tube. In the 104 years this shotgun has been around it has less then 700 rounds through it. My great grandfather kept it hanging on his wall, took it down to clean it, and on rare occasion hunt with it (He preferred using his 1887.).

Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weighs only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation. After close research this is a gen 2 and can be verified by the serial number in the 5000 s I won't list exact I had one fella gunna trade but got all weirded out cuz of the bad rap the gen 1 got well that was only up to number 488 anything under that was a gen 1, mine is the latest gen 2 just about when they went to gen 3 and I like mine I won't go less on it and it has none of those older FTF that gen one had, this is a great shotgun so if you want a awesome combat shotgun here you go.

These are becoming harder to find due to no more gun imports allowed from Russia. So what is here is here until they decide to lift the ban, if they ever do. The trade embargo with Cuba lasted over 50 years, so I have no faith in it being lifted soon.

Must be legal to own guns and able to provide a valid DL. I reserve the right to refuse sale to anyone at anytime. Must be willing to meet in public location.  

May consider partial, multi-gun or total trades. No wall hangers, no odd calibers, no SKS, no 1200 glocks with tons of mods because its still a glock in performance. Trades must either be in 9mm, 12 gauge, 5.7, 223 or 5.56. I can add cash on my end for the right trade. I need to know ahead of time if you are wanting to sign a bill of sale so I can bring 2 copies.
Some stuff I may be interested in is:

- Mossberg 930 spx
- Benelli M4 tactical. Can add cash or a Kahr cw45 with about 500 rounds to make up the  difference.
- Other semi-auto tactical shotguns that holds 7-8 shells.
- Glock 9mms 
- FN fiveseven, 5.7
- Poly furniture ak74
- S&W M&P .22 or 9mm
- Very few AR 15. Must be in the middle to higher end of the spectrum.

I shot a full box of Aguila ammo last year with no issues. Cleaned it and it's just been sitting in my gun case. I have seen this gun, in similar condition, sell anywhere from $450 to $650 on GunBroker. I am asking $350 (grip has a chip near the mounting screw) or $400 trade value. I am not in a rush nor am I hurting to part ways with this gun. If I don't get what I am asking, then I will just keep it. So, with that being said, no low ball offers please. Trade for a Ruger SR22 + cash and/or ammo and/or additional magazines. Trade straight for Ruger SR9 or Ruger LCR chambered in 9mm. I will also do some cash and as much factory brass cased ammo (9mm, .223/5.56, and .22lr) it takes to make up the difference. I apologize for the poor photos as they were taken with my phone. It almost makes the gun look rusted but I assure you there is no rust on this gun. I will provide a bill of sale for in state buyers so we each have a copy. In state buyer will bring Drivers License and CCW permit. I know the CCW isn't a ""requirement"" but it gives me a greater peace of mind.

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own."

I live in Port St Lucie and because of schedules I can't travel too far. 

I've recieved alot of trade requests, so let me narrow this down a little. Cash is King!!!
I have enough Ar's, just to be honest I don't know enough about AK's to trade for one.
I have been looking for a g23 but that would have to be a real nice one for a straight trade,but if you added cash on top, I might be 
interested. I like 22lr rifles and pistols for my kids, I have alot of them so if you have something I don't have lets see it,

	Hey all, 
I have for sale/trade a used but classic rifle. This is a Norinco SKS chambered in the classic 7/62x39. This is a heavily used gun, so it isn’t without its flaws. At some point someone tried to tap it for a scope mount, so there are some drill holes in the very rear of the receiver. Doesn’t effect anything except cosmetics. This also comes with 4 removable higher capacity magazines. One of them is a 20rd mag, and the other are 3rd mags. This also comes with the standard spike bayonet installed. 
	Im mainly looking for cash on this, but would consider trades. mainly looking for doublestack 9mms, revolvers, towards a folder AK, towards a Pistol AR, or perhaps certain lever guns, or PMR30. Also really looking for a decent 30 carbine. Honestly, just shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet in Norman on this if possible. 
Thanks for looking

	Hey all, 
I recently picked up these rings for a build i was completing. However, after mounting these to the gun, it was obvious that my scope would require a different (taller) set of rings to work. As such, these are available for sale/trade. You can see what I paid for them, but I’m just looking to recoup some of what I paid. These are Leopold Medium 1 Inch PRW mounts/rings. Need to be able to meet up in Norman on these. Not really looking for trades, but might consider trades for a case/bag for my AR. 
	Shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there.
Thanks for looking and have a good one!

The 93R17 rifles has the AccuTrigger, a revolutionary design that will forever change the way shooters expect triggers to function. The AccuTrigger gives the shooter the flexibility to set the trigger pull to individual preference without have to pay a gunsmith to adjust it. Also, even when adjusted to its lowest setting, the AccuTrigger is completely safe and cannot accidentally discharge during normal use from being jarred or dropped when maintained and adjusted as intended. A newly designed teardrop safety is an additional feature on rifles with the AccuTrigger. It provides for better acquisition of the safety button and operates more smoothly and quietly. Enhanced accuracy is another benefit of the Savage AccuTrigger, is the crisp, clean light trigger pull allows the shooter to maximize the accuracy potential of the rifle.

Engineered to be ultra-reliable and easy to use, it has all the features that a modern tactical shotgun should offer—and more. And thanks to its compact size (barrel length: 18.5”), it is ideal for negotiating tight spaces as well as for being safely stored away when not needed. Easy Operation, Plenty of FeaturesRight out of the box, the 1301 Tactical features an oversized charging handle, large textured bolt release and an oversized reversible safety button. This makes it easy to use under most weather or lighting conditions—your hands will always be able to positively and safely grip it and operate the controls. Also, the aggressive checkering on the fore-end and stock makes it easy to gain a secure grip even while wearing gloves. As far as sighting, the 1301 Tactical features a robust, protected ghost-ring system with an interchangeable front sight, giving the user the opportunity to adapt it to its intended use, whatever the conditions.Easy Customization to Most Shooters’ NeedsEasy-OperationAlthough perfect out of the box, this tactical shotgun is easily adaptable to most users’ needs, body type and shooting posture. The stock is adjustable for length of pull with provided spacers, so that you can ensure it will always come up naturally to your shoulder and point easily to where you are looking. Drop and cast are adjustable as well. And for extra flexibility in customization and accessorization, the receiver offers a MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail, making it a snap to add tactical accessories without any gunsmithing or modification to the shotgunSuper-Fast ShootingThe integrated BLINK gas operating system, featuring a cross tube gas piston, allows the 1301 Tactical to cycle 36% faster than any other shotgun on the market. This also makes it ideal for three-gun tactical competitions: when shooting the 1301 Tactical, you will simply and objectively have an edge over your competitors. And regardless of the use, with a 1301 Tactical you will always know that you have the best of Beretta to rely upon—with its unmatched 500 years of experience, passion and know-how.FeaturesAdjustable Length of PullA spacer system makes it easy to modify the length of pull to suit most shooters' body size and shooting style. Sling AttachmentAs a best-in-class tactical shotgun, the 1301 Tactical offers the possibility to attach a sling.Aggressive CheckeringThe checkering on the pistol grip is crisp and aggressive; this shotgun may be easily operated without your hands slipping--even while wearing gloves. Trigger Guard and Oversized SafetyThe safety button is oversized and placed right at the trigger guard to ensure easy and positive use. Ghost Ring SightThe solid rear ""ghost-ring"" sight ensures easy and intuitive pointing and target-acquisition even with both eyes open. Oversized Bolt Release and HandleWe have ""supersized"" the controls of the 1301 Tactical so that the shotgun may be easily operated without looking under most conditions. Picatinny RailThe Picatinny rail enables the easy attachment of a variety of sighting accessories without gunsmithing and without any modification to the shotgun. Fore-End Grip CheckeringThe fore-end is aggressively checkered for a secure and positive grip. Standard Capacity MagazineGas SystemThe gas-operating system of the 1301 Tactical features a self-cleaning mechanism, meaning that this shotgun shoots as clean as a recoil-operated gun. Barrel Deep in Fore-EndThe barrel is set deep into the fore-end to ensure closeness to the supporting hand. This makes pointing more natural. Front Blade SightThe sights on the 1301 Tactical are not an afterthought: they have been developed to be easily visible both indoors and outdoors under different lighting conditions. Also, the front sight is interchangeable, should the user prefer a different profile or material.Fxed Cylinder ChokeOptimized for tactical use with different loads.

This car is a blast to drive and gets great gas mileage. 

This one is a GT with custom leather trim package including leather seats, console, trunk cover, sunroof cover, and bra. Has new sunroof as well. 

It was Owned by a Fiero mechanic for most of its life and then a mechanic and now I own it and am a huge Fiero guy. The car is very clean and I have done a lot of work. Here is a list of what's been done

New clutch 3k miles ago
New adjustable shifter cable
New short shifter
New battery box
Fresh top of the line Penzoil platinum synthetic oil and Bosch filter
Fresh tune up 
Fresh coolant 
Installed a switch to turn radiator fan on and off. This is the main problem with fieros over heating and this little switch solves it. 
Does not have a stereo as I took it out to install a new one but have not put it in yet. So it comes with a new kenwood stereo, dash kit, wiring harness, and new pioneer speakers. 


The car runs great and gets 30mpg wen driven conservatively, but still has plenty of power and pulls strong especially at high rpms. That being said I have only romped on it a few times getting on the freeway but 99% of the time it's driven nice and mellow. I have driven in back and forth to Seattle over 30 times and it has done great. 

I also just this month bought a brand new set of 17"" wheels and low profile tires for it. The set was around $1300.  They are what is pictured but do not come with it unless an extra $900 is added. It will come with the original black 15"" wheels and eagle gt tires. 

I am looking to trade for the following and will take part trade and cash, or all cash. I also have a hardly used Apple MacBook Pro with retina display and custom internals that I paid $1700 for and don't ever use that I could sell trade if need to even out a deal.

It has not been used, but it has been taken out of the packaging and hand screwed into my lower receiver to check the fit. It comes with all originally included parts including a QD end plate, hex wrench, and locking collar. It does not come with a spring or buffer. The locking collar is designed specifically for the Sig pistol arm brace (to prevent it from rotating or sliding on the tube). The cool thing about this tube is there is no need for a castle nut; the end plate has a socket to accept a torque wrench in order to tighten it down to the receiver.

Has a few issues but nothing that prevents you from riding. 
Leaks a little oil. 
Needs a new headlight. (Bezel missing and wiring cut)
Speedo cable is broken 
Battery needs mounted properly.

Bike runs like a raped ape. Would be a great beginner bike. Easy to ride and not fast until you hit the power band.

The West may have been tamed and fenced long ago, but its unbridled spirit lives on in this line of traditional big-bore Henry rifles. Don’t let the retro look fool you, these rifles are much more than shootin’ irons for today’s new breed of cowboy. 


They’re also the unbeatable choice of big-game hunters who prefer the traditional look, feel, reliability and accuracy that comes from an authentic Henry rifle. Each Big Boy receiver comes drilled and tapped for easy scope mounting, and the barrels are fitted with fully adjustable sights. 


The traditional 20"" octagonal barrel is outfitted with a classic fully adjustable semi-buckhorn rear sight with a reversible white diamond insert and a brass beaded front sight. The tubular magazine tops off at 10 rounds. Both the straight-grip stock and forearm are crafted of select American walnut accented with a brass barrel band and Henry’s recognizable brass receiver. All have that crisp, smooth action that sets an authentic American-made Henry apart from other lever action rifles on the range and in the woods today.
