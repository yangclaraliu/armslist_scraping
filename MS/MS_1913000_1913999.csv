I've been hesitant to sell it but I just don't shoot it like I used to. This is a Police model shotgun and was issued to Cook County Illinois (see pics). Serial number dates it to 1969 production. It has an 18"" smooth barrel with rifle sights. The full length mag tube holds 6 rounds, 1 in the chamber makes 7 total (the designation 18-7 means 18"" barrel, 7 round cap). This is by far the slickest and most accurate shotgun I've owned. The barrel is threaded to the receiver like a rifle which makes for outstanding accuracy from a smooth bore. I can make one ragged clover leaf shaped hole at 50 yds with el cheapo Wal Mart 1 oz slugs from a rest. The action is slick as snake snot. This shotgun has surprised many Ithaca snobs with it's function and accuracy. Condition wise, I would rate it 90%, none of the typical abuse you see with Police guns, just normal signs of use: the odd scratch here and there, some bluing loss on the mag tube closest the muzzle. It could use a thorough cleaning. If you're looking for a home defense powerhouse or an accurate brush buster, this is your 12ga. I am in no hurry to sell this, just looking to clear some room in the safe. My price is relatively firm so please don't waste your time sending me lowball offers. Besides, this one won't last long. Since this is my last shotgun I will throw in whatever 12ga ammo I have on hand. I know I have a couple boxes of bird shot and a handful of buck and slugs. 

The only trades I will consider would be a .22 pistol (Beretta Neos, Ruger Mark 2, Whitney Wolverine) or vintage Mossberg .22 rifles. Or quality knives (and I don't mean Gerber or Cold Steel)."

I sat the bottom halves on my scope mount and sat my scope in them to see how they fit. It turns out I need the super low mounts and the company I bought them from said they won't return them because they consider them to have been mounted, even though there is not a mark on them and I never tightened anything down.

They are in perfect condition, so I priced them just below normal retail. It should at least save someone some shipping costs."

I now have a house with a permanent reloading bench, so I just don't need it taking up space. This works great for any single stage press (I have a Rock Chucker I used it with) it also worked with my progressive press for straight wall pistol cases. I did not try doing any rifle case on the progressive with it. 

Midway describes it as follows:

Perfect for the reloader with limited working space, or someone looking for solution to portable reloading needs. The Frankford Arsenal Portable Reloading Stand will allow any reloader to easily turn their press into a portable workstation. This 27"" tall stand can be quickly slipped together or taken apart in a matter of seconds. This stand is built to withstand resizing even the largest magnum rifle cases and features a compact and lightweight design making it easy to store and transport. The 9"" x 9"" hard plastic top has a drilling template outlining hole positions for many of today's most popular presses. This reloading stand is perfect for the apartment-dweller or anyone who is limited on space. This stand has a 1-year warranty against manufacturing defects."

There are a few of these floating around, but not many. They made 210,000 Winchester model 77's in the 1950's and 60's, which is quite a few.. But only 10 percent of those were tube-fed...that's 21,000. This is one of those Tube-fed models. I saw one sell on GunBroker last week for $455.00.
This one is in very good condition...very good, and it functions perfect and has every modern feature. They stopped making the Model 77 in the 1960's.
It is grooved for mounting a scope. (same size groove that is on the Ruger 10/22 and all .22 rifles). It has fully adjustable iron sites also. The bolt is on the left side, which is one of the tell-tale model 77 characteristics. It functions flawless and looks great. It will shoot cheap bulk ammo as fast as you can pull the trigger without a hiccup. This is a collector's gun BUT, it is ready to be an everyday shooter also. It looks and feels better than a Ruger. It is a Winchester, back when they were the best. It's not overly heavy and it lacks nothing that a brand new .22 rifle has. You don't feel like your holding an old outdated gun. Model number is 160694"

 Up for sale here is a lot of Nine (9) outboard engines that I have accumulated over the years, and now am selling to make some room in my Garage!
 All of these outboard motors have been stored indoors, in a garage, in proper upright fashion.
 Unless specified, these motors were put away in running condition, with all of the gasoline/oil mix run out of these motors prior to storage. Additionally, I did spray fogging oil into the engines as well. Due to somewhat long term storage (<5 years), it can be assumed that these engines will probably need the carbs cleaned, and some minor maintenance to have them up and running again.
 Also included are two (2) pressure tanks, and one (1) McCulloch steel gas tank, in great condition.

 Engine has good compression, and it shifts smoothly. The powerhead on this motor is very clean, and it does not appear to have many hours on it. It also appears as though the lower unit had been replaced at some point. The lower unit is solid. Prop is in excellent condition.

 1959 Evinrude 18 HP Shortshaft Fastwin
 Serial Number: 15028-13111
 This is a beautiful Evinrude. The motor is very clean inside and out, and has great compression. Nice Propeller.
 This motor has a unique shift handle added to the motor at some point to allow the pilot to shift in and out of gear at the front of the motor versus the standard side. I have never seen this type of shifter before.

 1964 Johnson 3 HP Shortshaft
 Serial Number: JW19M-B126327
 This motor is in excellent condition, and had the complete motor tuned up with all the points, coils, and sparks prior to putting it into storage. Has built in gas tank. Prop and lower unit are in excellent condition. This motor has been repainted the marsh-grass green color.

 1958 Johnson 10 HP Sea Horse
 Model Number: QD-19
 Serial Number: 1749131
 This motor looks faded, but is a strong runner. I bought this motor from a marine dealership in southern Iowa, where it had just been freshly tuned. This motor runs very strong. Included is the pressure tank for this motor.

 1949 Johnson 5 HP 
 Model Number: TD-20
 Serial Number: 610559
 Motor has some dings in the gas tank, but otherwise is fully there. I bought this from my neighbor, who received it from his father. This motor has been in storage for over thirty years, in the basement of his house. It has great compression, and was put away running. I also have the original owners manual for this motor. Good prop. Original shear pins are still located on the handle!

 1953 Johnson 5 HP
 Model Number: TN-28
 Serial Number: 804371
 This motor is a parts motor only. Does not run, and is not fully intact. The lower unit is good, and maybe some additional parts. No prop

 1974 Mercury 4.5 outboard Shortshaft
 This is a nice motor. Had the lower unit on it professionally replaced a couple of years ago. With full tune up. I started it up a little over a month ago, and it ran fine; However, the water is not pumping as much as it should be. The impeller needs re-inspection.

 1962 Fleet Scott McCulloch 14 HP Outboard
 Serial Number: 63REDACTED
 This motor is intact, however does not run. There is good compression, but no spark to the motor. The throttle handle needs repair, but I have the replacement handle and gear mechanism for it. This motor does not appear to have many hours on it. All the rubber on it is good. All emblems and stickers are good and intact. Comes with the ""Bail O Matic"" self bailer for the floor of your boat. Additionally comes with correct metal 6 gallon gas tank, and hose with the proper fittings. The shear pins are still on the front of the motor!

 I live in Woodridge, Illinois; which is located approximately 30 miles west of Chicago off of interstate I-355, between I-55 and I-88.
 I do not have the vehicle capacity to deliver these outboards!!
 I will, however, help load them into your vehicle for transport.

I even went to Harbor Freight and bought a Cheap Sand Blaster gun and some glass bead media, that worked beautifully on the slide stop ONLY! Gave it that nice satin finish but all other parts it barely did anything to.  Oh an by the way, I soaked all of it in Vinegar for 2 days first then tried sanding with 2000 grit wet/dry sandpaper all to no avail.  I believe the slide stop cam out nice because it was a different type of metal than the other parts. I did google how to remove Sig Sauers Nitron finish and there is little to no info.

Well anyway, I have to do something now. I like the satin stainless look. Can anyone recommend any near by the Detroit area that does this?

Gave it that nice satin finish but all other parts it barely did anything to. Oh an by the way, I soaked all of it in Vinegar for 2 days first then tried sanding with 2000 grit wet/dry sandpaper all to no avail. I believe the slide stop cam out nice because it was a different type of metal than the other parts. I did google how to remove Sig Sauers Nitron finish and there is little to no info.

 Well anyway, I have to do something now. I like the satin stainless look. Can anyone recommend any near by the Detroit area that does this?

Specifications
All of our products are manufactured using better then mil-spec tolerances. We took the original mil-spec tolerances for the AR-15 products and decided that wasn’t good enough. Our engineering department went to work and what we ended up with is the exceptional tolerances and fit we have become so well known for. Not only will you find that our products interchange with any other mil-spec components, we will do it with a higher grade of fit.

Stripped lowers are considered firearms by the ATF and must be shipped to FFL in your area. I will ship this gun to any FFL in any state where this firearm is legal to own. If you need a shipping quote please email me the zip code (or as close as possible) that the gun will be shipped to. Payments can be made by money order, certified check, personal check (gun will be held until check clears for orders shipped out of state), or cash. Price does NOT include SC sales tax for orders picked up from the shop or shipped to other SC dealers."

I would prefer a nice flat top, No cheap stuff pleae, These colts bring a premium but im not one of these jackass gougers either. Just let me know what you have and we can go from there.

I am thinning out my collection a little bit more. I have several 91/30 Izhevsk round receiver Mosin Nagants that I want to get rid of. First come / first served on getting to hand pick the best from the lot. Once these few hand picked rifles are sold I will stop the sales and keep the rest for myself.  If you buy a rifle I will throw in a 440 round spam can of silver tip milsurp ammo for $125. The spam cans are sealed for long time storage. I can guarantee you will not find silver tip ammo cheaper than this. Yes, you might find a cheaper Mosin but it is well worth a few extra $$$ to get to hand pick one that you get to see instead of using mail order, paying for shipping, paying an FFL fee, and then finding out it was ran over by a tank in 1945 and is horrible looking. My rifles look great and all are still packet in cosmoline by the Russians who were waiting for WWIII to begin. Ask around, people know I have a quality collection. I will only sell a few rifles so make sure you jump on this. All rifles have matching numbers (including the bayonet !!!), a cleaning kit, and an oil/solvent canteen.

One note on the Mosins. I have heard that prices are going to be going up again very soon. It seems like every time you turn around the Mosin supply is dwindling and the prices are jumping. I've heard everything from they are being destroyed in Russia to the guy who is selling them for the Russian military is going to continue raising the prices due to demand as the last few are sold. If I list any more of my collection in the future it will be at an increased price so you might as well jump on one now.

*** Oh, if you do not put I LOVE MOSIN somewhere in your email to me I will NOT reply. This is to keep the spam down. Again, if you do not put I LOVE MOSIN somewhere in your email to me I will NOT reply. ***

It fires the 7.5 x 55mm cartridge which I have a box that ill include with the rifle. I've never seen rounds for this rifle in the store, mainly purchased online through various websites, 60 rounds are usually purchased for about $30 - $40 even at today's prices and are readily available. The bore and rifling are in fantastic condition. The action is the most unique part of the rifle being a straight pull design instead of your typical bolt rifle action. The sling on the rifle is the original leather sling it came out of the factory with. All serial numbers are matching, verified serial numbers on various websites and it puts this gun at a production date of 1940.
