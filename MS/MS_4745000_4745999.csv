I've just been thinking I'd rather have a bolt action as I enjoy shooting them more than semi-autos. 

I built the lower from a stripped Palmetto State Armory lower, but ordered the complete upper through a dealer directly from Rock River Arms. The RRA upper has the same 20"" stainless steel barrel as RRA's National Match rifles. When sold as a complete rifle, RRA guarantees the Predator Pursuit as sub-1 MOA accuracy. I can verify that this rifle is capable of 0.5 MOA when shot from a locked down bench rest, and I can get between 0.75-0.9 MOA 5-shot groups out of this rifle off a bipod using handloads (if I can channel my inner marksman). Occasional groups where I can keep myself in line have been 0.6-0.7 MOA. I can provide targets and load data to support these claims. I have been able to shoot this rifle out to 470yds where I had 5 bowling pins set up. Was able to hit 3/5 pins on the first shot on repeated occasions with low/no wind. Approximately 600-800 rounds fired and is well taken care of. This is an excellent rifle for anyone looking to buy an AR purpose built for magnified optics. 

In the interest of transparency I will disclose that two winters ago the rifle fell off my truck tailgate when I was out coyote hunting and because of that the scope has a small ding in the tube. I have since run a tracking test and can verify there are no issues. The scope tracks well and holds zero. Essentially just a small cosmetic blemish. Armslist will only let me post one photo. More photos can be sent to email. 

Parts list & prices at time of purchase...

          Upper Half:
RRA 20"" Predator Pursuit rifle length upper (.223 Wylde chamber, 1:8 twist) - $675, price for same upper has since increased due to RRA adding railed handguard
Nikon M-223 3-12x42mm optic (Nikoplex reticle and ""Rapid Action Turret"") - $450
Nikon M-223XR 20moa mount - $70
BCM Gunfighter Charging Handle (Large Latch) - $50
          Lower Half:
Magpul PRS Stock (added extended buttpad) - $260
Ergo grip w/Palm shelf - $50
PSA Lower Receiver with parts - $100
Geissele G2S-E two-stage trigger - $190 (has to be felt to be understood...totally worth the price when compared to a mil-spec trigger)

Total invested: $1,845


Asking $1,400 OBO for complete turnkey package and will provide multiple recipes for handloads if interested. 
***Rifle has never seen a handload above recommended Lyman data, and all loads were worked up from 10% below maximum recommended charge with no overpressure issues. 

Willing to separate complete upper w/optic & mount for $850.

If upper gets sold, lower can be sold separately or possibly parted out. WILL NOT sell lower or lower components unless upper has already been sold. Will probably relist lower/lower components if upper sells separately.

Pistol is in like new condition with minimal wear. I purchased this pistol four months ago from a friend who used it for home defense. He claimed to not have shot it very much and I have put less than 100 rounds through it since I bought it. I would say it has had less than 500 rounds fired. It is cleaned and oiled every time it is used. There is nothing wrong with this pistol and I do not have to sell. I am primarily selling to fund another project but I'm open to trades. This pistol in in excellent shape, please do not offer me junk. I have more pictures, if you would like to see something specific let me know.


I will sell it for $650 outright and throw in 100 rounds of American Eagle 230 Grain FMJ. I will pay the transfer fee but I WILL NOT ship and I can meet you at gun shop of your choosing within an hour and a half from Everett, PA

Purchased brand new in 1960, this fine rifle has remained unfired and it is absolutely pristine and flawless. This was my Uncle's rifle, he was an attorney. He dreamed of hunting in Africa, but passed away before getting the chance. I inherited all of his hunting rifles and I am keeping most of them. I will not be using this rifle and would much prefer it go to someone who will shoot it and use it for dangerous game.
This rifle was designed, born, and bred for hunting the world's toughest and most dangerous game.

This rifle has remained unfired, always kept in climate controlled environment, and has been treated like royalty for over 50+ years. I absolutely challenge anyone reading this to find a nicer version of this particular rifle model from anywhere in the USA or world. I am very confident that this Browning FN Safari in 458 Win Mag is one of the finest specimens in existence in the world. You simply will not find one in this impeccable condition. These early Belgium Browning Safaris have zero saltwood issues and very the desirable long extractor. They just keep going up in value, so you will never lose money on these rifles, especially a gorgeous specimen like this one.

Feel free to ask any questions that you may have. If you need specific photos of some part of the rifle let me know. I can only post a limited amount of pictures here at Armslist. The buyer of this rifle will not be disappointed, I am certain of it. I am not a skilled photographer but did my best with the pictures. The glare of the flash created spots in the pictures, you can be sure there is not a mark on the rifle whatsoever.

Drop me a line if you have interest."
