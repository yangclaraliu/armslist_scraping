Details: 
1. Kahr P9. Research this gun, it is Kahr's high end polymer line! This is NOT the cheap CW9. Two magazines original box with blank warranty registration form. I can add a holster and ammo for the right deal if needed.
2. Phoenix Arms HP22. Will fire. Scratches on finish. Needs recoil spring replaced. And has no working magazine. The only magazine I currently have has no spring, follower or floor plate. Magazines are on the Phoenix Arms website for $16 as well as 4 packs of recoil springs for around $5. 
3. Polish P-64. This is a project gun it is missing parts.  If you can find the parts, it's a simple reassembly. Some idiot (me) took the gun apart when I knew nothing about guns and failed to put it back together. Over time and moving, parts got lost. I have a full list of all parts needed if interested.
Trade Interest: Smith & Wesson M&P Shield 9mm with extras. 1911 .45 all steel any size. Any Glock 9mm with extras. Ruger LC9,LC9s, SR9, SR9c with extras. Will entertain any firearms offer except for muzzle loaders. Main interest is handguns.
Trade Value: $700 for entire package.

I could primarily use the money, but trades will be considered. Bought this brand new about 3 or 4 years ago, and only put 25 rounds of .357 through it. It had been my first time shooting this caliber and I must say, it packed more of a punch than I was expecting haha. I had plans to bring it back and put more down, I just never got around to it. Since then I got the Hogue grip to help ease the felt recoil, but never got to test it out. Long story short, it's in excellent condition with barely, if any at all, powder residue on the cylinder. I made sure I cleaned it as soon as I got back from the range because I know it can stain quite easily. I have 2 holsters for it, but never carried it. I also have 25 rounds of Hornady 125gr FTX JHP. So in short, it basically turned into a bedside gun. Comes with everything from factory including the case. Now brass tax, this pistol retailes for about $650 on any given day, and I listed the MSRP below for reference, I UNDERSTAND I WILL NOT GET THAT KIND OF OFFER, that simply means don't expect me to jump on an offer that is $300 or equivalent in a trade. Simply won't happen. I apologize in advance if it tales me a little while to respond, it's just that some emails go to spam and I keep forgetting to check that folder, but I'll try my best.

I had assumed it was a stainless model, however, after speaking to the Custom Shop Director and Senior Gunsmith at SIG SAUER learned it is in fact a low-glare nickel variant of which very few were ever produced. As you can see it does not have the contrasting controls as the models produced today, instead it is all nickel.

It is super clean, functionally flawless, and remarkably accurate. No stains, scratches, or blemishes of any kind. If it is not a rare piece, it is certainly hard to find. Zero defects. Comes with hard plastic carry case and three factory mags."

ULTIMAK XUMM1B   MODEL M1-B    FOR USE WITH A RED DOT OR SCOPE.....

UltiMAK M1-B-- A rock-solid platform for your premium optics. With the increasing popularity of the AK based rifles in three gun competitions, the need for a handy, light, completely reliable high speed sighting system has resulted in the UltiMAK M1-B optic mount. Its Picatinny style rail is positioned well below the iron sight axis, making this the lowest optic mount available for the AK. With a tubular sight mounted low, you will be able to use your optic without a comb riser and still use your regular hold. The system allows for co witnessing (the ability to use your iron sights right through a 1x sight as a back-up sighting system) when used with a tubular reflex sight. This heavy duty mount replaces the original steel gas tube and upper handguard, so it adds less than one ounce to the weight of the rifle, making it by far the lightest optic mount installation in the world. The forward positioning of the optic gives you faster, easier and more natural targeting while maintaining your full field of view. Multiple target or moving target engagements, with both eyes open, become second nature."

This was mounted onto a mount by Burris at the factory, but has never been mounted to a firearm and thus never fired.

I had assumed it was a stainless model, however, after speaking to the Custom Shop Director and Senior Gunsmith at SIG SAUER learned it is in fact a low-glare nickel variant of which very few were ever produced. As you can see it does not have the contrasting controls as the models produced today, instead it is all nickel.

It is super clean, functionally flawless, and remarkably accurate. No stains, scratches, or blemishes of any kind. If it is not a rare piece, it is certainly hard to find. Zero defects. Comes with hard plastic carry case and three factory mags."

I Purchased this gun from the original owner about 2 years ago.  He never fired 1 shot out of this rifle.  He put the hammer spur and planned to buy a scope, but never did.  The lock and hammer spur bag is missing, but original paperwork, bag, and box is here.  After I received the rifle it has been in my safe for 2 years also unfired.  I had regular 357s and just could never bring myself to shoot this beautiful weapon.  This gun is 100 percent perfect.  Never fired once, but it has been racked maybe 4-5 times at most.  I am listing as LNIB just because I feel when a gun leaves the store it is used, BUT you will not find a better example.  One sold last week used with no box on GB for 2550.  I have listed link below to check.  Not taking into account the shipping and FFL charge.  I think this one is easily worth 3k if I listed on gunbroker.  But I'll let it go for 2500.00 and save the gb fees and headache before I list it to make more.  I will ship for 50 extra insured to local FFL.  Ill meet face to face in Georgia. If from Georgia I would trade for a Python in box or 4-5 Smith revolvers.

I can meet you from Ft. Walton to Pensacola area. These are milspec 5.56 green tip rounds which are straight from the factory, 2014 production. These were not produced using reloaded brass and it is some of the finest quality green tip ammunition available. More ammo can be purchased on request, I have 4,000 rounds but I'm trying to keep some for myself.

This ammo will not last long, the government is in the process of banning green tip ammo.

Great condition with box and 2 mags. The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols."

Genuine factory colt upper. These are hard to find, I know alot of people say this about some guns but this is actually one that is not just floating around your everyday market. Comes in the Colt box, with everything it did new iincluding the factory Matech flip up sight. I put it on a pistol lower and ran 60 flawless rounds through it. It has a blemish in the top rail from the trijicon mount rubbing it, just giving a full disclosure on it.  I paid $1049 for this upper not long ago, so I won't be interested in lowball offers. My price is unbeatable.
