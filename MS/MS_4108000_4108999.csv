I have a Gen 1 Sig Brace AND a pistol buffer too I am wanting to sell, I have no use for them anymore!

I have the original box, paperwork and strap or it as well. 

The brace sells for $160 new and mostly between $120-$140 online across various retailers. 

The pistol buffer tube is used and SHOWS sign of wear, i had bought it used, it's marred and had been cross threaded by the original owner. It STILL works and fits tightly in any mill-spec receiver. I have shot over 1000 rounds using it and never had any kind of wobble.

This is a package deal, I will not part it out sorry. 

With this in mind you are getting a Gen 1 Sig Brace no markings or excessive wear, a pistol buffer tube. The two fit together! You may need to use talcum powder to help the brace slide over but it does fit!

I'm asking to consider the package for at $120, the brace sells for $120-160 and the new buffer sells for $40-50, so you're getting a $200+ deal at 60% of the cost.

The price is negotiable but no low balls.. I will take trades as well.. please be an equal value or be ready to add cash."

Buffalo Bore Ammo - PREMIUM 35 WHELEN SUPERCHARGED 225 gr. SPTZ-BT (2800 fps) - 20 Round Box












Again, as per customer request, Buffalo Bore has developed two new 35 Whelen loads. Item 42A features a Sierra 225gr. SPTZ-BT bullet @ 2705 fps out of my Remington 700. (24 inch bbl)  At the expected impact velocities, this bullet will mushroom readily, but hold together on large game like bull elk. We recommend this load for use on smallish big game (like whitetail deer) through Yukon Moose and Bison. However, on very tough (other than broadside) angling shots on large big game, we recommend the use of our item 42B, which features a 225gr. Barnes TSX bullet @ 2654 fps out of the same rifle. The TSX load is a bit slower than the Sierra load because the long-for-weight all copper TSX uses up more case/powder capacity than the shorter Sierra bullet of the same weight.

If you desire the deepest possible penetration from an expanding bullet in 35 Whelen, the 225gr.TSX bullet delivers. It will out penetrate a 250gr. typical premium partition bullet, but gives the advantage of higher velocity, flatter trajectory and reduced recoil of the lighter 225gr. bullet. You can use this TSX load for bad angle (quartering or going straight away) shots on the largest North American big game.

This ammo is designed to be the highest quality, most powerful/versatile, 35 Whelen ammo, in the world. It exhibits sub MOA accuracy in our test rifle."

The perfect compliment to your maglite solvent trap project, or approved form 1 build.  These are completely legal, as long as you do not drill through them before receiving approval for your form 1 build and tax stamp from the BATF.

These steel freeze plugs are formed on a 20-ton press to maintain a complete forming, and a consistent shape.  These have concentric cones, with a consistent angle and the center point clearly marked for easier installation.  The cone is formed at roughly a 50 degree angle to the perpendicular center line of the walls.

I also offer center marked (not formed) freeze plugs. 

I do not sell the C-Cell plugs, or recommend that size.  It has a dramatically reduced internal volume, which reduces it's usefulness.  Also, the plugs being used for the C-cell are flared out to fit.  This means that only the outermost point of the plug is making contact with the wall, and leaves it prone to turning out of position if exposed to pressure.  In my experience, you'll be much further ahead, and safer, if you use the D-cell instead.

I will ship up to 7 sets for a flat rate of $6.  I will not ship outside of US."

One defining feature of this pistol is the 'tip-up' barrel. The barrel pivots on a pin under the muzzle so that the chamber may be loaded with the slide in the closed position. It is released by a lever on the left side of the frame, above the trigger. This simplifies loading, unloading, and checking load status, as the slide can be difficult for some people to retract by hand.

Not Armor-Piercing By Any Definition
M855 is not considered armor-piercing by either federal law, nor by the military forces of the world.

The armor-piercing ammunition used by the U.S. military is M995, which uses a solid tungsten core to pierce the armor of enemy fighting vehicles and modern military body armor.

Unlike the standard ball M855 round, the M995 is actually armor-piercing in function and under federal law, with a solid tungsten penetrator for use against lightly-armored vehicles. It is not sold to civilians.

Under federal law, M855 ball ammunition doesn’t meet either part of the two-part definition of ""armor piercing"" in the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Action (LEOPA) of 1986 that the Obama Administration is attempting to pervert.

18 U.S.C. 921(a)(17)(B) provides:

(B) The term “armor piercing ammunition” means—

(i) a projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper or depleted uranium; or

(ii) a full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile.
Far from being a ""projectile or projectile core,"" ""constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper or depleted uranium,"" the core of the M855 is soft lead, like the vast majority of bullets. 80-percent of the M855's  total weight is the bullet's lead core.

The projectile is also neither ""designed nor intended for use"" in a handgun, but was designed in the 1970s for rifles with 20"" barrels, when AR-15 pistols didn't even exist. Further, the jacket of the projectile is far less than, ""25 percent of the total weight of the projectile."" Try about 5-percent.

The M855 isn't ""armor-piercing"" by military definition, and isn't close to meeting any part of the definition for being classified as ""armor-piercing"" under U.S. federal law.

The Obama Administration is blatantly lying, and the worst part of that lie is that they are actually increasing the risk to law enforcement officers, but essentially forcing everyone to acquire more deadly bullets.

M855 is LESS damaging than almost any other common 5.56 NATO bullet
The M855 is considered to be standard ball ammunition which causes less damage to human beings than virtually every other kind of 5.56 ammunition, including the all-lead 55-grain M193 round that it replaced.

NATO actually pushed the United States to adopt the Belgian-designed SS109 cartridge as the M855 because they felt that the American-made 55-grain M193's tendency to yaw and then fragment was ""inhumane"" and possibly illegal under the Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration 4 against ""bullets which expand or flatten easily in the human body.""

80% of the weight of the M855 bullet is the darker lead core of the projectile, and the thin jacket is nearly irrelevant. The mild steel insert keeps the bullet from deforming and causing serious injuries, unlike prior and more recent designs.

Yes, you read that correctly: the M855 was pushed on the U.S. military as a less deadly bullet.

American forces complained regularly about the spectacular failure of the M855 to stop enemy combatants, at least since the 1993 raid turned rescue mission in Mogadishu, Somalia, that became famous in the movie, ""Black Hawk Down.""

The M855 cartridge was a spectacular failure in the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, Somalia, where Delta Force operators firing the round out of CAR-15 carbines reported that Somali militiamen took multiple rounds without immediate effect. The 10.5"" barrels of the carbines did not let the cartridge attain enough velocity to cause significan damage.[/caption]

The failure of the M855 in short-barrel rifles like the CAR-15, the M4 carbine, and in M16s (when the bullet dropped below 2,500 FPS velocity) led the U.S. Army, SOCOM, and the Marines to develop different and more effective bullets, which have now almost completely replaced the M855 in combat.

The failure of the M855 to generate fight-stopping wounds is even more pronounced in AR-15 pistols with 7.5"" barrels that the Obama Administration is attempting to portray as such a significant threat to law enforcement. At the low velocities of a pistol, the M855 creates narrow ""icepick"" type wounds which do not incapacitate attackers, and which are far easier to heal from than almost any other 5.56 or .223 Remington bullet.

Put another way, the M855 is is high demand for punching paper targets, but stinks at stopping people.

By forcing this ammunition off the market with it's false and spiteful reclassification of M855 as ""armor-piercing,"" the Obama Administration is ensuring the widespread adoption of more deadly bullets for law-abiding citizens and criminals alike."

Don't you think he would have done an executive order on the ARs after Newtown if he wasn't being paid off by the NRA. Use your common sense people. Every dummy and his brother about wet there pants ran out and bought ARs like they were going to be banned and even started putting together Junker ARs  and now they are not worth a pile of CRAP. Ill bet anyone on here 1000$ bucks this will never happen and then the market will be flooded with the so called penetrator ammo and it will be worth about a 10 cents a round. ANY TAKERS!

In 1943, Franco adopted these Mausers as the standard for their infantry. This is also referred to as the M43 Mauser short rifle. These are large ring Mausers that shoot the powerful 8mm round and are known for their high durability.
This particular one has matching receiver and bolt (as you can see from the pictures) and is in fine shape. The boor looks really good and has strong rifling.

I am only selling it because I bought a 1911 and no longer have a need for it.  I am the original owner.

Their rugged, medium-sized frame and cushioned grip system permit repeated firings of powerful .357 Magnum cartridges with minimal shooter fatigue. Because the GP1 also accepts the less-expensive, lighter-recoiling .38 Special cartridges, it is both economical and pleasant for practice at the range. Easy on the hand and budget, all GP1 revolvers boast solid steel sidewalls (no side-plates), and frame widths that are increased with extra steel in critical areas that support the barrel, making them rugged, reliable, and dependable. This model has a 6. blued barrel, a recoil-reducing, rubber Hogue Monogrip, and fixed front and adjustable rear sights. **This is a special order item and IS NOT STOCKED IN OUR STORE and full payment must be made prior to us submitting the order.

I have a pre1964 (1956 manufacture date according to serial number) Winchester 1894 in 30-30. It is in excellent condition, with good bore, no rust, whatsoever, and minimal handling marks. Everything is 100% original. No refinishing, no scope, no drill holes for scope. 

I will set the price at $750 OBO. I am far from an expert in older firearm values, so I'm definitely open to offers. Feel free to send me any inquiries, pic requests, and/or offers. I'm open to trades, but looking for nothing specific. I'm generally interested in modern handguns in .45, and always interested in gold/silver. I can add cash/trade if I'm trading up. 

I'm in south OKC, and would have no problem with someone coming to examine the firearm in person before making an offer. Thank you!

Stored in my garage, during the cold months of the year my garage is heated and sled winterized in the off seasons. Clean Title, I'm only the second owner of the sled. Front end Rebuilt and completely gone over, Reverse, heated Hand Grips that can be adjusted from low to high Heat that run from the throttle. New headlight bulb installed, and new Brake lightbulb, Like New Track with newer Rear Suspension that was recently installed. I Replaced the original Skis with nice Carbides and newer Front suspension recently installed. Brand New pull start installed. Just did Aimsoil sythentic inceptor Oil change also Crank Case fliud changed and re-lubed case using Aimsoil sythentic 2Stroke crankcase fluid. Carbs were just cleaned, motor sounds Awesome especially when giving some throttle. All of the Plastic+Decals are in Great condition! It's got a New Belt in the Motor now, nice New spare to go with it. New Spark Plugs and a handful of new spare plugs. Have about a quart of Aimsoil Synthetic Inceptor 2-stroke oil leftover from oil change. Seat has no rips or tears and is still in overall good condition. Besides the sled I have extra's such as Spare track for the 583, the track is pre drilled for studs. Full Rear Newer Aftermarket Suspension and once installed it's suppose to have the sled sit 3 to 4inches higher up, paid $250 just for the unused rear suspension. I Have a Original Clear Plastic Windshield to go with the plastic hood also Ski Doo brand Bumper Stand/Jack to keep your sled lifted for maintenance and for adjusting suspension, greasing etc. Also Original Ski Doo Factory Sled Parts Kit to go with the sled for changing S-plugs your belts etc. I was looking to get around 1,200$ for all but recently had 3 vehicles totaled due to a home accident with a tree and there for price drop down, Firm price of $800 for my 583 with all extra's listed. Extra's would add up to over 400plus dollars let alone the Mint Sled and Money recently into the sled.

The P220 SAS comes with the new SIG SAUER® Custom Shop Grips and is covered by a Limited Lifetime Warranty
I purchased a Pelican Storm IM2050 case I was going to use for this pistol but never did. Foam is uncut. I will include it as well or sell it for $45
Will let everything go for $900 which is a steal. I have not seen this exact model sell under $1000."

Just purchased new on February 26, 2015 and shot only once (under 40 rounds). Shoots great and I grouped really well. After shooting, I realized that I made a mistake in buying it and that I am more appreciative of the single action and trigger pull of/on my Kimber Ultra Carry and am not fond of the striker action on the XDS, but that's just me. I'll meet you at Front Range Gun Club in Loveland, Colorado to transfer the gun to you or...
