Sitting on top of the pistol is a silver Leupold 2.5-8x32 extended relief scope with minor ring marks that can be rubbed out if so desired.

Pistol will come with over 300 rounds of factory 460 S&W magnum, 200+ rounds of 454 Casull and 150+ rounds of 45 Colt.  I may split some of the ammo if someone is interested in it alone.

Background: I am the original owner.  This this pistol and the ammo were won as part of a “Friends of the NRA” raffle.  Smith & Wesson produced a limited edition, custom-engraved Model 460XVR revolvers. Only 1,100 of the limited edition revolvers were created and made available. This gun is number 0977/1100 and comes with the Smith & Wesson blue case as well as everything that came with it from the factory.

Named ""2007 Gun of the Year"" by Friends of the NRA. 8-3/8 inch barrel and on the side-plate of the revolver, a custom-designed embellishment depicts an eagle and the American flag along with the National Rifle Association insignia. 

One of the reasons they chose the Smith & Wesson 460XVR revolver was the versatility of the ammunition that can be used. The revolver offers shooters multi-caliber capabilities, which includes .45 Long Colt, .454 Casull and .460 S&W Magnum. The highest velocity production revolver available, the 460XVR is capable of launching a 200-grain bullet at 2,300+ fps, while delivering over 2,400 ft/lbs of muzzle energy. The .460 S&W Magnum revolver features Sorbathane recoil-reducing grips and an interchangeable muzzle compensator that dramatically reduces felt recoil. The 460XVR retains original X-Frame features including a crisp single-action and smooth double-action trigger, 5-round capacity cylinder and a durable stainless steel frame with a satin finish. The commemorative revolver is standard with an adjustable rear sight and a HI-VIZ light-gathering green dot front sight."

Not sure what I was thinking, but I wanted $600 obo.

I am selling my AR Pistol.  This started out as a CMMG AR, but has morphed into something different over time.  I decided I wanted an SBR, so I was going to use my CMMG lower.  To get away with using it now, I put a pistol buffer tube on it, to make it a ""pistol"".  Because I have been traveling in and out of the country, I just haven't sat down to do the form, and get lower engraved.  I was going to get my info engraved under the trigger well, almost invisible when filled in black, but still legal.  To finish the SBR portion, you just need to fill out the BATF paperwork, get the receiver engraved, pay the tax, get the stamp, and put a stock on it.  That’s it.

About the weapon.....  CMMG MK-4 lower.  Aero Precision upper.  Daniel Defense 10.3"" Government issue 5.56 SBR barrel (1:7 twist).  Magpul handguard with light rail (side mounted for thumb activated light (will include for $75 - INFORCE).  It has a modified stock trigger, still 2 stage, but much better break when it fires.  KNS Anti-rotation pins.  Yankee Hill quick takedown pins.  Rainier Arms AXTS charging handle (I will subtract $50 if you want a stock charging handle).  It has a ""knock off"" Noveske Flaming Pig flash thingie.  I will also include 2 Magpul parts kits magazines (will not have floor panels).

I had a SIG SB15 Pistol Brace, but a family member visiting decided that he NEEDED it, so he removed it before he left, and stuck a $50 bill on the pistol tube.  He got a good deal.......   Now, since the BATF said that the brace doesn’t change it from a pistol to an SBR, I have seen many, MANY people shooting ""pistols"" shouldered using the brace.  I would think it would not be comfortable, but functional.

*  I wiped it down with oil before I took the pictures, and I didn’t notice it until I was doing the pictures that not all of the oil was gone.

** For free, I will throw in 2 Magpul floor plates."

280,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4344280,For Sale:  4X32 BROWE TACTICAL OPTIC W/7.62MM CHEVRON RETICLE,"IL, Illinois, United States",$ 700,"Listed On: Monday, May 18, 2015",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The 4x32 BROWE Tactical Optic (BTO) was desinged to put all of the features and componets of the BROWE Combat Optic into a Military-grade forged 7075-T6 Aircraft Aluminum-alloy housing. The components, glass, and electronics are identical to the items used in manufacturing of the work class 4x32 BROWE Combat Optic. The forged 7075-T6 aircraft aluminum alloy housing provides for a nearly indestructible optic system ideally suited for military, police, and sportsmen. It delivers state-of-the-art optic that delivers highest quality optical glass, high precision machining, with a rugged military design. Red chevron reticle and A.R.M.S. QD mount.
Single Intuitive Control (SIC) 
The operation is simple and intuitive. The idea is revolutionary. The system rests in the OFF position or SLEEP mode. The first press of the SIC button puts the system into AUTOMATIC mode. In this mode, the LED automatically adjusts to the ambient light conditions using the Target Light Sensor Technology. The second press of the button puts the system in MANUAL mode. It starts at the brightest day setting and cycles through ten (10) day and three (3) night vision settings with every press of the SIC button. Holding the SIC button for more than three (3) seconds puts the system back to SLEEP mode, conserving battery life. Hitting the button again puts it back into AUTOMATIC mode. Simple. Intuitive. Effective.

Target Light Sensor Technology 
Through extensive R&D, we’ve discovered that mounting a sensor in the light path behind the objective lens magnifies the incoming light and provides greater accuracy of the target light levels. In AUTOMATIC mode, this key feature allows the BTO reticle to be properly illuminated even when the user and target are in dissimilar light and avoids sensor errors caused from ambient light. More importantly, as an operator is on the move, the BTO will continuously adjust automatically. For example, light levels can vary extremely from streets to dark alleys and buildings. In today’s urban warfare, when a nanosecond can make a difference, there’s no time to search for a poorly illuminated reticle or make manual illumination adjustments.

BCO Microcontroller 
The BTO Microcontroller is the brain of the operating system. Its custom program reliably and easily controls all of the electronic features. Unique to the industry, the BTO microcontroller is capable of being re-flashed with alternative programs via a sealed flash port on the back of the battery housing. This port can also be used to attach accessories such as a momentary remote tape switch.

Vibration Motion Sensor 
The vibration motion sensor conserves precious battery life by putting the electronics in SLEEP mode if motion is not detected after two hours. Additionally, if the SIC button is accidentally depressed in a carrying case or storage rack, the system automatically turns off after three (3) seconds. The BTO has an average battery usage life of 2000+ hrs. with a minimum of 775hrs. on max brightness. In SLEEP mode, the battery will maintain the full 10 year life expectancy of a Surefire Lithium 123A battery.

Housing Designed to Accept Accessories 
Versatility is at the forefront of the BTO housing design. So you’ll find multiple areas for mounting “add-on” accessories. For starters, the OD of the eye-housing is a machined 30mm diameter surface with a 2mm groove for locking on dust covers or an assortment of other accessories. Plus, two mounting bosses are placed on top of the housing for attaching additional accessories. On the objective end, we added a 42mm x 3mm OD groove and threaded the ID for added versatility for accessories, such as anti-reflection devices, dust covers, and/or laser filters.Dust covers are for display only and not included in this auction .

	Hey everyone,
I have available for trade/sale an awesome and hard to find little 5.56 pistol. This is a Kel-Tec PLR-16. It is chambered in 5.56/223. This is a really hard to find pistol and they are literally a blast to shoot. This one has a brand new OEM Kel-Tec hand guard with picatinny rail. In addition, I have installed an aftermarket single point sling adapter (way better than the OEM janky one). It also has a Levang Linear Compensator installed. This helps with follow up shots and directs the blast forward so as to not be so hard on the shooter. This will come with the single point sling, single point sling adapter, Linear Compensator, one metal 30rd magazine, factory 10rd magazine, and original box, papers, and tools. Also have some ammo or extra mag available. These are nearly impossible to find at the moment so the price is all over the place on these. I am open to reasonable offers, but i know what I’ve seen these sell for at the last three gun shows and on the classifieds, so please don’t waste both of our time bickering about supply and demand. I just got this on trade and would keep it, but there are other projects that I would rather have. 
	I would also consider trades. Mostly interested in ARs in 1:8 twist, AKs, a 5.7x28 guns, AR10s, PMR30s, CMR30s, etc. Honestly, just make an offer, as long as it evens our fair on both sides then i will consider it. Please no Blackpowders, 22s, or shotguns unless it is weighted heavily in my favor. I would also do multi gun trades or partial trades. Some trades will require boot on your side, some will require it on my side. Can add boot on my end as well if it is something I am interested in. I would keep this, but i would rather have a full platformed AR  5.56/223 than the pistol variant. For any questions or for offers shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to be able to meet up in Norman on this if possible.

Thanks for looking and happy hunting

The PPQ M1 has returned by popular demand and has remained a classic. The PPQ M1 sports a truly ambidextrous magazine release. Unlike the M1, the M2 uses a U.S. style button for mag releas. The trigger is the best of any striker-fired handgun with a safety lever and a short reset. Loved by many, the PPQ M1 is one of the best self-defense handguns available today

The gun was maybe fired only a few times back when it was first purchased. It is in amazing condition. This is a one of a kind find. It's very hard to find a 6.5"" nickel 29-2 with the N prefix in this type of condition with everything original present.

There is a very, very light ring around the cylinder from when it was possibly fired a few times back when it was first purchased. The same ring most every revolver has after the cylinder rotates. The top of the barrel looks like it could maybe use some polish to really shine it up to look perfect but I don't have any myself and don't really want to touch this baby to begin with Haha. Only took it out for the pictures. So basically, it's in amazing condition for its age and shows little to no signs of use. 

The price has been evaluated based on listings found online that have sold for this or even more.

MSRP for my rifle is upwards of $1,000, so any combined offer must equal that amount. Thank you.
