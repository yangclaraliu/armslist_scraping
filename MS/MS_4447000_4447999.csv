Boxes are tattered, but ammo is in good shape! This is a very nice rifle, that has not been cut or drilled!  Shoots and Functions Excellent! In .30 Remington, NOT .30-30 - there was no listing for .30 Remington in the selections. The cartridge is like a rimless .30-30 though. Bore is good and it miked out right on .308, for you bullet casters. I got it some time ago with a broken firing pin - and I don't think it had been shot for 40 or so years. I disassembled, cleaned and oiled, installed a new firing pin, reassembled, and went out and shot most of a box of newly loaded cartridges (new brass) with 150gr. jacketed bullets, and adjusted the factory sights. My eyes aren't so great, but it did a pretty nice group at 50 yards (see pictures). It has quite a bit of original blue left for a 1917 vintage, and there are no extra holes from oddball sights or scope mounts anywhere on the rifle. The barrel shroud is not dented. The stock has been refinished, but it doesn't appear to have been overly sanded. There is one spot near the wrist where a piece apparently broke off when disassembled (probably the guy who broke the firing pin), and it was glued back on - not invisible, but it is very strong. There is a very small piece missing off of the tip of the wood forearm - grain orientation made that tiny piece weak. It never bothered me, and isn't very noticeable. It has a real nice crescent butt.  Apparently when the original firing pin was broken umpteen years ago, the owner at that time decided to try and punch out the safety, which resulted in a few dings on and around that pin.  It's not bad, but if you are looking for it, you will see it.  NOTE: THE RECEIVER HAS NOT BEEN DRILLED!!! It is still intact!   I'm allowed only 3 pictures - if you would like more, please feel free to ask. Really, it's in pretty nice shape for a 1917 vintage rifle. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * I had to relist this ad, due to some idiot flagging my ad as a scam - it surely isn't - I have the rifle, and invite you to stop by and inspect it face to face, and also pay cash for it on the spot. I'm located in WI, about 30 miles straight South of Madison. If you would like to hunt with an easy-shooting, antique autoloading rifle in nice condition and with good ballistics, this would be a good choice. Ballistics are about the same as an AR-style .308 out of a short (16"") barrel (or a .30-30), with a lot less pressure! I reload new brass using .30-30 dies and a .30 Remington shell holder(same as .40 s&w!). I use W748 powder, and my last loads were 150 gr. Speer Hot-Cor bullets. Inspection of the cases showed the shoulders on the fired rounds being the same as my unfired cases. I intend to neck size only the once fired cases, and I chamber all of my hand loads to check for proper sizing. If you don't have any brass, I do have some (up to 40) that I might let go for an additional price. Remington still makes them once in a while though. Remember! 50 rounds of original factory ammo is available with the rifle! Thanks for looking!"

This scope offers shooters fast internal adjustment capabilities for precise and repeatable shot placement. The optics are extremely sharp with good color rendition. 
  The elevation and windage adjustments work extremely well for fast, accurate changes. The adjustment knob caps are a great addition, and the scope has metal lens caps that screw into both ends of the tube. The reticle, which is illuminated, is fine enough for long range precision shooting and it is lit and very easy to see in dim light situations. 
  The NP-R2 reticle gives the shooter exact hold points for windage and bullet drop as well a multiple zero points. This reticle is etched on precision multi-coated compound glass, which gives the shooter exact alignment and eliminates breakage. The glass etched reticle glows red and can be illuminated at different intensities. This ensures outstanding reticle contrast in low light when illuminated or a well-defined, easy to see black reticle when not illuminated.  The fine line subtension makes the NP-R2 reticle perfect for long-range applications. The vertical line is divided into 2 MOA increments, and the increments are used for range estimation, multiple zero points and accurate bullet drop compensation. The horizontal line is divided into equal 5 MOA increments for windage adjustments. 
   Each of our Precision Benchrest models feature 56mm multi-coated lenses, providing the superior resolution necessary to distinguish fine detail at extremely long ranges. An adjustable objective allows extra-fine focus to adjust parallax from 25 yards to infinity. Target turrets are calibrated in true .125 MOA (1/8 click) values and can be re-indexed to zero after sighting in. 
 Both Precision Benchrest riflescopes are equipped with a coil spring plunger return system to maximize tracking accuracy. The eyepiece provides fast reticule focusing, and a glass-etched illuminated reticule provides optimum image/reticule contrast under virtually any lighting conditions. You have two choices of magnification ranges. But only one choice in the ultimate benchrest riflescopes.

In great shape with no issues.  Will come with two 7 round magazines (they only come with one from the factory). Has an excellent trigger as most know and this is the Pro model so it doesn't have the hated magazine disconnect or a manual safety.  
 Would consider trades.  I like revolvers in 38 or 357, a lever action rifle in 357, a complete carbine ar15 upper, Kel Tec SU16, 40 caliber handguns, Glock 42, or a pistol caliber carbine in 9mm or 40.  Maybe a large amount of 5.56 or 9mm ammo.  No Kel Tecs or Taurus aside from the SU16 or Kel Tec carbines.  Looking for an even trade, have a move coming up so I can't afford to add anything to it.

If you'd prefer to buy I'll sell for $360, price is pretty firm.

Purchased from an Estate auction of a Firearms collector who had a note in the box stating this was a ""One-of-collectible"" as the barrel assembly is stamped  22 WRF CTG (WINCHESTER RIM FIRE CARTDRIGE) the predecessor to the 22 Mag., same bullet diameter (22) but the WRF was shorter than the 22 Mag. 
Apparently this pistol made it passed a sleepy inspector as the 9 shot cylinder is for a 22LR., frame & Calendar are matching #'s.  There is some holster wear on the bluing in a few areas but pistol is rust free and the cylinder locks up tight. Inside barrels lans/grooves are factory fresh with no corrosion. Fires in both single and double action. I taught my son & daughter to safely shoot with this piece and they love the break-top action as it make loading/unloading fun and easy! Very accurate pistol once you get used to the petite rear sights these came with.
More pictures upon request, have a look as pictures do speak a 1000 words.
Pistol has a 6"" barrel with the gold front sight blade.

Selling for $300 OBO to Oregon residents 21 & over willing to sign a Bill of Sale.
Possible partial trades of factory .308 match or FMJ/BT ammo or some sterling SMG magazines, plus or minus cash on either end, but cash is king for this deal as I have some care repair needs.
I will advertise locally for this week, but after that, if not sold I will be auctioning on gunbroker.com where it will sell for more than my locally sold asking price, but after fees and the need/time to ship, it makes better sense to sell to an Oregon neighbor.
I would also be willing ship to an FFL for a fee, but then comes the trust issue on the buyers end that is hard to work around.
I will meet buyer at the Albertson parking lot off of SW Cornelius Pass Rd & SW Baseline Rd. on the Hillsboro/Beaverton border.

Shoots a nice tight grouping.

Excellent cartouches, one is “3 GM-K”

This cartouche was stamped by General Motors during WW2 as a rebuild or inspection mark. GM was one of a few contractors given a contract to inspect & rebuild the Springfield 1903 and 45,000 of the 1917's. This is not a common cartouche, they're primarily found on Remington 1917's

Also available is the bushnell elite e6240. 550 dollars cash for the scope, rings, and bases.
This rifle is incredibly tight and smooth from the factory. Has the decelerator recoil pad on the stock. It will shoot sub moa at 100 yards as it sits. Recoil is surprisingly managable, much moreso than the .300 winmag. The ballistic coeffecients of 7mm bullets are better than .308 caliber bullets in almost every case. Meaning better accuracy at longer ranges, also better energy downrange.

The bushnell elite is an excellent scope for any range, has tight solid controls. Excellent vision quality. Superior light transmission, and crystal clear sight picture. Tracking is simple and quick requiring only fingers to turn the knobs.

This rifle package is EXCELLENT for target shooting or hunting.

I built this rifle for coyote removal around the house.  I have over $2800 in this gun, asking $2250.  Reason I am selling is that I have since built a 300 blackout, so this one doesn't get used anymore.  I have also been hunting wild hogs more as well, and I prefer 30 cal rifles for that.  If you have any questions or want additional pictures just ask.

M92 454 Casull Stainless

I love this rifle, but I have decided to down-size.
This is a beauty! I have never seen one like it.
Accurate, Hard Hitting, Versatile- from 45 Long Colt Light Loads to full-house 454 Casull.
Did I mention it is Beautiful? Smooth Action, Fast Target Acquisition.
Effect on target is always a treat! At 100 yards it effortlessly burned through my 1/4"" steel Gong, but was big fun. At 140 yards I up-ended a 200# Hog.
The 20"" barrel gives opportunity for the 454 Casull cartage to shine.
Just a great all-around hunting and plinking rifle. That's right, I actually plink with 454.

Bought it in 2000 and it was listed as new/unfired and since then I have been tempted to take her to the range, but the value would have gone down and I now find myself in need of car repair cash so... here it is!

By selling locally I won't have to deal with fees and the packing/shipping that comes after a gb.com auction win, thus the $550 firm and I like dealing with my Oregon neighbors!
