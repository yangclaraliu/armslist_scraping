The first military adoption is made by the Italian CONSUBIN (the Italian Navy ""SEAL"" teams) and from the Brazilian Army (1975/76). From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own. What sets it apart from the 92FS is: A. Distinctive military style markings on various components closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols. B. Unique M9-prefixed serial number(M9-0001 through 2010) sets this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols. C. ""Dot-and-Post"" sight system clones that of the M9. 2 - 15 round magazines, wood grips with 25th Anniversary medallion type “F” safety system.

I have a Glock 17L with one Mag that I would like to trade for a 17 or 19 plus cash or a good bit of extras. Stripped and painted over a retarded paint job on the frame that the guy I traded for it had on it. It would come clean but i don't have the time to spend on it. This is a pretty rare gun and I am sure it'll appreciate but I really just want a normal 17 or 19 to carry.  Slide and barrel seem to have seen very little if any use.  With all of that said I will not do an even trade and I won't knock 300 dollars off because the slide is painted.  You can strip it if you want or it looks fine.   REDACTED."

Overall condition is excellent with just a few minor handling marks. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bores are excellent.A very nice gun, the stainless Red Label has been out of production for over 5 years."

It's a solid stock unlike some late war production Mosins, which were formed from 2 pieces. The barrel is also original and in good condition. There is some sparse cosmetic rust with a few spots of pitting. There are very few problem areas where the pitting occurs, mostly appearing on the interior and exterior of the buttplate. Bayonet is original as well. The largest problem is a thin crack going down the top front handguard, there is no damage to the barrel."

Features	
A key feature of the pistol is its modular design. The main module of the P250 is an internal stainless steel frame fire control unit which consist of the integrated fire control group (trigger, hammer and all necessary linkage and springs), ambidextrous slide release (one on each side of the pistol), ejector and four slide rails. This steel receiver unit is used in every P250 grip module, top end, and chambering combination and is inserted into the grip frame module and held in place by the axis pin of the disassembly lever. The firearm's serial number is on the fire control unit instead of the grip module. The fire control unit allows the operator to interchange differently-sized slide assembly or top end modules and polymer grip frame modules and trigger shoes and (limited) chambering conversions to adapt the gun to the individual user and address different needs.

The P250 was designed to be ambidextrous in handling, sporting an ambidextrous slide catch lever and user reversible magazine catch. All other operating controls are designed so they can be operated from either side. The firearm can be field stripped with no tools.

The full-size and compact grip modules feature an integral Picatinny rail mounting-bracket at the lower forward edge of the module to allow the mounting of laser sights, tactical lights, and other accessories. Before the introduction of the Picatinny rail SIG used a differing Rail Integration System on the P250 Compact."

It's in good condition and shoots phenomenal groups.  If you aren't familiar with the rifle, look up its reviews.   It has a lightweight free floated  20"" bull barrel, guaranteed to shoot 3/4 or less MOA @ 100yds. My groups have always held at a half inch or less using factory ammo.  It comes with the Rock River two stage match trigger and hogue grip.  It has the Wylde chamber to safely shoot 5.56 or .223.  It has Leupold scope ring mounts that cost over a hundred dollars by themself. The scope is a Leupold VX-3 6.5x20x40 with side focus.  It comes with a sun shade and works great.  Every Leupold comes with a lifetime warranty that's fully transferable even if it's bought used.  I'm also throwing in 200 rounds of bulk ammo from Cabelas. The rifle comes with the case shown, as well as the original Rock River case.  If you're a predator hunter or target shooter you will not be disappointed with this rifle.  All I own and shoot is Rock River rifles,  they're quality.  The gun cost 1,300 new,  the scope 700, the Leupold scope rings 100, and the bulk ammo was 170.  These prices don't include tax. This is an awesome deal. The only reason I'm selling is because I'm wanting to purchase another Rock River chambered in .308, so I have to get rid of one of my guns. If you have any questions text, call, or email.  Thanks,  Seth.  620- two one eight- 8596"

Has collapsible Tapco stock, Tapco grip and the Tapco G2 trigger. Forearm is GFI. Rifle is finished in Kryptek Highlander. 

Full disclosure: Eats anything. Have had zero issues with this rifle. (As I'm typing this I'm actually thinking I should sell one of my ARs!). Before being dipped in the Highlander it was stripped and finished in an off white base color. I didn't like it so it got a rattle can BBQ black on barrel and stock. The cleaning rod was from a 74, too long so I clipped it to fit. More for appearance than function. It looks like a battle rifle, plenty of character. 

Will come with two Tapco mags, one in Highlander and the other plain black. Two 10 round metal mags and one 30 round metal mag.  At least 400 rounds of mixed 7.62 included as well as a Belarus scope riser. 

Will trade for laptop running Windows 7 or 8, minimum of 4GB of RAM and 40GB of free HD space, plus some cash depending on what you are offering in trade.

I am getting back into a gigging band and need to sacrifice one hobby for the other. 

Full disclosure: about 100 rounds through it. Nothing wrong with the pistol. Cycles flawlessly. Gets hot because of the delayed blow back gas system but this isn't really a range gun anyhow. The only thing worth mentioning is that if you choose to load +1 the top round from the mag will drop out. Walther says it can happen to any semi auto pistol. I think either the spring needs to be worn in or maybe there isn't enough upward pressure. Again I stress that once loaded it cycles flawlessly and I have no reservations about using defensively. Great ergonomics.

I have about 50 rounds of 30-06 Hornady SST rounds to go with the rifle. I also have plenty of 30-06 cases if anyone is a reloader.

The gun has about 20 rounds down the barrel. Cleaned every time. Tikka guarantees a 1MOA out of the box and I have seen no different. The Boyd stock also seems to eat up a lot of recoil because it is sturdier than the synthetic.

Works Flawlessly with No Mechanical Issues

Comes as shown with Original box, Removable 6 Shot Slide in Clip for loading in front of gun, Original Instructions 
There is a small pin that swings out from the bottom of the grip, it’s about 1/2"" long for pushing shells out  
Inside the box it says that this pistol works with cal 22 Crimped Blank Flobert Ballets 

Back in the 1950's they were $13.07 New by mail order from
UNITED SAFETY SUPPLY Cherokee Institute 310 West 9th St. Kansas City Missouri 64105

At one time I had some blanks for this and it worked well, however I do not have them anymore so it comes without any “ammo”
Blanks are available through a number of places on the internet, not sure locally I just haven’t looked.
Tear Gas loads I have seen on occasion but they are difficult to find most of the time. This would be neat but I have never shot any of the tear gas rounds.
These DO NOT Shoot Regular Bullets and as far as I know they Cannot be modified to shoot standard bullets.
The Barrel is NOT plugged as a few sites say, possibly the newer ones are, but not this old of a model. The charge (gas) is pushed up into the barrel and then out. Barrel has extreme rifling that appears good, perhaps this is to disperse the gas out the barrel in a wider pattern. But this is merely conjecture on my part, not having seen or shot a tear gas round through it.

A Very Nice Collectable that could be used if you wanted and one that is not an easy one to find complete with box and instructions.
