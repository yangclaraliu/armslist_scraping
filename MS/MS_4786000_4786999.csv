Was told this was bought new in the mid or late 70's, fired six times and then sat in a drawer until now, and it's only had 200-300 rounds through it since.
Only reason I'm looking to sell or trade is to get a round butt heavy barrel Model 10. Would be interested in a trade for one plus cash, but this is the ONLY trade I'm interested in (I do not like square butts, it must be a round!).

Otherwise I will sell it for $650.

I tested the tippmann out today and it works perfectly. The Ion has not been used in a year and i do not have a battery to check it out(it has an auto trigger with different modes of fire) but it worked before storage. The hopper on the Ion needs a battery door or a new hopper.  If you or someone you know is looking to get started in paintball you have everything you need right here for a hugely discounted price. Everything is lightly used but in great shape except the Ion hopper, it has a bit of damage on the bottom of the housing."

The finish of this gun is very nice and in great shape and the holster is also very nice.  Lockup, timing and action are all perfect.

Markings on barrel saying 38 S&W CTG and markings above the cylinder saying US PROPERTY GHD help indicate that it would have been a lend-lease revolver and the other markings show that post-war it was rechambered to accept 38 special.

Springfield trapdoor carbine 45/70 that has been modified to look like a flintlock rifle from the 1700-1800's. there has been a flash pan brazed to the top of the trapdoor where a small amount of powder was placed that would flash when a cap that was placed in a recess in the face of the hammer hit the firing pin and fired a blank sending flame and smoke out the end of the barrel. the carbine stock was replaced with a cut down trapdoor stock and fitted with a large brass end cap to look like the end cap on most flintlocks. and the front site was remove to receive a bayonet.  and a piece of metal was attached to the side plate to make the plate look like a flintlock from a side view when the powder flashed in a movie scene.the slide and saddle ring was reinstalled so it could carried in a saddle boot for western scenes. it is a real carbine with a 22 inch barrel not a cut down rifle SN. 144xxx has a round mark on stalk and a US. and rack # on the but plate. and the typical -  MGM - stamp on the barrel. this was bought at the MGM bankruptcy auction in 1970 by my father and i . he bought a lot of props and let me keep this one. this gun is in very nice condition and in working condition with full function  and would fire with proper ammo after being checked by a professional. i have seen one just like this in the Alamo movie not to say that this is the one used as MGM made more than one copy of every version of their props these guns were used in many of the old movies over and over again. these  don't come up for sale very often so get this one before it is gone. 1500 cash or trade for a - 308 ar type 30 cal ar - colt 1911 45 - and open to trade offers so just make a trade offer i might say yes

This set up is good for 600 yards plus if you can do it. It has the Cloud Peaks Basic Platform ($1250) with a couple extras on top of the package. It has a 22 inch SS Broughton 5C barrel set into a H& S Precision stock (extra $320).It gets an average of 2950 fps with a 140 grain bullet.  It has been given a Cerakote (extra $200) finish as well. The rings are Talley 30mm ($42) one piece ring set up. All totals out to close to $1800 + the action. I had it built 3 or 4 years ago. It has about 100 rounds total through it counting the break in rounds. I will include brass & a set of Redding dies with it ($80). It has never seen the woods. The scope is not included in the price but I will include with the rifle for an extra $500. I got it just for this rifle & is in mint condition. It is a Bushnell 6500 Elite 2.5-16-42 with the mil-dot crosshair. It will shoot sub MOA with proper loads.  Dies may have to be shipped by themselves if it is shipped by the local FFL as he charges extra for misc. items included with a gun. I can ship it by me for $45 with insurance. If it needs to be shipped by a FFL he will charge an extra $20. Insurance alone will be $15 or so. Make me a legit offer if inteested. Serious inquiries & will not reply to any low ball offers - I am not hard up to sell it just not using it.  IF IT IS LISTED IT IS AVAILABLE. I remove it  within a hour of sale so no need to ask if is it for sale.

The brand new bullpup-rifle from IWI that's taking the world of modern semi-auto rifles by storm. After more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

I am open to high-end gear,  ammo (.45, 9mm, 7.62x39) optics.  Just let me know.  I also have other accessories I can add to this deal like a surefire light, IR/Green laser unit, mags, hard case.  Thanks

This is great build, and has been a flawless companion over the last 4 years.  

I built this weapon from the ground up and have been very happy with it.  This gun has been to 10 or so tactical rifle courses. So its wasnt just a show piece to plink around with.  Its a serious work horse.  Id estimate 3-4k rounds through it. The MBUS sites have held zero since the day I sited them in and so has the 1-4x shortdot scope. This thing is great at point blank, and Ive also hit with irons at 600yds.  So it will do what you need it to.  I hate to sell it but I leave for basic in a couple months and am downsizing some of the man room.  I will give a list of parts and accessories I am selling it with.

Included are two 12 round 40 cal magazines, two 18 round 9mm magazines.  The original sights are included, 2 extra sets of grips with extra grip screws. Box, manual too. It was a Sig CPO certified pre-owned that I've had for 6 years.  The night sights still glow.  Will sell only to an Ohio resident at least 21 who can legally own a handgun and will require a bill of sale and will provide same to the buyer. I can provide more photos by email.  No trades please.

590,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4786590,For Sale:  New in box -  Sig Sauer Legion P229 9mm,"DuPage, Chicago, Illinois","$ 1,175","Listed On: Friday, December 4, 2015",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"PRICE FIRM, NO TRADES,

Did I say PRICE FIRM, NO TRADES? I guess so!  Just to be sure: PRICE IS FIRM, NOT INTERESTED IN TRADES!

When I saw Sig had gone and created a new series of upper end pistols, I was really pissed off!  Why?  Because I spent hundreds upgrading my current collection of Sigs at a much higher price than these new pistols cost and the Legion still has several more desirable features.  To wit:

    Reduced and Contoured Elite Beavertail
    Frame Relieved Under Trigger Guard
    Legion Gray PVD Finish on Slide and Frame
    Custom High Checkered G-10 Grips
    Grayguns Intermediate Reach Adjustable Trigger
    Enhanced Action with SRT
    Low Profile Slide Catch and Decocking Levers
    Solid Steel Guide Rod
    SIG SAUER® Electro-optics X-RAY™ High Visibility Day/Night Sights
    Enhanced Checkering on Front Strap and Under Trigger Guard
    Three magazines

If you register the gun with Sig, they will send you a special gun case and coin and you are part of the Legion family.  Apparently, there will be special offers to Legion members only.

I had Gray Guns customize my M11-A1, but it still does not have these various features, like the newer night sights, the amazing grips, the steel guide rod and the lower profile levers.  So, being a compulsive gun buyer who loves Sigs, I had to run out and buy one.  The only good news for me is that with my M11-A1, Gray appears to have matched it with the Legion's trigger set up and since I cannot sell my M11 and recoup most of my investment, I have decided (reluctantly) to sell the Legion.  

All I did with the Legion is rack it and dry fire it 4-5 times, while comparing the action to my M11.  So, this is a new, unfired pistol with the factory grease still on it.  As I am a private seller, there is no sales tax.

Finally, all laws will be followed on handgun transfers, etc.  I will need a pic of your FOID (if out of state, your FFL info).  I have sold out of state before, and accept USPS money orders or bank cashiers checks. I will ship this gun to conus for $40 insured."

M14S Import. Better than traditional in many ways. This is a better than new, Polytech, IDE Michigan USA import, M14S in .308/7.62x51. It has the better stock, improved bolt (HRT), head-spaced forged receiver, chrome-lined barrel and improved piston assembly. This is a later, best engineered and produced version. Polytech Industries rifles have a better reputation for receiver surface machining and finish over the earlier Norinco imported rifles. For those of you new to the M14S:  Ron Smith at SEI is THE authority on Chinese M14s. He knows them inside an out, better than anyone else.  Ron traveled to China and advised the Chinese on how to make a better M14. This resulted in the side stamped IDE import - the best ChiCom out of the box.  Look him up for yourself, to verify.The BS about soft receivers is just that - BS! Yes, a small number of the early Norinco receivers may have had issues, but that's it.Specifications for the M14S 7.62 x 51 Caliber: 7.62 x 51mm Weight: 11.5 lb. (Empty) Barrel: 22 in. Chrome Lined.

*** P.S.  The Zastava PAP M92PV AK-47 pistols are not made or put together (as far as I know)  by Century Arms. They're just the importer. The Zastava M92 AK-47 pistols are all made by the well known Zastava Arms Factory in Serbia (formerly known as Yugoslavia). Or you can just do a google search, or do an internet/ on line research. There are plenty of info on this particular gun on the internet. Just wanted to clarify that part since I had a few people questioning the ""authenticity"" of my gun, for some reason.

This gun is 114 years old and still running strong, it has the octagon barrel and it is chambered in .22 WRF. The rifle has been professionally refinished to ensure longevity. Considering how old this rifle is the bore is decent, it still has rifling but is worn. The action is clean and ready to be used, it is a fully complete rifle, no missing sights or screws. It feeds bullets with no issues at all, very smooth pump action. The 22 WRF ammo is widely available and considered the early 22 magnum. The 1890 was the gallery gun used in carnivals, since the 1890 depression most boys got a single shot Flobert, but some saved for the 1890. Great chance to own an iconic .22 pump! SN#101002  .

HK summary:  Like its 5.56 mm counterpart, the MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series, only in a semi-automatic rifle configuration developed for civilian users.

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons.

Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially.

The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch’s American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components.

The MR762A1 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series including adjustable buttstocks, ergonomic pistol grips, mechanical sights, and the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard. This MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” type rail system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be removed without special tools by the user and ensures 100% return to zero when reinstalled.

Ambidextrous operating controls are standard on the MR762A1, including a convertible charging handle and an ambidextrous selector lever. The MR762A1 uses the same 10- and 20-round translucent polymer box magazines made for the HK417; a 5-round magazine is also under development. MR762A1 rifles are well-suited for a variety of applications including law enforcement tactical, police patrol, general sporting, and hunting (a 5-round magazine is under development).

I'm putting up my CZ Accu Shadow Lite up for sale. I have been bit by the SBR bug and am thinking about them non stop. 

I am the second owner. I got it off another forum member on her a few months back. I love the gun but I shoot my 1911's better. The gun came with 6 mecgar 17 round mags which I keep at my dads in NH, 2 holsters with no mounts on them and some extra springs. I have only shot about 500 rounds through the gun. The trigger is by far the best DA/SA trigger I have ever felt. It's so smooth and so lite that it's a dream to shoot. It does have some wear on the front of the slide from dry firing but no other marks on it. everything I got with the gun will be included in this sale.

i am located in MA and will do a Efa10 with another Ma resident or I will ship the gun from my FFL to your FFL and shipping will be included in the sale. 

I'm asking 1,700 for everything. That includes the gun, 6 mags, 2 holsters and the extra springs also I will include a set of original orange aluminum grips in perfect condition which are crazy hard to find. If you can't own the mags I will drop the price to 1,550

I will not split the grips or mags until the gun has sold and the buyer has first dibs on everything.

Will trade for a Daniel Defense MK18 upper with or without optics + or - cash depending on optic or not."
