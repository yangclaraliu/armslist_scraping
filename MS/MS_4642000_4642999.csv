As you can see on the receipt, the cost is  $1,895.00 AFTER the package discount.  I think $1500 would be a fair trade for something.  

I still have 3 trial versions in my fridge plus 2 antidote shots (just in case you have an erection lasting longer than 3 hours).  I have all the instructions, the auto injector kit, and little cooler with ice pack.  All UNUSED AND UNOPENED.

I can meet you at the Oklahoma Men's Clinic, pick up all the shots in person and we can do the trade right then and there so to prove this isn't fake.  Need anymore info?  Shoot me an email.  Serious only.  Thanks."

The sale includes ALL of the original pieces, parts, and packaging.  GREAT shape!

GEN 123 ADAPTERS FIT STANDARD & COMPACT GLOCK FRAMES: GEN 1, GEN 2, AND GEN 3 SERIES: MODELS: 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38.  MODELS: 20SF, 21SF (W/ USE OF SILICONE ADHESIVE).  SUB-COMPACT MODELS: 26, 27. 29, 30, 33, 39.

The GRIP FORCE GEN 123 ADAPTER was developed specifically for GLOCK's GEN 1, GEN 2, and GEN 3 series of pistols.  It eliminates the drawbacks associated with
 permanent modifications to your factory pistol.  The GRIP FORCE GEN 123 ADAPTER mates completely to the back strap of the GLOCK frame, permitting the shooter's hand to conform to the frame in a more secure manner.  This offers more control and allows the shooter to index the pistol on target more efficiently. 

*In 2007 and later, GLOCK produced some pistols (in 9mm and .40 caliber), that have
 slightly thicker frames than most other GEN 3 pistols.  These frames, which have a 
 serial number prefix starting with the letter L (i.e. LXX123), are oversized in diameter at the trigger housing pin location.  The GEN 123 GRIP ADAPTER may not fit on these 
 oversized frames. This is a very small number of frames, and the majority of L Series serial numbered frames have no fit problems whatsoever.  

The GEN 123 ADAPTER will also work on a GEN 4 Pistol if the GLOCK factory Medium grip panel is installed on the GEN 4 frame. The horizontal ridges on the
 underside of the GEN 123 ADAPTER may need to be slightly reduced in order for
 it to fit over top of the factory Medium grip panel.  

I have 2 available.

You can pick this up in Fond du Lac, or I can ship it to you for $4.50."

I bought this brand new and sent the entire firearm to Robar guns in Phoenix, AZ. Robar coated the slide and the appropriate internals with Robar's NP3 finish. (it tests 200+ hours under salt spray). While I was waiting the 12 week lead time, I fell in love with the M&P Shield. So, someone is going to get a beautiful pistol with no rounds fired. I searched the internet and I cannot find a single Glock 19 for sale like mine. I have over $1385 in the firearm. $875 or best offer, PPT, FTF, buyer pays fees.

The best part of the MGI® Quick Change Barrel Upper Receiver is that it utilizes standard AR barrels! Take a close look at the MGI Rifle, Pistol and Conversion Kit photos.  You will see that the barrel is a standard AR barrel with the Delta Ring, barrel nut, sling swivel and front handguard keeper removed.  That's right, you can use standard barrels just by removing the items mentioned above!  The latest QCB-D model now is compatible with piston systems!!!  The rails have also been changed to create less sharp edges against the shooter's hand as well as creating cleaner lines and appearance. This latest revision comes with multiple improvements such as Hard Coat Anodized Mil Spec Finish, four full-length Picatinny style rails, new locking arm retention system and more.

Approximately 600 rounds through.  Has been trouble-free the entire time.  No jams, although to be fair I only shoot high quality new ammunition (typically 115/124gr FMJ target loads). No horror stories here - gun has already been sighted and magazine has already been modified to address common complaints with this pistol. Comes with original box, one 8-round magazine, and nylon pistol pouch with keyed padlock (see photo). Contact me by email to make arrangements for purchase.

This is not a show piece or a tack driver; it's a cheap gun to keep in your toolbox or boat or whatever as a backup piece.  That said, it plays this role really well and you can shoot bullseyes with it from 25 feet with proper sight picture and trigger discipline.  It's a $135 gun that sold new for $189; what do you expect?  That said, I like it very much and will be sad to see it go.

In lieu of $135, I will also accept a minimum of 8 ounces of silver or 1/10 ounce of gold.  I will also accept: a complete Phoenix Arms HP22 range kit, 5.56x45 rifle ammo, 9mm handgun ammo, and certain AR accessories within reason (but those must be brand new in box), or a combination of the above.  I have limited time to spend on this sale, though, so if you must trade, make sure your trade is GOOD. I'm only getting rid of this to raise funds for something better as it is, so if that doesn't happen, I'll just keep it and enjoy my nice cheap little pistol.  No skin off my back.

Designed both by and for undercover LEO agents, the STI Shadow is a compact aluminum framed pistol with everything anyone needs in a backup pistol.

When Texas undercover narcotics officers started looking for the perfect concealable pistol, they came to the premier Texas pistol manufacturers. Based on their input, STI has come up with the STI Shadow- a light weight pistol that is as reliable as it is concealable. Comes with a quality IWB holster and two set of grips, one set original to the pistol.

The classic slide is 3.0"" in length with rear cocking serrations & standard STI oversized ejection port. The 2 dot Heinie straight 8 tritium night sights have been recessed into the slide and, along with the integral sight channel, provide the perfect compromise between easy sight acquisition and snag free carry. The STI Shadow is built on a forged aluminum STI officer sized frame with a stippled front strap. The grip includes a flat checkered polymer mainspring housing configured to provide excellent retention. The controls are STI’s single sided blued thumb safety and STI’s bobbed high-rise, blued, knuckle relief beavertail grip safety. The barrel is a 3.0"" fully supported STI ramped bull barrel. The STI Shadow comes standard with an STI RecoilMaster guide rod
 system, STI commander hammer, and patented STI International trigger system.

All external features are KG coated black. Come with 1 free hour of range time at Top Gun in Arnold."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

I payed over $800.00 for this radio but would be willing to take $600.00 or take the best trade offered! I'd love a good tactical shotgun or maybe a Springfield XD. (I own a Glock 19 but it doesn't do it for me like a XD! Lol!)

This gun has also been upgraded with a 3 lb. connector and modified trigger giving it a lightened trigger pull. The laser sight is a red laser and features both a solid red laser as well as a strobe mode.  Another nice feature is the auto-off to conserve battery life.  The laser comes with a 1-year warranty though Laserlyte has been very helpful in replacing these for me well beyond the first year.  I use these on all 4 of my glocks.  A concealed carry inside the waistband holster is also included with this offer.

I have shot this a bunch, such an accurate rifle. Takes 5-round stripper clips, two of them, to deposit 10 rounds into the magazine. The stock is not in amazing condition, it is a military surplus rifle. The top piece of wood (near the rear sight), is cracked and missing a piece. The main stock is rough, but could be refinished if you so choose. There is a dent above the left side near the trigger. The rifle still has the unit markings on the butt, pretty neat. The bore is great, I have kept it oiled and have not shot corrosive ammo through it.

The gun will come with 4 boxes of surplus ammo (15 rounds per box). This, I believe, is corrosive ammo. I think the ammo is Turkish, it has cyrillic writing on it. 

Located in Dover, work in Rochester, sometimes travel to Alton/Wolfeboro for work, could bring it along one day at your choosing.

947,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4642947,For Sale:  MSE AQC-1C Reflex Sight,"Stafford, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 800,"Listed On: Friday, August 28, 2015",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"MSE AQC-1C Reflex Sight for sale. For those of you that are familiar with this brand, you know that they became unavailable quite a while back because the parent company went bankrupt due to a mismanagement of funds. For those of you that aren’t familiar with this sight, it can be easily researched. This site beats out other top brand sights including: Trijicon, Eotech, and Aimpoint in nearly every aspect. Here is one of the many comparisons. 
http://youtu.be/nXOFt5TKpRQ

THIS IS ONLY TRUE PARRALAX FREE SIGHT. NO SIDE TO SIDE OR TOP TO BOTTOM DRIFT.

“The MSE AQC-1C reflex sight is built upon a fully-reinforced synthetic chassis that embosses all the electronics and optical components and fully protects them from shocks, water, moisture, sand, dust, and other environmental aggressive factors. AQC-1C reflex sights can choose between a standard red-dot, a close-to-medium-range precision engagement reticle (basically a red dot with two side reference bars) and a full, fast target acquisition reticle. The reticles, and their intensity, can be selected and set either through the three buttons located behind the optical sight itself, right under the aiming window, or through the factory-issued PTT button and remote cable. This sight is extremely compact, at 2.7""x2""x5.7"", and extremely light as well, as their overall weight never goes over 14 oz. The 1.18""x1.44"" aiming window sports a 1.62 square inch area and an unlimited field of view, as the AQC sights can of course be operated with both eyes open.”

This sight is NEW, has all the original casing, books, etc. and has never been placed on a rifle and fired. I have set it up to make sure all the functions work. You cannot find these sights anymore because the people that own them, hold onto them. There are two websites that claim they have them but a little research will reveal they are scam sites, which is probably why the prices are so low. I am selling it to pay college bills. Call Aaron @ REDACTED if interested."

 The CQB T-Dot Sight is designed for combat and competition shooters who frequently address targets at close quarters. It corrects a common problem with combat-zeroed optics mounted on an AR-type rifle: the point of impact is significantly lower than the point of aim at close quarters distances based on the popular EOTech EXPS2, the CQB T-Dot eliminates the “guesstimating” when aiming at these targets. It retains the parent design’s 65 MOA circle illuminated reticle with two aiming points calibrated for 50-200 yards and 500 yards. The bottom of the T-Dot’s circle is left open, with a “T” indicating a precise aiming reference zeroed for about 7 yards. All aiming points are calibrated for 5.56mm NATO ammunition. Windage and elevation are adjustable in ½ MOA increments."

Designed both by and for undercover LEO agents, the STI Shadow is a compact aluminum framed pistol with everything anyone needs in a backup pistol.

When Texas undercover narcotics officers started looking for the perfect concealable pistol, they came to the premier Texas pistol manufacturers. Based on their input, STI has come up with the STI Shadow- a light weight pistol that is as reliable as it is concealable. Comes with a quality IWB holster and two set of grips, one set original to the pistol.

The classic slide is 3.0"" in length with rear cocking serrations & standard STI oversized ejection port. The 2 dot Heinie straight 8 tritium night sights have been recessed into the slide and, along with the integral sight channel, provide the perfect compromise between easy sight acquisition and snag free carry. The STI Shadow is built on a forged aluminum STI officer sized frame with a stippled front strap. The grip includes a flat checkered polymer mainspring housing configured to provide excellent retention. The controls are STI’s single sided blued thumb safety and STI’s bobbed high-rise, blued, knuckle relief beavertail grip safety. The barrel is a 3.0"" fully supported STI ramped bull barrel. The STI Shadow comes standard with an STI RecoilMaster guide rod system, STI commander hammer, and patented STI International trigger system. All external features are KG coated black.
