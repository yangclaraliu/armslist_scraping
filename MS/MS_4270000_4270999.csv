Excerpt taken from article:  ""Most notable on the Centurion is the use of a machined receiver. That’s right AK fans, this a solid piece of machined steel—not your typical rolled sheet metal version. To commemorate this fact, a U.S. Flag is engraved into the receiver itself.""

Grips have  33 of 100 to match the Display case that also features the NRA and 33 of 100.Over the last century, the 1911 pistol has undeniably become one of the most dependable and effective firearms to date. Designed by John Browning in 1911, it is best known for its short recoil and slender design, and is popular among civilian shooters. Even the U.S. military has trusted it to be the sidearm for our troops since WWI.
 
It is because of this legacy that we decided to create the NRA 1911 pistol. During its 100th anniversary in 2011, American Legacy Firearms teamed up with the National Rifle Association and produced our first NRA licensed project.  Built on an Auto-Ordnance 1911A1 .45ACP, the NRA pistol is nickel plated and comes with beautiful maple grips. Engraved on the slides are maps of every conflict the 1911 has been involved in over the last 100 years. The artwork also commemorates the brave men and women who’ve served our country. A beautiful oak display box is included. With the edition number placed on the left grip, there will only be 100 made for each state. Several states have already sold out. Each sale helps support the NRA in their ongoing commitment to protecting our Second Amendment rights!"

This Mauser was manufactured in the BRNO factory in Czech Factory (At the time under control by the National Socialist Party aka Nazi) contracted by the then Persian monocracy for its imperial palace guard, there were only 900 made; Persian Mausers are considered to be among the finest quality ever made. This gun is in excellent condition with the shiniest bore I have ever seen in a Mauser. My apologies for the bore picture I couldn’t find a flashlight low enough in lumens to counteract how shiny and mirror like it is. The only blemish is where it was kept in a safe for over 50 years near the end of the barrel where the holder in the safe made contact. This rifle is All matching except for the scabbard which I Purchased separately to complete its ascetic look. I’m am asking 1000 OBO for both.

It has a stainless steel barrel and originally came with a synthetic stock, which I replaced with a custom thumbhole wood stock.

The rifle also has an added barrel strut to enhance accuracy.  Note that as presently configured, it doesn't have a scope mount, but mounts are as cheap as $10 and simple to attach. 

It cycles very reliably and is very suitable for anything from ranch work to home defense.  It is also a very fun plinking rifle. With the scope mount, it becomes a great all-round rifle, or a good SHTF alternative to an AR. 

The mags are 20 round, 7 are black/blue (some show a bit of wear), one is stainless.

The rifle's MSRP is $1075 (though usually more like $800 retail), the strut is about $100, the stock is about $150, the leather sling $50, mags are about $30 each. So, new, we have about $1250 total. If you're not interested in the fancy sling, that's fine (it was a gift). I also have the original stock, which I'll include.

I'd be happy to sell for $700 or trade for a good pistol.  9mm, 45... or possibly 380.  No other calibers please.

We can adjust trade with cash or ammo from either side.

If you're unfamiliar with the VEPR system I suggest looking it up. This is basically an AK on steroids. It boasts a thicker receiver, chrome lined, fluted barrel (to reduce weight and increase strength). It can handle whatever ammunition you throw at it.

Ruger doesn't make these any more! There is absolutely nothing wrong with the weapon, perfect operating condition. I really love this gun, no cheap plastics, just good, solid stainless steel and laminate. Perfect for hunting in less than ideal weather without any worries. I am willing to FTF or ship at buyer's expense.

It has less than 150 rounds through it so the magazines and the action aren't even fully broken in. Function has been 100% out of box with several types of 5.56 and .223 ammo. I never benched it out to 100 yards, but it is definitely more accurate than I am with iron sights.

The laminated stock is a very nice black/grey with a slight greenish tint to it. I believe it was made under contract by Revolution but is a slightly different pattern from their Explorer stocks.  I've made a few modifications to the stock for better ergonomics as it originally left much to be desired. The stock has a very few and very small handling marks, still in very good condition. It also has an excellent non-slip recoil pad.

Also included are two practically brand new Ruger factory magazines: one 20 rounder and one 30 rounder. Stainless steel scope rings, an upgraded handguard made by Choate for better ventilation and weight reduction, and three 5.56 dummy rounds by Magpul as an extra. 

Asking $800 cash, buyer pays shipping if applicable."

Quality hunting, combat & survival knives.
Unique designs by: Richard Tingler!
I have been making Knives & Custom Guns since I was 16.
I only sold locally and on eBay but Since the Gun Law are changing All the time, I am now focusing on my knives instead of guns. Mine are made extra heavy duty and of the highest quality and Getting better all the time! I use Damascus steel “352 layers or more of 1095 steel and 15N20 Steel “. Also solid D2 steel and every once in awhile I am asked to use 1095 or 5160 & SUP9 STEEL. Others upon request if needed.
See My Face Book Page – Richard Tingler’s Custom knives
PLEASE LIKE & SHARE!

Please Email me Directly ( REDACTED) if you have any questions or want to design a knife for a special purpose or tell me a “TYPE” you’re looking for and I’ll send you pictures of what I have made and ready to sell. I make Hunting-Fighting-Survival-Swords-Machetes & the most authentic “Book Of Eli Machete”in D2 steel also have my version of the “Tracker Knife” and RAMBO“ONE” in Damascus

Damascus steel

This blade is hand forged with 1095 and 15n20 high and low carbon high nickel steel. This blade is about 58 hrc on Rockwell scale. This will hold an edge and keep it’s sharpness for a long time. Ideal for a long lasting sharp cutting edge when used on tough cutting jobs.


D2 STEEL

D2 is sometimes called a ""semi-stainless"". It has fairly high chrome content (12%), but not high enough to classify it as stainless. It is more stain resistant than the carbon steels however, it has excellent wear resistance. D2 is much tougher than the premium stainless steels like ATS-34, but not as tough as many of the other non-stainless steels. The combination of great wear resistance, almost-stainlessness, and good toughness make it a great choice for a number of machete & knife styles. Bob Dozier is one maker who uses D2-steel. Benchmade Company has begun using D2 in its Axis AFCK also.

I have sold world wide - at this point about seven (7) other countries. And almost every customer has come back and bought more from me. Two (2) customer has bought about ten (10) knives threw the years and one has bought over fifteen (15) from me.  

For the person on here “CLAIMING” to have the best knives and all others on here our junk compared to yours well let’s go blade to blade. We can take your knife and my knife blade edge to blade edge and then we can take a sledge hammer to the top one and the one that ends up with the most damage pays for the other one.
So let see go ahead and but “YOUR” junk on the edge and see what on here is REALLY BETTER! Oh and stop stealing designs off of mine will you!

Will Ship!"

Id prefer cash for another project, So I'm  Dropping the Price Today only, you ABSOLUTELY won't find a better deal on this gun in its Condition  with everything I  have invested in it at this Price point of $675.00 . (I take very good care of my firearms, always kept in a safe with controlled humidity ) again I have a lot invested in this gun this is a Very Very Reasonable  offer. This Glocks Dead Accurate &  Smooth  Shooting! 
If you want to do a trade I need $750.00 to $800.00 in trade Value. I prefer cash for another project that's  why my cash offer is so low today but if its a trade I'm  gonna need the 750-800 equal value. Even at that I'm well under what i have in the gun."

 The STI commitment to making some of the very ﬁnest custom quality handguns that your hard earned money can buy, goes far deeper than some plaque on a lobby wall. It is a personal responsibility of every STI employee owner to put their best into each gun that leaves the building. For them it is more than a job—it is innovating and engineering to keep raising the STI standard; it is machining and hand crafting each part for a ﬁt and ﬁnish that ﬁlls your hand with conﬁdence; and it is the integrity to stay the course even if it means doing things diﬀerently. STI is for the discerning shooter who appreciates having the best.

Tactical DS 40cal

The Tactical DS (Double Stack) offers everything the Tactical Lite does, except with a steel frame. The diference of its steel frame feels heavier in the hand and the felt recoil is subdued. Double stack, higher capacity magazines keep you shooting longer and reloading less, while its overall design is easily controlled with a palmable grip.

The guns bluing is faded and the stock has scratches  but it is original and not sporterized in the slightest bit, no cracks either. The gun is 100 percent original and all but 100 percent remington stamped. The marks ive seen with the R in a circle is butt plate, trigger, trigger guard, floor plate, receiver/barrel, entire bolt is stamped remington, sight and barrel bands. I might be missing one but cant think of it. The only thing this rifle is missing is the bayonet and top hand guard if it had one at all. The stock is walnut and appears to be original remington. This gun has the infamous ""five dice"" mark on the left of the receiver and has a Spanish sling hanger. Im not certain if this was a Spanish civil war rifle or not. It is not numbers matching like typical Spanish civil war rifles and bolt has no serial number. If interested I can send detailed photos to your email as I cannot get photos to load on this post.

Designed to work in any Smith & Wesson M&P model pistol in a centerfire caliber, the Apex Flat Faced Forward Set Trigger Kit reduces trigger pre-travel and over-travel, while allowing the shooter to position their finger at an increased leverage point lower on the trigger face to take advantage of lower trigger pull weights.

I'm considering selling it in order to buy something that I'll actually use. I looked on gunbroker.com for a target price and came up with what I consider reasonable based on others for sale. Most of the ones for sale are pre-war. But I found one that is close to the same year (mine is a 1946) and is in similar condition, although the one in the link below has more wear at the muzzle and along the cylinder than mine. Turn line is similar. Mine has all matching SNs, including the grips. This Transitional model has a 5"" barrel and is in very good shape! I'm obviously not a professional appraiser but I'd say it's 95%+ based on the assessment of the one in the link. I'm thinking $1500 as a median value. Let me know if you need more photos. However, there are some in the forum thread below.

A great collector's piece. But if you're wanting to fire it (which I have), it will shoot any .38 cartridge, not .357 though. Super light trigger pull in SA!

Remington UMC Ammo 9MM Target Ammo FMJ 1000 Round Bulk Pack $229.99 THATS LESS THAN .23 A ROUND!!!!!!!!!Jacketed Soft-point (JSP): This type of ammunition was designed to fill the niche between full-metal jacket and hollow point ammunition, the tip of the round is exposed lead with the rest being copper jacketed providing better expansion than a normal full-metal jacket, and providing better penetration than a hollow point. Balistically they perform very similar to a normal round, providing a similar accuracy and performance to a non-jacketed bullet. The design of the JSP round makes it ideal for states where hollow point rounds are restricted, and where the desired penetration is not found from hollow points. However, due to the in-between nature of the JSP when compared to hollow point or full-metal jacket makes it perform less than desirably than either of those rounds in their respective environs.Jacketed Hollow Point (JHP): Jacketed Hollow-Point ammunition is designed to expand on impact with a target, causing it to expend more of its energy than if it went through the target. This has the effect of not passing through whatever you are shooting and hitting something behind it, as it will expend its energy faster than a traditional round or a full-metal jacket round. There is a trade off for this, a hollow point will not achieve the same penetration of either full-metal jacket rounds or jacketed soft-point rounds, and have trouble defeating barriers.Full-Metal Jacket (FMJ): The full-metal jacket round consists of a soft-metal core, usually consisting of lead, encased in a metal jacket-such as gilding metal, cupronickel or a steel alloy. This jacketing will surround usually the front and sides of the bullet, leaving the back of the round uncovered lead. This round has a higher muzzle velocity than plain lead and leaves behind less fouling in the bore, creating an easier clean up after shooting."

Here is a recently purchased, never fired Ruger 10/22 Black Synthetic Stock Collector's Edition firing 22LR. 

The collector's edition includes some fun memorabilia, all of which is still wrapped up and unopened. Tin sign, small pin, even a sealed reprint of the original Ruger ad.

The firearm itself is brand new and unfired. It includes a BX25 round banana magazine and a tubular 10 round magazine. Also includes bolt hold open, and lock. Comes with original packaging.

I live in Macclenny but am planning a trip into Jacksonville Friday 4/24 and could meet at Costco.

Also for sale are 15 boxes of 50 count American Eagle .22lr 40 grain and ~150 rounds Federal .22lr in a can. The American Eagle was purchased several weeks ago at Gander Mountain and the Federal was purchased second hand from a friend of mine, so I can't vouch for its age (though the tips do show some age, so they aren't new). $40 for all of it if you are purchasing the Ruger (so $300 for firearm and ammo).

Also for sale are two brand new never used Walker EXT muffs (34dbr) and two brand new never used Remington clear glasses. The muffs are $13 on Amazon each and glasses are $7, so buying from there would cost $40 for the two pair. If you are buying the Ruger, you can add on this stuff for another $20.(so firearm+ammo+muffs/glasses: $320)

In case you haven't heard or read, production of the VZ58 / VZ2008 has stopped and they aren't importing any more of these into America. The Czechs have moved on to a new main rifle. They are selling for $800 to $1000 in Canada, and in a couple years or less will fetch those prices here. 
Read reviews on why the VZ2008 beats the AK if you're not sure why. Outstanding rifle!

ASK FOR MORE PICS!

I have a VZ2008 with 4 magazines, each loaded with 30 rounds (120 rounds total) and comes with a great condition ammo pouch (with belt loops and shoulder strap). This rifle shoots accurately and functions perfectly.  

-I removed the slant break (which should never be on a semi-auto) and put a plain thread protector on which reduced felt recoil. (Will include slant break if desired)

-I have had the bolt-carrier tabbed, which means the shooter will never have to worry about any trigger ""gremlin"" problem popping up (although I never experienced this even before it was added). All semi-auto VZ2008/VZ58s had the tab until it was patented by Czechpoint a few years ago (yes, the $1,250 Czechpoint VZs are tabbed like this one). The tab was done expertly, and I can provide pics if interested. 

-Also (forgot to mention earlier), I put one of the eBay heat shields in the handguard to reduce heat. Can be easily removed but just an added perk.

Originally wanted to trade for an FAL or L1A1 but none were offered, so I'm going to sell this baby to put the money toward an FAL.

Thanks for looking!

P.S. Leather was added by me to the foreguard just to look cool (give it a kind of rebel look). Can be unwrapped if desired, I used no glue or anything like that."
