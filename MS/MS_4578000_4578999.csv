Available in .338 Lapua Magnum, .300 Winchester Magnum and .308 Winchester, the precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 20 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended. Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color that blends into any environment - every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own. Mounted on this rifle from the factory with Barrett rings is a Leupold Mk 4 4.5-14x50 long range riflescope. The Leupold sports a 30mm main tube, mil dot reticle, and M1 turrets. Rifle with two 10-rnd mags, 2 rail sections with flush cup mounts, and one plain railed section."

This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting. This is the 2nd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers a half inch more eye relief, positions the windage and elevation adjustments inside of the optic rather than in the mount, less moving parts in the mount which makes the mount even more stable, and has a quick release thow lever on the bottom of the mount which allows the quick removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accomadate the 7mm raised sights. Mount  Length: 1.6"" (40.6mm) Height: 1.64"" (41.65mm) Clears common low profile flip up rear iron sights Weight: 4.5oz (128 grams) Color/Finish: Non reflective black or tan with hard coat finish  Flip Orientation: Ambidextrous mount to allow left or right flip Rail Interface: Fixed Picatinny with single mounting bolt.

This AR-10T has fired less than 200 rds. In all likelihood it has had less than 100rds. All either bench or firing at coyotes with a twilight scope. 

It has a made in Japan 10x42 adjustable to distance/focus SWFA Classic ""Super Sniper"" Scope. This scope was made by the company that made the Bausch and Laumb Elite series scope for Bushnell. This scope has an NSN assigned to it- the Navy used them in testing, thus the NSN number. This one was mil-surp but never been mounted until now. They are nitrogen filled and the environment/temp/etc does not effect focus, fogging, etc

I am nothing fantastic when it comes to rest shooting, but it honestly shoots like a bolt gun in terms of accuracy. I've shot into a pack of coyotes and dropped one dead and the resulting pass through crippled another and I got him later. 

Comes with 200rds NATO Brass Ammo and 1 20rd Magazine.

Model: Type 14.9 Nambu
Caliber: 8mm
Serial Number: 67031
Nagoya Arsenal Type 14, 8mm Nambu, 4.5” barrel- This is a Nagoya Arsenal made Type 14 made in September of 1939. This is a unique transitional piece due to the large trigger guard added for soldiers to use with gloves, but it does not have the magazine retention spring. This is one of 5,700 produced between September and December of 1939 with this transition feature.  After 1939, Type 14’s had a magazine retention spring in the front grip strap. The pistol also retained the earlier 25 groove wood grips of the earlier models. The pistol has original blued finish with very minimal wear. The pistol has a bright bore and strong rifling.
Considered “Original run” (see http://members.shaw.ca/tju/t14gallery.htm for details). My grandfather brought this back from WWII, according to him he picked it up from a dead officer’s body somewhere during the Midway Campaign. Not sure whether this story is true or not. Feel free to ask for more pics, I’ll send any that are requested. Comes with the Holster, one Magazine and a small tool in the holster. Buyer pays shipping, quote for shipping upon auction win. Feel free to ask any questions, I’m happy to answer them!

I acquired this pistol about a year ago or so I would have to check the receipt for exact date, I am the original owner bought it new in the box.  I have only put 320 rounds thru it so far.  I do not shoot it as much as I would like, it has mostly been my carry gun for the past year so I shoot it enough to keep familiar with it.  Anyway, it is in almost new condition with just minor holster wear on one side of the slide.  It is my carry gun but I babied this thing alot with regular cleanings and I always wiped it down at the end of the day before I put it in my drawer, so this gun as definitely not been abused.  I has nice slim grips and night sights, the front green and the rear amber, you just line the green over the amber and you should be on target.  Shoots great, great trigger, very smooth and accurate.  You can feel the quality in your hand when you hold this gun very solid would not hesitate to take it anywhere into any situation.  No complaints about this gun and really dont need to sell just seeing what kind of interest is out there, thinking about getting a dirtbike actually.  This is definitely a premium 1911, everything is forged steel no MIM parts all hand fitted and blended where necessary.  Top quality demands a top price, and I am asking $2000, comes with the factory box and all paperwork and 3 mags, two being factory and one being from Kimber.  Also alittle fun fact about this gun is that the Gander Mountain here in Mount Juliet has this exact same pistol for sale for $2500, now I realize their prices are usually way to high but it does help illustrate the value in this firearm.

This features a scalloped boxlock receiver, cocking indicators, side clips, walnut stock, double triggers, extensive German-styled engraving and a matted rib.  The stock has a cheek piece, and sling swivels (if you are not a fan of the sling swivels, I can have them removed).  Bores are shiny, clean and free of pitting.  Chokes are Modified and Full (If interested, I can provide contact information for a gunsmith who reams chokes to whatever constriction you would like at an extremely fair price).  28"" barrel.

**This shotgun is unique in that a European gunsmith has fitted a folding V-notch rear sight into the rib.  With slugs, it's almost like a poor man's double rifle.  

Issues: Checkering is not great.  There are some dents and dings in the wood (especially the forend).  There is a nick in the extractor but it functions and extracts perfectly.  Case colors are about 30% or less.  Overall, the gun is not a mint gun but is still very nice for the price.

It is a 10-11 to be exact and it does not have an internal lock. Action is beautifully smooth and it locks up as tight as a bank vault in double and single action. I consistently shoot one hole groups that I can cover with a nickel in double action with it. Was professionally cerakoted to like new condition by FTW here in town. Has hogue bantam grips for easier concealment currently on it, however it also comes with the original wood grips. Have a fair amount of gear for it as well to make it suitable for concealment and competition. Have a Fobus paddle holster, 4 speedloaders (3 safariland comp tac's, 1 HKS), two safariland speedloader belt clips, and an Alien Gear 2.0 Cloak Tuck IWB holster that it is pretty comfortable to carry in (been carrying it this summer occasionally in shorts and a t shirt). Finally I have a 50 rounds of 38 special I will include in the sale. Have over $700 invested in the gun and gear.
Again, I love this revolver but I've found another one that I've been wanting to get for a long time, so I'm selling this on to start saving for it. Looking to sell it and everything it comes with or $600. price is pretty firm, you will not find another set up like this for the price. This would be a great setup for someone who likes to conceal, carry, or compete with revolvers. Feel free to ask questions! The only trades I would consider would be a VP9, PPQ, or maybe a SIG P320 plus cash depending on what you have and what it comes with..

The factory sights are also equipped. 7 of the magazines are polymer with the exception of the one it came with. I also have a little over 120 rounds that I will toss in as well. No particular reason why I am wanting to sell I just have not been out shooting very often and it is sitting around going unused. There are roughly 300 rounds that have been fired through it. Please let me know if you are interested. I also will provide the original case it came with, It just does not fit with the sight attached. You can email me or text me at REDACTED."

I no longer hunt, so the rifle has not been fired in at least 10 years.  The serial number indicates it was built in 1982, back when there was some real quality and workmanship in guns.  The gun is in excellent condition, with some very minor wear and marks from use over the years.

It is fitted with a Redfield 1.75 x 5 Wide-Field scope, very appropriate for this gun.  The scope was factory-overhauled in 2005.  I have the paperwork that shows the work accomplished.  They are great scopes, clear, hold their zero and durable.  It's by far the best scope for someone who can't use open sights or peep sights but likes to still hunt.

There is also included an attractive padded leather sling, attached to the rifle with quick-detachable swivels.

Marlin’s Model 336 is a high quality tube-fed repeating lever-action rifle that has been around since 1948.  Since its introduction, over 6 million Model 336 rifles have been produced. It continues to be one of the most popular and common rifles in the USA.  They are well-built, accurate, robust, and reliable. One of the key selling points of the model 336 is that they have a solid receiver top, giving the rifle extra strength and allowing for side ejection.  The solid top of the model 336 supplies a platform to easily mount an optic sight.  

Another outstanding feature of the model 336 is that it’s designed to be easily disassembled for cleaning inside the barrel. Unscrewing the lever pivot screw allows removal of the lever arm, bolt, and ejector for maintenance. 

To complete this package, I have a many-years' supply of ammunition, plus dies and components for reloading more.  Here is a listing of the .30-30 ammo:

21 boxes of Western Super-X 150 gr. Silvertips
4 boxes Remington 150 gr. Core-Lokt
1 box Winchester 150 gr. Power Point
1 box Enforcer 150 gr.
1 box Sears 150 gr.
4 boxes of reloads in new Norma cases
Miscellaneous loose rounds

Bair .30-30 reloading dies
At least 200 fired cases, some resized
New unopened can of IMR-3031 (a good .30-30 powder)
3 boxes Seirra 150 gr. flat-nose .30-30 bullets

This package will put you in the .30-30 business for years to come.  The 32 boxes of ammo will allow practice and many years of hunting.  I'm expecting to get $795 for the gun, scope, accessories and ammo.  Have you priced ammo lately?

Give me a call and let's talk about this and make arrangements for you to see everything.  You won't be disappointed. 9one8-4nine6-one5three0"

M92 454 Casull Stainless

I love this rifle, but I have decided to down-size.
This is a beauty! I have never seen one like it.
Accurate, Hard Hitting, Versatile- from 45 Long Colt Light Loads to full-house 454 Casull.
Did I mention it is Beautiful? Smooth Action, Fast Target Acquisition.
Effect on target is always a treat! At 100 yards it effortlessly burned through my 1/4"" steel Gong, but was big fun. At 140 yards I up-ended a 200# Hog.
The 20"" barrel gives opportunity for the 454 Casull cartage to shine.
Just a great all-around hunting and plinking rifle. That's right, I actually plink with 454.
