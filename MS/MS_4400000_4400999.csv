Today we have a Smith & Wesson CS9 sub compact pistol. I purchased this for my third generation collection about two years ago, and have since decided to fund other projects. I have never fired the pistol, only cleaned, oiled and greased during my monthly inspections of all my firearms. This gun was more than likely fired less than 100 times by the previous owner, and even more likely never carried. There are no discernible wear marks of any kind on the pistol. The rear of the slide has a scratch from the PO and I'm assuming it occurred during take down. The carbon version of this pistol is viewed by many to be more desirable, as carbon steel has better overall strength characteristics compared to stainless. If you are looking at this, then you know these are getting very difficult to find in this condition. As another bonus, this pistol remains with its original box and paperwork. Please have your CCP available for me to view and prepared to sign a bill of sale. If no conceal permit, I like to see a drivers liscense for residency and for my records.  Price is FIRM, no trades whatsoever please. 

   By the way, don't flag my post as spam simply becasue you don't like the price. I bought this pistol for 650 two years ago and never shot it. It's rare and desired, and you gotta pay to play."

You can read the article above and see why this revolver is coveted by collectors

""The blow came in 1973 when all Blackhawks were moved to the large frame originally built to contain the pressures of the .44 Magnum.  Now all Blackhawks—whether .44 Magnum, .45 Colt, or .357 Magnum—would be built on this hulking frame.

The larger frame was obviously needed to safely chamber the .44 Magnum, and the .45 Colt certainly benefited from the larger frame size as it essentially became a .45 Colt Magnum.  But the poor .357, one of the most ideal rounds for packing into the woods, receives no benefit from the larger frame at all."""

 The simple answer.. Someone who is tired of your shit..

Had you showed up to pick up your target on time or apologized for hanging up on me you'd be shooting instead of wasting more of my time on armslist.. 

Here's the story:
We schedule a time and place to meet, I'm 10min early (like respectable armslisters are) He texts me only after I have told him I'm in the meeting spot to tell me he's 30min late.. then calls and hangs up on me..

texts me the next day like nothing happens and asks to meet again.. I ignore him..  

Month later he tries again, I had cooled down and figured I'd just get rid of him..
several text messages and an attempted phone call.....you guessed it...nothing..

next day texts me again asking to meet..blames me for not getting back to him.. told him I wasn't interested in selling to him...  what a jerk I must be??

I understand that these can sell for 299.00 online, and sometimes even as low as 269.00 +  shipping and FFL fees, so I’m thinking that my asking price of $260 cash is pretty on target.  It will come with the original box, magazine, papers, spent casing from factory, and the remainder of a box of .380 target ammo that I got when I got this gun.

Gun has functioned flawlessly for the few rounds that have been put through it, prob less than a hundred. I've cleaned after every time shooting it. 

Night sights are less than a year old, tried getting a picture as seen to show how bright they are.  Only other thing I did, was put a little bright orange paint around frond sight, and a little white on rear sight, to help with sight picture during day, works for me, but could easily be removed with some paint thinner or goof off, I also tried to get a good picture of that.

When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.  Loaded Chamber IndicatorTaurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.  Accessory RailFeatures the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessories""Credit Cards accepted but do incur a 3% fee."

First gun, Excam Warrior HW357 .357 magnum revolver with a steel frame. This gun is in fair shape externally but works like it's brand new. It has nicks and scratches and some of the bluing on the trigger guard is worn away. At some point in its life the adjustable rear sight was broken and was recut. The sights are usable, but no longer adjust. I was told that the original owner was a security guard, and that fits with the condition of the gun. Carried much more than it was fired. Comes with a Blackhawk holster and two sets of grips; the original right handed target grips and a set of hard rubber grips off of a EAA  Windicator. 
This gun was built in Germany by H. Weihrauch. They have built revolvers for several different companies through the years including Excam, Arminius, FIE, Herters, EAA and others.

Second gun, Norinco model 54-1 in 7.62x25 Tokarev. This is the Chinese version of Tokarev TT-33 pistol that was built for import to the U.S. before the ban in 1993. It functions perfectly and all numbers match, including number on the magazine. Around 50 rounds of modern production PPU ammunition is included with the gun."

Can’t swear to the number of rounds that I’ve put through it, but I’m comfortable that it’s less than 500. Haven’t shot it much at all the last few years because my 1911 is just more fun. I recently bought another that’ll be my much lighter mid-sized carry gun.

It's in good condition, but not like new. Pistol by itself appraised 6/5 by my dealer at $375-400 for private sale as is without the original box (replacement on auction sites $20-25). No nicks but wearing of the finish at contact points. Can only upload one pic but can send more pics for wear on slide, safety, slide release, grip and barrel. 

Gun comes with 4 magazines. 2 factory 10 rounders, one thirteen round Mec-Gar flush fit, and one 15 rd Mec-Gar extended magazine (5/8” longer than the flush fit). Also comes with light tan leather Bianchi #5 holster (right side or left side cross-draw. Not currently produced.), a nylon Ace Case  holster (either side) & 250 rounds of fmj (150 of 180 gr Lawman and 100 of 165 gr Winchester)."

*Small chunk out of lower buttstock, wrist in good shape (many of these are not). 
*Small crack in forearm was epoxy repaired and will not rebreak. 
*Action in great shape, I test fired it. It's 1903 vintage, however and like all guns over 100 years of age you should have it checked by a competent gunsmith YOU trust before firing - you don't know me from Adam!
*Still short chambered for older paper shells (see below). 
*I didn't ""slick up"" the action, but I did smooth it out with a detailed cleaning and gross de-burring. It's not a race-ready competition gun, but it's mighty nice (for a model 97...)
*Takedown frontend serial numbers match receiver. Plenty of adjustment left on the barrel lug. Takedown fit is nice and tight. Serial range: 200,xxx
*Receiver custom engraved E.J (or G.) Babcock - unknown history.
*Very nice patia and moderate finish left (see pictures).
