The rifle maybe has 500 rounds through it. I have babied it since i got it. Milled ak's are amazing, the action is smooth as butter and very accurate. i am asking $1300 OBO for this. If you look at all the accessories and this rifle new it would be close to 2k in price. the rifle alone is 1200. This package is a steal. i just have to many rifles and way to many ak's so i am thinning the herd. Please no low ball offers. Will ship to Legal states must ship to legal FFL."

The Winchester Model 69 was a bolt-action .22 caliber repeating rifle first produced in 1935 by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. It was marketed as Winchester's mid-priced bolt-action rimfire sporting rifle, positioned above inexpensive single-shot rifles such as the Model 68 and beneath the prestigious Model 52. An uncommon Model 69 variant, the Model 697, was offered with a telescopic sight and no provisions for iron sights. Production ended in 1963."

I am first and only owner of this weapon.  Has slight holster wear from normal use.  Will come with everything from factory.  The threaded barrel IS a sig factory barrel, not aftermarket.  This is the threaded model scorpion.  I am open to all reasonable trades.  I will add accordingly if needed.  Threaded handguns take priority.  Then 9mm and then .45."

This ammo is from a fresh factory run of ammunition that did not meet spec for a military contract. The cases of the ammo may be dented or otherwise not 100% uniform in a way that does not affect performance.

The two most common 5.56 rounds are the 55gr M193 and the 62gr “green tip” M855, both of which are used by the US military. The US made M855 is painted with a green tip to distinguish it from M193, so that troops do not shoot M855 in their 1 turn every 12 inch twist barreled M16's that would fail to properly stabilize the heavier and much longer bullet (length being a primary factor in bullet stabilization). The NATO SS109 62gr steel core “penetrator” bullet is used in the M855 round. The steel penetrator makes it more effective at penetrating hard targets and such.

5.56 ammunition is only to be used in rifles labeled 5.56mm, and must NOT be used in those rifles labeled .223.

Many of the now well known early American engravers like Nimschke studied Ernst’s patterns while in industrial school in Germany. This style became the foundation of American firearms engraving when his students emigrated to this countryThe Walther Ernst PPKS uses a more Germanic style Ernst pattern on the slide with a centered gold deer on a stainless pistol. The safety reflects the pattern. These were the last 200 Walther PPKS made under contract by the S&W Houlton, Maine factory. The grips are a walnut laminate with the Walther logo and a reflection of the slide design in the center. The guns are marked sequentially “One of 200” on the frame.Once in a great while, a firearm becomes so popular that it becomes a cultural icon. Like a great car or movie, a great firearm can become a true classic. The PPK established a defining influence on the design of concealed carry firearms. Its elegant lines and precision engineering have a timeless appeal. And a PPK has the solid feel of pure quality. More than ever, the PPK is a statement of sophistication.Developed in 1931, the Walther PPK continues to thrill the shooting public and the legend lives on. The PPK/S, with a longer frame for one additional cartridge, and the PPK are now both produced in the USA. Features of the PPK and PPK-S include a firing pin safety, manual safety with decocking function, double action and single action trigger and extended beaver tail.

The 44US was designed exclusively for the war department as a target trainer, intended solely for use by U.S. troops. It was adapted from the pre-war 44B model, and included adaptations like those made to the 42MB -- made mostly to keep costs down. The war department wanted an accurate, dependable, heavy-barreled trainer, and was willing to sacrifice cosmetic detail to make it affordable. While the 44B featured a deluxe, genuine walnut stock with long beavertail and cheek piece, the 44US stock was plain, usually birch with walnut finish. The four-position (adjustable) front swivel plate was removed, and both front and rear swivels were fixed, on the 44US. The hooded front sight was replaced by a plain post, the rear sight was the S-100, originally adjustable forward and back through four sets of screw positions (later reduced to three and then two). The first batch was shipped with Lyman 57MS receiver peep hole sights.

Selling my very lightly used Rock Island Armory GI 1911 in 9mm. Package includes RIA GI 1911 in 9MM, two (2) 9-round mags (1 stainless & 1 blued), Safariland ALS paddle holster, and one (1) pair of ""stag"" grips I bought on ebay from Thailand (the original RIA grips are included too). I'm not sure if the ""Stag"" grips are real stag or not, but they look great. I think the ""stag"" may be made of water buffalo, but I am not positive. I painted the front sight ""blaze orange"" to make aiming easier. If you don't like it, you can easily remove it with nail polish remover. Price is $300 + transfer or would trade for a Ruger LC9S or S&W M&P Shield in 9mm . I won't ship.  I'd like a face to face transfer at a FFL within reason from where Philadelphia, Bucks County, and Montgomery County all come together."

The truck was from California and was repaired from a front left crash and has a salvage title. This truck has been super reliable. It was my daily driver during the winter, I had a sweet summer ride so it kept the miles low. I have 3 Toyotas and they are the best. This truck was always professionally serviced. Brakes were recently done. Comes with a remote starter, weather tech floor mats, topper, tow hitch, engine block heater. AC works but is not strong, some rust starting above windshield. Passed Frame inspection at Burnsville Toyota. Again this is 2 wheel drive but has been a great winter truck and if you need a reliable truck for a good price this is it. Interior has no tears and is in great condition. If you are looking at financing I believe Spire Credit Union will finance salvage titles. Email me with any questions."

Harrison’s “U.S. Pistols & Revolvers 1909-1944”. For the avid 1911A1 collector, you know that this is a rare piece as described in Clawson’s book: Beginning in October 1942, the acute need for pistols prompted Colt to transfer 6,575 unsold commercial Government Model automatic pistols to their existing military contract. The existing commercial serial numbers were peened flat on the receiver and under the slide firing pin stop and restamped/renumbered in the military serial number range. All or most of these pistols were originally manufactured wit the Swartz safety. These safeties were removed when the pistol was transferred to the military contract and these “Swartz safety” pistols can be easily identified by a square hole located beside the disconnector cutout in the slide (THIS IS one) Slides retained the original commercial inscriptions . Barrels transferred with these pistols were either “S” (commercial) or “G” (standard military)…(This one contains a “G” barrel - The pistols were parkerized and submitted to Ordnance inspectors for military acceptance. An Ordnance inspection mark (crossed cannons) was stamped on the receivers W.B. or GHD inspectors marks present on left side of receiver."
