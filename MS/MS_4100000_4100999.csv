Large enough for one big man and a small child or two slender adults but excellent for one fisherman with room to put things on the bench seat beside him while fishing and stretch out his legs. 44 inches wide compared to the one man that is 32 inches wide.
Used 5 times total. Abe to set up with shanty straight up for a wind block or closed.

Zippered door, vent flaps, cargo door in back and closable window flaps.
Weight is just under 50lbs and lighter than the new versions. Large enough I found carrying a folding kitchen/card table chair sat inside the shanty allows for another 3-4 inches of fishing room and added comfort. Im 6 foot and 260. Plenty of room for lantern, bucket, two poles fished with lots of food/bait/drink storage space behind you. 

EASY to set up and take down. Perfect for father / son or daughter team without breaking the bank.  Light a lantern in it closed up on cold windy days and you can take your coat off after 20 minutes or so.

Selling to upgrade only if it sells for one big enough for a couple of us to fish all night.

All I can say is what a gun. DA trigger is the easiest and smoothest that I ever felt. SA breaks like my Custom Les Baer. Accuracy 1.5 “ at 50 yards. That's 50 yards not 50 feet. 

This gun put my SIG P210 & SIG P226 X-5 to being irrelevant, and I sold them. You ask then why should I want to sell some of my prized guns? My only problem is my age and my wrist pain, makes it very painful to shoot anymore, and you can't take your possessions with you, unless you were a dead Egyptian king. 

Here is your chance to get one of these guns without the long waiting period, and be able to see and feel it in person. Shot maybe 1 box through it to test functionality and accuracy, but like all my guns it is still LNIB. I still have guns that I have never shot in my safe. To the guy who almost has everything, this is one that you have to have, but it isn't cheap. $1850. Comes with CZ case and (3) 18 round mags, test target and no waiting list.
Check out the CZ Custom site: http://czcustom.com/czcaccushadowblk.aspx
and click on the AccuShadow model and read some of the reviews. Mine has all the options including a hand picked and fitted barrel to my specs.

This might be your only chance to see one in the aftermarket, because they are such a custom backlogged gun.

Don't need the money, just getting older everyday.  

I would like to sell some of my guns & personal items (but not at wholesale) and get down to a couple of CCW guns only; but I will still look at trades, (Pistols in 9mm only or other high end watches as trade material in an up or down value trade.) Being retired buying, selling and trading is still one of the fun things I still like doing.

I like things that most everyone else doesn't have. I have had Rolex's, Breitling's & Omega's, but still own my 22 year old S&G Omega Seamaster Professional 300 Super Quartz watch that's accurate to 2 seconds per year. My watch happens to be the most accurate dive/sport/dress watch in the world, and I'll even sell it at $6000; included a pic just in case the person that thinks he has everything wants it. If you want more information on this watch, and how I can make such a claim that it is the most accurate dive/sport/dress watch in the world, send me your email and I will send you back the information that will back that up. I guarantee that it will be informative if you are looking for a high end Holy Grail Watch you have to consider this watch in your collection? Also have a NIB Never worn Breitling Aeromarine Colt Super Quartz dive/sport watch for $1850. WR to 500m, and accurate to 10 sec/year.

Don't respond to this ad asking a bunch of questions that are already in the ad, please. Read ad first. Everything is priced fairly in today's gouging market so I'm not really looking to negotiate. It has been used, but not abused. The rifle has 1500 rounds through it without a hiccup. The lower wood handguard has a wear spot on it. The buffer tube stock adaptor has a mil-spec buffer tube on it but will accept commercial tubes as well. It does not shoot like your regular out of the box AK. The recoil has been reduced to less than that of an AR and I have held a 2 inch group with a smoking hot barrel. This is a very nice piece for anyone looking for a pre-setup AK. This package would easily cost you at least $1400 brand new. I am at $1000 firm, not one cent lower. I will take any lower offer as outright disrespect.

Product Information
Shop more BlackHawk products
The Gladius flashlight is packed with unique features including durable aluminum construction, fully-adjustable light intensity, automatic temperature control to avoid overheating, low battery indicator and a lock-out tail cap. Three operation modes provide momentary, constant-on and strobe functions. Run time: 90 minutes at full power, 400 hours at lowest setting (1 lumen). Length: 6-1/4"". Weight: 6-1/2 oz. 

Technical Information

Bezel diameter: 1.25""
Tailcap diameter: 1.25""
Body diameter: 1""
Length (bezel to tailcap): 6.23""
Weight (without batteries): 6.63 oz

Material and operation: Aluminum, waterproof, LED bulbs. Tailcap has thumb-activated button and a rotary dial surrounding the button.

Settings:
Standard. Tailcap turned fully clockwise. Press button - on, release button - off
Strobe. Tailcap in center detent. When button is pressed, light is in strobe mode.
Constant On and adjustable light level. Tailcap is fully counter-clockwise. 
a. Quick press and release of button leaves light on, repeat and light goes off.
b. Hold down on the button and the light will stay on and begin to get dimmer. When at desired light level, release button. Light has 100:1 ratio from 4 watts to 0.03 watts and takes 3 seconds once the sequence is started. To make light brighter, hold button down and light will get brighter.
System Off. Press button halfway down when tailcap is fully counter-clockwise. This will unlock the tailcap and it can be turned even farther counter-clockwise. This will lock the button and it will not depress. This mode allows storage of the light in a gear bag without the light activating.

Other Features:
Auto temperature control. If the light temperature becomes excessive, control cuts LED power by 50% (25% light reduction), allowing the temperature to gradually reduce. Light will continue to operate.
If temperature continues to rise after the power reduction, power is automatically terminated to protect LED and surrounding materials. When the light has cooled, it can be returned to full power by depressing the tailcap button.
Low Battery. When the battery life reaches a pre-determined point (which will vary depending on usage), the light will pulse twice every 15 seconds until the batteries are replaced. This low battery indication is programmed for the momentary and constant modes only.
Run time. Approximately 90 minutes of full power outlet (90 lumens), with an additional 20 minutes of gradually reducing light output. Approximately 400+ hours at the lowest setting (approximately 1 lumen)."

Stainless and Nitron Coated full sized gun.  It is a .45 and it has only been test fired.  I was selling another gun with this one but after several requests to separate them, I am.  Like I said, it is brand new and comes with a brand new Mitch Rosen Sig Sauer holster that is black leather.  The holster has never been used as well.  This gun comes with all the original packaging and has a lock, extra magazine, etc.  Not interested in trading or negotiating.  I actually had this sold from a person on here but he wouldn't show his license to me so I called it off.  I actually lowered the price a bit more to sell this quickly to a person who is legally able to own it and can prove it."

$800 package not including taxes, shipping, or labor to install. Reason for the Trigger and Mainspring housing swap was 1) to rid this P938 of ALL plastic parts (both those are plastic on ALL P938's) and 2) For the color ""Pop"". I could have done black, but the Red makes this very unique and the mainspring housing and grips were VERY hard to locate in RED. You will NOT find another one like this.

This is a Finnish M28/76 rifle. Hard to find, but worth the wait. This particular example is complete with the front and rear target sights, the aperture disc for the rear sight, AND a set of replacement front diopter sights (incredibly rare). It has the true two-stage M28-76 trigger. 

This rifle is a ""total sneak"" variant with almost no markings of any kind. Some small parts, like the sight, have a maker's mark, but there is no serial number or makers mark on the receiver or barrel.

No modifications of any kind, no corrosive ammunition at any time. All original, bore like a twisted mirror, bluing at 90% or better.

This rifle shoots 7.62x54R, not 7.62x53R (as many do). The bolt is light and tight, and the trigger is finest I've ever felt on a Mosin.

More pictures and details available.

And since Guitars are as cool as cars and guns I figured someone might be interested. I bought this thing for almost 2,000 back in the day and am looking for 1,400 in trade value. If you do want to buy it outright, I'd want 1,600 as they sell on ebay for 1,800. It is not still made, so it is appreciating in value, I just shoot more than I play guitar anymore. I'm open to all trade deals, or trade and cash which is preferred. I also have several guitar pedals and even a Bogner Marshall Half stack I'm trading. So if you had a AUG or SCAR or something crazy, we can get there. I'll list all the things I'm interested in below and even if what you have isn't on there, please reach out to me at 269-598-71four7. The worst thing I could say is no. Thanks.  BTW I am willing to drive or pay transfer fees if necessary."

https://www.classicfirearms.com/m91-30-mosin-nagant-rifle-from-pwarms

This gun is in decent/good condition, rifling is strong and it is not counterbored. 

I am only selling because I need to downsize my collection. 

The gun works great and shoots straight. 

I also have a new ATI Synthetic stock in the box I can sell separately for $50. 

Bayonet included. I believe the serial numbers on the gun are matching as well. 

I will upload pictures when I have a chance though it may be 2-3 AM tomorrow when I do so. 

I can ship this to any NC resident(to your house!) so long as you are not barred from owning firearms. Its legal to ship a rifle or shotgun to another resident in state. 

Shipping is $25, thats what it cost me at UPS last time I shipped a Mosin to another NC resident. Its probably best I just ship you the gun, unless you live very close by as gas cost will likely exceed shipping.

This new 30-30 load was designed as the single 30-30 load for all big game hunting. The Barnes TSX opens fast enough to be brutal on deer sized critters, yet penetrates like TSX bullets normally do, so it gives ample penetration for larger species such as elk. While we feel the 30-30 is marginal for big bull elk, this is the load to use if you choose to pursue elk with a 30-30 and then use the same load to hunt deer, so you don’t have to readjust your sights for differing loads. This is the perfect load to hunt black bear of all sizes with as the bullet will expand fast enough to deliver terminal devastation on smallish bear, but will penetrate deeply enough for 500+ lb bear.



The below velocities were shot from my personal rifles. We believe the industry wide use of extra long laboratory test barrels gives unrealistic high velocities that you’ll never realize in hunting rifles. So, we give you real world velocities from real world rifles, so you know what to expect in the real world, where it matters.

The gun has less than 300 rounds through it. It has very slight wear on the bluing on the right front sharp edge near the top of the slide. Marginal wear on mechanicals. As far as I can tell (feed ramp being the best indicator) and reading up on gun blue book value - this would be a conservative ""Very Good"" 

I understand that there aren't many of these models that come around. I can't find a recent posting for this model.

Other info: Extremely rare piece. Blued Series 80 MkIV bought new in 1990s by original owner. Acquired recently from owner(friend). Very good condition with 2 factory Colt magazines. Original plastic box. No manual

The only thing I could find in terms of production run is the link below. The post states that the poster got a letter from Colt stating a production run of approx 800 Delta Gold Cups in blue. I tried calling Colt Customer Service and they stated that they are not given that number.

Military surplus 7.62x54r is currently purchasable in the U.S. in 440 round spam cans for under $100. This ammo is imported from Soviet Union cold war stockpiles. Importantly, the cost translates to about .20 cents per round! 

What firearms shoot this great ammo? The Mosin Nagant is a high quality and affordable bolt-action rifle that shoots this inexpensive ammo. Currently, you can't afford a semi-automatic that shoots this round! The prices on semi-autos that shoot the 7.62x54r range from a low of $1000-$1500 (i.e., PSL, VEPR-54, SVT-40) to $5000 (i.e., NDM-86, TIGR) and upwards of $20,000 (SVD Dragunov).

For sale here is a 1944 year model m44 Mosin Nagant. It is in very nice (collectable) condition. It includes the sling and bayonet. It was made at Izhevsk and is all numbers matching. The gun shows little signs of usage and has a beautiful stock.

It is in extremely nice condition and I have never had a malfunction with it.

This little Llama .380 was made in 1974. Why is that important? It was the last year that they made it with a true 1911 style locked-breech action. After this, Llama cheapened them up by making them a blowback. The locked breech is more accurate, stronger, and more reliable than what came later. It also seems to have much less felt recoil. I have owned both and there is a significant difference, with the earlier guns like this one being much better in all categories. 

This one has factory adjustable sights and is a dream to shoot. I shoot empty shotgun shells with it at 25 yards all the time.

I am available to meet you almost any time here in Santa Fe.

Contact me through Armslist with your phone number and I will call you so we can meet. You will like it. It's tiny, but it seems to fit most hands, and is a great car gun or concealed carry gun. Everyone who has evr held this one has commented on how comfortable it is, and how nice the trigger is.  I am cheap on this one. Very cheap, and I know it - so the price is firm.
