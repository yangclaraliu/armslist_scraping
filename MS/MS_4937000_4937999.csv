- Fiber Optic Dual Line Sight System Optimized for fast-handling balance/instinctive pointing
- Ultrareliable Inertia Driven semiautomatic bolt system
- Comes with three choke tubes and a choke-tube wrench
- 4+1 capacity for 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells
- Weighs only 6.5lbs!!

The Franchi I-12 represents a new line of Franchi auto-loaders by incorporating a free-floating bolt with the Inertia Driven System. The I-12 is well-balanced, and features a narrow-profile fore-end and buttstock. This Franchi shotgun will handle anything from 1-1/8-ounce target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. Every I-12 Franchi shotgun is powered by the Inertia Driven System. That means no bulky gas cylinders, valves, pistons, or hardware. Without that extra baggage, the I-12 has a slender, low-profile fore-end that fits the shooter's hand for comfortable handling. The I-12's specially-designed recoil pad incorporates a two-part system called the Twin Shock Absorber. During firing, the TSA recoil pad initially holds its shape, and then deeply compresses with the recoil, soaking up the kick and spreading recoil energy over a wider area of the shooter's shoulder, reducing felt recoil by up to 44%. The I-12 in Max-4 HD is an ideal choice as a waterfowl gun. This variant also features a 28-inch ventilated rib barrel, and a red-bar front sight and includes a set of screw-in choke tubes.

Comes with all the chokes plus a Carlson's Black Cloud Duck Choke and even a very TIGHT EXTRA FULL turkey choke that sticks out the barrel 2 inches. These 2 chokes alone are worth at least $100.

Also includes a full set of custom Buttstock shims to allow adjustment in length, as well as side-to-side and Up/Down.

As well as an additional Buttsock Cheekpad from Benelli.

MSRP: $849

This rifle fires the new .270 WSM: an amazing round.  It has the same trajectory as the 7mm Remington Mag as well as the same energy at all ranges.

The recoil of the .270 WSM is similar to that of the .270 Winchester.  The inertia drive system and advanced cartridge design combine to make this powerful rifle a pleasure to shoot.  This is why knowledgeable long range and short range shooter find the .270 WSM so attractive.

The original Colt medallion grips are in excellent shape with a few minor marks. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent as well. Mechanically, the King Cobra was essentially a stainless Trooper Mark V and was a heavy duty revolver made to take a steady diet of full power magnum cartridges. It appears this example has been fired but very little. It comes in the original plastic case with the outer sleeve which is serial numbered to the gun. The owner's manual and miscellaneous factory paperwork is included, According to Colt, this King Cobra was manufactured in 1996. A very nice example!

This is a stainless steel King Cobra. This beauty is chambered for the .357 Magnum and wears the 4"" full lug barrel. The sights are adjustable, the rear sight featuring the white outline blade, the front a ramp with red insert. Condition is close to new and the gun shows no wear aside from the usual cylinder turn line. There are no scratches or dings, no rust or pitting. If I had to pick a number I'd call this Colt 98%+. The original Colt medallion grips are in excellent shape with a few minor marks. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent as well. Mechanically, the King Cobra was essentially a stainless Trooper Mark V and was a heavy duty revolver made to take a steady diet of full power magnum cartridges. It appears this example has been fired but very little. It comes in the original plastic case with the outer sleeve which is serial numbered to the gun. The owner's manual and miscellaneous factory paperwork is included, According to Colt, this King Cobra was manufactured in 1996. A very nice example! Buyer pays $30.00 shipping. ask me if you have questions."

I am the original owner, which I purchased from Vance's. It's made in Italy and works flawlessly. I also have a OTB holster that comes with it. I am only selling it to finance another project. If you have any questions, please let me know and Ohio residents only, CCW preferred. Thanks!

Description:
The Beretta 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.
Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively on or off. The safety lever also functions as the pistols decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.
The Beretta 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them. One of the most tested and trusted personal defense weapons in history.

Description:
The Beretta 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.
Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively on or off. The safety lever also functions as the pistols decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.
The Beretta 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them. One of the most tested and trusted personal defense weapons in history.
