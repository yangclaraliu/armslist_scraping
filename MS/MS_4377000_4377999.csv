Hi all, I have a really nice winchester 1200 20ga 21"" barrel with ATI tactical 6 position stock with pistol grip, cree flashlight with battery and charger, aprx. 14 slugs, 45 #3 buck and a crap load of #6 bird shot and some #4 bird, approx. About 100 all together, with sling that holds 15 rounds and a bandolier that holds 55 rounds. This 1200 is in very good condition, and with all the accessories and ammo it is easily a $450 trade value, this is not a cheap shotgun, it's a Winchester, it's only had minimum rounds put thru it and spent decades in a gun safe, oiled and babied. I Will trade for a Taurus millenium G2 with ammo or Ruger SR9c.  I am disabled now and want one of those fine dependable compact guns for the bedside and have a good rifle and a great 1911 as needed for longer shots or extended fire fights, lol. The Taurus or ruger would be primarily for night time or any concealed carry."

MORE INFO:

Full-Length Sizer Dies for bottleneck cases have vents to prevent case damage caused by trapped air and for excessive lubricant. Headspace is held to minimum tolerances to avoid changing the case body length during full length sizing.

Dies are properly hardened and hand polished. This special RCBS finishing produces a die that will withstand years and years of the abrasive type of wear cause by the sizing.

All RCBS Seater Dies have a built-in roll or taper crimper as appropriate for the particular caliber. To seat BULLETS without crimping, simply unscrew the die until the crimp ring no longer engages the case mouth.
Large, Easy-to-adjust hex lock rings utilize hex head set screws. Unless otherwise noted, all 

RCBS precisioneered Dies have the standard 7/8""-14 thread. Dies are packaged in stackable, plastic storage boxes specially designed to protect the dies in shipping. Includes loading data label.

They both have surface rust and pitting on the receivers, bolts, and other metal bits. Both seem to function fine but I haven't fired either one. I received them for some landscaping work but project guns aren't really my thing so I'm looking to sell or trade em.
Gun #1 has the most rust, but it seems to be mostly isolated to the receiver and bolt. I haven't taken either of them apart so the rust may extend under the stock. It is still packed with cosmoline and has the nicer stock of the two
Gun #2 This one seems to have less rust on it but it's scattered in several spots, like the receiver, bolt sling swivels and magazine.  Again I haven't taken them apart so It'd be my guess that there's more hidden under the stock. The upper handguard has a crack in it.
Armslist will only let me upload three pics so if you'd like to get a better idea at the condition contact me and I can send some more pics
These would make a good project, parts or truck guns. I'm asking $110 a piece or $200 for both.

The Geissele Super Dynamic Triggers are the Super Dynamic - Combat (SD-C), Super Dynamic - Enhanced (SD-E) and the Super Dynamic - 3 Gun (SD-3G). These triggers incorporate a unique, flat trigger bow that is patterned after the trigger of an M1911 pistol. The flat bow reduces the perceived pull weight of the trigger and improves the trigger’s already outstanding tactile feedback to give the operator outstanding weapon control. All Super Dynamic Triggers are rugged, non-adjustable combat triggers with a sear design that provides a wide margin of safety against unintentional discharges yet still gives the operator a sharp, repeatable trigger release.

The Geissele Super Dynamic Triggers are the Super Dynamic - Combat (SD-C), Super Dynamic - Enhanced (SD-E) and the Super Dynamic - 3 Gun (SD-3G). These triggers incorporate a unique, flat trigger bow that is patterned after the trigger of an M1911 pistol. The flat bow reduces the perceived pull weight of the trigger and improves the trigger’s already outstanding tactile feedback to give the operator outstanding weapon control. All Super Dynamic Triggers are rugged, non-adjustable combat triggers with a sear design that provides a wide margin of safety against unintentional discharges yet still gives the operator a sharp, repeatable trigger release. Constructed of precision-machined tool steel, these triggers provide the ultimate combination of precision and reliability."

First picture is a stock photo but every thing shown is in the box.

Freefloats Barrel & Gives Fast Install/Removal Of Accessories. At its heart, the KeyMod™ system creates the potential for universal modularity between various manufacturers of accessories and accessory rails. As more options become available, new KeyMod™ accessories will attach directly to the KeyMod™ slots rather than via Picatinny rail segments, creating a lighter, cleaner, and less bulky weapon system. The BCM KMR also allows for a greater range of customization, offering an additional 4 offset mounting points between traditional 3, 6, 9, and 12:00 positions.

 Manufactured from an exclusive blended aluminum and magnesium alloy, the BCM KMR weighs 30-40% less than pure aluminum with the same strength properties. The BCM KMR also features a proprietary patent pending mounting, indexing and lock up system that mitigates 12:00 rail movement due to heat generated from the barrel nut.

  The KMR's propriety finish is a plasma deposition process originally developed for the Aerospace industry. The finish creates a stabilized, ceramic-like surface coating with superior wear and scratch resistance when compared to anodized or even hard chrome. The stabilized nature of the coating means it has a higher corrosion resistance as well, due to the lack of ‘pores’ in the surface."

Antenna does not exist so radio stations are hard to get, from tires need replaced, paint is faded and chipped from being on the road. Interior is in pretty good shape. Leather seats are cracked here and there but nothing major. It had a small front end collision before we got it. You can hardly tell except the front left head light pops out a little bit. Never fell out completely but it does protrude a little bit. Its a great car, mechanically sound with no problems with the motor or transmission. 4WD, power seats, power windows, leather seats, power mirrors, towing package. Great family car, we have had it loaded with 8 people, filled in the back and pulling a 16 foot enclosed trailer and it handled all of it great.

The Geissele Super Dynamic Triggers are the Super Dynamic - Combat (SD-C), Super Dynamic - Enhanced (SD-E) and the Super Dynamic - 3 Gun (SD-3G). These triggers incorporate a unique, flat trigger bow that is patterned after the trigger of an M1911 pistol. The flat bow reduces the perceived pull weight of the trigger and improves the trigger’s already outstanding tactile feedback to give the operator outstanding weapon control. All Super Dynamic Triggers are rugged, non-adjustable combat triggers with a sear design that provides a wide margin of safety against unintentional discharges yet still gives the operator a sharp, repeatable trigger release. Constructed of precision-machined tool steel, these triggers provide the ultimate combination of precision and reliability."

I thought I would try to sell it locally before moving it to Gunbroker or doing a forum sale.

The rifle for sale here has great bluing, 90% remains. The wood has some nicks but nothing major. The action is smooth as can be and the rifle groups well out to 100 yards. It has been shot/carried very little.

The Remington Model 8 was invented by John Browning and was one of the world's first successful semi-auto rifles. It is a takedown design almost like modern survival rifles. It has the same safety as the AK-47; Kalashnikov copied this from the 8/81. The 81 was the updated version introduced in 36' and made until 1950. This one is chambered in .35 Remington. The .35 is entirely a lever gun round now days but it was originally made as an intermediate cartridge of sorts for this semi rifle. I have 3 boxes of .35 Remington Core-Lokt and Hornady Lever Revolution available too. I will give you at least 20 cases of .35 for reloading for free. 

Great fun gun with collector value or a hard-hitting, fast shooting brush gun for deer or bear if you hunt in WV or NY (or other states that allow hunting with semis) at times. You simply cannot get a semi-auto chambered in .35 Remington anymore.

Thanks for reading! Let me know if you want to see any more photos.

I will trade this rifle for a Browning BLR in certain calibers; .243, 7mm-08, .270, .308."

It was made in the Tula factory (the best Russian factory for them) in 1938, before the soviet union did any fighting in WWII.  It is in really excellent condition and has a great bore with crisp rifling, smooth bolt, and the stock doesn't show any signs of wear.  I looked at over 30 Mosins to find the best one, and chose this over a number of hex receivers.  The bluing is amazing for its age, and all I did was remove the cosmoline and refinish the stock.  The serial numbers match, including the bayonet.  I honestly think this rifle was hardly shot, it looks unissued.  Asking $280 obo."

Serial #227xx, This gun absolutely pristine. Shoots exactly to the point of aim and even have ammo and dies to go with. What makes this gun so rare is the characteristics of a 99B vs. other model 99's is full Octagonal barrel 26"" long. Straight grip with a ""Perch Belly"" Steel rifle butt that is curved, schnoble tip knife edge dovetail. As you can tell in the pictures this gun is beautiful. This gun has never been drilled and tapped..

Model 99b's are rare and in this condition its even more rare. Model 99's used a rotary magazine to hold the cartridges. The rotating magazine uses a spring-loaded spool with grooves to hold the cartridges. It also has a counter to indicate how many shots are left. This guns counter works perfect and functions flawless.

The rotating magazine design allowed the rifle to be one of the first lever-action rifles to use spitzer bullets. Previous lever-action rifles used tubular magazines, which placed cartridges of ammunition end to end. Another safety feature was that upon cocking the rifle, a small pin protrudes above the top receiver to indicate the rifle is cocked and ready to fire. This design was ahead of its time. This is a very early model 99.

This is a great deer rifle or collector piece in its current refurbished condition. This gun will not disappoint. Email or text if interested 918-four02-0854. FTF in tulsa area only."
