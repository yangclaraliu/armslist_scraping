The story:
 Theres a ton of ammo flippers at the moment, so I thought I would explain why I'm selling a large amount of ammo. I'm new gun owner and purchased the ammo along with my first pistol. It has since been traded for a 1911, so I find myself with a bunch of ammo I can't shoot, with no plans to buy another 9mm handgun for quite some time. Rather than letting it sit I figure that the money would be better going to things like gas, car insurance, and taking my very deserving fiancee to dinner."

This HK is a 9 mm, 18-round, double action only, semi-automatic polymer frame pistol manufactured by German arms firm Heckler & Koch GmbH. VP stands for Vollautomatische Pistole, and the designation 70 was for the year of the first edition: 1970.

The HK VP70 Z was the first polymer-framed pistol and predates the Glock 17 by 12 years. This weapon weighs 28.9 oz unloaded, lighter than most other metal framed pistols of its time.  Although it was the first polymer pistol, the Remington Nylon 66 rifle introduced in 1959 was the first polymer-framed firearm in production.

The VP70 uses a spring-loaded striker like a Glock, instead of a conventional firing pin. It is double action only so the trigger pull is relatively heavy. In lieu of a blade front sight, the VP70 uses a polished ramp with a central notch in the middle to provide the illusion of a dark front post. Contrary to a common misconception, the VP70 does indeed have a manual safety. It is the circular button located immediately behind the trigger and is a common cross block safety.

I have attached a picture of page 157 of the Modern Gun Values, 15th Edition that shows in perfect condition the gun's value is $750.00.  In my opinion, the gun is in perfect condition; however, I also realize that only a true HK collector would pay that.  

I have the original box, test target and manual.

I've got a Ruger Vaquero .357 mag with a 4 5/8 barrel and blue finish. It's a single action revolver. It will come with a cowboy belt and holster. It does have some wear marks on the cylinder but stuff a good looking shooter. One cool thing I do like is that you can shoot .38's out of it for more fun times shooting instead of the 357 mag.

I thought I'd like this kind of revolver but turns out it's not my cup of tea...

( because it is 19.99 a box) compared to 44.99 for the .308(win) . Some guy at the gun shop told me i am risking blowing up my barrell by firing that through it. was he just trying to get me to spend more money on the .308 Win for double the price of the .308nato? i have fired a few boxes of the nato and had no problems but just seeing if anybody out there knows if there is a risk or anything more than me. thank you for your help."

Imported CZ 75 full size with 1 16-round MecGar magazine. Military/Police trade in. 

Not much needed to be said. This is definitely the most accurate 9mm I've shot and is an awesome and one of the best 9mms ever made. 

I have shot about 100 rounds through this and it has had no issues at all. Range buddies were very impressed with the accuracy, but those that know CZ 75s already knew this.

This is not a Pre-B model, it is actually a transitional model (1994) between the Pre-B and CZ 75B. It DOES accept MecGar mags, so that is a bonus, because Pre-B mags are hard to find and at least $40/ea. MidwayUSA sells the 16-round MecGar mags for $23, though you may find them lesser somewhere else.

This is essentially the same as a CZ 75B, which has a manual saftey and can be carried ""cocked & locked"", like a 1911, but no decocker.

Frame is in very good condition, but has some minor wear and some minor nicks. I doubt you will notice at all. The only noticeable wear is on the back right of the slide, but has no impact on functionality. Again, not very noticeable. Of course, the slide can be cerakoted or refinished if desired. See if you can notice on the last pic.

Barrel is in pristine condition. Firearm is cleaned well and oiled. 

CZ 75s are rare on the used market because people like to keep them. I would like to as well, but need to keep my carry piece and sell off my other 9s to pay some bills, so cannot accept any trades at this time.

The great thing about the CZ 75 is the affordability of its components if you wanted to change things out. Factory rear sight is only $9 at cz-usa.com. Front sights are only $5. Unless you want to go night sights, of course.

Priced to move. Tangfolios (CZ clones) aren't even priced this low.

Heavy holster wear on the slide, but I didn't get it refinished as it gives it character. If desired, Sig Sauer can refinish the slide for $99.95. Range buddies of mine said I'd be crazy to do so, because it looks great. Here is the link:

There's absolutely nothing wrong with the pistol and I'd keep it, but I'm looking for something a little smaller.  Comes with box, manual, 3 10-round magazines, speed loader, cleaning brush and rod, extra rear sight and a few other spare parts.  Everything that's in the pictures below.

Also includes 200 rounds of .45 caliber ammo in the following quantities: 50 rounds Winchester Premium Law Enforcement, 50 rounds of Magtech, and 100 rounds of Speer Lawman (last two are 230 gr. FMJ).  That's well over $100 in ammo alone!

As a kicker, I'm throwing in a 27 round magazine and a Galco Matrix holster (not pictured).

Skip the background check, taxes, waiting period, expense of extra mags and ammo and miscellaneous fees, and buy the complete package today!  Cash, trade, or cash & trade.  I am willing to travel a little to meet if you're coming from far away, or will ship the pistol package (minus ammo) to a Wisconsin resident within the state after payment clears (yes, it's legal).

**Because of all the e-mails I've gotten today, read the following addendums**
1.  I will only split up the package by removing the ammo, not magazines or the holster or anything else.
2. My price is pretty firm.  Yes, it's a Gen 2 gun, but it's seen less use than many of the Gen 4's I see posted on here, besides which there's almost $300 in extras here!
3. IF YOU SEE THIS, THE GUN IS STILL FOR SALE!!!!"

Also the original hard box, and the cardboard cover, instructions and factory paperwork, and the brush and cleaning tool. (also in the picture are a lock and sight for a rifle that are not supposed to go with this handgun)

from the manufacturers website:
 The CZ 2075 RAMI is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ 75 line of pistols. Just like the 75, the RAMI is double action/single action, allowing it to be carried in different conditions depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety.

Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI ships with a 10 round flush-mount magazine and 14 round extended magazine in the 9mm Luger version. With a 3” barrel and an unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the black polycoat, alloy-framed RAMI is ideal for concealed carry.

from Haus of Guns:
Down to a man every last person who had their hands on the CZ RAMI 2075 boasted about how accurate it was even at marginally long distances. I started at the typical self-defense distance of 7 yards (20 feet). Ironically as I backed up it became evident that this gun was factory sited to be dead on more in the 15 – 20 yard range. Not sure what type of self defense altercations are expected in the Czech Republic, but around here that’s quite a poke! In my hour of shooting I ran over 200 rounds of ammo through the little CZ without so much as a hiccup. ZERO malfunctions or disappointments and that makes Ebbs a happy shooter! I even went the extra mile to mix up ammo types and load it randomly even TRYING to get it to burp and she refused. The accuracy of the CZ is also afforded heavily by the precision of its sights. The rear sights are full adjustable for elevation and windage and they appear to have a green tint (not night sights) and a little glow to them in low light. It’s going to sound ridiculous to say this, but this gun almost felt more accurate at longer distances than it did at closer ranges.

    Kahr CM9 9mm Sub-Compact Pistol
    Crimson Trace Laser
    Old Faithful IWB Kydex and Leather holster fitted for the pistol with the laser
    Pierce grip installed + extra Pierce Grip
    Nylon pocket holster
    All boxes, manuals, and paperwork for everything


The Pistol:

    This Kahr CM9 pistol has had less than 100 rounds put through it and is in excellent condition. It was thoroughly cleaned after its two visits to the range. The original box and paperwork is included. It has a single 6 round magazine which give the pistol a 7 round capacity. I have installed a Pearce grip to give your pinky a place to rest. I include the original base of the magazine as well as an additional Pearce grip.



The Laser:

    Installed is an LG-437 laser sight which provides an instinctive front-activation point that engages with your natural firing grip. Simply hold the weapon normally and the Laserguard activates, placing a bright red dot where the gun is aimed. Seamlessly mounted to the trigger guard, this instinctive solution is critical to personal defense, and an excellent way to outfit your premium quality Kahr Arms concealed carry weapon. All the original box, paperwork, and tools are included.

The Holsters:

    This gun fits in your pocket making it perfect for summer wear, and a simple nylon holster is provided for that. Additionally this package contains an Old Faithful leather and Kydex holster which has been shaped for the pistol and the laser. This is a waste band concealed holster made of very high quality material, and I have found these to be one of the most comfortable holsters available.


I am asking $600 for all of this, but will consider interesting trades.

 I will accept credit card payments for a 3% transaction fee (the fee I am charge). I am not a dealer – this is a private sale. I am located in the Galleria area of North Dallas. Must be willing to sign a bill of sale or show a CHL."

When selling pistols be sure you are abiding by federal and North Carolina laws.  There are cops, feds, or anti-gun people posing as military members trying to buy guns without a permit.  They claim to be Army at Ft Bragg or Marines in Jacksonville.  They try to milk the fact that service members have a hard time getting PPPs.  They tug your heartstrings to get you to sell to them anyway so to pose gun owners as law breakers or charge you.  Whatever you do, always make sure your buyer has a NC Concealed Handgun Permit or Pistol Purchase Permit.  Also, be sure to get a bill of sale.  It will cover your butt if police come asking about a gun you sold that was used in a crime.  It isn't legally required, but it's a very good idea. http://bluelinedefense.com/d-files/bill_of_sale_1.pdf 

Our military members have honor, they will not break the law or go against their command to buy a gun.  If someone is trying to skirt the permit, do not sell to them.  It is likely a fed or an anti-gun person trying to get you in trouble."

I have a North American Arms 32acp Pocket Pistol. All steel construction with poly grips, 6+1 capacity. It is made for no frills dependability and protection. Great for summer carry, deep cover or as a back up gun. I wear a tailored suit or just shorts and a tee shirt with this gun and it conceals perfectly. (I call it my tuxedo gun)

As interested parties will see in their research of this gun that this usually does not come with night sights this one does. Had it sent back to the manufacture to have dove tails milled on the slide and then fitted with lollipop night sights. 

It is clean and well taken care of with a low shot count. I put a hundred rounds with ZERO failures. 

This is a great configuration for those who like the Legendary seecamp's 32 pocket pistols and do not want to pay out of the a** for something just as small but equally high in quality.

Once you put it in your hand you will feel the quality.

Heres what you get:
The Origonal Box
NAA 32acp Pocket Pistol
2 EXTRA magazines FILLED. 3 total(2 w/pinky ext and 1 flat base)
50 extra rounds of FMJ ammo

It is everything you need from the get go.

Fun pistol to shoot, but I could use some extra cash right now.  Note = these guns are know for ejection issues.  Using a 10/22 factory mag with the built-in ejector greatly reduces jams.  This one shoots really well with the Ruger BX25 mags, which are NOT included here.

Condition: 
  It hasn't come out of the safe in a while, it's clean and functions well, though like I said above these do tend to jam a bit if they don't like the ammo you're using.  For its age, I'd say it's in Very Good condition.  The battery is dead on the red dot, it just needs a CR2032 button cell battery.  I've also misplaced the thread protector, but it's not needed with the barrel extension installed.

I have met some really good, honest people in my buying, selling, and trading. that is up until a couple months ago. I sell once fired brass among other odds and ends. I met this guy through armslist and conducted 2 transactions for brass without incident. so on the third deal he told me that he would pay me through paypal in a day or 2 when he received payment for some ammo he was reloading to sell on Gunbroker. normally I would not have done it, but he had gained my trust and I figured it would be fine. for the past 2 months I have tirelessly tried to get him to settle this debt. now he will not even answer my calls or texts. he owes me $360 cash. I even offered to let him trade me something. I got excuses at first, then no more communication. his name is KYLE UNDERHILL. he is from Greensboro , nc. do not trust this man. I need that money to buy more brass to resell. didn't want to have to go this route but hes left me with no choice. if you know him please tell him to settle his debts. $360 is a lot of money to me. I don't want anyone else to get taken advantage of like me. we don't need people like KYLE UNDERHILL doing business on armslist. Kyle, if you read this, PAY ME MY MONEY. any input from you guys would be appreciated. armslist has been contacted. thanks for reading this.  here is a link to all his adds. do not buy from this man. he does not pay his debts!!!  http://www.armslist.com/classifieds/search?relatedto=1910667"

I’m selling/trading this as a package, the Rifle, the scope, the rifle bag, and 370 rounds of ammo. This rifle is basically brand new. Less than 50 rounds through it. Only shot it twice, once to sight it in, and once for fun, and that’s the reason I’m selling it, I’ve had it for over 2 years and hardly ever get to a range where I can shoot it. The range I go to now because it’s close and convenient doesn’t allow anything over .223/5.56. This rifle is in perfect condition. Thank you for your interest."

This is a 1965 Ford Mustang coupe. The body of the Mustang is in good condition. No major dings or and no rust. The Paint looks good from a distance but if you look closely, it needs to be done again. The Tires are Brand new and the Rims are II Crave Alloys (worth over S1000). It has power (Stainless Steel Brake Corporation) brakes and Front Disc conversion (over $1500). The Transmission, Automatic (C4) was rebuilt less than 5, 000 miles ago. The interior is nice, Not excellent but in very good condition. No rips on the seats, not really faded and pretty clean over all. Now to the serious part....

This car was originally a 6 cylinder and I bought a motor from a 94 Ford mustang (5.0 ) and had a mechanic rebuild it here in Town. We were planning on going fuel injection, instead of carburator, so the motor is set up for that application. (However if you decide to go carb, its an easy switch). The motor was rebuilt ( so you get an awesome 302 motor!) but unfortunately the shop went out of business before the installation was complete. So right now... the motor is in the car... You can finish the installation either carb or fuel injection.

This car will be amazing with that motor. It will cost close to 2500 to complete the project and to be honest, I don't have the money to invest into that project.

DO NOT try to Low Ball me. I know what this car is worth and I know that once the installation is finished and it's all done this car will sell EASILY for 11 or 12 thousd. (if you go fuel injection, it will sell for ALOT more :)

Please contact me IF you plan on coming to see the car and IF you have the money. Will consider trade for a nice truck, montero, concrete slab/ brick work. 
Will trade for Ar 15, .308 Socom 2, or any awesome gun to add to my collection. Pink slip in hand. Let's do this! Im looking for 3000 cash plus 3000 in trade value.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge.

The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. 
The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). 
The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Gun #1: Walther PK380, MSRP $390-490, asking $360 cash
Cartridge: .380 Automatic Colt Pistol (ACP)
Finish: Blued
Stock Color: Synthetic Black
Barrel Length: 3.66""
Round Capacity: 8 + 1
Hand: Ambidextrous
Gun Weight: 19.4 oz. (empty)
History: I purchased the gun new a few years ago, and took it to the range a few times <500 rds through it.
Comes with original box and packaging, some ammo. Email if interested.
The PK380 is not just good looking. It is small and good looking. That makes the PK380 excellent for concealed carry. Its small grip is ideal for shooters with small hands. The slide is easy to operate, making it a good choice for women. The light weight goes unnoticed in a pocket or purse. Small and effective.

Gun #2: Walther P22, MSRP $380-540, asking $360
Cartridge: .22 Long Rifle (.22LR)
Finish: Blued
Stock Color: Synthetic Black
Barrel Length: 3.42""
Round Capacity: 10 + 1
Hand: Ambidextrous
Gun Weight: 17.6 oz. (empty)
History: I purchased the gun two years ago and never made it to the range. Never fired.
Comes with original box and packaging, +aftermarket thread adapter, and some ammo. Email if interested.
The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns, and an explosion of imitators. The P22 is lightweight, with a low proflie, for easy concealment."

This is a solid gun folks! It is stamped not milled, but it is still not a cheap one. Everything shoots flawlessly. All gear fits nice and snug and looks badass! None of it was cheap, if you know your guns look it up, add the prices for yourself. This rifle also has the recoil buffer installed, between that and the anti-shock stock you would think your shooting an AR, but all the punch of the 7.62. Never jammed never misfired never disappointed! This is a superior customized weapon compared to the other AK's on this site."

This is a new H&K 45C that only has 1 magazine through it (8 rounds) through it to ensure initial reliability when i purchased it 4 months ago. Comes with everything that you would expect when buying it new from H&K also has the H&K factory Luminova charge night sights. Im asking $950 obo cash offer, Not in a hurry to sale so please refrain from ridiculous offers as they will not get a response. Honestly just looking to sell so that my wife doesn't kick me out but will possibly entertain a high end handgun trade or trade plus cash. Thank you for taking the time to look at my listing."
