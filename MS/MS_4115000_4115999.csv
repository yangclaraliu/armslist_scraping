New extractor has been polished, but is missing the thin loaded chamber indicator that sits on top of it. This does not effect the function of the pistol. Taurus has this part on back-order.

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

NOTE: I have six test shot plates if interested to use them for target practice I am selling them for $20.00 Each let me know if you want them thanks."

I have installed the Kineti tech barrel shroud, and the Chaos titan quad rail system. This gun comes with all of the above and more:
1 plastic hard case
Factory cleaning kit
2 Magazines (1-5 round and 1-8 round)
A cheapo red dot sight that seems to move out of position when the gun is fired, so useless on this gun, but maybe you can use it somewhere else?
Cleaning rod
Factory thread protector ring for the barrel
Vertical grip (not shown) you can adjust the position and length

If you look on gunbroker or other sites, you will see incredible mark up on prices for a converted Saiga 12. Im not here to rip anyone off, I just want the money i invested into the gun back. I am looking to make a large purchase soon, and wish I didnt need to sell this off to help with that purchase, but that is where this becomes your gain. 


I will require that you have all proper documentation (IE Drivers license and FOID card). I will need to follow the law, and run your FOID through the state police website and verify status. Once that simple task is done, you can buy this gun.
Happy shooting!"

***** New Model WITHOUT the Thumb Safety *****

NIB SCCY CPX-2 (CB model which has a black slide and black frame as shown in photos).  It has only 21 rounds fired to check function (flawless). Never carried, no wear marks or scratches. 

I bought two of these guns this week (03/02/15)...this one which is all black and another one which has a Flat Dark Earth frame.  I couldn’t decide which I liked better at the time so I bought both.  I’ve finally decided to keep the FDE one so this one is up for sale.  I haven’t even registered this gun yet so you can be the first to register it.

The CPX-2 is an elegant but robust gun with a “no questions asked” lifetime warranty from SCCY which follows the gun, not just the original owner. 

The still-sealed test fire envelope with matching serial number is dated 01/26/2015 so you can be sure this is a brand new gun.

The CPX-2 has a small profile that makes it excellent for concealed carry.  It comes in the original factory box with everything else from the factory: all paperwork, two 10-round mags with pinkie extension baseplates installed plus two extra flat baseplates, test fire envelope, and childproof lock w/two keys. 

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TN driver’s license or permit.

If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.  Price is firm; cash only please.  I’m not really looking for a trade and definitely not low-ball offers.  Thanks!

Made in the popular 5.45x39.5 caliber. The brainchild of two of the best gun makers in the world, the SGL31 rifle is manufactured at the world-famous Izhmash Factory in Russia then imported and remanufactured by Atsenal, Las Vegas, NV into its final configuration. 

The absolute reliability and authenticity make the SGL31 the ONLY CHOICE for collectors, perfectionists, and AK enthusiasts alike. All authentic components, made according to the original technology, and detailed attention, which went into the manufacturing, make the SGL31 THE rifle you will be proud to own and show off to your friends at the shooting range. The ONLY truly configured AK-74 currently available in the US market that uses brand new Hammer Forged and Chrome Line barrel, the SGL31 offers the safety and reliability that you expect from your rifle, making it the highest quality AK-74 available on the market. 

I have put 200 rounds through this rifle so it is in great condition. It features a rifle dynamics M-4 stock adapter and magpul CTR stock, and a set of upgraded tritium night sights. I have a set of wood furniture to go along with the rifle as well. I am selling/trading the rifle by itself or as a package with 1100 rounds of 7N6 ammo and Bulgarian circle 10 magazines. 

This rifle unfortunately isn't being imported anymore, and the true Arsenal stamped SGL series are very rare to find.

The $1500 price tag does not include the mags and ammo. Those are available at extra charge."

I don't need it now and I'm not looking to make money on it but I'm not looking to lose any either or to waste my time as I can just go shoot it. 

You can offer me cash if more than what I paid and you buy all of it, but prefer to trade for gun. It's gotta be worth my time as this stuff is obviously getting harder to find and just gonna go up in price

My email and text number are below.

Must meet publically in or very near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

Looking for a Gen 4 Glock 19, maybe a 23 or small possibility 17, 21 or 34. Or gen 3 19/23 prefer FDE    Plus some cash or possibly factory target ammo if you want all 1000rds

I can get new stock gen 4's for $525 or under and gen 3's for $475 or less. If it's been shot it's used and those are $400-475 if stock. So please don't wast our time if you want BPS or Gander prices. Can add some value for upgraded internals and nt sts or tactical light with laser

Also would consider an M92 ak pistol or quality AK 47 rifle new or like new plus ammo if stock. Not interested in adding cash here 

Possibly a Sig P226 in 9mm Navy or higher end new or like new straight up

Possibly a quality 1911 new or like new straight up.  No Taurus or RIA or lower brands.  Prefer Kimber, Sig, Remy, Smith or better. Don't really need one so can't add cash


If any other tactical larger caliber rifle or other pistols, they would really have to be worth my while. Thanks

 Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

I would only add cash, ammo or possibly a gun for the right AR in .308. Might consider a Full Spikes 5.56 if quality rail and flip up sights or Spikes AR pistol w/ 10.5"" barrel or similar quality brand factory built.  I would definitely  consider a .308 Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, LMT, PWS, Ruger, Windham, Core, etc or similar price ranges $800-$1600 .Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built. Must be new or like new.  I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.   Other quality factory built ar's in 5.56 would have to be straight up or real close and rather find a nice 10.5"" ar pistol 

Also possibly interested in new or like new Zastava AK M92 pistol...(I can buy new one stock for $450 or less) ..

With its lightweight 22 oz. polymer frame, thin profile, and ramped 3.2 inch barrel, the newly designed Millennium G2 is the ideal concealed carry handgun. The Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment. Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
	Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

Both of these types of ammo seem to be very similar if not the exact same loading just marketed differently.  They shoot very similarly and the only difference I have found between them is the head stamping and the color of the primer sealant (the Ranger primer sealant is blue, while the non-Ranger primer sealant is red).  I originally bought a case of the Ranger ammo because that is what I was using in my defensive pistol.  I could find the non-Ranger ammo locally for a while so I started buying it as well.  I have since sold all my .40 pistols, so I no longer have a need for this ammo.  Feel free to make trade offers.  Ialso have 5 .40 S&W glock mags for sale, listed under magazines.  Thanks"

Micro H-1 - Same frame, diode and finish as the T-1, these were developed as an economical choice for those who don't need, or desire the lowest settings needed for night vision equipment, or the extra waterproofing to dive down past 15ft (H-1's are still waterproof). They marry to our mounts just the same as well.

H-1's are small enough to be used anywhere that you could put iron sights, these sights can be used on any type of firearm or archery equipment. A lightweight rifle with an Micro H-1 mounted on it remains a lightweight rifle! A hunting revolver with an Micro H-1 installed remains as easy to carry as with iron sights and is much quicker to aim. On a bow, the parallax-free Micro H-1 eliminates the need for a peep, allowing you to shoot accurately in lower light

I'm finding that the market for plain Kydex holsters is taking up most of my time at the moment and I really enjoy the craft and end product. That said, these Hybrid's are of excellent quality. The leather is thick and sturdy but breaks in extremely comfortably. The Kydex is a stout .080 thickness and the clips and fasteners are all made from steel. Aside from the quality....they look great and @ $35.00 a piece you're getting more value than what you're paying for. At the moment I've got 2 of them in stock for an M&P south paw.

The top of the slide was milled by ATEi to aid in single-hand manipulations.
The rear sight is made by 10-8 Performance. Front sight is stock, but I painted dot orange because I didn't care for the factory white.
21st Century Gunfighter Catalyst extended magazine release.
Comes with 4 magazines (2 8-round magazines that came with the pistol, and 2 10-round magazines I purchased separately).
Just installed the most recent generation of slide stop lever. This newest generation has a dimple machined into it that has fixed the mushy reset that has commonly been associated with M&P's. It now has a very audible and tactile reset. Other than that, the trigger is factory. I did, however, polish all of the engagement surfaces for smoother pull.
