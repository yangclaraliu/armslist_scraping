Dealers, Law Enforcment, and Collectors may take any number of virtually identical specimens we have on hand at the same per-gun price, and with no additional shipping charges. Few of us will ever own a blued steel Smith & Wesson model 36 Chief’s Special of any description, now discontinued since 2006. The Taurus model 85 represents Taurus's leadership, and others' following, to use technological advances in steel work and investment casting to bring the Chief's Special class of revolvers to a state of withstanding .38 Special +P proof loads. Smith & Wesson itself lagged for almost 10 years before following suit, and that only under pressure from its Brazilian offspring. This is the steel frame blued finish Model 85 Snub. Manufacturer is Forjas Taurus of Porto Alegre Brazil, and Importer and warrantor is Taurus International of Miami. Construction is entirely steel except for the grips. Finish is bright blue lateral surface, with matte verticals atop the barrel and frame for reduced sighting glare. Barrel is 2 inch full lug with integral .132 serrated ramp front sight. Rear sight is frame integral fixed notch. Hammer is MIM type .325 short serrated spur, case colored finish with matching .300 smooth faced combat trigger. Cylinder capacity is 5 rounds of .38 Smith & Wesson Special caliber ammunition, including +P loads, like the Remington Golden Saber in some of our photos. Ammunition is NOT included. Ignition is flat faced hammer against floating firing pin. The Taurus 85 has a transfer bar internal safety device, as well as Taurus’s innovative hammer lock that is not conspicuous like the ancestor company’s. Weight empty is 21 ounces, with center of gravity at the cylinder stop. To increase its similarity to the classic model 37, we have fitted this revolver with a set of 1970s production Sile Italian Walnut Combat Grips. Some of us call them Banana type. The grips will not accommodate a speed loader. This revolver and its mates are what we call Factory Demos, Taurus’s showgirls that served on display with the company’s sales reps at trade shows like the annual SHOT show in Las Vegas. All of them are in their original issue factory box with two keys for its internal lock, instruction manual and protective packaging. Surface detractions are minimal to negligible, only occasional faint edge and cylinder face whitening, but really no more cylinder rotation marking than brand new specimens one might see on display in a gun store. Note that its box is labeled, Factory Reconditioned. This simply means, as the label states, Taurus will repair it if it has problems, but they will not perform a free refinish. It does not need refinishing anyway, as we have noted. These revolvers are fresh production, manufactured in 2013. Pricing on a bright blue Smith & Wesson model 36 often approaches $1000, and it was not rated for +P ammunition. We’re offering the 85 Blue Steel Snub in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates,  for only           $ 249.00   Not transferable to civilian Not transferable to civilian residents of California or Massachusetts.      Shipping:$15 lower 48; $40 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority, insured with Delivery Confirmation.

Dealers, collectors, and law enforcement, however, may take any number of virtually identical 85 Ultra Lites we have on hand for the same price and with no additional shipping charges. In the mid 1980s, after years of following their Smith & Wesson Chief’s Special ancestors, Taurus began taking a leadership role. This Taurus model 85 Ultra-Lite represents Taurus's leadership, and others' following, to use technological advances in steel work and investment casting to bring the Chief's Special class of revolvers to a state of withstanding .38 Special +P proof loads. Smith & Wesson itself lagged for almost 10 years before following suit, and that only under pressure from its Brazilian offspring. This is the lightweight, stainless and alloy frame Model 85 Ultra Lite. Manufacturer is Forjas Taurus of Porto Alegre Brazil, and Importer is Taurus International of Miami. Construction is lightweight alloy frame with a coated satin finish, with stainless steel barrel, cylinder, thumb latch, trigger, hammer, and internal parts. Steel parts finish is satin stainless. Barrel is 2 inch full lug with integral .132 serrated ramp front sight. Rear sight is frame integral fixed notch. Hammer is MIM type .325 short serrated spur, satin finish with matching .300 smooth faced combat trigger. Cylinder capacity is 5 rounds of .38 Smith & Wesson Special caliber ammunition, including +P loads, like the Remington Golden Saber in some of our photos. Ammunition is NOT included. Ignition is flat faced hammer against floating firing pin. The Taurus 85 has a transfer bar internal safety device, as well as Taurus’s innovative hammer lock that is not conspicuous like the ancestor company’s. Weight empty is 17 1/2 ounces, with center of gravity at the trigger. Grips are factory combat finger groove boot type, pliable recoil absorbent rubber textured surfaces, and they do not exceed the length of the grip frame. This revolver is what we call a Factory Demo, one of Taurus’s showgirls that served on display with the company’s sales reps at trade shows like the annual SHOT show in Las Vegas. Surface detractions are minimal to negligible, only occasional faint edge and cylinder face buffing, but really no more cylinder rotation marking than brand new specimens one might see on display in a gun store. Note that its box is labeled, Factory Reconditioned. This simply means, as the label states, Taurus will repair it if it has problems, but they will not perform a free refinish. It does not need refinishing anyway, as we have noted. From its serial number prefix, it was manufactured in 2013. It is in its original, factory issue box with two keys for its internal lock and instruction manual. Label constitutes the warranty statement. Taurus service, the few times we’ve used it in the past four decades, has always been excellent. Pricing on a Smith & Wesson model 637 often approaches $600, and the 637 does not have a full lug barrel.

Armscor of the Philippines launched its business the same year that we did, 1952; but it was a little over a decade before we began carrying their products. Since the earliest Armscor .22 rifles, to their long produced .22 Magnum ammo marketed by Fiocchi, we have had positive experience with Armscor products, and that is especially true with their Rock Island Armory series of Government 1911 style pistols, good as anybody's .45. Here is Armscor's offering in .38 Special. We have noted for many years the similarity of Rossi Revolvers to Colt lines, and the Armscor 206 is even closer. Hammer, cylinder release latch, and ejector mechanisms are very close to the Colt D Frame revolvers. This is no Colt, of course; it is a much less expensive revolver, but a well made one, all steel with no pot metal whatsoever. Surfaces are roughly finished but durable matte blue military style finish, much like the Colt Commandos of World War II. This revolver, like its progenitor, is double and single action with a Ruger-type flat transfer bar internal safety mechanism that enables engagement of the firing pin only when the trigger is pulled all the way. Lateral play to the cylinder is no more than 2mm total movement, but these revolvers time much better than Colts; the cylinder locks into place well before the hammer falls. Barrel is 2 inch steel, ramp front sight with fixed notch rear sights. Grips are cut checkered, round butt magna type Filipino Hardwood. Weight empty is 24 ounces. These revolvers come heavily greased from the factory; we have de-greased and oiled the ones we sell, and that's a good $20.00 job. Own one of these good, solid Filipino Colt Copies, the Armsor Model 206 in .38 Special, 2 inch Matte Blue Steel         for only           $ 239.00.                     Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts.

www.thunderbeastarms.com   for the complete specs.


The model 223A is our full-auto suppressor for 5.56 mm NATO assault rifles. It is designed for extreme durability and high heat loads from full-auto and burst firing schedules. The 223A is ideal for short-barrelled rifle (""SBR"") format fighting carbines and M4/M16 pattern rifles, as well as AR-15's that will be used with a high rate of fire. 

The 223A was developed specifically for the 7.5-inch Sabre Defence Industries Stealth SBR. 

The 223A is made of 316 stainless steel and inconel and features a full-welded baffle core for durability. It has a length of 6.8 inches, 0.4 less than the 223P, to keep over-all length of the carbine relatively short. Muzzle blast concussion is eliminated and the recoil impulse is reduced and smoothed over time. The 223A improves the accuracy of most rifles. It is sealed and requires no maintenance. 

The 223A is ideal for fighting carbines including full-auto applications.

Here is an excellent tribute to the time honored Remington 870 Police, and it has more accessories with it than any stock 870P. This is the Hawk 12 gauge shotgun, with a squared-off, Browning-looking receiver imported by H&R 1871, New England Firearms. We have had excellent service experience with the Hawk 12 gauge imported by other companies, but we know from years of experience that New England Firearms Service is second to none, on the rare occasion that it is needed. This New-England Hawk Import is slicker finished than its Interstate Arms siblings, and it has the standard Police Cylinder 18 1/2 inch barrel. We have outfitted it with an extra AT, Advanced Technologies, cruiser pistol grip, and with a polymer heat shield. This listing, then, is for a combo since it has both buttstocks and the shield. Note that its barrel lug is 3 inches forward toward the muzzle than a comparable 870 Remington, hence the different specs from standard 870s: chambering is for both 2 3/4 inch and 3 inch shells, capacity is 5 + 1 for 2 3/4 inchers, equal to the standard Mossberg 500 capacity. Weight empty is a well balanced, comfortable shooting 7 pounds, and it comes with weather-resistant black synthetic stock and forend. Length of pull with buttstock installed is 38 1/2 inches with a standard length of pull from the face of the smooth faced combat trigger to the end of the 1 inch pad on the buttstock; and overall length including pistol grip installed as shown is 29 inches.

Serial is BSCXXXX. This gun is from the early 90s before the M640 was beefed up to chamber in 357 mag. The newer 640 revolvers are great, but they definitely carry like a bigger gun, unlike the older 640, which keeps the airweight dimensions.

As you can see from the photos, in excellent condition, low round count, and meticulously well taken care of. Trigger pull is exceptionally smooth, timing is exact, lock up is tight. Comes with original box and papers.

Asking $600 cash FTF in Birmingham, AL. 

A beautiful wheelgun with a bit of something for everyone. 

If you are looking for a CCW, it is light enough to carry, but heavy enough to shoot comfortably, so you can practice as much as you want in a range trip. Indeed, if you already have a 642/442, many carry the airweight, but practice with the 640, which is the exact same size. 

For collectors, this is a very desirable prelock J-frame with original box and papers. Would be great for showing off to your friends, both at home and at the range. For investors, these will undoubtedly continue to increase in value (as are all prelock S&W revolvers that are no longer made) due to finite supply and continued demand for classic no-nonsense wheelguns.

Bottom line: Don't miss this opportunity to pick one up as these are becoming increasingly hard-to-find!

I live in Birmingham, but travel to Huntsville and Mobile regularly. I can provide proof (e.g. pistol permit) that I am a good guy and as many references as you need from recent firearms transactions. Deal with confidence. I won't waste your time, please don't waste mine.

Thanks for looking!

Happy to answer any questions, share more photos, arrange a face-to-face inspection, etc."

Ground mount AND wall mount features make this the #1 ALARM MINE AVAILABLE ANYWHERE. Each alarm package comes with an instruction manual and warning sign. (Spanish upon request)

Sentry Alarm Mines by No.26 Forge are SAFE and AFFORDABLE TO USE! They work similar to concrete nail guns but WILL NOT AND CANNOT FIRE LIVE AMMUNITION. The Sentry Alarm Mine works with the same .22 Cal blanks that you would use in a Ramset nail gun and are available at any hardware store or Home Depot. 

12 lb. to 15 lb. mono-filament fishing line is recommended since it will trip the alarm and break off at the knot with increased tension. A cotter pin through the trip eyelet or a binder clip works great as well.

After I called him out on the scam, you can see his response...

Be careful out there people... This would be an easy one to get screwed on!  This is why it is soooo important to use a company like paypal for these types of purchases, even though it is a pain in the butt.

I wasn't able to post the first page of my texts because of the five pic limit, but I basically asked if his Beretta SP V was still for sale, he said it was and that it was $1500.  I asked why it was $1500 when his add had it listed at $1950 on armslist.  He said he thought I was talking about a Beretta 686 he had listed as well, not the 687 I was really inquiring about...  Then the texts start from there...


***UPDATE***

I received several emails from people stating that they think that I was possibly wrong in my judgement of this being a scam.  I wanted to attach one of my responses.  I probably didnt go into enough detail above...


Thanks for the email.  I might not have explained it clearly in the post.  I called the guy and it was clearly a scam.  He couldn't understand english and kept asking me to repeat myself.  An established business such as the one he was possing to run would hire a competent employee if it wanted to sell its product.  He wouldn't meet face to face with me, he was just using the information as a cover hoping that I would buy.  The store he used as a front appears to be a real store, but has a different phone number, and a seperate website.  When I called him out on it being a scam, he told me to mind my own business, and asked why I needed a gun in the first place, am I a robber?  I also googled ""Beretta 687 Silver Pigeon V 12 Bore/gauge Shotgun"" in google images, and found where he stole the pictures from.  The exact same gun (you can tell by the wood grain of the stock, as well as the sales tag and background of the image) is for sale on some auction site half way around the globe in Surrey (a British county).

BUFFALO-BARNES 41 MAG. LEAD FREE - 180 gr. Barnes XPB (1,550 fps) - 20 Round Box












This is a full power plus 41 Mag. load. It is safe to fire in all 41 Mag. chambered firearms and has short enough over-all-length to fit even very short cylindered revolvers such as the Taurus. We are not able to use a flash suppressed propellant for this load, so you’ll notice a large muzzle flash when fired from barrels under 7 or 8 inches in length.

This load is designed primarily for hunting animals the size of deer and medium sized black bear. Additionally, it would make a wicked defense load against humans.

As always, Buffalo Bore refuses to follow the industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels to establish our published velocities. Our advertised velocities are generated from real world firearms so our customers can see what type of results they will get in the real world, where it matters.

The only one that exists for SEF lowers. By adding this unit you either maintain your US parts count or increase it by one. These lowers are also clipped and pinned. Real clipped HK pins would fall out of the holes. These end pins are machined bar stock to mimic the HK pin ends but will not push through and are seated in the lower pin hole. The rear tang can be shortened so these will work on G3/91, 33/93, and MP5 weapons. These will not fit the ""K"" series. EDIT: These will also fit CETME's if you switch to an HK style FCG. NOTICE. Original steel lowers are designed internally to fit a 23mm FCG box. If your semi receiver-shelf is wider than .906 inches NO STEEL lower will fit it. As all clones are built differently, you may need some minor fitting to fit this on yours. These were designed to, and fit, the HK91’s that I use for measurements.

Sentry Alarm Mines by No.26 Forge are SAFE and AFFORDABLE TO USE! They work similar to concrete nail guns but WILL NOT AND CANNOT FIRE LIVE AMMUNITION. The Sentry Alarm Mine works with the same .22 Cal blanks that you would use in a Ramset nail gun and are available at any hardware store or Home Depot. 

12 lb. to 15 lb. mono-filament fishing line is recommended since it will trip the alarm and break off at the knot with increased tension. A cotter pin through the trip eyelet or a binder clip works great as well.

I bought the gun brand new about a month ago and it's seen about 40-50rds through it.  It's shot flawlessly and is accurate, but really I just don't need it.  It's American made, it's a 70 series, Novak sights and other good features, Ruger really did their homework on this model, it's their newest 1911 offering.  Makes for a GREAT carry 1911.

It comes with the standard stuff from the factory (gun + two 7rd mags + box + zip bag) and also comes with two CMC (Chip McCormick) 8rd Power Mags, both of which work flawlessly.  It also comes with a Don Hum H721OT OWB holster (brown) for carry use.  

The gun is in tip top shape, no idiot mark, no scuffing and no abuse plus I keep my guns clean, so it's not filthy dirty.  I've owned quite a few 1911's and this one is as just as nice (if not nicer) than any Kimber or Springfield I've ever had, it really is a very nice 1911 for the money.

The gun has an MSRP of $899, and the two CMC mags are worth $50 and so is the holster.

Asking $700 cash OBO.  I live around Danville and prefer to keep it close but will meet up as long as the distance is reasonable.  Not really looking to trade but might for a like new Gen4 Glock 19 (FDE or black) + cash.  Thanks for looking.

These were manufactured during the infamous period that began in 1994 and ended in 2004, when 13 shot magazines could not be sold on the civilian market. Since Lorcin was literally gunning for overseas markets, these had to be marked Export Only. That is a moot issue since 2004 in most jurisdictions of the United States. These magazines will only work in a Lorcin model L9 pistol that accepts double stacked magazines. They will not work in an L9C Compact; Will Not work in a Hi-Point; Will Not work on a John Deere 47H Manure Spreader. They will only work on a Lorcin Industries model L9 pistol. Lorcin, of course, is long gone out of business, so when these are gone, there won’t be any more. These magazines have been stored for several years. They have never been loaded or issued; they do, however, show contact wear on their edges from being stored in bulk. We found them in an old Atlantic Warehouse. Our single magazine price is $29 per. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $23.00 each. Own 3 for only $ 69.00. Not for sale to civilian residents of California, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, or any other jurisdiction where 13 round magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement only. Shipping.Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

All of the accuracy, reliability, and craftsmanship of the HK G3 platform coupled with the practicality and affordability of the 7.62x39 cartridge--and it takes AK mags!. The rifle has been expertly maintained and only lightly used. With its heavy match barrel the PTR-32 will embarrass all but the highest quality long barrel, milled receiver AKs in the accuracy department. With its excellent PWS muzzle brake recoil is reduced much more significantly as well, allowing for rapid follow up shots. The stock is a surplus G3 model that will either clean up nicely or can be switched out with ease for a retractable one. In addition the receiver has been professionally cut to accept high capacity drum magazines.

Photo shows brand new factory magazines for the Browning Double Mode 9mm Pistol, the BDM. The pistol was similar to the venerable Hi-Power, but the magazines did not interchange. These magazines are what we call take-outs; that is, they were taken out of new pistol boxes when a certain onerous Federal Law sunset in 2004. Manufacturer was Mec-Gar as principal supplier to Browning Arms. These are factory Browning magazines. Construction is all steel body and springs with a slick bright blue finish. Cartridge follower and floorplate or tail piece are polymer. Each magazine holds 10 rounds of 9mm ammunition: 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, 9mm Luger, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Marking, as the photos show, is Browning BDM / 9mm Luger / 10 Rd Cpcty / Made in USA. This magazine is for the full size BDM pistol.

This listing is for THREE magazines; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. We only trust One name in aftermarket magazines: Mec-Gar. Mec-Gar manufactures the factory magazines for many brands, including Browning, Beretta, Rock Island, and Kel-Tec. Here are representatives of the Mec-Gar 10 round magazine for the venerable Browning Hi-Power pistol, originally made for a compact variant of the BDM pistol, but one with the same grip frame length as the Hi-Power. Surviving BDMs have longer grip frames than the Hi-Power, so these won’t work in those, but they work just fine in any true Hi-Power or clone thereof. These magazines came to us in their plastic wrappers, but no display boxes. These are late 1990s production for FN in Belgium and Browning in the United States. These magazines have never been loaded, fired, or inserted into a firearm. Photos show their original shipping cartons where they shipped from Gardone Italy to Herstal Belgium. Note the distinctive magazine release cut in the bodies, so constructed for the experimental BDMs that never went into production. This doesn’t affect their performance at all in either Hi-Powers and FEG 9HP Pistols, the good quality Hungarian Clones, and they work just fine. The FEG 9HP shown in the photos is not included, and we are not advertising it for sale in this listing. These magazines are legal for civilian ownership in all jurisdictions of the United States except New York City itself. Mec-Gar magazines, write the factory technicians, are constructed from certified carbon steel and feature a heat treated housing and a hi-impact polymer or certified carbon steel follower and extended floorplate assembly that limits capacity to ten rounds of 9mm ammunition. Some of them are marked only with the caliber on the body face, Caliber 9x19mm; and some have the words Made in Italy stamped on them. All these are part of a special buy we made, and we have substantial quantities of these magazines on hand at press time. Buyers will receive from the same lot as the photo specimens. Note the Mec-Gar sealing tape on the cartons. These fine magazines are civilian legal for all jurisdictions except New York City itself, where the limit is five rounds. Normal retail pricing on any Mec-Gar magazine is upwards of $40 apiece; and if one has the Browning Deer Head logo on it, make that upwards of $50. We’re offering in lots of 3 or more, however, at $19 per. Own 3 for only $57.00. Onesy twosy price is $22 per. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into New York City, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

I have a beautiful M&P 9C I purchased from the gun store literally 4 weeks ago. And as usual I went all out on buying extras. I love this gun. But im thinking I might love a 1911 more. And if you notice as I did, for weeks I waited for a used one to pop up on armslist but it never happened. I'm told that they are very nice guys. People buy them and don't get rid of them.  So I put more moneys together and just went to the store.

1 M&P 9C  compact with the 2 factory 12 round mags, 3  factory hand grips and everything that comes with it from the store. $550
I bought another 12 round mag right away. $25
I bought 2 more finger extension bottom plates. $30
I ordered online a full size 17 round mag and a xgrip extension for the full size gun feeling. Best of both worlds. $50

Dimensional specifications in the Gun Control Act of 1968 stopped importation of the well known Baby Browning pistol, manufactured in Belgium by Fabrique Nationale, into the United States. Then, from the early 1970s until the late 1980s a Michigan Company known as Bauer and then as Fraser Arms manufactured a respectable stainless clone of the Baby Browning. Bauer and Fraser titled their clones as the 25SSP, with Pearl Grips, or the 25SSW, with Walnut. Magazine manufacturer Mec-Gar produced sparing amounts of slick made Italian Magazines for the Babys and Bauers for several years, and they still claim to produce them. We have not seen any shipped, however, for 4 years now, and we suspect that Mec-Gar’s tooling may be in need of maintenance. Here, then, in these photos, is the only game in town for replacement magazines for these good little pistols. Manufacturer is Triple K of California. Construction is entirely blue steel, from the bottom of the floorplate to the top of the cartridge follower. We took the liberty to fit these magazines to a Bauer 25SSP that we had on hand, it took some polishing at the back of the magazine’s lips. This magazine will fit an FN Baby Browning, a Bauer 25ss, or a Fraser Arms 25 automatic. It will not fit any other firearm. Magazines like these are pretty hard to come by. We’re offering them each for only $ 29.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City.
