The only sign of wear is that you can kinda see where the rings were a little bit (only by a slight shade difference, no scratches or anything like that). The scope lens and overall scope looks like new. Only reason I am selling is because I am upgrading to a different scope. 

Here is a link to the scope on the Leupold website in case you want to look it up.

Or throw in an X-Tension™ magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 16+1 rounds of 9mm (12+1 of .40SW.) You’ll find everything on the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD®.

If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for an XD® 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range."

I got these in a trade, however I have too many projects right now and not enough time. I would like to pass them along to someone who would enjoy them more than I do. 

These kits are nicer kits than most, as they were not hacked apart when they were demilled. They demilled pretty meticulously as you can see in the pictures.

From what I've read online, the magazines are relatively universal and can function with some uzi variants, M11s, Olympic 9mm Ar-15's, etc. Some of the magazines are serialized, others are not. I've seen these mags sell for roughly $20-$25 a pop.

Been debating on saling/trading my Remington 700 sps (chambered in the big bad .308) rifle for quite some time now. And have finally decided to move on to the next thing. I bought this rifle from a ex marine (sniper) that built this rifle to mimic his service weapon to shoot around with. This weapons has a nice scope and bipod as well as some ammo/sling to go along with it. 

Only thing im considering trade to would be: 
bolt action rifle (in .223), ar style rifle, possible to consider a ak, or high end pistols. May consider 2 for 1, or cash + gun for me, possibly can throw cash + my gun & extras for whatever you have. 

Sale price with scope, bipod, ammo & sling would be $800 obo (jus the rifle is $775).

This rifle has only been to the range once to be sited in and was only out on one hunting trip after that. This rifle right out of the box was incredible. I paired the rifle with a Leupold VX-II 3-9x40.

I absolutely love this rifle but can't get out with it like I would like to. The recoil reduction is extremely helpful and the composite stock with ""limb saver"" butt makes shooting incredibly easy. It is easy to carry. Will come with case and strap. 

I hate to be posting this rifle as I have quit a bit of money invested into it but just can't use it anymore. Please feel free to contact me via email with any questions.

I do not need help selling this rifle. Those who inquire should know that this is an extremely desirable rifle and it is in flawless condition.

Please put Browning in the subject line of the email and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

Hey all,
I decided to change up my 45 load. So, to keep things simple I'm selling off all my other factory ammo. I priced these at lower than what I saw in stores. I would cut a little better of a deal if you buy all or large lots. This is all brass cased factory ammo (no reloads). May consider trades for certain reloading powders, primers, projectiles, casings, etc. Mostly needing Bullseye powder, Unique powder, H110 powder, Cci 500, 550, 300 primers, 185r 45 projectiles, 458 socom brass, 458 socom TTSX projectiles, 44 magnum brass, etc. Possibly 45 ACP nickel casings and 9mm nickel casings. Would also consider HP 7.62x39, 7.62x25 tokarev, or other loaded ammo trades.. May consider gun trades as well. Just shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet in Norman. 
Here is what I have on hand:

This shotgun uses the same inertia drive recoil operation as Benelli's M1 Super 90, and many parts interchange. The gun is in very good mechanical condition, with a few small dings from bumping against other guns in the safe. The mag tube holds six 2 3/4"" or five 3"" magnum shells and the gun will empty them as fast as the trigger is pulled. This shotgun is fast, reliable, and light. 

I will include the factory stock and the Choate MK5 pistol grip stock pictured, as well as all the stock spacers that came with it from Choate. The charging handle is a Benelli oversized part from GG&G that works much better than the tiny Beretta factory piece. Both charging handles will go with the gun. The thin 1"" wide sling is also included, but I do not have the factory box or paperwork.

Sauer & Sohn company in Suhl, Germany in 1938. It has a 3-digit serial number in the ""a"" letter block which shows that it was one of the very first produced in 1938. It has original WWII German, ALL MATCHING SERIAL NUMBERS! It is in excellent condition with all original finish on both the metal and wood, and has scarce original markings for wartime overhaul by the German Spandau army depot in 1941!! The barrel & stock were both replaced at the depot, and numbered to match. The barrel was made by ""Geco"" and bears their classic logo. The Geco company is one of the biggest small arms / equipment companies in Germany and is still in business today. The barrel shank is correctly ""0.2"" marked indicating that is the 2nd barrel installed on this receiver. The stock was made by the original Mauser Oberndorf factory and bears their wartime code ""byf"" under the heel. The bolt take-down discs in the buttstock were made in-house at Spandau and are ""SUWW 1941 Su29"" marked. The stock is inpsection proofed ""Eagle over Su27"" under the grip and with a smaller ""Su29"" waffenamt on the side of the butt. The bayonet lug & buttplate were both armorers parts and are numbered to match the rifle in the same font. All these markings are textbook correct. This rifle was a US veteran's bringback war trophy and has NO IMPORT MARKINGS or other post-war markings! It has all original finish and has never been refinished! The stock has not been sanded, aggressively cleaned, or laquered and has lovely texture & color. The metal has all-original finish with a light pleasing patina and no rust or pitting. This is a very early German K98 made in 1938 when production numbers were lower and quality control was higher. The attention to detail on these early rifles is amazing with nearly every single part being serialized and waffenamt proofed, from the front sight blade to the action screws. Relatively few of these early rifles have survived in all-matching wartime configuration. The large majority of the earlier K98's went to the Russian front, and were eventually captured by the Russians who tore them apart, refinished, and reassembled them into completely mixed-up rifles. The small percentage that did make it back to the US were often sporterized and modified into custom hunting rifles in the first few decades after the war. These early K98's were extremely popular for this because of their high quality and solid construction. Finding one like this that escaped intact and original is rare indeed!! The bore is excellent and shiny with strong lands, deep grooves, and a tight muzzle. The pictures tell it all...for more pix and probably shipping details contact me here REDACTED"

This has the clearest glass of any scope I have personally owned, and its built like a tank to boot.  I am selling because I am selling the host weapon on which it was paired.  I challenge anyone to find better quality in this price point.

I am also including the Tenebrex lens caps, a 70.00 value.

****************   

New UZI shoppers.  You will see several manufacturers of 9mm UZI carbines, allow me to help you understand the difference.  If I am incorrect, please let me know.

IMI “Israeli Military Industries” UZI is the original manufacturer of UZIs.  These are the collectible UZIs demanding the highest price.  These are also referred to as Action Arms, the company that imported them into the USA.

Vector Arms are built on Group Industries receivers, properly manufactured in the USA.   Group Industries is the only UZI receiver manufacturer to case harden the receivers so they will not wear out. The internal components of Vector UZIs are a blend of USA and Israeli made parts.  All Vector Uzis are hand made; known for reliability & long life.

Norinco Model M320 UZI are an unauthorized Chinese produced copy of the UZI.  The later produced models had the barrel nut welded in place to prevent barrel change.  I am told that they are reliable shooters, but some of the machining is crude.

Century Arms UC-9 are also unauthorized Chinese made ""Uzi-like"" firearm of the lowest quality.  Inferior metal and manufacturing.  Design changes, some parts do not interchange with original UZI parts.  I am told that these are fussy on ammo types.  
Century Arms UC-9 sell new for less, than Vectors and Norincos sell used."

Your gun is used. You know how I know? Because you bought it from the store/another person and then took it home. Its used. It doesnt matter how many rounds you ""didnt"" fire. Its used. It left the store having been purchased.

Try to sell a car you bought new from the dealer for the same price as the dealer. Even IF it had 1 mile on it because you had it towed home, its STILL USED. 

Guy on here talking about 1500 for his A400, get real. Yea, Im not paying tax or fees, but Im also buying a USED gun that you might have fucked up or tinkered with and temporarily fixed or any other number of things you incompetent idiots do. 

Unless you have an FFL and a store front, the weapon is used. I dont know how much I can stress that. Your glock that you ""test fired"" 500 rounds out of is *still* used. 

That hunting rifle you swear you only zeroed in? Thats used too.

""Oh, but what about my sweet AR15 custom build that my buddy made in his basement"" - Still fucking used hero. 

You guys ask insane prices, and then I see it relisted again a few months later as if maybe the market for your used gun had a sudden influx in the last 6 months. No, it didnt. Because you still have a USED GUN.

Get real idiots. Also, stop typing in your model on gunbroker and then asking the *asking* price you see thats the highest. If 1800 for your shit gun was fair, that auction would be under the  ""sold"" listings."

855,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4787855,"For Sale:  1958 Winchester Pre-64 Model 70, 300 H&H Magnum","gerogia, Georgia, United States","$ 1,800","Listed On: Sunday, October 18, 2015",Rifles,Winchester                                                                                ,300 H&H Magnum                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Up for sale is one incredible, all-original, very rare Winchester Pre-64 Model 70 built in late 1958 and chambered for the venerable, accurate, and powerful 300 Holland & Holland (H&H)Magnum. This collector-grade rifle has never been afield and only fired 9 total rounds!!! I bought it in 2007 from the original owner, an older gentlemen from Salida, CO, who purchased the gun locally in late 1958 to hunt elk. Although a longtime 270 fan, he told me he succumbed to the ""Magnum Craze"" that was sweeping the country in the late 50s and early 60s, mounted a vintage Weaver 4X scope on the rifle, sighted it in with 9 rounds, and then put it in the bedroom closet and never hunted with or shot it again. According to the original owner, ""Jesus, the thing just kicked too damned much!"" and he reverted to using his beloved 270. I bought the rifle from him in 2007 to add to my Model 70 collection and, other than to receive a regular cleaning and inspection, I've never taken it out of the safe, shot it, or hunted with it. I'm only selling it because I have several Models 70 in 300 H&H and need the money for another project. So, up got grabs is a minty, all-original Pre-64 Model 70 in the desirable 300 H&H that, in 57 years, has only had nine bullets down the tube and never been afield. Metal is absolutely beautiful, 99%, with the only blemishes being one small rub on the extractor, one on the bolt knob, a minute scratch on the trigger guard, and only the slightest edge wear around the muzzle--all are depicted in the pics below. Rifling, as you might suspect, is sharp and crisp. Original sights, front sight hood,and sling swivels are intact and in wonderful condition. Bolt is serialized to the action. The original stock is uncut and wears the hard plastic butt plate appropriate for a 1958-vintage Model 70. Wood has some beautiful tiger stripe, as you can see in the pictures, and a few closet and safe marks, but no cracks or major imperfections. There's a elongated shallow dent on the right side of the butt; some tiny scratches near the butt plate, a shallow rub on the top of the comb; some slight scratches on both sides near the floor plate; and a tiny dent near the end of the forearm, all of which I've tried to show in the pictures. Checkering is sharp and well defined. Overall, I'd rate the stock at 97%. The period-correct Weaver scope and mounts have been on the rifle since new and the lenses are clear and bright. This rifle, a true safe queen, isn't 100% perfect, but it's as close to perfect as you're going to find for a 57-year-old rifle. In fact, I've been hyper-critical in my attempt to describe every minor flaw, so don't let that scare you--this is one beautiful rifle! It would make a superb addition to a Model 70 collection or serve equally well afield. I've tried to describe the rifle to the best of my ability and have attached the best possible pictures. Please ask if you have any questions or would like more photos. Winning bidder will pay the actual cost to have the rifle shipped insured in a hard case. I am not a licensed FFL holder, but a private citizen so, before bidding, make sure your FFL holder will accept shipment from me. Full payment in the form of a money order and The rifle will be shipped within two business days of the payment and FFL receipt. I do not accept returns, so please ask any questions before bidding. This well-cared-for rifle comes from a pet-free, smoke-free home. By bidding, you certify you live in a locale where it's lawful to receive and own this rifle. Again, ask any questions. Pre-64 Models 70 like this one don't pop up everyday, so don't let this opportunity to own a rare Rifleman's Rifle in 300 H&H Magnum slip away. I bought this rifle for $1800 in 2007 and that's exactly where I'm starting this auction--the market will determine the final sales amount. Bid often and early to make this quality, collectible Model 70 yours. I wish you good luck, happy bidding, and straight shooting.
The barrel on this rifle measures 25 1/4"" from muzzle to action, but Winchester advertised them as 26"" on the 300 H&H. The barrel is regular Winchester Proof steel, not stainless steel, and the bluing is dark blue, not the mat finish you'd find on a stainless barrel, for example, like the ones that commonly were fitted to 264 Win Mag Westerner rifles."

This is a Enfield No.5 Santa Fe ""Jungle Carbine"". Rifle has been in my family since new and is in great condition. I`v only put about 150 rounds through this rifle. I`v taken a few deer with this out to @200 yrds and it`s dead on accurate. It comes with the correct 800m site and 2-10 round magazines. The one mag is original to the rifle the other is not. All #s match (bolt, receiver,ect.). The wood is in good shape with no cracks. As you can see in one of the pics there is a pistol grip and collapsible stock conversion(not cheap) which turns this into a excellent ""bush"" rifle. It`s a simple one bolt conversion. It makes it that much smaller for backpacking into the back country. I find the pistol grip makes it a more stable shooter, kinda like a AR or AK pistol grip setup. Comes with both wood stock and pistol grip options(if you want both). Also I have @100 rounds of .303 that come with it. Feel free to contact me with any questions. I`m sure we can work something out with shipping."
