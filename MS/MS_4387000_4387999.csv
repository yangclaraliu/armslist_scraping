Introducing the Steel Veteran Targets flagship steel target stand!  This is a hardcore target stand.  It has 3 slots for 2x4 wood posts.  You supply the wood, cut to whatever length you have lying around.  Use it to staple up cardboard or hang steel targets from.  The bolts are ¾ inch.  There are holes for stakes at all four corners for uneven or soft ground.

 We will also be releasing a complete steel target system designed for the center slot and side slots in the next couple of weeks and you can add that on at a later date.

You may see some companies selling similar stands with holes for 1x2’s or 2x2’s.  If you are a high round count shooter, you know that those smaller boards don’t last long, especially when shooting steel.  2x4’s are much more common, and last a lot longer.

These stands are veteran designed and made with USA steel right here in Jacksonville, FL.  Price is normally $60.  Fathers day sale price is $50.  Buy two stands for $45 apiece, three for $40 and increments of 5 or more are just $35 a stand!  If you can find a similar stand for a better price, send us a message at REDACTED and we will beat that price. 

 If you need multiple stands, send us a PM to work out a deal!  Delivery can be arranged in the Jacksonville area.  E-mail us for shipping options.  We can accept cash or credit."

350,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4387350,For Trade:  3D Printer - Makerbot Thing-O-Matic - Includes Supplies,"Winchester, Northern Virginia, Virginia",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, June 11, 2015",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hi, and thank you for looking!

For trade-only, we have a genuine Makerbot Thing-O-Matic 3D Printer, complete with cables and supplies.

This 3D printer features a Stepstruder MK6 and 4x4x4 build platform.  It is a fully working model, and we've printed a number of whistles and other basic trinkets to test its functionality.  Additionally, we precision re-adjusted a few key mounting points, and it should be a good reliable hobbyist printer for many projects.

To answer the first question many here will undoubtedly ask, will it print AR lowers?  No.  Well, not very well, at least.  It has a 4x4x4 build area, which means that to build objects larger than 4x4x4 requires the use of various bonding methods, making it not very good for making AR lowers.  On the gun-making front, you might be able to make some nice 1911 parts, snap-caps, mags, holsters, tools, etc.  However, as far as AR lowers are concerned, it will take you HOURS to make one working lower, and since good quality aluminum lowers can be bought for cheap here on ArmsList, you're better spending your time working towards one of those.

This 3D printer will include a variety of replacement parts as well as several spools of filament.  It works well on Windows, Linux, and Mac, and if even works well without a computer.  Just put your 3D image on an SD card and tell the machine to make it!

Please remember that 3D printing is generally a hobbyist-oriented industry, and a LOT of tinkering and tweaking is usually involved.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.  Thanks again for looking.  (-:"

Small classes, lot's of shooting, draw and live fire your pistol from your holster.

I run small classes in a private setting.  You will shoot  in this course,  200 - 300 rounds is not uncommon.  


The course will start with 4 hours of NRA FIRST Steps Pistol and it continues with 4 hours of NRA / Winchester Pistol Qualification program.  This is a self paced program and students can progress at their pace. Running small classes allows for this.

The second day starts with several hours of IL Law, Federal Law covering such topics as use of force and the IL Concealed Carry Act.  We move to drawing and firing realistic air-soft analog pistols, drawing and dry firing your pistol from your holster and finally drawing and live firing your pistol from your holster.

The course meets all requirements for your concealed carry permit.  As a courtesy veterans may take the full 16 hours for $75 if they wish.  I am a small time operation so I do not offer a 12 hour course at this time."

I have performed extensive research and I have found similar knives but none with a Collins Bros. Stamp on the sheath. I cannot find a makers name on the knife itself, the only marking of identification is on the sheath, which is specifically fitted for this particular knife. It shows some age and from the other collectable I acquired I am guessing its age somewhere in the 1960’s to early 70’s.

That is a big ZERO until now. This is the model right before the C2 that is a compact unit. It has the same 15 ft range as the C2 which is really just a curvier design. As the C2 is $350-$400 with the extras, this unit will cost less than half. Whether you want to make some seriously cool You-Tube videos or keep it next to the bed, this unit works! How do I know? Besides the photo that has the POWER light glowing, I got it with 4 cartridges and fired one. I hung a towel over a picnic pork roast (still wrapped) and at 6 or 7 feet POP!!! The probes stick in a towel like glue as they are barbed and the voltage can jump 2 inches to a body beneath, through jackets or even kevlar. Only a 9-volt battery so won't mess with a pacemaker even, but watch COPS and you will see a 280lb badazz whine how he was stabbed and shot, but the TASER beat the crap out of him. He went from ""I hate the world and you too cop!"" to ""SIR, I give, no more...."" This unit has a programmed cycle that repeats again so the ""intruder"" does not recover fast and yank off the probes. It cycles through a pattern so you can drop the unit and run. You can also use the unit as a TOUCH and ZAP stun gun if needed after firing (If you miss)The pack of new cartridges (not new as in for sale today at the store as this is the previous model) has all sorts of registration you send to TASER and every deployment, drops 20-50 strips of paper with the serial number of your unit all over the place. The Air Taser unit has 1 LIVE cartridge mounted (pops on and off easy) and a sealed and new pack of 2 more. As it is used and consigned, no warranty can be made by me, and all instructions and registration is direct with TASER if you choose.  At this price, you get the 2 cartridges (sell for $70) plus the 1 attached, the holster and a new Alkaline 9V battery. Not the newest model but the $175 to $200 you save can buy a decent 22 pistol (Glock Trainer) for target use or fun OR a 12 gauge pump shotgun new in box with ghost ring sights.You need an ffl for the 12 gauge but this TASER ships direct to you for $12.35"

For starters, Silver State uses heavy duty brass that helps to maintain smooth chambering. Next comes the Sierra MatchKing bullet. These super-accurate bullets have very thin jackets and are held to exacting tolerances in diameter and weight, and the hollow point design produces the highest possible ballistic coefficient. Although some of these bullets have been used for hunting, Sierra recommends them for target shooting only. ATTENTION:This ammunition is loaded with hard Military Spec Primers designed for use in military style rifles. It may misfire in some single shot break-open firearms. Please Note: While the 5.56x45mm NATO will fit in a .223 Remington chamber, the 5.56 is a military round that runs at higher pressures than its .223 counterpart and is not recommended to be fired in a .223 Remington chamber.

This is a sick target model. The red dot is like cheating. I added custom mesquite grips I designed and were laser engraved. The pistol is extremely tight, and needs to be shot more than I shoot it. Zero malfunctions, but honestly isn't even broken in. With all the work done by Les Baer factory on this, its easily a $3000 item with a 1 year wait.

I got the 357 from a marine on quantico base. He use to shoot competition with it and he only shot .38 rounds through it. I traded a 1911 for it. Next I got to shoot it one day with some 357 rounds for the first time. It shot 3 times in a row but did not shoot from the fourth trigger pull but the fifth trigger pull it did. The gun has a life time warranty, so I sent it to Smith & Wesson and they fixed it. 

When I cleaned the 357 I always took out the yoke screw to give it a good cleaning but this time around I took the yoke screw out and could not put it back in, so I sent to smith and Wesson and they took care of it for me.

Since then I got 2 Sig handguns and now I'm hooked on Sig, so I put the 357 up for trade for another Sig or something with equal value."

I got it from another reenactor and it was not used prior. He simply had it around. It could use a little ""working out"" to help loosen it up a bit. I have fired three live rounds out of it and about 15 blanks through it while I was attempting to get it tuned in for blanks.

This is a Yugoslavian semi-automatic only copy of the MG42. It can not be made to fire full auto.

It has a little surface dirt on the bipod from a training event. The ""brown stuff"" inside the cover is grease. Not dirt or rust. But it probably could use being cleaned out and regreased.

Included is a wooden box. Two belts. Yugo Snail Drum. (Could use a repaint to look more German wartime) and I will throw in my MG Gunner's pouch as I will not need it. I also have a MG42 sling that I will include but I do not recommend using it as the latch for the pistol grip is not big enough. However, I have no use for it and maybe you could modify it or something.

This is NOT CONVERTED. It is still chambered in 8mm Mauser. Some people convert them to 308. This is still in it's default caliber.

I also am including an MG3 blank adapter but I do not recommend this for use. There are other blank adapters out there that are far superior and will give you good results. This gun will likely need some tuning in for blanks. They can be a bit stubborn with blanks but a proper adapter and time will go a LONG way. This is just how these guns are.

I am asking 3000 plus half on shipping costs. I will be kind on that rather than tossing the full cost of shipping at you. I will be at Knox County D-Day in Ohio if you wish to do a FTF there. Any FTF sale will require ID. I heavily prefer if you have a valid Ohio CHL to show me to show you are valid to own firearms.

I reserve the right to refuse a sale. If you raise red-flags I will back down in the effort to keep this legal.

For trades? I'm not too sure yet. I am seeking German or Russian weapons. BFONGs or otherwise. I might dabble in some modern stuff. We'll play that by ear. Money, obviously, is king.

Payment via PayPal usually preferred. We will keep it discreet to avoid them getting antsy about it. I may take other Payment methods. However, NO CASHIER CHECKS! This is due to the risks involved with them. Thanks for understanding. FTF, obviously, cash is king there.

SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE. Been having issues on other pages with this item and lack of commitment! Come prepared and things will go smooth."

As stated the Makarov is in almost new condition. Was unfired when I got it and I've only put 150 rounds through it since.  This is an Arsenal commercial model and not military surplus, so it is in excellent condition cosmetically, I'd say around 95-98%.  Is still in military configuration though with fixed military sights and bakelite grip.  Will come with two 8 round magazines (one of which is serial matched to the gun), a surplus military flap holster, and 450 rounds of 9x18mm ammo.  

I've enjoyed Makarovs but I'm looking for something a little smaller for carry this summer.  Primarily interested in a Springfield XDs (prefer 9mm but would still consider 45), a Ruger LC9s plus cash or ammo,  Walther PPS, a S&W J Frame of some kind in 38 special (not interested in LCR's), Glock 26 or 27, or maybe a Ruger SR9c or SR40c. The only 380 I would consider would be a recent production Glock 42. Not interested in S&W Shields, No Taurus or Kel Tec please.

I have repaired all normally damaged areas of the inserts with Clear Cast Resin and re-flocked it. They normally get brittle over time as they were made from cheap plastic and were never intended to last this long.

The Revolver is in Excellent Condition with minimal flaws in the finish. There are slight rub marks on the Cylinder from where it was sitting in the case. I tried to capture them in the pictures. So, do you feel lucky? Huh, Do ya...?

More pictures can be supplied to serious buyers. What you see is what you get.

Trades will be considered but only firearm related items and please no, .40 S&W Calibers. Other S&W Revolvers will be considered as trade if it is something I do not have. Trade plus cash is an option but I am not interested in anything made from Polymer for this fine revolver."
