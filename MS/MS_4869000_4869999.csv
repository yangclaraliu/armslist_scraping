I have up for sale an HK P2000SK chambered in 9. It is SA/DA with a decocking button so no trigger safety, just a hard first pull then you have crisp light action with single action. Another option is to cock the hammer back for immediate single action. The pistol has around 250 rounds through it, and comes with two HK mags, the original HK carrying case, and manual. I'm also throwing in about $50 of ammo as you will get a box of 50 ball rounds, and two boxes of Federal hollowpoints (40 rounds). Also comes with a $40 Blackhawk paddle holster as shown in pictures. If you know anything about H&K, you will know that they make the top quality pistols, and their pistols are the preferred brand of a lot of worldwide operators (Special Forces). This is a $900 pistol when it's new, and it has been babied from day one. 

Thanks for looking!"

This one was made in Greece by EBO with H&K tools, so it is as close to an HK-91 as you can get. It was imported by Springfield Armory for your shooting pleasure. Some history from Wikipedia on the HK-91 and SAR-8: “The last few HK-91s that were delivered to the U.S. in 1989 were blocked by customs after President George H. W. Bush issued an Executive Order banning the importation of ""non-sporting"" rifles . . . Licensed copies of the G3 and HK-91 were produced in Greece by Hellenic Arms Industry or ""EBO"", using factory tooling purchased from Heckler & Koch. A small number of these HK-91 clones, which are functionally and aesthetically identical to the German-made rifles, were imported into America by Springfield Armory, Inc. and sold under the designation SAR-8. These rifles, which ceased being imported in 1994, are not to be confused with later Springfield-made SAR-8 model rifles which feature cast aluminum receivers and are considered of markedly lower quality, being valued at far less than the original Greek models"

Hey all, 
	I have available for trade/sale a lot of 458 SOCOM ammunition. I got these on a bulk trade a while back. I got these as they are and was told they are 300gr Hornady rounds made by Southern Ballistic Research. I would rather these go to someone who wants to try some different rounds instead of just ""burning"" them up at the range. If you've ever bought these before, you know these can be pricey, so buy from me and save! Here is what I have:
-86x SBR 300gr HP Hornady (10 of them have had the tips notched by previous owner for some reason)- $180
	I would also trade these for Wilson Combat TTSX 458 SOCOM loads, or possibly other 458 loads to try in my rifle. May also trade for certain Guns as well. Need to meet in Norman on these. Shoot me a text or message on here at REDACTED and we can go from there. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

The laser can be activated by pressing the slide release pulltab on the left or right side of the frame- extremely ergonomic and simple to use.

After some research I found listings up to 3.5 grand for one of these quality semi-automatic pistols.

731,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4869731,For Sale:  STEVENS LITTLE SCOUT MODEL 14-1/2 .22 CAL.,"Rural Bay County, Panama City, Florida",$ 200,"Listed On: Thursday, January 21, 2016",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Offered for your consideration, a J. STEVENS ARMS COMPANY LITTLE SCOUT MODEL 14-1/2 w/20-inch barrel chambered for .22 Long Rifle. These rifles were produced between 1909 and 1936; overall length is 35 inches and weight is 3 lbs. 6 oz. Includes two full boxes of 50 & one partial box of WESTERN .22 Short vintage ammo.

THE STORY:

This was my first rifle 50 years ago. When it was given to me, I was told to use .22 Shorts exclusively, as Long Rifle (maybe High-Velocity?) ammo would cause the breech block to open slightly upon firing. Of course, at the time of design, over 100 years ago, the High-Velocity Long Rifle cartridge did not exist, and I'm not sure whether the issue was occurring with Standard-Velocity long rifle cartridges.

Anyway, as a favor to me, my younger brother took the rifle out without asking about 30 years ago, and was probably firing LRHV ammo when the firing pin broke. The captive portion of the pin (cartridge end) is still present in the breech block, retained by the breech block lever. The rifle has been back-burnered since that time.

It was disassembled by one of us back then, and I thought I had all of the pieces, but just noticed as I went to prep it for sale that the breech block screw and hammer screw are missing; all other parts (albeit only half of the firing pin) are present. The breech block and hammer were placed in position, unretained, for the photos.

The bore/rifling appear to be in excellent shape. The unit has light surface rust on most surfaces, though the only possibility of significant pitting appears to be on the buttplate. Note that, as far as I'm aware, this unit has never been refinished, and I've made no attempt to mitigate the corrosion currently present. There is inlaid into the buttstock a medallion with the name ""Robert""; if the buyers name is Robert, that'll be 25 bucks on top of the listed price : )

Numrich has a schematic and list of parts at:

http://www.gunpartscorp.com/Manufacturers/SavageStevensSpringfieldFox-33479/Rifles-40502/1412LittleScout-39683.htm?page=1

though it appears that all parts are currently ""Sold Out"". Sad, because the firing pin and both screws listed for around $25 total. On the upside, they have an excellent photo of the firing pin, which should enable anyone with the requisite skills to fabricate one, especially since a sample the most critical portion is still in the breech block. The screws should be similarly easy to reproduce, if replacements cannot be had."

	Hello all,
	This listing is for a used but in great shape Ruger Charger. This has a beautiful stock and is in great shape. This comes with the spring loaded bipod, factory 15 round mag, two after market 25rd butler creek magazines, carry case/material cover, and ruger lock. This has the threaded barrel with thread cap installed and the picatinny rail on top. I would keep this, but I really don’t have  large use for it at the moment and would prefer to get it to someone who could really appreciate it more than I. I do also have a brick of ammunition and a red dot/scope i could include on certain trades or for an extra cost. 
	I would also consider trades for other firearms, large lots of HP 7.62x39 ammo, 38 spl revolvers, or possibly blackpowder revolvers with adjustable sights. Please, no 40s unless heavily in my favor and not other various items. Shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on this. 
Thanks
JB"

AR-15 pistol build that I almost nearly completed. All it needs is a handguard of your choice. It currently has a Mil Spec barrel nut, but that’s easy enough to change. Parts and prices listed below to give an idea of what it would cost to build new.
