Over the last year I've added a rifle length buffer tube, JP enterprises silent capture buffer, original A2 stock without buttplate door, hogue grip, 18"" ss barrel chambered in .223 wylde (.223 and 5.56), mid length gas system with lo pro gas block, diamond head vrs-t 15"" rail, troy folding battle sights, JP trigger spring kit, and Kies master blaster linear muzzle break.

Gun is very fun to shoot, I built it so me and my girlfriend could shoot paper targets at the range since .223 is easier to find them .22lr these days. Its a heavy gun, barely moves when you shoot it. Between the JP captured spring and the linear muzzle break, its a lot quieter from the shooters perspective than a typical carbine. I have roughly 1000 rounds through it, only one FTE while shooting steel case wolf.

I don't have to sell this gun. I'm looking to buy a side by side in the next couple months and could use the extra cash. I have three 30 round tapco magazines and 200 rounds of Tul .223 to go with the gun and one of the magazines is full of whatever the Walmart steel core 62gr ammo is. I have the hard plastic case the gun came in and the owners manual too."

I bought this to use as a snake gun when fishing. It is really too nice to just be thrown in a tackle box so up for sale it goes. I bought it brand new and shot exactly 10 rounds through it before putting it in the safe. It really does shoot a lot easier than I expected. I have the box and papers for it also when I get brave enough to look for it in my junk closet.

Sorry, but I am firm on the price and not looking for any trades. I would prefer a face to face sale but will ship to anyone's FFL dealer for $15.00. For as little money as this is I can't afford to drive to meet anyone except here in town. Thanks for looking!

All weapons listed on this site are still being sold in gunshops for a lot cheaper and theyll be brand new, dont waste your money with these clowns.

Just a word to the wise, If your weapon has been on this site for the past few months, youre either charging too much or you need to work on your people skills and maintain a professional attitude when dealing with folks because there has been alot of shady activity.

The reliability of these uppers is unmatched due to the nature of their operating system which is also adjustable to accommodate various types of ammo and use of a silencer. Besides incredible reliability, PWS also uses Isonited barrels on their guns which means you can expect out of the box performance and accuracy even after throwing many thousand rounds downrange. The quality of the BCG is also something to be admired seeing as how this upper has almost 300 rounds of 5.56 through it yet the points of friction of the BCG that interface with the inside of the receiver are totally free of any wear and tear.

NORTH AMERICAN ARMS MINI-REVOLVER 22 LR
The NAA .22 Long Rifle is the most popular Mini-Revolver ever produced. With the many current accessories, it is versatile for many applications and is the standard by which other Mini-Revolvers are judged.

As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge.

Great hidden back-up gun. Can be hidden in a boot, a cap, in the crotch area or other secret places. Very easy to conceal."

THE STIPPLE JOB IS THIS HK IS OUTSTANDING AND WAS MUCH NEEDED AS THE STOCK TEXURE IS WAY TO SLICK. 110RDS DOWN RANGE. COMES WITH BOX, 2 MAGS, PAPERS ECT... PM OR TEXT REDACTED.

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014.

This is a high quality gun made in Japan in the same facotries that made Browning Citori's at the time.  It has 26"" ventalated rib barrels, SKB's Inter-Choke system, chrome lined bores, crossbolt locking system. It has inlaid artwork in gold by Ron Van Gilder on the side of the receiver and is finely engraved. I'm listing this gun as new in box. It has never been fired and has just been sitting in my gun safe. SKB stopped production of this model in 2005 and the medallion version had very limited production (50 guns were made in 20 gauge to the best of my understanding). MSRP was around $2350, and blue book on these are around $2000.  When I was looking at comps online to find a selling price I saw that Cabela's had one listed in USED condition for $2100, but they pulled it down because it sold.  I am asking $1800.  I feel this is a very fair price, but am always open to hear what you have in mind. This is a very nice, NIB with all the papers, never been fired shotgun.

I originally purchased the gun with the intent to start shooting with my wife.  Shortly after purchasing it, we stumbled across a really nice left handed Beretta o/u that I couldn't pass on.  That left this gun as the ""odd man out"".  It has sat in the safe ever since.  

I'm open to listen to offers and possible trades, but would prefer cash.  Never hurts to ask though, worst I can say is no!

Face to face is always best, and I am willing to travel to meet somewhere that works for both of us.
I would consider shipping to an FFL on your dime if that is the only option."

This mic's at .309 at the case mouth, meaning this is actually made for the AK and SKS, not like most of the domestic ammunition I see which is actually using a .308 projectile.  I haven't seen any Olympic for sale since I bought this, probably 14 years ago.  Test your AK out for accuracy with something cleaner to fire than Tula, then you have brass to make more for the next trip.

In addition to the full can, I've got 5, 40 round boxes of Olympic FMJ, and 5, 20 round boxes of Prvi Partisan 123 Grain Soft Point, plus 5 extra rounds of the Prvi.

This is good, accurate, and will give you a reloadable casing.  I'm asking 70 cents per round, and would prefer to sell all or most, due to what it is.  Make a reasonable offer, and I would accept partial trades.  There's almost 1000 of the Greek stuff, and its got an M67 bullet.  You're paying for something above and beyond Winchester White box, or Federal, and most of the other stuff out there at a great price.

Tell me what you've got and let's get your AK or SKS rifle closer to its accuracy potential."

Description from Springfield:

Springfield Armory® was the first 1911 manufacturer to offer a frame that included an accessory rail as part of the forging. The Champion™ Operator® mates this forged Operator® frame with a shorter slide and a 4 inch barrel. This results in a pistol that is suitable for concealed carry or operating where a light is needed – and it doesn’t sacrifice any capacity.

Pick up a Champion™ Operator®, and you’ll find that it’s a feature-loaded expression of the classic 4 inch 1911. The beavertail grip safety, flat mainspring housing, Lightweight Delta™ hammer, extended ambidextrous thumb safeties and extended trigger give you all the ergonomic advantages you want in a carry pistol. The 3-Dot tritium combat sights mean that the Champion™ Operator® is ready for any conditions. A carry gun also has to be reliable. Thanks to the lowered and flared ejection port, fully supported ramped match grade barrel and proprietary dual-captive recoil system, the Champion™ Operator® is guaranteed to perform when you need it most. And the Armory Kote™ finish will keep it performing for years to come.

You can carry the Champion™ Operator® with you all day, appreciating its smaller size and standard capacity. Then slide your favorite tactical light on the rail, and put it on your nightstand. When you need a feature-packed 1911 for night and day, reach for the Champion™ Operator®.

There is some minor finish wear on the slide near the muzzle from carrying. This is a working gun, not a safe queen, but always well cared for, never abused. Wearing a set of Pachmayr Signature grips for increased comfort and recoil management. This is the same grip specified by the Marine Corps as one of their requirements for their MEU pistol.


Included is the original case, magazines, etc. I will also include a custom kydex holster by Hooch Holsters. I will also throw in a box of Winchester PDX1 Bonded JHPs if my full price is met. 

My price is firm at $800, and fair given the included holster and ammo. I don't need to sell this gun, I just have my eye on a few other things at the moment. If my price isn't met, I will happily keep it.

I would prefer to sell, but the trade interests listed below are the ONLY trades I'm considering. Please do not offer me your .17HMRs, .410 bolt action shotguns, video game consoles, first born children, or Jimenez/Bryco/Jennings handguns. Unless of course you want to do a straight trade for a Wilson Combat Professional :)

Transaction will be face to face, prefer to keep it in the Indy area. No shipping, no taxes, no paperwork. Will want to see DL and LTCH, nothing recorded.

This rifle is very accurate and is very reliable. Ive fired roughly 400 rounds through it since i bought it new and have never had any issues with any ammo that i have ran through it. I did run 60 rounds of steel through it just to see if it would malfunction, and it didn't. The rest was all new brass cased. With the rifle, the factory box will come with it, along with the certificate of authenticity. One factory 10 round mag (looks like a 30 round but is factory limited by troy). Depending on the offers i get, i will throw in either a magpul afg or a magpul vertical fore grip. i may also include the cheap firefield 2-10x40 scope with built in laser, a troy single point sling, my plano gun guard all weather case. (This case is very similar to the pelican cases. Has pluck foam, Very rugged). For everything listed, i will take 1350 obo. If you don't like my price, then that's fine. I do not have to sell this. On other online auction sites, there are only 7 listed nationwide for sale. 

Id rather trade for multiple pistols (huge fan of subcompact glocks) or do a single straight trade for a kimber ultra carry of stone sort. Will accept trades on other 1911s as well, so long as they are a 3"" barrel. Lower end guns will require either multiple pistols or cash added on your end. Will email more pictures due to the image size being too large to post multiples. 
Thanks.

I apologize for the upside picture. Have no clue how to rotate it. 

MUST BE A KENTUCKY RESIDENT AND MUST SHOW ID. Prefer ccdw. Don't tell me you live in ky via email, then text me and say you live in Indiana.....

Im a motivated seller and i will work with you on the price.....providing things go smooth and easily. But keep in mind that i don't have to sell this. Don't waste my time or yours. I will increase the price for dumb people if that's how you want this to go."

This is a super high performance 45 GAP loading and gives the 45 GAP some serious muscle. The long-for-weight all copper Barnes bullet will penetrate deeply for such a light bullet and will give low recoil, which aids in fast follow-up shots. Expect roughly 12 to 14 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone.

This load utilizes a flash suppressed powder, which gives the shooter an important advantage as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Firing to save your life in the dark is likely if you find yourself forced to fire at all. Blinding yourself with your first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

As always, we have used real world pistols to generate our advertised velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels to determine advertised velocities is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to reproduce such false high velocities in the real world, where it matters.
