It's in near new condition and has only been fired about twenty times.  Comes standard with a pistol grip.  The breaching muzzle is designed to grip a door while venting gasses to prevent the danger over pressure, although it is fairly sharp and a jab to the face would be very convincing.  It holds 5-6 shells in the magazine depending on their actual length.  Dual extractors. I installed a short section of polymer rail on the forend for mounting a light.

Although I really enjoy this pistol, I'm looking for a smaller, pocket 9 and/or a full length 9mm pistol - as I'll be getting into more target shooting this summer. I love everything about this pistol, though I prefer a 6 o-clock hold for a sight picture - and these are setup for sub-center sight picture, which isn't bad, just different from all my other firearms. Bummer for me..

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-Spec plates at 40 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is target material. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 15 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc."

Purchased new 4 months back and shot only twice. I know when used firearms are put up for sale the usual info reads, “Shot 1 box of ammo through with no issues” but this is the honest truth in this scenario. Pistol is awesome and a joy to shoot and carry due to its compact size, but I am now having to shift gears towards an Alaska project and as such need funds to purchase a Ruger Super Redhawk in .454 Casull. 
Purchase price I paid for Firearm and additional items are as such: XDS-$475, Extra magazines & mag holder-$100, Crimson Trace LG 469-$190, for a grand total of: $765.
Asking package price of all items (will not sell separately) is a very fair $650 OBO

The only trade possibilities are pistols in either .454 Casull or a .460.

As described in title, checkered walnut stock, 18"" barrel, LNIB.
First off, it is a 2012 model.  Yes, I know older JM stamped Marlins command a premium, but don't believe all the internet griping either by folks repeating old tapes .  There were teething pains early on when Freedom Group bought Marlin, but this was built several years after that.  But Marlin hasn't made 1894's in .357 in a couple of years now, and if you call Marlin they will tell you they don't know when they will again.
The finish, wood-to-metal tolerances, and action are all good and smooth.  No scratches, dings, or anything else.  
I put 9 rounds -- one magazine tube worth -- through the rifle, to test for function, and then it has sat in the safe totally unused.  I could clean it, put a light coat of oil on it, call it BNIB and you wouldn't know.  Have the original plastic wrap and box.
The picture attached is a generic pic off of Google simply because it's a better picture than I could take -- this one is exactly the same.  If you want another view I'll take a pic and email it to you.
It's a fantastic, handy sized carbine.  When I shot the 38's through it, it literally recoiled like a .22.  (I did not try any .357's, but obviously it will handle those as well, as stamped on the barrel).

This revolver is ready for big game hunting. It has the 8 3/8 inch ported barrel and Leupold scope.

I am also including 2 custom speed loaders and the holster which fits the revolver and scope combination. The original sights are still intact so the scope could be removed and the iron sights used. I have included a picture. I tried to upload more pictures but the website would not allow me due to maximum limits. I have over $1100 in the combination.

True military overrun ammunition produced in Sweden for a NATO European Military contract. It’s loaded in 10-round stripper clips, individually sealed in plastic bags and comes neatly packed in a brand new 50 caliber ammo can, making it perfect for long-term storage.

BULLET INFORMATION: Thanks to its unique projectile design this load possesses a higher ballistic coefficient than standard M855 ball. The noticeably longer projectile ensures it better retains both its velocity and energy over distance. The end result is it shoots flatter, drifts less in the wind and hits harder compared to standard M855. It also possesses greater sectional density for deeper penetration."

This rifle is Chambered in 7.62 x 39 mm, it takes all standard AK mags. The very best thing about this bullpup is that the overall length is only 27"". That is just over the Federal long gun cut off of “more than 26” and allows you to carry the rifle with much greater mobility. This configuration allows close quarters tactical use. Perfect for Law Enforcement, Military or Home Defense. The gun can be fired “from the hip” or from the shoulder without having to fold or unfold it to fire. It’s always 27” and always ready to fire. All high capacity magazines will clear the pistol grip.

Comes with Tactical Bag."

Up for sale is a Sig Sauer 1911 compact chambered in 45 ACP. Gun is all stock, and I bought new 3 or 4 years ago. I would estimate I have shot 500 rounds through it, but that number is not exact. The gun is very accurate and is in great condition, with little signs of wear. The gun has also been cleaned after each shooting. There is nothing wrong with this firearm, I just don't use it enough to have a $1000 gun sitting in my safe.

Price includes gun, 2 magazines, original case, and a crossbreed IWB holster that has been used (I bought the holster used and have carried this gun 10-20 times in the last 2 years). 

Price reduced from $950 to $850, I had an error in my original ad stating this was a 1911TCO (tradictional compact), it is actually the 1911CCO model which Sig quit making in 2013. To my knowledge it is almost identical to the traditional model which Sig produces now.

The rifle is a .223/5.56 16"" melonite coated 1/7 barrel with low profile gas block, Troy battle Ax stock, Troy 13"" Alpha rail, battle ax grip, battle flip up iron sights, forged upper and lower, etc.

Included are (4) 30 round mags, all paperwork, FDE inserts in rail and on grip along with a zip up soft case. I also have approximately 400 rounds of 5.56 ammo that I will include for the right trade.

The factory booklet from Troy documenting all parts used on the gun alone totals $2,142.73. The ammo, three additional mags, Troy inserts in rail, and soft case were over $300 as well. This brings the combined value to almost $2,500. The rifle is new, and unfired. While I am not expecting to get that amount out of the rifle I would greatly appreciate that you value your trades accordingly.

Text me at REDACTED with inquires or email if needed. Will sell everything for $1,500. No trades please."

I just checked the site, and to buy this new would be at least $689....broken down as follows:
$399 basic kit before add-ons
$90 for collapsible stock
$170 for the quad rail
$30 for flash hider
$___ for shipping costs?

I've put less than 100 rounds through mine, and it's worked perfectly 100% of the time. So it's not new, but it's less than 100 rounds from new, and is fully loaded as you can see... EXCEPT that this listing does NOT come with the flip-up MBUS sights shown in the pictures because I need to keep them for another purpose.

The photo shows this MechTech mounted on a Gen 4 Glock 17 - so please note: the Glock is NOT included in this sale. This listing is for the upper only (no sights). If you have a Glock 17 of any generation, it will fit and function perfectly on this upper, and I think that even a Glock 22 will work on it, as long as you use 9mm mags.

I will meet you in metro Birmingham, or I will ship it to you (where it's legal, which I think is everywhere) if you pay the shipping costs. Compared to a new one, this is a great deal to save over $100."
