Also included, is a framed authenticated print of a 1936 Frank Tenney Johnson painting, ""On the Range"", which was added at a later date.

Featuring a five-times zoom system, front focal plane precision reticles, dimensionally-matched precision adjustment knobs with Zero Click Stop technology, and outstanding optical performance, XTR II value is unprecedented. Scopes come with a G2B Mil-Dot Reticle or a F-Class MOA Reticle. The G2b Mil-Dot is a mil-based reticle with hash marks in between the mil dots for more precise aiming, distance measurement, holdover, and hold-off for wind. The F-Class MOA Reticle is the only reticle of its kind to feature multiple illuminated center dots, the Front Focal Plane reticle keeps the 1/2 MOA grid design accurate at any magnification. A second 20 MOA offset 1/2 MOA grid allow shooters to obtain an extra 20 MOA of elevation beyond the capability of the turret adjustments and still have horizontal wind hold-off references.

Here is my Polarstar Airsoft Toy for sale. It has a custom metal upper and lower receiver (ie no trademarks, so if your a label/brand whore you can stop reading now!), bsa site, daniel defense quad rail with covers, moe grip, crane stock rear wired with custom fcu (no crane cover plate, but has cover). Standard barrel with metal hop up, modify hard bucking with prometheus nub, front flip up site, sling, ambidextrous sling adapter and of course v2 fusion engine. It is used and has visible field wear but works and is a cheap ready to use field rifle. It will come with a deans wired 7.4 lipo battery (yes it has an adapter if you don't run deans wiring). 

Only real negative (which ironically is a positive highlight of the set up) is the custom fcu. It is not hard wired into the connector in the event I ever wanted to return to the newer fcu, I could. So, basically if you pull out the stock too far you will pull out the wires. More of a nuisance vs a problem because you can just plug them back up. It will be up to you the buyer if you want to keep the custom fcu set up and hard wire them into the connector or switch to the newer fcu and hard wire into that(fcu on your dime). It had a pinched line but is fixed up now. I will include a replacement line if you decide to just put a fresh one in but it's not necessary. 

Priced appropriately @ $500 picked up. Lets do the math for a minute... Polarstar Fusion Engine's were running $500 BY THEMSELVES, now about $475 new. Your getting a Fusion Engine and a free rifle with alot of extras that add up well beyond my asking price!"

628,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4367628,For Sale:  PSL Marksman Rifle 7.62x54R,"Spring Lake, North Carolina, United States","$ 1,000","Listed On: Saturday, September 5, 2015",Rifles,no type,7.62x54R                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I'm selling my PSL, it will come with three 10 round magazines, two work perfectly one typically jams after the second or third round. The magazines do lock the action open when empty. I'm also throwing in 110 Prvi Partizan JSP (jacketed soft points) rounds. The scope in the picture also comes with the rifle. 

General information: Despite some resemblance to the SVD Dragunov, they are two completely different rifles, and the only similarity is that they both are chambered for the 7.62x54mmR round. The PSL was designed based on the RPK light machine gun. They are more expensive than what they used to be due to the fact that they aren't imported anymore. Also, while it may look like a sniper rifle it is intended to be a designated marksman rifle, so shots out to around 600 meters (possibly out to 800) are what the rifle is designed for. 

Another thing to note is that PSLs are typically picky about what ammo you use. So when shooting, try different ammo to see what it likes best. Also, one should stick to light ball ammo (150 gr and lower).

Also FTF only, though will have it done with a FFL transfer for safety reasons. Will pay for the transfer fee. Will meet as long as the drive is no longer than 4 hours.

Will also send more pictures if requested.

I am not one to like things too ""fancy"", standard A2 stock set, Magpul, or similar.

If I don't find someone that has a used one available, I will order a new PSA with Magpul. If you have some upgrades, I am fair and will take that in consideration.

...This carbine was bought off centerfiresystems.com a few months back. Centerfire's price on the carbine is $549.99. If you were to buy one off of them, you'd need to wait for shipping (a couple of weeks) and the pay all kinds of additional fees such as shipping, taxes and transfer fees.

Can't say there is really much, if any, pitting.

I have more pics that I can email upon request.

According to the seriel # (4986xxx), it was manufactured in 1981.

I bought it for my husband about 5 years ago, then right after I got him a Marlin 30-30 (which he totally fell in love with).  He has never even shot the Winchester. The man I got it from said he had had it since it was new but he had shot it very little.
