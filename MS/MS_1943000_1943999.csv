DESCRIPTION:	 	 	 
The semi-auto hunting rifles VEPR are designed for medium-sized and big games. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). 
VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market 

The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope. 

All VEPR rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory, included in the manual.

 Paid $680 new, go for around $550-$650 today depending where you find one. Easily $250 worth of ammo without tax and another $100 between the holster, demooners and extra moon clips. All in all there's around just over $1000 here.

 Asking $800.00 obo for all of it. Would prefer not to separate any of it either. Might consider trade for a Glock + cash but nothing else."

Both of these boxes are pretty nice too for their age. Someone did write Army Ammo in black felt pen on the back of the 30-06 God only knows how long ago. Now for the brass. I have two boxes of Weatherby Tiger boxes in very good shape. Both are complete with once fired brass. Next is a full box of Remington .222 brass, also in good shape.

Sorry for the bad pics I can always send or text more. I'm in Bowling Green just south of Toledo/Perrysburg. A few weeks ago I drove to Columbus and back with no problems. Runs great just needs some body fixing.

My bottom dollar is $1400 cash or trade for Guns worth more so I can make a quick sale on them. 

Any questions shoot me an email at [email]REDACTED[/email], PM me, or text/call me at REDACTED

Thanks for checking this out!

Approximately 75 hours on engine. This is an absolute little gem and is the most versatile little skiff I have owned. You can draft in 5 on the flats, fish the bridges at night, or run to beach with the kids. She is tiny but mighty for a boat you can keep in your garage. I spent an incredible amount of time configuring her for different fishing scenarios and was delighted to fit her with every possible accessory. You can run the boat bare, as I did often, and I loved the safety and security of the recessed bow when fishing at night or when with the kids. Add in the forward casting platform for serious flats stalking. Next, line up the custom Yeti cooler with removable back-rest and you have yet a third option. She has brand new Snake eye LED running lights, blue LED courtesy lights, blue LED underwater lights, 6 remote control power pole, 2012 Minn Kota 55lb thrust Ipilot (with quick release mount, remote control and gps anchor lock), two new batteries, live well, 4 blade stainless prop, spare prop, on-board battery charger (plug into any outlet), 15 gallon built in alum fuel tank, bilge-pump, GPS/Fish-finder, back-rest for poling platform, 18 carbon/fiberglass push pole, rod holders, push-pole holder on platform, anchor, basic safety equipment, lockable hatch, trailer, and Yeti cooler with custom seating to match boats cushions. The engine was recently serviced and the boat is in excellent condition. She was kept indoor at a marina and professionally cleaned after each use. If you are looking for a smaller sized skiff, I do not think you will find a more classic looking boat that can do as much. Shes not sexy, but she is classic in appearnce, reliable in use, professionally maintained, and fully loaded. Asking $13,000"

This lot comes with:

·      T-1 Tommy Gun in .45 ACP
·      Pistol grip
·      Pistol grip fore-end
·      Straight fore-end

·      Drum magazine
·      Stick magazine
·      Sling buckles
·      All paperwork
·      Fitted Case

 You will be the 2nd owner of this low-mileage semi-auto.  I never loaded the drum mag, and only got to run 100 or so rounds through the stick.  If you have a 1911, you need a carbine in the same caliber.  What better model than the icon of that other failed legislation that did nothing more than promote criminals: Prohibition!

Here are the package details: 
- Walther P22 Platinum Pink edition

- 2 extra magazines
- 100 rounds of CII Stinger 22 LR ammo

The gun does have minor wear marks (on the slide - visible in picture) from the kydex holster, but nothing major. It functions great and fires smooth; it is a tad picky in particular with Federal bulk ammo that I've noticed, so it might require more breaking in before it will eat that particular ammo. Other than that, it's a great little shooter; I have no complaints.

I would really like to sell this for $375.00 cash, but would settle for a partial trade of cash and ammo. The ammo I'd accept: 22LR and 9mm priced fair. I will respond to all offers, and if I feel your asking value for the ammo is too high, I will let you know.

Up for sale is a Remington 597 VTR, which aside from the stock and grip is NOT a 22 AR 15 clone. Based off the tried and true Remington 597 platform, these are pretty rare variants that accurize the gun and give it a ""tacticool"" look. This is NOT a plastic toy gun 22. It has all of the accoutrements of a match grade target rifle, with a free float (doesn't touch the barrel) aluminum tube handguard, target crowned 16"" bull barrel (for those that aren't aware, bull barrels are heavy match grade barrels that make normal profile barrels look like toys), A1 stock and pistol grip (that can be changed out with ANY AR 15 stock or grip). Make no mistake, this gun is capable of unbelievable accuracy. I bought it for my son, who wanted to get into competitive shooting...until we built him an real AR 15. Since then it has lived in the safe. He didn't even finish a brick of 22, and the finish is 85-90%, with no bare metal exposed. Included is one 10 round mag that came with the gun, and a 25 round factory mag (cost me $45), a padded sling, a Bushnell ""T"" dot reticle red/green sight (this was transferred from a hog gun of mine and has some scratches, but functions flawlessly), and a 6 point adjustable AR 15 buffer tube (in case you want to convert this to an adjustable stock). Why tinker around with a Ruger 10/22 or a plastic look-alike toy, when you can drive nails?"

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."
