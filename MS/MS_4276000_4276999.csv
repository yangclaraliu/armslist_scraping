Has a few very minor scratches on the receiver - honestly it came this way brand new - otherwise is excellent condition and works great. Great for any type of hunting as it shoots up to 3.5 inch shells. Stoeger is owned by Benelli and shares the same inertia driven bolt system and was also NRA's shotgun of the year in 2012.

The G43 is our new single stack 9mm pistol. The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCK history. Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size.
 
When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.

It is a second variation coil spring action made in 1914.  All of the metal is in good original condition.  Bore is good/excellent.  The barrel has been tapped for the scope that is on it and there a few extra holes where another scope has been on it.  There is also a single hole on the very top of the receiver that I imagine served as a scope base also.  All of the holes are filled with the appropriate screws. The 8X scope that is on it was made for Winchester by an outside contractor, and it was available on the late 1930s production Model 52 rifles, and the Model 75 Target rifles.  It is clear and bright and works perfectly.  I also have a spare ""Hotchkiss"" rear sight that originally went with the first generation muskets but it also fits this one.

The sling swivel on the buttstock pulled out at some point and someone put in a nice repair and then covered all of the wood with a varnish.  Overall I consider this rifle to be an excellent shooter but given the extra holes in the barrel and the refinished wood it is a little too modified to be a collector.

And if there's something else that catches my eye I'd be happy to make a deal, either another gun or cash normally would do the trick, cash is king though.But anyways some details on the rifle. It has a 10.5 noveske upper with the double chrome lined barrel from the factory. And a gen 3 noveske lower, but internals are colt that includes the lower parts kit and fire control group. Buffer, buffer tube, spring all came from spikes and it has the T2 buffer in it which surprisingly does make quite the difference in recoil. And of course it has a Sig brace on it. And lastly it is topped with a Burris 332 optic that is really nice and great glass. So that said all this fun stuff has me around 2700-2800$ after all said and done. But no I'm not looking to get that out of it as far as cash goes but I'm not looking to take a large loss either. Just make an offer if your looking to buy and we can talk. I am open to shipping but it will be on your dime and I do have PayPal so I can accept payment that way as well. As far as trades go I'm open to partial trades and cash as long as it's firearm related. So no I don't want your 1980's surround sound or broke down lawn mower. Just firearms. But if you have any questions feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer them thanks. And for a little extra I can thrown in some ammo as well.

 Value breakdown
Noveske complete upper before shipping - 1578$
Noveske gen 3 stripped lower -310$
Lpk minus trigger(colt) - 70$
Colt FCG - 75$ or geissele ssa trigger 220$
Spikes buffer tube kit w/T2 buffer - 70$ 
Moe grip - 35$
Sig brace - 110$
Burris 332 - 300$ 

All that equals 2548 but after tax it's 2738ish$, so there's the breakdown guys for those asking. Also yes I'll sell or trade the gun without the optic. I do ask if you have a trade your value/investment is around what I have. Can add geisselle ssa trigger for 2200$, 2100$ with the colt trigger.

Banned since 1994 but legal to own there will be no more of this coming into the country.

It is basically a Benelli m1 in a beretta package. It shares the same bolt assy and inertia operating system. Gun is very light weight. Most m1 accessories fit other than front end assy (barrel, handguards) due to different barrel mounting on the mag tube. If the mag tube is replaced m1 front parts fit. 
(Stock, side saddle ect do interchange ). 
Cycling speed is amazing
probably 200 rounds fired
Gun is 5+1+1. 5 in the tube (due to 922 required mag restriction crimp), 1 in the chamber and ghost loading one on the lifter. could get one more in the tube if the roll crimp was removed, but i rather not have to deal with the hassle.

This is the spring version, not the nitro piston version. I bought this awhile back and just haven't used it as much as I thought I would and could use the money towards a CCW handgun. I have fired it maybe 50 times, probably less. With Crosman Supermatch pellets, I have been able to get dime sized groups at 10 yards pretty consistently as long as I do my part.

The scope is a Winchester by Daisy 2-7 x 32 with adjustable objective. It is a big upgrade from the cheap 4x fixed that came on the rifle. It is also designed specifically for the recoil of spring air rifles so you don't need to worry about ""reverse recoil"" damaging the internals of the scope. The pellets are a combination of Crosman Premier Supermatch and Crossman Premier Superpoint pellets, still in their tins. I've shot more of the Supermatch, so there are probably a few less of the Supermatch compared to the Superpoint, but not much has been used out of either tin. The soft case is a Buck Commander soft case.

This Precision-Guided Semi-Auto firearm is optimized for herd management and predator control. It also has unique law enforcement and military applications.

Precise impact on targets out to 0.3 miles, moving as fast as 10 m.p.h.

The same Tag-and-Shoot™ technology found in fighter jets

What is Effective Range for the 5.56?

Effective range for this model is the distance at which a typical shooter will be consistently successful on a 5” static target. For a typical shooter, the effective range is 150% greater using a Precision-Guided Firearm than with a legacy rifle. If the target is moving, the effective-range advantage of a Precision-Guided Firearm increases to 350%



What is Cost Per Effective Yard?

Cost per effective yard is price divided by effective range. On average, Precision-Guided Firearms are less than half than the effective cost of a premium legacy gun and scope combination."

Up for trade is a very nice colt 1991A1. I got this in trade from the orginal owner. It's in very good shape an comes as you see it pictured.

As far as trades I am open but below are a few specifics. 

Ak-47 or ak-74 must be a good quality gun. A wasr is fine but I'll need cash with it.

This gun will shoot under moa with the right ammo or hand loads.  This is the AP4 model so you can go to the DPMS site and look up the specs.  I got rid of the detachable carry handle to mount the optics.  I also mounted a extra ring on the side of the handguard so I could us a 2 point sling.  When drilling the hole in the handguard the drill bit did hit the barrel and it made a small dimple in the barrel but doesn't affect anything and can't be seen unless you look under the handguard.  The only reason I am selling this gun is to finance a new build in 6.5 creedmoor, 260Rem., or .243 in a gas gun and would consider trades for that gun.  I have $1600.00 in this set up and would take $1300.00 for it."

This rifle is in great overall condition considering its age. The wood on the stock  is solid. Lots of minor scrapes and scratches in the finish. The metal parts belie its age. The action is smooth and works without a problem. The bore is in excellent condition with strong rifling.

In 98% condition, only a few very minor dings in the stock from handling and a touch of shine on the Mauser-style extractor bow. The bluing and bore are 100%.

When up and engaged, it blocks the sear and hammer so the gun cannot fire. This safety also prevents rearward movement of the slide.GRIP SAFETY: this safety prevents rearward travel of the trigger. The gun can only be fired if the grip safety is firmly pressed in when grasped by the hand to then allow trigger movement.DIS-CONNECTOR SAFETY: this safety prevents a round from being fired before it is in the chamber with slide and barrel locked. The dis-connector enables the pistol to fire only when fully locked and trigger is released.HALF-COCKED POSITION: the half-cocked notch in the hammer allows it to be locked in a half-cocked position. This happens in situations of unintentional hammer release or follow through caused by sear bounce.INERTIA FIRING PIN: the firing pin, designed to be shorter than its housing, is held to the rear by a spring and can only protrude to hit a cartridge primer when a fully  cocked hammer blow overcomes the spring force and the inertia of the spring."

It is a rebuilt, probably done around June 1945, based on what the barrel is stamped (6-45). The op rod, bolt, stock, barrel, trigger housing, safety, and hammer are all Springfield made parts. This is a CMP service grade rifle, with an excellent bore, the ME is 1+ and the TE is a 2+. I have the CMP hang tag and COA for this rifle, along with manual and en bloc. The is one small area of the stock that had an abrasion on it (done a long long time ago) and a two or so inch strip on top of the barrel behind the front sight where the finish is worn, but the rest of the finish is very good. The op rod is not relief cut and seems to have all wartime parts. I have a C&R, and can ship to an FFL or C&R. Feel free to ask me any questions, I'll be happy to answer them. I am asking $1,200 OBO (and add shipping if you wish to go that route). The rifle comes with an original web sling and all CMP accessories. You can text me at (2five6)-4three1-four2five7 or email me at REDACTED. If you'd like more or specific pictures, feel free to ask. I will need to see your drivers license for my C&R bound book.

I had my local Gunsmith do all the work- The Bullet Ranch in Pataskala. I had a Rifle Basic adjustable trigger installed which is adjustable from 8oz.- 24oz.

Andriod brings you technologically advanced craftsmanship and extreme style with our first ever touch screen watch!
The bold Galactopus offers an ultra-modern approach to precise timekeeping! A rectangular silver-tone case comes crafted from surgical grade 316L stainless steel. To activate the digital display, simply push the crown surrounded by a crown protector at 3:00. A black ABS thermoplastic case back comes etched with the Android logo.

Beneath a TFT touch screen crystal lens, a digital dial face features an analog and a digital display, both with four color display options to suit your viewing preference. A striking digital tourbillon effect catches your eye above 6:00. The dial includes chronograph functionality to measure elapsed periods of time, a programmable calendar, and an alarm. You can customize the date and time, time zone, a 24-hour clock, dial brightness and language.

Powered by a precision Android AD551 movement, the Galactopus houses a built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery with up to a two-day battery life when fully charged. For your convenience, you can choose to keep the dial display illuminated for up to an hour or opt to take advantage of one of several power-saving modes.

Adding to the contemporary appeal, a black leather strap sports the look of carbon fiber. Fitting up to approximately an 8"" wrist, the strap secures with an Android etched silver-tone buckle clasp. Fast forward to the new look of Android with the fierce Galactopus!

Power saving modes:
When the power saving mode is not activated, the dial will stay illuminated for up to one hour and will need to be recharged after that point.
Setting the power save mode to the 15 second option allows you to view an illuminated dial for 15 seconds after you've pushed the crown; after 15 seconds, the dial will automatically return to sleep mode (power saving mode). You'll need to recharge every 48 hours on the 15 second mode.
Setting the power save mode to the 30 second option offers 30 seconds of dial illumination. You'll need to recharge every 24 to 36 hours on the 30 second mode.
Setting the power save mode to the one minute setting gives you one full minute to view the dial. You'll need to recharge every 24 hours on the one minute mode.
A full charge takes an estimated 1.5 to 2 hours to charge.

Keep extra charging capabilities at the office or while traveling with this additional Android Charger 618-545.

Great reliable plinker. ""Half slide"" reduces the amount of mass needed to cycle when compared to a full slide. Less mass translates to less picky about ammo which is a major concern when considering a 22LR.

I've owned Colt's, Rock River, LWRC and even the Bushmaster polymer (that one was bad). At be Waukesha gun show two years ago I bought the 2nd gen New Frontier complete lower after researching it and watching the videos on the website and reading the reviews. I built it with a Palmetto State Armory upper with the FN cold hammer forged 1/7 barrel, Midwest Industries railed free floated upper. I got the mil-spec BCG from joe bob outfitters and a BCM charging latch. I switched out the five dollar grip and stock with Magpul and added 'Magpul sights.

The first time out we pounded ten magazines through it and had zero issues. Last year it only went out twice and maybe had a few mags through each time. Round count is between 400-700... I'm sorry but I didn't keep a log. 

I have more than the 500 in the upper and parts alone, but I'll add a soft case two magazines and 60 rounds of ammo to get you going.

I'm hoping someone either gets this as a 1st rifle or if you have other ARs that you keep this one as is and shoot it before you switch out the New Frontier Lower. This gun has been accurate and reliable and I'll be happy to show the new owner range photos. I'm only selling because I have a needed home repair and I'm not selling the LWRC...lol.

What would that tell you?

If you're selling a Glock for $600, you're way outta line...period. Your new Glock 19 isn't worth $600, especially when idiots on this site think they can now gouge you for a Glock and then say ""buyer pays transfer fee""...?

 WTF, just go get butt raped at Cabelas and sit and enjoy a burger while you're there.

If any post starts with ""I'm just testing the waters here"" that means the seller/gouger is obviously wanting way more than it's worth, hence the idiot disclaimer.

IO and M&M AK's etc. are not worth $1000 or more, regardless of what kind of cheap Chinese shit you've attached to it, or a $50 red dot. Looks neat, not worth shit.

The post for the new 43 in Eastern Wa where the guy says don't ask for pics, it's cuz he doesn't have one. Mystery solved. It's painfully obvious that people TROLL here for nonsense, painfully obvious, get a fucking life. 

Why would you drive from Seattle to Vancouver to pay top dollar from the guy moving 1911's etc. all the time and says meet at his local FFL. So, drive across state, pay retail for used, still do transfer and fees, waste lot's of extra time and money, all for a PRIVATE SALE ""deal""...pretty sweet.

To the guy selling the Para Expert for $700, it's a $550 gun. Tops. Period. Just because it's a 1911 doesn't make it hi value, it's low end and everyone knows Para's break.

22 ammo sellers, it's not the commodity it was a year ago, they have it every Friday at Big5...Federal Champion 550rd for $37.99 so give it a rest."

I am a CCW holder, and would prefer to sell to the same. Also I will require a bill of sale since the gun was purchased from a dealer by me. Of course a valid AZ ID, non felon, able to own firearms, etc is also required.
Price is $650.00, and I am not looking for trades at this time. If you don't want the laser, looks like they are going on eBay from $100-$150 so you could sell it and have this brand new P938 for $500 roughly. I don't have the time to sell it so I will not seperate at this time.
