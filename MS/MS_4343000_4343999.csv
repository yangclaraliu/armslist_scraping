I called Remington and they verified that this truly is a police issue wepon, not one put together by someone after the fact. The barrel is 18 inches with a bead front sight. The grip is the original bakalite one marked Remington. This weapon is very nice for a 34 year old gun. Thank you for looking at my ad. Dan  email  REDACTED"

Bought this earlier this week actually, but I'm not going to be shooting the gun I was planning on using it with this year, so down the river it does.

Here is Cabelas original description:

""Cabela's ""Bullet Proof"" Two Takedown Shotgun Case

We've updated our popular ""Bullet Proof'' gun cases to provide even more protection for your valuable firearms. The Two Takedown Shotgun Case has new 45° heli-arc welded corners to protect this vulnerable area from dents and dings. Just like the originals, these cases are constructed of virtually indestructible .063"" marine-grade aluminum. Heavy-duty closed-end rivets attach hinges, latches, handles and rigid internal dividers without letting in dust or moisture. They have top-quality, full-length piano hinges, along with plated steel latches and handle, and a stainless steel locking rod system. A weather seal keeps out moisture, and dense, thick urethane foam cradles and protects your firearms and gear. Meets airline requirements. Size 36"" x 14"" x 4-1/2"".""

Internal dimensions are 35"" x 12 7/8""

This rifle has been a safe queen; I bought it new less than a year ago and never fired it. I've moved in another direction with the gun collection, so off it goes. 

The rifle is in absolutely perfect condition. It's been kept in a humidity-controlled safe and babied. I've never oiled it, so it's just like it came from the factory. Included are five magazines (approx $25 value each) and four of them are still sealed from the factory. The original bayonet is also included. The leather scabbard has some interesting graffiti drawn on it, which I'm guessing was done by Serbian soldiers during the 1990s. There is a Metallica logo and a reference to the band Dead Kennedys, along with some Cyrillic writing and a few other things including the words ""fuck off."" Although the rifle is brand new, the bayonet probably saw action in the Balkan conflicts during the 1990s.

In addition to all of the above, I'm including a brand new, never-used Czech military surplus messenger bag. It is a green bag with a rubberized coating to protect against water. It's my understanding that it was originally intended to hold a radio."

The 3-10x44 Tac II is built on a one-inch diameter, matte black anodized, aluminum alloy main tube. Inside that tube are fully multi-coated lenses. The fingertip adjustable, ¼ MOA windage and elevation adjustments offer a whopping 95 MOA range and the mildot reticle always remains centered. Eyepiece focus is of the European fast-focus style. All Mueller Tac II scopes are covered by Mueller's transferable Limited Lifetime Warranty.


It may be something of a trade secret, but the fact is that the 3-10x44 Tac II is produced for Mueller in the same factory that makes the very highly regarded Sightron SIIB Big Sky riflescopes. This accounts for its similarity in many ways to a Sightron Big Sky.

 1″ tube construction with matte black finish to minimize glare 


Included are a set of Kenton Industries Target Turrets calibrated for this Scope and the  .308 Winchester 168 Grain Boat Tail Hollow Point @ 2700 Feet Per Second. Barrel Length spread is 22""- 26"", with 26"" being optimum. These turrets make ranging as simple as clicking up 25 yards at a time once 100 yard zero is achieved. The MilDots are round, and their size is .22 mils, U.S. Army Standard.


This scope was used for a one week FBI Sniper Marksmanship Course. It is near mint condition. No box or paperwork. A manual is available online, but only a MilDot User Tutorial is needed to learn the reticle system.

I love this rifle, but I have decided to down-size.
This is a beauty! I have never seen one like it.
Accurate, Hard Hitting, Versatile- from 45 Long Colt Light Loads to full-house 454 Casull.
Did I mention it is Beautiful? Smooth Action, Fast Target Acquisition.
Effect on target is always a treat! At 100 yards it effortlessly burned through my 1/4"" steel Gong, but was big fun. At 140 yards I up-ended a 200# Hog.
The 20"" barrel gives opportunity for the 454 Casull cartage shine.
Just a great all-around hunting and plinking rifle. That's right, I actually plink with 454.

Down from $700.  I wanted 600, but somehow started thinking700.  Get in now before it's gone!

I am selling my AR Pistol.  This started out as a CMMG AR, but has morphed into something different over time.  I decided I wanted an SBR, so I was going to use my CMMG lower.  To get away with using it now, I put a pistol buffer tube on it, to make it a ""pistol"".  Because I have been traveling in and out of the country, I just haven't sat down to do the form, and get lower engraved.  I was going to get my info engraved under the trigger well, almost invisible when filled in black, but still legal.  To finish the SBR portion, you just need to fill out the BATF paperwork, get the receiver engraved, pay the tax, get the stamp, and put a stock on it.  That’s it.

About the weapon.....  CMMG MK-4 lower.  Aero Precision upper.  Daniel Defense 10.3"" Government issue 5.56 SBR barrel (1:7 twist).  Magpul handguard with light rail (side mounted for thumb activated light (will include for $75 - INFORCE).  It has a modified stock trigger, still 2 stage, but much better break when it fires.  KNS Anti-rotation pins.  Yankee Hill quick takedown pins.  Rainier Arms AXTS charging handle (I will subtract $50 if you want a stock charging handle).  It has a ""knock off"" Noveske Flaming Pig flash thingie.  I will also include 2 Magpul parts kits magazines (will not have floor panels).

I had a SIG SB15 Pistol Brace, but a family member visiting decided that he NEEDED it, so he removed it before he left, and stuck a $50 bill on the pistol tube.  He got a good deal.......   Now, since the BATF said that the brace doesn’t change it from a pistol to an SBR, I have seen many, MANY people shooting ""pistols"" shouldered using the brace.  I would think it would not be comfortable, but functional.

*  I wiped it down with oil before I took the pictures, and I didn’t notice it until I was doing the pictures that not all of the oil was gone.

This rifle is nearly new with only 50rds. on the barrel. I had to steal the scope off of it for another rifle and haven't shot it since. When I shot this rifle it was super accurate and loved 45gr. bullets and lighter. With the 24"" SS barrel it achieves amazing velocities. It would make an excellent coyote/varmint rifle which is what I originally intended to use it for. The rifle comes with the factory hard case and conversion for the bolt release to accept standard .223 rem./5.56 mags. This allows the user to use any .223 upper on this lower. The conversion is simply a little screw and only takes 3min. to perform. The rifle came with one 5 rd. magazine and I have purchased an extra 5 rd. mags for a total of 2 mags. With the extra mag, trigger upgrade, and the rifle I have a little over $2,000.00 invested. My price is fair and I'm motivated to sell. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions at all.

Unlike a lot of cheaper 1911 would say they except all parts but still need a machine shop to massage some parts to fit. This is a excellent 1911 and a great package deal. I'm selling everything that $750.  Call or txt   REDACTED.  Thx for looking

This started out as a CMMG AR, but has morphed into something different over time.  I decided I wanted an SBR, so I was going to use my CMMG lower.  To get away with using it now, I put a pistol buffer tube on it, to make it a ""pistol"".  Becasuse I have been traveling in and out of the country, I just haven't sat down to do the form, and get lower engraved.  I was going to get my info engraved under the trigger well, almost invisible when filled in black, but still leagal.

About the weapon.....  CMMG MK-4 lower.  Aero Precision upper.  Daniel Defense 10.3"" Government issue 5.56 SBR barrel (1:7 twist).  Magpul handguard with light rail (side mounted for thumb activated light (will include for $75 - INFORCE).  It has a modified stock trigger, still 2 stage, but much better break when it fires.  KNS Anti-rotation pins.  Yankee Hill quick takedown pins.  Rainier Arms AXTS charging handle (I will subract $50 if you want a stock charging handle).  It has a ""knock off"" Noveske Flaming Pig flash thingie.  I will also include 2 Magpul parts kits magazines (will not have floor panels).

I had a SIG SB15 Pistol Brace, but a family member visiting decided that he NEEDED it, so he removed it before he left, and stuck a $50 bill on the pistol tube.  He got a good deal.......   Now, since the BATF said that the brace doesnt change it from a pistol to an sbr, I have seen many, MANY people shooting ""pistols"" shouldered using the brace.  I would think it would not be comfortable, but functional.

The reason the round as created was to give piece of mind to the defender that a loved one in the next room would not fall victim to stray lead that did not hit the intended target. 

Remington HD Ultimate Home Defense shotgun ammunition features the same pellet material as the popular Wingmaster HD™ tungsten-bronze hunting ammunition and is offered in two loadings. Consumers can choose from a load of BB’s for the highest terminal energy or a duplex mixture of #2 and #4 pellets for excellent pattern density and outstanding stopping power with a reduced chance of over-penetration. 


Both loads are 12 gauge, 2 ¾-inch with 1 1/4 ounces of shot at 1250 feet per second. At the most commonly encountered home defense distances, Remington HD Ultimate Home Defense produces very tight patterns for one-shot confidence.

The 2 boxes in the center are both Winchester 12 guage, one is super x high brass 7-1/2 lead shot game loads. The second winchester box is a 4 shot 1300fps steel shot game load. 

The other 3 boxes are old and I am really throwing them in for fun. They are both 16 guage and the primers are all in good shape so you can be the judge. If anything they are a cool novelty to have laying around the man cave. 

I am asking just 30.00 and am located in Salem. I am willing to meet halfway. I am also willing to trade for 7.62x39 ammo.

Works great. Pat 880,555-1,062,855. Made in Plymouth Michigan. I've been trying to find the exact date on this gun and I have contacted daisy and sent pics of gun etc and they believe this gun is a 1947. They believe this gun is worth up to$600 depending if it works and condition. They stopped production in 1942 due to the war and started back up in 1946. In the 50s they changed the stock and forearm to plastic. This particular Red Rider has copper bands, wood stock, wood forearm and steel barrel & aluminum painted lever. Dating it to 1947 as well. Plus the wood dates it to 1947 as well. The gun works well and has no mechanical issues. The only flaw I see is that there are 2 cracks on the wood stock. You can see in pics.
