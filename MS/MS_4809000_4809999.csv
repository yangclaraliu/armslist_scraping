I added a bakelite pistol grip but I also have the black plastic grip it came with.  16 1/4"" barrel / 36"" OAL / 26"" with stock folded / 7.8 lbs.

If your trade is worth more than my rifle, please see my other listings.  Maybe we can work out a multi-gun/item trade.  I can meet at the Greeneville Walmart or somewhere convenient for both of us. I will prepare a bill of sale between buyer and seller only.  I'll give you all of my information so please be prepared to identify yourself.  This is for your protection and mine.  I'm as pro-2A as they come, so I'm going to do my part in making sure my weapons don't end up in a felon's hands or at a crime scene.

From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

I am the original owner of this gun and have owned it for about 1.5 years.  It has around 500 rounds through it.  The gun has minimal amounts of wear on it.  I have taken very good care of the gun as I do with all the guns I own.  The gun features the updated version of the sights.  It shoots very well and reliably.  I have only had one issue with the gun.  The issue involved the poor quality factory guide rod.  The guide rod developed a bur on it while firing and the spring got caught on it. This ruined the factory guide rod and guide rod springs.  I have replaced the factory guide rod with a stainless steel guide rod from BT Guide Rods.  The spring is made by Wolff (more on this later).  Nothing else was damaged or even scratched.  I have since shot a good amount of ammo out of the gun with no issues.  The gun functions perfectly fine, but I am selling it because I would like to buy something a little bit larger.  Everything pictured is included, but I will list everything below.  I live in Athens, Ohio, But I am in Columbus frequently.  I am also near Dayton pretty often.  I travel a lot so if you are near these areas feel free to contact me and see if we can work something out.  You must be willing to fill out a bill of sale form even though it is not required by law.  If you have any questions or concerns please ask me.

Made from 1947 to 1969.

Colt decided to rename the Army Special to more reflect the actual buyers of the gun, so the Army Special name was changed to the Official Police.

The 1947 post-war version had a ramped and serrated front sight, a new shaped hammer with grooves, and the new cylinder retention system.



That was just what the gun was, THE official police issue revolver for a great many police departments like the New York City Police, Boston Police, and Federal agencies like the FBI and Treasury Department.

The Official Police would serve as a prime police issue gun into the 1960s, and was highly favored by private guard services, industrial plant guards, and civilian gun owners wanting a powerful and strong revolver."

Created with every aspect of the hunt in mind, the Whitetail Extreme delivers outstanding performance throughout the entire season. A combination of full-grain scrunch leather and 900-denier nylon in the upper offers extreme durability with the lightweight flexibility needed for spot-and-stalk hunting. Inside, a GORE-TEX Scent-Lok membrane locks out moisture and reduces human odor while remaining breathable enough for all-day wear. The 1,200-gram Thinsulate™ Ultra Insulation keeps your feet toasty on those frigid days. An abrasion-resistant heel, toe and side rands deflect the scrapes and cuts of harsh terrain. A new bob rubber cup outsole bites into the ground for sure-footed traction over soft and hard surfaces alike. The removable polyurethane footbed and EVA midsole provide foot-cradling comfort, while the gusseted tongue locks out debris.

Info:
The Springfield Armory® XD® Sub-Compact is an ergonomically designed Semi-Auto Pistol meant for concealed carry use. The ergonomic design of Springfield XD pistols optimizes pointability and shooting control to get you on target quickly and stay on target during rapid fire. XDs have durable polymer frames and a Melonite®-coated forged steel slides. Checkering on the frame provides a solid grip to keep the pistol in place when shooting. A grip safety (similar to a 1911) blocks the weapon from firing unless the safety is depressed, which happens naturally when the pistol is held correctly, but automatically goes ""on safe"" when the shooter's hold is released. An articulated safety lever built into the trigger blade backs up the grip safety. A loaded chamber indicator and striker status indicator give both visual and tactile indication whether the gun is loaded and ready to fire in any lighting condition. 3-dot, steel sights on this semi-automatic pistol provide rapid sight acquisition, and are dovetailed into the slide for easy replacement with after market night sights; and, an integral rail on the frame allows the attachment of aftermarket tactical sights and lights. An ambidextrous magazine release accommodates either hand. The Springfield Armory XD Sub-Compact Semi-Auto Pistol fieldstrips easily without tools for cleaning and maintenance. Comes with 1 flush fit magazine and 1 extended magazine.

There are also many practical uses.

Take for example, you are sitting on your porch relaxing after watching the big game. Suddenly a terrorist shows up, having grown tired of religious freedom and tolerance we have here in 'merica. Worse yet, he is wearing stage 3 body armor. You reckon you could satisfy his curiosity on whether his god exists. You will want to give them the answer that only a 458 socom can provide. If he manages to live (while wearing stage 3 body armor) you just broke every bone in his upper body. 

So after all this wonderful abilities this rifle has, why am i selling it? Because i am not a brave man im afraid. I am ashamed to say i let the commies win. By Commies, of course, i mean my wife. She claims i have too many guns already and dont need one to hunt elephants. I disagree. What if the tide rolls or the eagle goes to war?  I am madly in love with my captor so i will comply. So if you read this far, i hope you at least got a good smirk going on. I know i will once she sees this ad and proceeds to bonk me on the head. Here is a quick list to recap

Pros:

Lower completely interchangeble with standard AR 5.56 uppers. Just swap and go.

5.56 magazines can be used just fine with the 458 socom ammo. Just single stack instead of double. Use metal one magazines peferably as plastic ones tend to jam.

Energy transfer is impressive from this platform. Give a quick peek to Iraqveteran8888 on youtube in regards to this caliber if you would like an idea of its power.

Cons:

Ammo is not readily available on shelf.

Ammo is also about 2 dollars a round.

This is an awesome little .38 special that I came across.. I don't really know it's history and I'm not an expert on guns, but I know that it shoot great! I've only put around 12 bullets thru it so far, but I have no complaints. I was told that it was not shot very much by the last owner and set on a closet for a long time. I do know that it has been reblued. So it looks really new as far as I know. From what I can find on the Colt serial number lookup, it's around 1931, but it just doesn't feel or look that old to me. I can't find any rust or anything that makes it show it's age, but it has been reblued.. I'm guessing that the mother of pearl handles were put on later because there is no Colt symbol on the gun. But the cylinder moves clockwise when shooting, and it has a serial number that I'm able to look up for on the colt site. I really love it, but I don't have any more practical use for it."

This beautiful vintage Remington bearing serial number 04775, stamped with a “ XRR “ date code was manufactured in December of 1946 documented by information published from the Remington factory barrel date coding system. The rifle in our auction photographs was designed as Remington’s top of the line rim fire target rifle. Remington target rifles were very competitive in matches all over the world, and the quality and workmanship in there rifles was unequaled. The over all condition of the rifle in our auction is exceptional; Target rifles were generally used a lot during this time period when shooting was in its prime so to speak. It is seldom to see target rifles from this vintage, that still remain in really nice over-all condition. This particular Remington Model 37 still retains virtually all of the Remington factory applied blued metal finish throughout showing some very light signs of wear from use. The rifle looks almost like new, has a perfect bore, still functions just like new, with a nice firm lock up, and a great trigger pull. This is definitely one of the nicest Rangemaster rifles that we have been privileged to offer for sale here on Gun Broker. Those of you who know your Remington target rifles, will certainly see this as a very nice clean example for its age. The rifle features a 28 inch heavy ""Match Grade Target Barrel"", is chambered for .22 Long rifle rim fire cartridges, and comes complete with one Remington factory original 5 round magazine installed. The factory Remington Walnut wood stock is in excellent condition retaining virtually all of the original factory applied finish. The rifle has a couple very minor handling marks as shown in our auction photographs, however compared to most of this vintage the rifle is in great condition otherwise, and still presents itself beautifully. The rifle has had the barrel stabilized as you can see, this practice was not uncommon with target shooters to increase accuracy on target rifles. This fantastic vintage Remington Model 37 would be a wonderful investment piece, a great addition to any collection, or would also make a great rifle for the range. For those of our viewers a little less know-legible on the Remington Model 37 Rifles they were Remington’s top of the line rim fire target rifle, and were designed and manufactured with the most stringent quality controls to compete with Winchester’s famous Model 52 Target Rifles. The rifle in  auction has the factory original Remington supplied sights. The rear sight was uniquely designed to mount to a Scope base with six index points for eye relief therefore making adjustments as well as complete removal quick and easy as well as precision lockup keeping the sight at zero at all times. The rifle also has a specially developed Remington multi-aperture that allows the shooter one of six different size apertures all in one sight without removing or changing any parts. You simply rotate the desired aperture into position. The front sight is a Redfield globe sight with interchangeable apertures affixed to a special base for quick removal. These sights were specific to the Remington Model 37 Target Rifles, and are nearly impossible to find, since this rifle comes complete with the sights, it is simply a huge bonus! In addition folks, the rifle comes with the original Remington factory supplied scope blocks. What a great package! If the winner of this auction would like to fit this rifle with a fine John Unertl or Lyman Target scope we would be happy to assist, I have contacts that could supply several fine scopes that would fit this rifle at an additional cost. The Winchester Model 52 rifles were better marketed by Winchester, therefore they outsold the Remington Model 37 Rangemaster somewhere around a ratio of 5 to 1 or more, therefore today making these fine Model 37 Remington target rifles highly sought after as collector’s items & investments alike since there were so few produced. Finding an example that still remains in great overall condition like the rifle in our auction is very, very rare indeed. This would be a great addition to any fine Remington or gun collection"

Factory ammo is not hard to acquire and it's an easy round to reload.  I just cerakoted the rifle in the very attractive Burnt Bronze. This is a great rifle for big to dangerous game. This is one of the most efficient magnum cartridges ever as it utilizes about 10% less powder than other comparable magnums for a given velocity/bullet weight. You can load 150's for the small stuff, 160 Barnes TTSX's at 3200fps, or 200gr Noslers at 2800fps.   This rifle has a very low round count and is practically new. It includes a New Weaver Classic K6, and Leupold mounts and rings.  A 3 port muzzle brake makes this rifle very tame considering the cartridge (.308 recoil).  Ammunition available but not included at $800. Included is your choice of 2 new boxes of Winchester 200grXP3 or 60 rounds of reloaded 160gr Barnes TTSX. I can ship to an FFL dealer for around $40 (UPS ground insured)."
