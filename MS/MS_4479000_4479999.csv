I'm going to be honest here, this IS the gun that killed Hitler. As the story goes when Hitler realized that the war was lost he asked his body guard to kill him with the world's greatest weapon. Vague I know, but soon after his body guard showed up with a captured American rifle. 
""What the hell, Fritz!!??"" Hitler was quoted as saying.
""You asked for the greatest weapon ever made to kill you"" and that was all that was said. War ended and the rifle found its way back to America. Don't ask how or the whole story will fall apart. 

The good: rifle is in great shape, functions flawless. Made about May or June of '44

The ugly: does have some mild pitting where the wood meets the metal in a few places. Wood is not USGI

The Bad: the lock bar sight needs to be tapped. It's having a hard time screwing back on.

Normally with this kind of historical providence a rifle like this could go for $10,000, so I'm only asking $9,999.
However because it's the 4th of July soon, I'm only asking $775 WOW!!! It will come with a sling that I think is at least Korean War, stock kit, cleaning tool and multi tool,, and a couple of clips and a big hard case.

Because of its history this rifle is cursed. It can only be sold to the following people. New Mexico residents that are 18 and older, that are legally able to own and posses weapons. I know what a oddly specific cruse.."

THIS GUN HAS BEEN SHOT EXACTLY 80 TIMES.

Everything is in LIKE NEW condition. My only reason for selling: I have been shooting Glocks since I started shooting, and can't break my Glock habits. This P220 is great to carry, and easy to shoot. DA is almost easier to shoot than SA. This is the P220 carry, it takes the normal full size 8 round P220 magazines, but has a shortened slide and barrel. Still shoots like a full size P220 though.

Buyer must be able to legally purchase and own a firearm.

I am asking $700 firm.

I also have a Comp-Tac CTAC IWB holster available for the P220 Carry. These go for about $90, but I can make a package deal.

I'm selling my Waffen Werks built VZ. This was the same company (along with TGI) to build Czechpoint guns before they took operations in house. This gun is built on a D Technik receiver and a D Technik kit. It features the original issue, cold hammer forged chrome lined barrel, and patented push down plate on the carrier. A few very nice features on this rifle, it has the bayonet lug and muzzle brake! Features many of the early builds did not have. Like all VZ rifles, it features a last round bolt hold open and milled receiver. They come in a full pound lighter than a stamped AK! It operates via a short stroke gas piston and fires via striker. It is also done in a finish that is a closer representation of the original. This rifle is and was very innovative for the time, and is considered a gold standard for auto loading simi auto 7.62x39 rifles! As always with used guns, there are light handling marks around the knob on the carrier and a few other spots. The barrel is bright and shiny with very strong rifling. The bonus, it's been fitted with a rare Czech surplus wood kit! Not only that, but I'm including the original bever barf kit as well. The lower handguard on the bever barf has also been fitted with a Chris Stone heat shield. Still not happy, how about both bayonets! Heck why not toss in a side folder as well. It may be original surplus in used condition,  but it's a rare 59 two rivet variation, and works great! Still not satisfied? Fine, how about a side rail that you could mount (needs to be tapped still.) Basically everything pictured, except the bipod, is included in this sale! You get two 922 compliant magazines and a cleaning kit with this rifle. Have questions, please ask! Plenty of pictures to send upon request!"

Not a LE6920. A couple of armslisters have had a problem with me calling it an m4a1 and for that reason I will share that it has an m4a1 roll mark and documentation from colt calling it an m4a1. This rifle was purchased and then I added the same upgrades that I carried in the Navy to have a quality rifle that could take abuse. It comes fitted with a centurion CMR 12"" rail, a vltor imod stock, a bcm gunfighter grip and a knights armament trigger guard. The sights are not pictured but will include the matech rear and Troy front flip. Also all original parts are included and factory box. I am looking to get 1300 cash for the rifle or 1400 in trade. I am very approachable so don't be afraid to shoot a trade offer. I am looking particularly to get a multiple pistol trade, such as HK, sig, glock, FNH  and Springfield. If the pistol does not have that manufacture on the slide please don't respond, not to offend but those are all I will carry. 
I have fired exactly 60 rounds through the rifle as part of a training course and meticulously cleaned it after. 
I did research and have found that this colt rifle will sell for anywhere in the ballpark of 1300-1500 with the socom II set up and that does not include the value of parts I have added. I believe my price is more than fair but if you would like to work something out please text me at REDACTED. Thanks for looking. Happy 4th"

Not trying to be a jerk, but I really don't have the time, or patience, to go back and forth with someone who isn't actually READY TO BUY...If you're ""seriously interested"", then by all means come take a look at it. Don't be ""one of those guys"" who makes offers without even seeing it.

The HIPERTOUCH® 24C is the competition version of high precision fire-control drop-ins for installation in AR-15® and AR-10® type rifles. The HIPERTOUCH® name is short for HIgh PERformance TOUCH, 24 for user adjustable trigger weights and C for competition marksmen like 3-Gunners. It installs and functions just like the HIPERTOUCH® 24 but with half the pre-travel and a faster reset."
