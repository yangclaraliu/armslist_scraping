What's even more noticeable is the worthless trash on this website and others that have immediately begun exploiting this circumstance by offering this ammunition for sale at ridiculous prices.  

What's more amusing, is the level of ignorance that is being spewed by these people about this ammunition and what the ATF is going and not going to do.  Playing on people's emotions and spreading misinformation. 

So, before you fall pray to this trash type seller/exploiter, before you throw your hard earned money away to line their pockets, take a few minutes and finish reading this post, you'll save yourself a great deal of money, but more importantly, you won't get RIPPED OFF...

FACTS:

The ATF is currently reviewing a ban on XM855, however it is also reviewing a ban on 39 other classes of ammunition and has been for years.  Those classes of ammunition have been selling just the same since their own ban review began even years ago.

The last time the ATF was actually successful in banning a class of ammunition was back in 1993.  That ban was for Teflon coated ammunition that was designed to penetrate Kevlar vests.  That type of ammunition was commonly known as ""cop killer"" ammunition. 

The actual ban process on a class of ammunition is not as easy as it sounds.  Often times it takes years and the ATF has an uphill battle in most cases tied up in court by groups and organizations like the NRA fighting them tooth and nail.  So if you want to spend your money wisely, become a member of the NRA or if you're already a member, send them a donation.  They and other organizations like them are the only thing standing between us and government overreach.  

As the current frenzy on this ammunition is subsiding, retailers are beginning to have XM855 available and in stock again.  Examples are Palmetto State Armory and Gander mountain, they have it in stock, Midway and Cabela's expect to have it by the weekend.  They are charging normal prices for it.

In closing, THANK YOU for taking the time to read this post, I hope I've succeeded in preventing you from wasting your money.  As you can see, I have no vested interest in leading or misleading you in any direction, nor am I attempting to sell you anything.  I do ask that if you like this post, send me a quick note.

Nothing wrong w/ a profit, but he is a THIEF AND LIAR.  

All of the listings (10 total, so it's NOT a hobby) are overpriced handguns he has purchased right here on Armslist...the latest example is the Glock 42 at $475 that he bought just under $400.  Likely he will take no less than $450, but fellow A-listers feel free to try for less.  

He claims to be a 'hobbyist' of guns, yet exploits unsuspecting and uneducated sellers with lowball offers, then re-sells them at a significant markup (sometimes the same day).

Again, (probably fake name) Larry Reavis at REDACTED that is PURPOSELY SPELLED instead of written out in numbers.  Claims to not be available after 4 (scam artist with a job equivalent to a parking attendant).

The trigger and spring kit would be valued at 175 with gunsmith time for install and polishing internals. The 2 extra mags are valued at 35-45 ea so 600 seemed fair to me so if you don't like the price then love on but don't flag it being ""way over priced"" which it's not...... Thank you.

This is the very sought after early version with a metal trigger housing and brushed and polished barrel. Receiver is marked Rifle instead of every other model of 10/22 that is marked Carbine. Later versions went to a plastic trigger housing and painted barrel. Gun has a complete Power Custom trigger group (hammer, sear, springs, and shims) with a nice light trigger pull and very positive reset and virtually no pre-travel. Also has a Kidd bolt buffer. The contact areas of the bolt have been polished, the bolt radiused where it contacts the hammer, the action is slick as snot. Also the bolt release has been worked to release via sling shotting the bolt instead of fiddling with the release, the way Ruger should have made them in the first place. Has a Ruger branded 4X scope mounted that gets the job done ok. The rifle has had less than 100 rds through it. Comes with an Allen padded case. Comes with 1 factory 10 rd mag. Looking for $425 for it, these early 22"" versions with the good metal trigger housings and actual polished stainless barrels instead of gray painted are extremely hard to come by. Only trade considered would be a nice full size CZ 75B or Beretta 92fs."

It comes camp wrapped, but the camo can be easily removed if you don't want it. As mentioned, the scope will come with the rifle as well as the mounted bi-pods, sling, carrying case, and 2 boxes of Winchester ballistic tip ammo. If you are interested, you can reach me through here, or you can text me at 910-5 8 one- six six 5 two. Not looking for trade, just straight cash. Will sell for $350 OBO Will include pictures if you request them."

Experience the thrill of rapid fire, shooting from concealment, shooting from a kneeling position, and enjoy the rewarding ""pling"" sound from striking steel targets with Miami Shooting Club!  Our team of NRA certified firearm instructors reserve the private tactical range at Trail Glades Shooting Range so that we can safely practice more realistic shooting scenarios.  With our team of instructors, we're able to maintain about three students per instructor ratio - ensuring a smarter and safer training environment.

If you've never shot before at a tactical range - you don't know what you're missing.  You can spend years at a traditional, stand-in-one-postion, one shot a time, plain paper target, boring range - and the first time you shoot at a tactical range, you'll still be blown away!  Shoot at steel targets like those you see in the TV show ""Top Shot"" - targets like the Dueling Tree, PT Hostage, and other Reactive Targets.  Have you ever emptied your magazine in rapid fire?  You'll do that with our tactical range experience! 

If you need to buy ammunition, eye protection, and/or ear protection, Trail Glades has a store available with a large selection. 

The fee is $39 a month with a one-time $97 registration fee.  For first time members, the registration fee is collected at the range.  For more information, contact us at REDACTED or message us.  You can also check out our website at www.MiamiShootersClub.com"

***I offer no warranty or guarantee with this barrel kit, if you purchase it, you must assume all responsibility for it's use.***
.
.
I am offering, for sale, a KKM, 4 3/8"", G30 barrel, threaded in .578 x 28. And, the chamber has been reamed for .460 Rowland. **Instead of having a proprietary thread pattern, like some .460 barrels, this allows you to use accessories, such as a suppressor, with this barrel. I have fired 45acp, 45 Super and .460 Rowland from the barrel and it is in perfect mechanical condition. With it I am offering a thread protector and a Yankee Hill Machine Co. .45 compensator, which comes with a thread adapter and the comp and it is all stainless steel. Also, I am including a 23# tungsten guide rod assembly from the glockstore.com.

If you would like to use the compensator with a different barrel, then go to yhm.net and browse the options under pistol adapters. There are several versions in 9mm, .40 and .45.

*I highly recommend purchasing Glock 21 magazine springs to install into your Glock 30 magazines to help eliminate misfeeds due to the increased slide speed, if you fire 45 Super or .460 Rowland from this barrel.

If you would like to see this barrel in action, type: ""Glock 29 fires 45 caliber"" in the youtube search line.

 ***I have fired, only, factory made ammunition from this barrel***

The barrel is $230
Custom gunsmithing $150
The thread protector is $15
The YHM adapter is $19.50
The YHM comp is $62.50
The Tungsten RSA is $69.95

 Which is a grand total of $546.95 (not including shipping costs)

The price for this package is FIRM which covers shipping. I will not part out the package as it is just as easy for you to buy the parts from the vendors.

*I know there are two RSA's pictured but I am only selling the 23# RSA.

 *when I have cash in hand I will ship USPS priority with ins. and provide a tracking number for the shipment.

 Who Am I:
 My names Chris. I have done countless Glock Trigger/Slide jobs on my own Glocks as well as many others people Glocks. I also do other weapons including Handguns and Rifles. I am legally allowed to possess a Handgun, I can show you my CCP and Mil ID so you know I'm not a felon. I do not own a shop, I do this as a hobby and to help people with cost. I will however do the same if not better job then you will get at a gunshop for a fraction of the price, you can pay over $100 for a polish job at gunshops! I enjoy gunwork and I do this as a hobby, I have been for many years and I am very familiar with Glocks and many others, just shoot me a message with what gun you have.  Turnaround is 48hrs, however in most cases it is ready for pickup next day, I say 48hrs for a 1 day buffer in case I have something going on with work. Cant beat that! Also I can install what ever custom parts you have purchased on your own. There will be a ""Pre"" and ""Post"" work form to fill out stating what services will be provided and that your giving and taking back possession. A copy will be made for you to keep.
 -------------------------------------------------
 Why Polish Internals?:
 Polishing is like waxing a floor. Less friction equals smoother surface, which in our case equals a physically smoother operating gun and a smoother feel to the user. Glocks come stock with a 5lb trigger pull which in reality is closer to 6lb, sometimes slightly more, due to all the friction from factory coated parts. Polishing will bring it to where it should be with stock parts which is roughly 4.5lbs-5lbs, thus making the trigger pull feel lighter then your used to. I also offer two parts to further reduce trigger pull and enhance smoothness, that when coupled with the polish job will make your Glock operate as smooth as possible and make the trigger pull break like glass every time....Pull the trigger on one of my glocks before you commit and see for yourself!
 -------------------------------------------------
 What I offer:
 I will completely disassemble the gun(slide and frame), clean the entire gun(bore at your request), polish all friction prone internals, oil and reassemble. Can also polish Barrel Feed Ramp at your request with no additional Fee.
 Price $25

 I will Remove the Factory 5lb Connector and replace it with a POLISHED 3.5lb connector. This reduces the trigger pull to roughly 3lbs-3.5lbs.
 Price $15

 I will Remove the Factory 5lb Trigger Spring and Replace it with a 6lb Trigger Spring. Why heavier here? The Trigger Spring actually assists the Trigger in Pull/Reset, a Heavier one will make for a Smoother pull and Smoother Reset.
 Price $5

 I will refinish your scratched/worn barrel by slightly sanding, degreasing and applying an even coat of Black DuraCoat DuraBake which is a heat treated form of Duracoat making it hard as nails once its heated.
 $15

For any custom parts you would like installed, please let me know and I will give you a quote. I can install parts you bought or I can order them for you at a discounted rate and save you some money.

This was one of those that were imported in the 90's as unissued rifles.  This one has a  very low round count and has a great finish on it.  The serial number puts it at a 1963 production.  This one has the milled trigger group which is much more durable and desirable than the newer stamped ones as well as a milled receiver and screwed in barrel.  These early production SKS rifles were by far superior in quality.  The barrel is chrome lined and a synthetic stock has been installed.

SKS's of this quality and this clean have become hard to come by.  Like I said earlier, this was one of those new unissued guns.  It was bought, taken to the range a few times, and put away in a safe only coming out to play once in a while.

Here is another site explaining the gun

http://www.guns.com/2013/09/25/remington-2020-smart-scopes-masses/

In short, this rifle uses a digital optics system that allows the user to tag a target and the scope will range it itself, adjust for elevation and tell you the windage so you can adjust that with the buttons on top. Remington claims this rifle can shoot out to 500 yards without a problem and can accurately range out to 750. This system also can hit a target that is running up to 10 miles an hour. The other revolutionary thing with this package is the ability to stream what you see through the scope onto an iPad or iPhone which will alow you or others to see the shot. The scope will also take pictures and record audio and visual of your shot to save for replay. I am selling eveything as a package how it originally came from Remington: The Remington 700 in 30-06 with the trackingpoint scope and the extra batteries and charger inside the custom fit case from Remington. It also came with 300 rounds, 100 of 168 grain, 100 180 grain and 100 rounds of 168 grain Barnes Vor-tx.
