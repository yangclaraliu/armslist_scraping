The Eotech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sight was developed after extensive testing of various optical sights, and US Special Operations Command has standardized on the Eotech Holographic Weapon Sight as its 1X weapon optic for close quarter and urban combat zones. To meet the stringent requirements set and demanded by our elite fighting forces, EOTech has developed the EOTech Holo Sight M 553, modeled after the ever popular, battle proven Eotech HWS design. The EOTech M553 Holo Sight incorporates many additional features required within the SOPMOD Block 2 program. The advantage of EOTech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sights is its holographic reticle patterns that are instantly visible in any light condition, instinctive to center regardless of shooting angle and always remain in view to achieve lightning quick reticle to target acquisition without covering or obscuring the point of aim. The magic of EOTech Holographic 553 Weapon Sights is the edge they provide to you in close quarter or urban combat zones. The EOTech Holographic M553 Weapon Sight will remain fully operational even when the laminated window is obstructed by mud, snow, rain, or even damaged/shattered, as long as you can see through any portion of the laminated window, the entire reticle pattern will be visible on target with point of aim/impact being maintained and fully functional

Here's you go. It's in perfect mechanical shape, bore is a mirror, stock is solid with not splits or cracks at all. This rifle handles just like a scaled up Ruger 10/22. Recoil is pleasant. I'll be honest, if you want an inch grouping at 500 yards, this is not the rifle for you. But it will easily provide 5 inch groups at 300, and for a hunting rifle in western washington(especially a light, quick handling, semiauto) it's about as perfect as you're going to get. Scope it or not, the open sights allow for a pretty fine bead. Questions are welcome, part trades will be considered on a case by case basis. I'm available to meet up just about anytime, my schedule's pretty open."

I bought it for myself as a birthday present but due to a new job and being a full time college student I do not have the finances nor the time to shoot this rifle. I have taken this rifle out to the range twice. Shot the rifle about 250 rounds. Absolutely zero problems starting from round one. 

The rifle is piston driven, this keeps the action very clean and cool. The plated bolt and carrier group make it for a very easy clean up. Because I do not have a lot of money I value my belongings. This means that I took very good care of my rifle. 

The rifle comes with the following:

 I have not calculated shipping, but it would be expensive with all the bullets! Gun is also 54"" overall length. Local pick-up preferred. All shipping would be extra.

The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.

Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.

The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.

A self-defense handgun does no good if it is miles away when you need it. The PPS is a concealed carry firearm that is slim, light and comfortable to wear all day long. Yet it is fast to bring into action, pleasant to fire and easy to shoot accurately. With Walther, performance comes in small packages.

1. The first one is an SGL-21 chambered in 7.62x39, it is NIB and unfired, it comes with real Russian brown laminate furniture and Krebs rear peep sight. Includes box. Asking $1200

2. Milled Arsenal SLR-101, originally a ban-configuration that someone did a poor job of restoring. This is a fully functional gun still but it's a bit ugly, been painted over a few times (I believe it has black Rustoleum on it now) and the threads on the muzzle arn't slightly off-kilter (but are still functional) I put a nice set of laminate furniture on it from RTG parts. Asking $850

3. Also have a PTR-32 KFR Gen II rifle length gun that takes AK magazines.. This is the new build that is more reliable with different types of magazines compared to the first gen.. Asking 900 for factory configuration.. I have some furniture and stock options though if interested.

I'm getting out of the AK game, I have plenty of ammo and magazines that can be purchased along with them if interested, however I don't have them inventoried yet.

•	Three original 16 Round Magazines
•	One extra factory 16 Round Magazine ($29)
•	Trijicon HD Night Sights ($159 aftermarket and considered the best night sights made)
•	Blackhawk Serpa Holster ($50 New). I will throw this in for free.

I also have a few extra items specific to this pistol if you are interested. They do not come with the price listed on the ad but are extra if you are interested. I have:
•	New in Box Factory Magazine with Aluminum 25 Round Pistol Gear Mag Extension ($80 New will sell for $65 additional)
•	Safariland Level 2 ALS Light Compatible with the Streamlight TLR-1 and TLR-2 ($90 New will sell for $60 additional)

This gun is in great condition with a super smooth action and trigger. This pistol with standard three dot sights currently sells for $550-$600 just about anywhere you go. I am asking the listed price for the Pistol with Trijicon HD Night Sights, the XD Gear Case, an extra magazine and the Blackhawk Serpa Holster. I have a little bit of Speer Lawman Ammo left over so if the price is not right I’m sure we can work something out with that.

This pistol is super accurate. The last test I ran with Speer Lawman ammo put all 15 rounds from one magazine into one ragged 1.2” hole at 15 yards with just the mag base resting on a sandbag. I am willing to meet at any range you want so you can see the pistol, shoot it, see how accurate it is yourself and know that you are getting a deal (I will even provide the ammo). 

I will only sell this gun to someone who has a valid CCW permit and NC License. If you do not have that then I will be fine with an FFL transfer at a gun store. Most only charge $20 for this and those are the only two options I am willing to do. I will not compromise on that so please don’t ask. If you are interested, I travel for a living across most of NC so if you want to meet and take a look at it please let me know and I’m sure we can work something out. Thanks for looking."

Columbia River 6772 CRKT 6772 Crawford/Kasper Plain Edge Knife

This knife is in near mint condition. It has never been carried or used. The edge has been polished razor sharp.

This feature packed tactical knife, designed by writer and knife use instructor Bob Kasper and knifemaker Pat Crawford, is a serious self-defense folder built to satisfy under the most serious situations. Thick stainless liners covered with black Zytel® scales give this knife a very hefty feel. A thumb scallop on each side leads to the thumb stud for easier opening and more secure grip. An integral part of this tactical folder is the patented Lake & Walker Safety (LAWKS). Located at the top front of the knife, the LAWKS mechanism insures that the blade will remain locked under heavy cross stress. The lock is a Walker-Lock secured by the LAWKS safety.

While using this knife you will discover that your fingers are raised above the blade and away from the surface, and the index finger groove keeps it from slipping down to the blade. Friction grooves on the top of the handle and on the liner lock provide a more secure grip especially under wet conditions.

The blade is a modified clip point of 420J2 stainless steel at 54-56 Rc., double hollow ground and finished with a fine bead blast. Opening is smooth and effortless on its Teflon® bearings. A black Teflon® coated pocket clip holds the knife unobtrusively at the top of your pocket. This knife is about as macho as it gets!

When plate armor started to become more common, edged weapons became less effective. As a result many types of piercing or concussive weapons were developed including the war hammer. With a hammer head on one side and an armor piercing spike on the other it was equally useful against mail and plate alike. This war hammer was used by foot soldiers and could crush or pierce virtually all armor on the field. If I fought against knights with armor this would have been my main weapon of choice.

Old Smoke is a retired hand carried many years on an Arizona ranch as a working sidearm. Definitely a cowboy gun. I have owned this neat old piece for several years and am simply downsizing my collection. I have a Super Blackhawk 3-screw and that's enough.
This Ruger .44-magnum Blackhawk was manufactured in 1962 and has the 6-1/2"" barrel of that time. It's the Blackhawk designation since the Super Blackhawk was not yet in existence. It wears an earned patina finish, I've never been able to bring myself to send it off to Ruger to re-blue for several reasons. 
First, once it's done, it's done
My other reason is, this fine revolver came by the patina finish with age and regular carry. Besides, Uberti charges extra money for their ""Antique"" washed finish. A re-blue should be decided by the next owner.
I have never came across an old Three Screw with this kind of seasoned wear without seeing pitting or worse. There is no pitting on this revolver. 
The timing is excellent with only the faintest turn ring on the cylinder, a testament to Ruger's fine craftsmanship of the day. 
Lock-up it strong and tight with no cylinder play.
Bore and cylinders are in fine shape with plenty of lands and grooves. It's obvious that it was worn in a holster but must have been wiped down regularly 
Certainly not worn out from shooting. I have no way of knowing how many rounds have been fired through it, but I've never seen one worn out from shooting. 
Included is the old vintage Hunter holster Old Smoke rode in for decades. This revolver also has a set of vintage Jay Scott faux stag grips of the period. There is no box or original grips. It shoots true and will get the job done every time.
Price: $690.00 
Type of Payment: United States Post Office Money Order. However, If the buyer calls me, I may accept a personal check with an agreed upon understanding that the revolver will not be shipped until the buyers check has cleared my bank. That can take up to ten-days.
Shipping: $20.00

I would keep this for myself, but I would prefer a DB9, LC9, or Snub 38 instead.  This will come with the gun, two mag floor plates, factory lock and keys, factory box, and factory paperwork. I can add ammo or cash on certain trades, and would hope you could as well if needed. Need to be able to meet up in Norman on this if possible. 
	Shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Would also trade for a tokarev pistol and extras/cash, PF9, DB9 and extras, a 38 revolver (preferably snub, but open to others as well). Would also do partial trades on various guns and items and even for 357 magnum brass, H110 powder, Accurate No. 5 powder. Just shoot me a message and we can go from there.

	Hey all, 
	I know its a long shot, but after loading up quite a few 38s and 357 mags this last weekend (gotta love the rainy weather!) I noticed i am down to less than 1 lb of both H110 and Accurate No. 5 powders. Ive found it in a couple places online, but would prefer to buy local (still sealed obviously) if possible. Both because the Hazmat fee kicks ya pretty good, and because i would rather buy some powder local if you have at one time bought some you didn’t still need, or bought a bunch at the height of the scare and have some you don’t “have to” have on hand. 
	If you have either of these, shoot me a message on here or a text message at REDACTED and we can go from there. I do have a few random trade items, but could just as easily do cash. I am mainly looking for 1 lb bottles, namely because 8 lbs of No. 5 would last indefinitely for generations as little as the 38 load takes haha. I am local to norman and would like to stay around norman close if i can just so gas doesn’t kick us both.

1,000 obo. cash.  No tax, shipping or FFL fees.

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, so I will be pretty picky on trades, basically, the deal will have to make sense.  If offering a trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  Below are items I will consider.  I already have several firearms in the platforms and calibers listed below along with plenty of ammunition for all, but again, I may trade if the deal makes sense on my end, otherwise I will wait for cash.

Would not mind another quality 16""-18"" AR 5.56 upper, ideally a 1/8 twist, but will consider 1/7 or 1/9, medium fluted barrel(will consider others) with quality rail and BCG.  Going for best possible accuracy while keeping overall weight down.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants.  

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP(HK, Beretta, XDM 5.25"", maybe the 4.5"", depending) maybe .357 Sig or 10mm, but may consider other models and calibers, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag., maybe others.

Purchased this stock kit for a build I'm working on but before it arrived I found a different kit I liked better.  As it is this kit is brand new and unused and ready to be installed. Comes with the buffer tube, spring, buffer, castle nut, and a mil spec carbine stock. Buffer tube is mil spec in dimension and the positions are laser engraved so you can see what position your stock is in by just looking at it.  Great choice if you're working on a build right now and it will screw into any lower receiver with standard threads.

I have no use for it so I'd like to sell it for $45, just looking to get what I have in it back out.  Would also consider trades for AR mags, optics of some kind, or a rear sight.

Smith & Wesson® M&P Shield™ Semiautomatic Pistols



• Compact, lightweight pistol ideal for concealed carry
• Less than 1"" thick and 6"" overall length
• Packed with M&P features for superior performance and reliability
• Two magazines included

Smith & Wesson’s M&P pistols are the handguns of choice for many law-enforcement units, and for good reason. Rugged reliability and accuracy combine with solid construction make the M&P line stand out in a highly competitive field. Now Smith & Wesson offers the lightest, slimmest and most compact semiautomatic in the M&P family – the Shield. Less than 1"" thick, 6"" overall length and weighing just 19 oz., the Shield is perfect for concealed carry or a law-enforcement backup gun. Striker fired with a low bore axis and an 18° grip angle, the Shield delivers a natural sight picture and points instinctively. The consistent trigger pull and short trigger reset enhance accuracy and make for fast follow-up shots. Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W with a 3.1"" barrel, accuracy is outstanding for a compact semiautomatic. Maintenance is easy with the patented M&P No Tool Takedown System. Steel recoil-spring rod adds durability and the captured spring speeds the takedown and cleaning process. The Shield comes with two magazines, a six- or seven-round version that fits flush with the base of the grip and an seven- or eight-round version with an extended finger rest.

It is a hard to find ""Super 16"" (see pictures), most 223 Contender barrels are ""Super 14"" and this one includes the iron sights. The bore is immaculate. This barrel also has the muzzle threaded 1/2-28 for a silencer or flash hider or muzzle brake. The barrel was threaded concentric to the bore using the single point method on a lathe, NOT threaded using a die. This ensures the threads are perfectly concentric to the bore and 100% safe with a silencer. I have tested it with my silencer and it works perfectly. Because it is a single shot it will also make the 223 as quiet as it could possibly be. The factory front sight was moved back to accommodate the threaded muzzle. An 11 degree target crown was added to ensure the barrel is very accurate, both with and without a silencer. It will include the Weaver scope mount that was on it when I bought the barrel. The iron sights are the finger adjustable type so no tools are needed to make adjustments. The barrel also has the very desirable dual locking lugs which ensures a tight lockup as well as being extremely easy to open. The dimple in the threads is from the old front sight screw hole and does not affect the barrel, threads or function at all. It includes a rifle forearm in walnut and the two screws to attach it to the barrel.

 This is an amazing deal because the ""Super 16"" barrels are getting extremely hard to find, especially the 223 with iron sights, and when you do expect to pay $250+. The cost of threading will cost $75+ not including shipping and to move the factory sights back expect to pay another $50. The scope mount is another $20. Most places charge ~$50 to put an 11 degree target crown on a barrel.

 And because it is chambered in 223 it is extremely cheap to shoot. And because it is 16"" you can add a folding stock for the ultimate survival rig. With a Choate folding stock the gun will be 21"" folded making for a great backpack or survival gun.

 I am so confident in this price that if you can find this setup cheaper PM me the links and I will match that price.

 Price for barrel is $325 shipped. I can take PayPal or postal money order, no personal or bank checks. Will take AK and Glock magazines or accessories. Not interested in any Contender or Encore trades.

 I am selling because I am getting out of 223/5.56 because I rarely shoot the caliber any more.

 I welcome any questions you might have."

Hands down, the most commonly used phrase we hear from tactical end users is “smaller, lighter, faster” when describing the perfect optic.

SunGuard ARDs are designed to mount to a scope by fitting inside a Butler Creek Flip-Open or Quake Bushwacker scope caps.
