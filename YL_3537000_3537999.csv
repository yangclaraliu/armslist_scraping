It's hardly gotten any use so it ends up just sitting in a case. The mid-length gas system paired with the Battlecomp 1.0 really make for a very recoil friendly rifle. It was built to be very lightweight (w/ the Vtac rail) while still being a very accurate shooter (been shot out to 600m). There are some very, very minor cosmetic marks on the receivers and rail but nothing major. Here is the parts list with prices:

I hate to do it, but for sale is my Polish TTC with 342 rounds of ammo, two magazines, pouch holster, cleaning tool, and owner's manual (a little dirty).  It has a stainless barrel, last-round hold-open, external hammer, and 8-round capacity magazines.  This semi-automatic SAO pistol has fantastic accuracy and shoots extremely reliably.  The 7.62x25 round is really hot!  At about 1,600 fps, it's close to rifle speed.  Check out YouTube for videos of it going through various types of armor.

I have torn this pistol down and found all matching serial numbers, unless something is marked that I'm not aware of.  It's in good condition, showing some wear, and a tiny spot of rust on the side as can be seen in the second picture.

In my research, this appears to be one of the most solidly-built TT-33 style guns.  I believe this one is completely fine to be dry-fired.  This gun is not designed to be carried with a round in the chamber, as it is not drop-safe.  For this reason, many people choose to remove the safety lever that was added for import purposes.  The internal design is simple and reliable.  I really enjoyed shooting this gun, and I know you will too.

I'm asking $399 [Edit: $339!] due to the completeness of the set and the amount of ammo.  I'm selling, because I have some home repair costs to pay for, but I might be able to swing some trades.  Whatever you have in mind, please offer.  Thanks again for looking!

(Note: I don't understand why, but I can't select 7.62x25 caliber, single-action, and pistol for this listing.  The ArmsList system seems to reject that combination.  Anyway, obviously that's what this is.)

You can also reach me by text at 1-REDACTED.  Thanks!

By the way, so far three people have contacted me to ask if this is still for sale.  I'll deactivate the listing once it's sold.  I am worried that my email replies might be ending up in spam filters or something.  Please, feel free to TEXT me at 1-REDACTED (I don't take phone calls on this phone for various official business reasons, sorry) and if you tried to contact me but didn't get a response, it's perfectly fine to try contacting me again so that I know that my reply didn't reach you.  In fact, if you want, you can send me your cell number using the contact form, and I'll reply to you by text or by call.  (-:"

This versatile spherical rifle propellant incorporates in its formula CFE, Copper Fouling Eraser. This ingredient, originally used in military propellant, greatly deters copper fouling. It contributes to longer periods of top accuracy with less barrel cleaning time. Being a spherical powder, metering is superbly accurate. CFE 223 yields top velocities in many cartridges such as the 204 Ruger, 223 Remington/5.56mm NATO, 22-250 Remington and the 308 Winchester/7.62mm NATO, plus many, many more.

Henry H006M Big Boy .357 Mag Lever-Action Rifle, 20″ Octagon Barrel, Walnut Stock

The Henry Repeating Arms Big Boy .357 Magnum lever action rifle is a great choice for Cowboy Action SASS approved rifle. The Big Boy incorporates a top brass receiver, 20″ octagonal barrel, American Walnut stock, and 10 round magazine tube.

The adventure and romance of America’s Old West are imbedded in its distinctive 20-inch octagon barrel, straight-grip American walnut stock with brass buttplate and brass barrel band. The solid top brass receiver features side ejection. The overall length is 38½ inches and weighs in at 8.68 lbs.

A nice 19th century touch is the use of a fully adjustable Marble semi-buckhorn rear sight with white diamond insert and brass beaded front sight. The Big Boys have the smoothest actions of any centerfire lever action rifles on the market today. They work beautifully to give you competition shooters a leg up in any event you take part in.

2460 is a fast burning, double-base spherical rifle powder created as a slower version of our popular Accurate 2230 propellant. Its slower burn rate allows for higher load densities in popular cartridges like the 223 Rem and 308 Win. Easy metering characteristics and a burn rate optimized for gas-operated rifles make 2460 a great choice for high volume, progressive loaders."

At 5"" tall with a barrel length of just under 4"", the Compact model shaves a little more than 3/4"" off the length and about 1/2"" off the height of the full-size CZ 75. Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. There is a safety stop on the hammer as well as a firing pin block safety. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line. We buy guns and layaway is available! Sorry, no trades and all state and local laws apply. We are an FFL dealer so you must be able to pass a background check. 3% credit card fee. We can also ship this gun to other FFLs if needed."

This is a pre-crossbolt safety model. It is in very good condition. The wood to metal fit is perfect. The bluing is deep and shows very few minor flaws, same as the wood (let's see you go 36 years without any imperfections). Even the screws and high wear areas look great.

It currently has a fixed power 4x32 scope installed with a set of see-through rings so you can still use the iron sights. I will also include a set of brand new receiver plug/screws if you want to take the scope off.

Also included is a partial box (40 of 50) of PPU 240 grain JHP moving at a blistering 1,542 fps. That puts this round on par with Buffalo Bore's Deer Grenade offering. The once spent brass is also included for the reloader.
