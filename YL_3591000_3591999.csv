I bought this from a friend who wanted to get into long range shooting and after not too long, decided it was not his game.  He shot 250 rounds through it, I shot 8 rounds through it with factory Hornady 139gr interlock, hunting ammo. I was able to shoot a 2"" 5 shot group at 200 yds with that hunting ammo shooting prone, from the included bipod and a rear squeeze bag.  With good hand loads it should do even better than that.  The base rifle is a model 700 Long range, barrel is a 26"" varmint contour 1 in 9.25 twist.  The factory stock was removed and the barreled action was dropped into a KRG whiskey 3 chassis.  Chassis is Aluminum with composite grip panels.  Has adjustable cheek rest both fore and aft, and vertically, and has adjustable LOP, and vertical adjustment of the butt plate.  The chassis also has built in QD sling mounts as well as a multitude of attachment points for picatinny rails on the fore end.  Uses AICS long actions magazines (none included).  I will include the bipod (appears to be a blackhawk), and I will ship the rifle in a fitted Plano tactical hard case.  The only thing I can find wrong with the whole gun is that the small screw in the face of the trigger seems to be missing.  I don't think this will affect safety or function of the trigger at all.  The only reason I am selling it is because I have no need for a 7mm Rem Mag, and I don't want to use a long action for my next project.  NOTE: The trigger in this rifle is an X-Mark Pro trigger, under Remington's Voluntary Recall.  It has not been sent in to be cleaned by Remington.  I recommend either replacing the trigger with an aftermarket, or sending the barreled action into Remington to be fixed under the recall.  The buyer of this rifle acknowledges this and assumes all responsibility for the trigger once received.

Rifle complete- $1300+ 75 for shipping
I will part out if I get a buyer for both the barreled action and the chassis.  Prices Separate will be:
Whiskey 3 chassis + the Plano case - $900 + $30 shipping
Barreled action - $550+ $30 shipped

Because the .22LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time, it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue, .22 silencers must be disassembled for cleaning and regular maintenance. Until SilencerCo introduced the 22Sparrow, the only .22 silencers that could be disassembled for cleaning required a cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds. However, often the components of those silencers would be fused together and unable to come apart. Competitor products on the market have baffles in their .22 silencers that must be removed by twisting the outer tube around the baffles and/or sliding the outer tube off of the baffles. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the outer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the outer tube, there is simply too much buildup of fouling and lead to remove the outer tube in that manner. 22 Sparrow Caliber: .22 LR .17 HMR .22 MAG .22 WMR 5.7x28 FN WEIGHT: 6.5 OZ DIAMETER: 1.062"" LENGTH: 5.08"" FINISH: Black Oxide MATERIALS: Alloy Steel Heat Treated 17-4 PH Stainless Steel Mount: 1/2x28 Threads FEATURES: User Serviceable Multi Part Containment Technology Full Auto Rated on .22 LR O-Ring engagement to keep barrel threads clean and the silencer securely mounted Serialized outer tube is protected Stainless Steel is Chemical and Solvent Resistant Life Warranty"

Aimpoint PRO 
A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. 
The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints. 
Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic 
• Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. No need to fumble with switches prior to use. 
• 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances. 
• In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking and maintenance easy.

$13 each or 6 for $75.

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.

In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents. Though similar to the other rifles of this style in appearance, the VZ58 uses a completely different bolt and fire control system. Even with a machined receiver, the VZ2008 is lighter than most similarly styled firearms with a sheet metal receiver.

Featuring a short reach from the backstrap to the trigger, the SR9 creates a comfort level that will challenge any standard-sized, striker-fired pistol available today. The structurally rigid, recoil-reducing, glass-filled nylon frame and alloy or stainless steel slide combine to create a low-maintenance, rugged and reliable handgun.

Extended Ejector Rod

   Ribber Grip 
Exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions. 

   Taurus Security System (TSS)
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. 

   Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear. 

   Fiber Optic Sight
Light gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic"

Kershaw Steven Seagal Limited Edition Knife

Kershaw’s “Steven Seagal” knife is a big, handsome knife specifically created to fit Mr. Seagal’s hand. The blade features his signature in English on one side and in Japanese characters on the other. The knife handle includes a genuine stingray leather insert. Because of its beauty and durability, stingray leather has been used for centuries to enhance a wide array of products. It is most well known, however, for its use on Japanese sword handles. This is the tradition Seagal had in mind when specified stingray leather for the handle of the knife that bears his name. In addition, the uniquely textured stingray leather provides a one-of-a-kind look and feel-plus additional gripping power. This high style, high performance folding knife combines some of Ken Onion’s signature design features along with the size, looks, and function Seagal demanded. The Steven Seagal knife also features a high-quality AUS8A stainless steel blade with a Rockwell hardness rating of 55-57. Naturally, the blade is honed to Kershaw’s famous, incredibly sharp edge. The anodized aluminum handle is built to be both strong and lightweight, while the stingray leather insert provides a singular look. The handle also includes a removable or reversible pocket clip.

Item Description:
This is a brand new in box LWRC M6A2 AR-15 with 16"" barrel. The M6A2 rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI carbine systems feature their short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of LWRCI's rifles, the bolt carrier group of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. The 16"" barrel is Cold Hammer Forged and NiCorr treated with a 1:7"" twist rate. The barrel is treated with a NiCorr surface conversion process. This rifle has a 12"" lightweight sculpted quad rail handguard derived from LWRC's REPR platform. This rifle features LWRC's enhanced fire control group and both it and the bolt carrier group are coated with a proprietary nickel coating for permanent lubricity.

Includes everything seen in pictures. Three mags, holster, manuals, lock, etc.

The holster is well used, I carried this pistol as my CCW. The holter has a notch cut into it for the mag release, as otherwise the mag release was pressed when sitting against a hard-back chair. The mag release is not loose, the leather holster was just not designed well in that aspect. Otherwise the holster is excellent and very durable.

With its construction of ultra high performance and tough Stainless Steel, the Spectre II allows weapon fire to go virtually unnoticed.

It is not only super tough, but also one of the quietest .22 suppressors known to man. With the Spectre II, users will also enjoy its multi-caliber versatility.

The Spectre II has a unique CTA baffle design for easy disassembly and is user serviceable, which is very important for any .22 lr silencer. Because the .22 lr round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy an ineffective. To avoid this issue .22 silencers must be able to be disassembled for cleaning regularly maintained. Most .22 silencers on the market can be disassembled for cleaning, however they require cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds or often times they will fuse together and they are unable to come apart. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the silencer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the tube, there is simply too much build up of fouling and lead to remove the tube from most .22 lr silencers on the market. The Spectre II has the unique CTA baffle design that keeps the carbon and lead debris from reaching the silencer tube allowing it to be disassembled easily.

""Of course, you get more than just a heavy receiver with Arsenal. It’s a whole pile of tweaks and upgrades. It comes with all new everything, naturally, including a correct rear sight leaf, U.S. made furniture featuring a mid-length 10-inch buttstock (this is between NATO and Warsaw Pact lengths, giving it a 13.4-inch length of pull) with a trapdoor for a cleaning kit, a full-length cleaning rod, and a hard-crome-plated Bulgarian barrel made using Steyr manufacturing techniques. The barrel is finished with a 14x1mm left-hand threaded 4-port muzzle brake.

The Warlock II was created for maximum sound suppression in a lightweight aluminum package. The Warlock II has minimal first round pop for optimal discretion. From varmint hunting to plinking, this .22 suppressor will ensure quiet success.

The Warlock II has unique CTA baffle design for easy disassembly and user serviceability, which is very important for any .22 lr silencer. Because the .22 lr round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time it is possible for  a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue they must be disassembled for cleaning and regularly maintained. Most .22 silencers on the market can be disassembled for cleaning, however they require cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds or often times they will fuse together and they are unable to come apart. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the silencer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the tube, there is simply too much build up of fouling and lead to remove the tube from most .22 lr silencers on the market. The Warlock II has the unique CTA baffle design that keeps the carbon and lead debris from reaching the silencer tube allowing it to be disassembled easily.

Hey all,
So I just picked up a little lot of this 25 acp ammo yesterday and was just planning on shooting it or sticking it in the ammo can. However, i noticed that a few of these are really old boxes and actually still have the ammo inside (only one of them isn’t full and it has rounds in it as well. So, Being as i am not a collector of the older boxes, I would rather get them to someone who does want them for their history rather than they “bang” effect. So I am offering these up for trade for 25 auto ammo. That being said, I will not trade for aluminum cased ammo unless it is a little better in my favor. I would also trade for jhp 25 ammo. I do not have a brand preference per se, but i just want them to be “newer” and in good condition (IE I’m not going to trade for your old corroded coffee can ammo). This is for pickup in Norman only. These all are pre “keep out of reach of children” as well
Here is what I have and their quantity of bullets contained inside. Please refer to pictures for the designs and appearances of the boxes:
2- 50 round boxes of Remington Dupont ""Kleanbore Priming"" 25 auto, both boxes are full and the ammo still looks great and shiny
1- 50 round box of Winchester “OilProof” 25 auto, box is full and ammo looks good
2- 25 round boxes of Geco “OilProof” 25 auto all are shiny and look good (the whole box looks to be in german, so i can’t tell the specific type)
1- 8rd box of Peters Dupont “Rustless” 25 auto, cartridges are “dingy” in appearance but not overly corroded. (wanting to trade this one for a full box of 25, given its greater ago)
To arrange a meet up shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

This rifle is a factory SBR and these are pretty hard to come by. This rifle has about 300 rounds through it, but it is in outstanding condition as you can see below. No personal information has been engraved onto this rifle due to the fake can/barrel extension that was attached in lieu of filing for a tax stamp. The barrel extension was cleanly pinned and welded over per ATF requirements. With the right tools, the extension can be easily removed with little evidence that it was ever pinned. Once the extension is removed, no additional gas work will be needed since this was a factory SBR. Let me repeat that... no additional gas work is needed. This rifle is properly gassed for the 8” Krinkov barrel. It runs flawlessly (with or without the extension). Mag lock-up is excellent with little to no movement.

Let me elaborate on the SBR status of this rifle since some of you may not know much about the process. This rifle is NOT currently a SBR and has been removed from the NFA registry since the extension was pinned. This is a legal-length rifle that will ship to your FFL and you can take possession of it immediately. You can then file for your tax stamp and remove the extension once you have your approval paperwork. Lastly, since I have receive quite a few questions on this - this IS a factory SBR. It came as a SBR from K-Var. It was not chopped after being purchased. That is why no gas work was or will be needed.

If I recall correctly, these were right around $2,300 new. Given how scarce these are, I feel that my price is more than fair and I have seen these go for a lot more.  Included, but not pictured are the cleaning kit and oil bottle that came with the rifle. The original box is MIA. The rifle will ship with one US-made polymer mag. You can also see this rifle, where I have it listed on GunBroker.  Feel free to check my feedback.  This rifle will not disappoint.  

Add $40 to my asking price to cover shipping and insurance.  

Lastly, we all know that Armslist is full of scams.  That is no secret.  If you get in contact with me, I will be more than happy to provide more photos.  I will also have no problem shipping through my FFL (add $30 for that) if that will make you more comfortable.  A FTF transaction in PA is also GTG as long as you are a PA resident, willing to fill out a bill of sale and provide identification."
