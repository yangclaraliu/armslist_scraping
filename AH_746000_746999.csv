This functions flawlessly. I have put in the neighborhood of 500 rounds through it, without a single FTF or FTE. With good ammo, using the scope, it is capable of 1.5 inch groups at 100 yards. Price is fairly firm with perhaps a little wiggle room. These are no longer for sale at any retailer, and are going to be on the immediate list of banned guns if the AWB passes in January. If this does not sell, I have no problem keeping it.

It is a long weapon with a tactical light attahced to it using the finest adhesive known to man, that's right duct tape.  I also have installed a tactical knive using the same fine duct tape, it has a shell holder for quick reloads, again using duct tape and if the SHTF too bad I even have installed a fine kel tec for more firepower and sum back up with that fine duct tape.

If you will look closely, you will see a pin in the frame above the trigger, it has a bearing trigger, you can see the steel bearing directly behind the trigger,instead of the typical trigger bar, this pistol has ""Pachmayr"" ""Los Angeles"" stamped under the slide, you can tell the slide/frame have been fitted, it has micro adjustable sights, the barrel, slide and other parts have the last 2 digits of the serial number stamped on them, this was done to make sure the gun was re assembled with the original parts. Magazine well is beveled. This is one sweet pistol and rare. Frank Pachmayr was one of the first custom gunsmiths for the 1911, he started a business in California and accurized many 1911 pistols, this is one of them and you do not see them every day. This is clearly a Pachmayr Custom. No box, no paperwork. What you see, is what you get. I have added a pair of the Pachmayr American Legend grips because I feel they look better than the plain jane wood grips from Colt. If you are looking for a rare, one of a kind, this is for you.  All local , state and federal laws apply. I would prefer a face to face transaction, but can ship, at buyers expense to an FFL. The price is $4,000. I am in Columbia,Tennessee."

Magpul ACS stock, pinned in place since I'm in NY.
Standard mil-spec buffer tube, spring, and buffer
Rainier Ultramatch 18"" stainless barrel - Only shot about 10 rounds through it. Chambered in .223 Wylde, so you can fire 5.56 and .223 while having the accuracy of the .223.

CMMG Stainless 22LR Conversion kit. Switch between 5.56/.223 & 22LR in 60 seconds or less! Shoot for $0.04 per round for fun and $0.40 per round when you mean business.

MAGAZINES: 4 - 30 round metal mags, 1 - 30 round composite PMag, 1 - 60 round hi-cap Surefire metal mag, 1 - 25 round CMMG composite mag for 22LR.

STOCKS: Standard Stag Arms buttstock and deluxe Troy buttstock with rubber recoil pad and inside storage shown in photo.

Blackhawk single point adjustable bungee sling and ambidextrous mounting ring on buffer tube. Go from resting stance to on point target acquisition in one second. Best sling on the market.

MagPul angled forearm grip. Much cleaner looking, more ergonomic and simply better than vertical pistol grip style. With the angled grip you tend to pull back into your shoulder. With the vertical you tend to pull down toward the ground.

NEBO Flashlight mount currently fitted to a 3watt LED flashlight/taser! with lithium-ion battery. Includes box, papers, wall charger and car charger.

Gunslick AR-15 Cleaning kit, auxiliary rail-mount sling ring, 30 round mag holster.

Approximately 200 rounds of 5.56/.223 assorted ammo including about 80 tracer rounds.

EVERYTHING IS BRAND NEW! A total of 30 rounds of .223 have been fired through this rifle in process of sighting in the scope and is very accurate. An additional 3 rounds of 22LR were fired to test conversion bolt and mag. Everything works perfectly.

It took a month to acquire all the gear and assemble this complete package when items were far more readily available than now.

All totaled, the actual cost before recent increases was over $2,800. I'm not needing to sell but would for a return of 15% on my investment of time and money. My cash price is $3,250. A combination of cash no less than $2,000 and desirable trades at a value of $1,500 would be a possibility as well.

Email or text offers along with photos of any trades to REDACTED. Thanks for looking!

P.S.

For those who like to complain, I want to preface this ad with a statement against any ensuing debate or indignant behavior over price. Reality is, value is determined by what someone is willing to pay. That is a fundamental principal of supply and demand that the economy of any free country is based upon.

If you disagree with capitalism imagine living in a communist or socialist country where everything is regulated and try buying the same there. It won't happen.

Considering the impending ban can be imposed any day now, I believe the price to be very fair. If not sold before the ban, I will no longer accept the same price. Thank you."

 From Manufacturer: New RAPTOR Custom AR Lower Receiver stripped and comes as pictured. The BMG Difference 99% of all AR15 Rifles manufactured have lower receivers made from forgings. Forgings are created by pouring molten aluminum alloy into a form, then compressing it at high pressure. The problem with utilizing forgings is that once the alloy cools, no two end up equal in specificity. Without equal specificity, it is impossible to make any jig to hold these forgings in place equally in order to allow the computerized milling machine to complete the job. All our lower receivers here at BMG are made from 6061 T651 aircraft grade alloy. Unlike other manufacturers that offer a similar product made individually from ""Billet"", (a solid block of aircraft grade aluminum alloy) our receivers are all made from bar stock, (Billet) four at a time and are not separated from each other until all milling is complete. By creating multiple receivers from the same piece of bar stock, we are able to maintain the closest tolerances available in the U.S. Today"

I know the price is high but that is what I am willing to sell it for and it is current with the market (take a look at gunbroker and remember that this has been professionally converted...usually figure on about $300 for that). I don't need to sell it, I like it, but if someone wants it bad enough and is willing and able to pay for it, I will part with it.

It has a fixed stock and comes with the 5 round mag and a MD 20 round drum (as well as the box). Also, it is a true conversion (trigger group has been moved forward)…it has not just had a pistol grip attached to the back.

Usually I try to answer all emails I receive but in this case, if you do not receive an email from me, I am not interested. Please do not take it personally. While you may want to ask some questions to determine what you want to offer, I may not have the time to respond to many emails. If you have questions, please include an offer as if the answers to your questions were all positive, and if I am interested, I will answer and we can go from there.

Also, as everyone else, the offer is going to have to be good enough to make me part with something I do not think I will be able to get again for a good while or could only get again at great expense. I am completely fine holding on to this gun and I am not interested in selling at the ""former"" prices.

High Capacity Magazine

The MWG 90 Rounder high capacity magazine for the AR-15/M16 provides you with the finest in state-of-the-art high capacity magazine design. The 90 Rounder's innovative snail-drum design and advanced space-age materials are combined to create a very light, completely reliable, low maintenance, high capacity magazine that will withstand a level of heavy field use that would destroy a metal magazine, while weighing 33% less.

The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 is designed for 5.56mm NATO or .223 Remington ammunition.

The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 is designed to be close to maintenance free. Never remove the silver-gray Teflon lubricant powder. Never Use any oil-based lubricant. Never disassemble MWG products, and never disassemble the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 .

The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 contains small parts & springs that may cause injury if improperly released. If repairs are required, return the magazine to MWG Company for repair. Any disassembly, alteration, re-adjustment, improper installation, or misuse of any MWG product voids all warranties.

Never attempt to load the 90 Rounder into the weapon or detach the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 from the weapon, with a cartridge in the chamber. Always lock the bolt back first and visually ensure the chamber is empty.

Because of its unique design, the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 can be left partially loaded for an extended period of time, but never store the 90 Rounder with more than 80 rounds loaded. Leaving the 90 Rounder for the stored with more than 80 rounds loaded may damage the springs and cause the weapon to malfunction. Never attempt to load more than 90 rounds. Loading more than 90 rounds may damage the magazine.

Always avoid lethal situations whenever possible. High capacity magazines such as the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 are intended to eliminate re-loading downtime for persons in unavoidable potentially lethal situations, but no product can fully protect the user from injury or death in a firefight. The knowing use of MWG products, when a potentially lethal situation could be avoided, will constitute an assumption of the known risks of engaging in a lethal situation.

LOADING 
The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 must generate energy to reliably feed ammunition into the receiver at a consistent rate. As the magazine grows full, more energy must be exerted to load additional rounds. This energy is stored in a special spring & released to move the entire ammunition load during firing. It takes a lot of energy to reliably move 90 rounds of ammunition, and so it takes a lot of energy to load those same rounds. As the magazine nears capacity, the final rounds may require substantial energy to load.

The use of a lighter, narrower bullet results in a significantly higher muzzle velocity and superior ballistic performance to the .50 BMG, supposedly to such a degree that the .416 Barrett retains more energy than the .50 beyond 1000 yards. The projectile remains supersonic to out around 2000 yards. That's my typical ground squirrel shooting range. That's why I bought the Barrett. Ha, ha, ha. Heck, I can't even SEE 2000 yards! I saw one ballistic chart that said the Barrett puts a 400gr bullet at 3250fps with a resulting muzzle energy of 9380 foot pounds. That's around twice the .458 Winchester magnum! Those ballistics will provide greater accuracy than the .50 beyond 1000 yards. This rifle is brand new in the box. It is chambered in the .416 Barrett. It comes with one 10rd magazine. It is housed in a Pelican 1750 case with a custom moulded interior designed specially for the rifle so it is held securely. This is not a factory California compliant model.Will ship INSURED.

Frame retains 95% bright original bright blue with a few light scratches and slight browning. Barrel and magazine tube retain 90% original bright blue with slight browning near frame. The hammer retains 50% original case colors and the crescent buttplate has faded. The bore is mint and crisp indicative of a rifle with this condition. Most screws appear untouched, but 2 have slight burring. Nice original walnut stock and checkered forearm have never been sanded and retain virtually all the original finish and checkering is sharp. There are no cracks or chips in the wood and the wood-to-metal fit is perfect with a few dings. All edges, English proofs and role stamping are crisp and sharp. Action is really tight like it has not been worked in a really long time. Notice the old oil and dirt residue or crud around the hammer, sights and other crevices that collectors like to see proving aged “untampered with” condition. The stock has a period cartouche in the right side of the stock stamped with the English seal and the words “Niger Coast Protectorate – Fire Arms Protection” around it. There is also another number stamped in the underside of the stock near the lower tang. This rifle has some nice history and the little bit that I found was that this rifle was ordered by England’s Parliament during a period that they denied accusations that England was participating or interfering with the Ivory Coast trade in Niger. It wasn’t until around turn of century that they publically announced they would send troops to help. However, this rifle proves that they were involved earlier. I have owned this rifle for 20 years and I have not seen another with this cartouche or history. This is a fine condition rifle that will make a fine addition to any Colt collection.  I give a 3 day inspection.

This was not and is not a safe queen. This is a working man's gun. As such it has scratches and signs of use (but not abuse). While it is collectible because it has LEO restricted roll marks, it would be on the lower end on the collectible scale because it has been used. If you need a New In Box model, this is not for you. If you you want a great reliable firearm that has a proven history and track record, one you can rely on to accurately shoot rounds down range, this gun is for you.


The AR-15A3 model AR6721 is an exceptional patrol rifle with tactical accuracy chosen by federal, state and local agencies. The 16.1"" (40.9 cm) heavy barrel with 1 in 9"" (229 mm) rifling twist allows flexibility in ammunition selection. The telescopic butt stock adjusts to four positions to enhance mobility and fit to a wider range of operators. In position, the removable carrying handle provides an M16A4 target style sight adjustable for windage and elevation to 600 meters. Easily removable, the flat top upper receiver allows for easy mounting of optical, night vision and other tactical sighting systems. The tactical carbine is the answer to all the requirements of modern law enforcement."

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine.

Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips, and the Impact/Dust Cover can now be snapped onto the floorplate when not in use to prevent possible loss. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color.

This was purchased during the ban, so the stock is pinned, there's no bayonet lug and it has a muzzle brake instead of a flash suppressor. Personally, I think the muzzle brake is a more practical feature than a flash suppressor. IF there is to be a new ban, the fact that this rifle only has 1 of the previously banned features (the pistol grip) MIGHT save you from having to modify it to conform to the law.

This pistol was completely checked out and test fired by Steyr Arms recently, and is functioning perfectly.  Included are two 17 rd. magazines, the original carrying case, two trigger keys, and owner's manual.  Additional pictures are available on request.

For those not familiar with the M9-A1, here are some facts and some comparisons with the ""Other Austrian Pistol"", the Glock 19:

The Steyr has a similar grip angle, but a smaller diameter and much more ergomonic grip shape.

The Steyr has a 4mm lower bore axis, for less muzzle flip and less perceived recoil.

The Steyr has a steel subframe incorporating the frame rails and the trigger / sear mechanism (very solid and precise).  This steel frame fits into the polymer grip as a module.  The glock uses its polymer grip as a frame to locate & hold the trigger mechanism, and the frame rails are molded into the polymer grip.

The Steyr uses unique fast acquisition trapezoidal / triangle combat sights which are made of steel and dove-tailed into the slide for easy replacement.  The glock uses plastic sights and front sight is staked in.

The Steyr has a shorter trigger pull, with a quicker reset.

The Steyr has a two round greater magazine capacity (17 rds versus 15).

The Steyr has a built-in keyed trigger lock as an additional safety feature.

The Steyr was initially designed for the .40 S&W, and then adapted for the less powerful 9mm.



My price is $475, face to face in N. Austin.  I'm not desperate to sell, so please don't make lowball offers (they will be ignored).  Trades for one or more firearms, +/- cash  may be possible (mostly ""tactical"" weapons or target guns), but I'm not very interested in hunting rifles or hunting shotguns, antiques, etc.  No archery equipment, computers, jet skis, etc.  Serious buyers will provide me with a (local) phone number if they want to talk in person.  I won't give out my number unless I can contact you at yours (too many spammers & scammers).

You want to flag all the listings, price gouging here on Armslist, I agree. Not saying its right go anywhere and everyone is raising their prices on everything. I went to (not going to name names) on Friday and all the Pawn shops and gun stores seems have raised thier prices on everything. I walked into a Pawn shop Friday while the clerk was changing out the price tags and I asked him why and he told me supply and demand and it wasn't just the AR platform types guns but it was all. So it's even your local dealers/suppliers....

And honestly I would rather do something with the people who contact you on a listing you have and they lowball you so much, you come back w a counter offer they even low ball you even more and then all of sudden your listing has been removed by flagging, G, I wonder who just flagged my listing....?

If someone is asking $1500 for their AR type platform I bet they are more and willing to come down on the prices. But I know when you have someone asking $3000+ for a DPMS, MP, Bushmaster, Delton, PSA etc and they say firm now that's different.

No one is forcing you to purchase that $2500 AR.... Move on to the next listing and all this hipe will die down and everything will be back to normal, but the lowballers will still be out there. 
What I don't like is that you will have someone asking all these question and go back and forth between emails/texts and they will lowball you or even worse is if they want to meet you somewhere and then they lowball you and don't  budge at all even though you come down on price for them, I think that's worse then price gouging...

That's my opionon and I know they are like assholes, everyone has one!"

This was not and is not a safe queen. This is a working man's gun. As such it has scratches and signs of use (but not abuse). While it is collectible because it has LEO restricted roll marks, it would be on the lower end on the collectible scale because it has been used. If you need a New In Box model, this is not for you. If you you want a great reliable firearm that has a proven history and track record, one you can rely on to accurately shoot rounds down range, this gun is for you.


The AR-15A3 model AR6721 is an exceptional patrol rifle with tactical accuracy chosen by federal, state and local agencies. The 16.1"" (40.9 cm) heavy barrel with 1 in 9"" (229 mm) rifling twist allows flexibility in ammunition selection. The telescopic butt stock adjusts to four positions to enhance mobility and fit to a wider range of operators. In position, the removable carrying handle provides an M16A4 target style sight adjustable for windage and elevation to 600 meters. Easily removable, the flat top upper receiver allows for easy mounting of optical, night vision and other tactical sighting systems. The tactical carbine is the answer to all the requirements of modern law enforcement."

   These AK-47 style rifles came with a 20 round magazine and the ability to accept any high capacity AK magazine or drum. They featured a side folding metal butt stock and vertical fore grips. This firearm used a Hungarian chrome-lined 12.6"" barrel with a muzzle brake permanently attached to reach 16"" in overall length. With the shorter barrel and side folding stock, these guns were well suited for Hungarian mechanized forces to use in tight spaces more efficiently.
