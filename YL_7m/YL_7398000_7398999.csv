Made by LegalManufacturing, LLCSlide is much more durable and made better quality for shooting more accurately and better weapon manipulation. The slide is plated with nickel boron finish and has weight reducing side and front slide cuts. Has forward serrations. Its a very nice look and design and makes a difference in shooting and performance. And with the added lone wolf trigger makes the trigger pull much nicer and lighter. (Trigger put on by previous owner)Below is from legalmanufacturing's website about the slide etc.""NIB BATTLEWORN® is a patent‐pending nickel boron plating process that offers wear resistance while simultaneously reducing friction to aluminum, steel, and titanium firearm surfaces. NIB BATTLEWORN®is a dark shade of gray with an aesthetically distressed, modern “battle” finish. Legal Manufacturing LLC’s proprietary plating process creates a smooth and uniform surface and increases the hardness of the plated part to over 70 Rockwell hardness. NIB BATTLEWORN® does not add significant dimension to the metal surface ensuring it can be applied on nearly all firearm components with no adverse impact on operation.""Has original case, 2 15rd mags plus a magpul 15rd and 17rd mag still in packaging. Has extra back straps and loader. The barrel is A stainless steel barrel which looks much nicer. and the numbers on slide, barrel and frame all match. Has lone wolf trigger as well.These are much harder to find in the gen 4, even the gen 3s new will run about $600.i will let mine go for $700. I am not desperate to sell and will gladly keep it for less. If you can find one else where for cheaper with the Tin coated barrel and lone wolf trigger then i suggest you get that one and dont waste my time telling me about it. For a standard gen 3 glock i wont value it more then $500 unless its a g34 and a gen 4 standard no more then $550 at best. Extras will obviously be taken into consideration. dont offer trade value with boot hoping that $700 value will suffice, the $700 price is strictly an all cash price!My price is firm! Trade value of $750 for nice HKs, or gen 4 glock 34 with upgrades or boot or a glock 23 or 35 with a 9mm conversion barrel.will also trade for really nice 1911s such as springfield, ruger, kimber, maybe remington. Would also like a Cz 97b with boot. All steel baby desert eagle in 9mm or .45 with boot my way.walther ppq with boot my way.hk vp9 with boot my way. (HK vp9 is $579 new at academy with Luminous sights so i place a value on it at $525 used) beretta m92fs with boot.gen 5 glock 19 with boot.XDM 9mm or 45 4.5"" or bigger with boot MY way.smith and wesson m&p 2.0 9mm or .45 with boot my way or the earlier gens with even more boot my way.Cz 75Bd or Cz 75b tactical plus bootcz sp-01 with bootcz p10 with boot. Only long gun ill consider is a nice AK or a gen 3 glock 19 or 23 with a kel tec sub p2000 that uses glock mags in the same caliber or with a micro roni instead. Your trade needs to be something really nice for me to consider it, so dont offer me an xd and expect me to trade straight across or a $500-550 brand new priced gun and expect to not add boot. I AM ONLY INTERESTED IN STRAIGHT TRADES OR TRADES WITH BOOT MY WAY, I WILL NOT ADD BOOT TO ANYTHING HIGHER VALUE SO PLEASE DO NOT ASK. OTHERWISE JUST CASH WORKS TOO.may consider multi gun trades but no junk.would like a nice handgun and a home defense 12Ga shotgun combo deal or a nice entry level bolt gun in .308 or .223 or a lever gun in .30/30, 357 or 45 long colt. Only revolvers i care for are single action revolvers in .45 long colt with boot my way. Maybe a larger model 44 magnum. Not too big a fan of snubbies unless its a taurus 85 as an extra or with alot of boot.not wanting any .22lrs, archery, or black powder. Will not trade for anything non firearms!!NO HI POINTS OR JIMENEZ OR COBRA ARMS OR QUESTIONABLE MAKES. Will not ship!! Can meet in nashville or clarksville.. any farther will require more boot and that still has a limit. Due to the amount of no shows ive recieved this last week i will be picky about where i meet or how far i am willing to travel. serious buyers only please!!

Located in Gadsten Alabama. Call or text REDACTED. No trades please except possibly a very nice Remington hunting rifle. I have several other shotguns from my personal that I'm selling. You can select ""listings by this user"" to see them. Here is list of differences between Remington 870 Express and Remington 870 Police:870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization.The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

In original box with paperwork, and I'm the original owner. I recently was given a Commander from a family member so this sweet pistol can go to a good home. One bonus to this Kimber model is that the Firing pin safety is operated by the grip safety and not the trigger, giving it an excellent crisp break. It will come with a new $60 Galco Brown leather holster and two magazines (one is a Chip m. Mag, come with 1 mag new) . Paid $952 for gun just a few months ago with an in-store discount, then purchased all silver parts from Kimber custom shop to have the rear safety contoured to remove the hotspot that Kimber is notorious for.  All original with front and rear checkering, night sights, sweet 4lbs trigger, and the list keeps going. I've fired 250 rounds through it and consider it broken in. It ejects to the 4 o'clock position and has been very accurate and reliable thoughout the break in. This is your chance to own a sweet 1911 Commander for a fracton of the cost. This Kimber is truly a good one to one.

Has a decent Feyochi 8-32x50 scope on it that I bought from a local shop near me, it's not a great brand and I only spent $130 on it but it has worked perfect out to 500 yards for me. Also put a bi-pod on it. Both scope and bipod come with it, along with 2 10 round mags, and original box and manual(everything that came with it when bought new) I paid $1437.27 after taxes for just the gun and got around $180 with the scope and bipod. Have some ammo that will go with too. I'm asking $1300 firm. I figure that's a fair deal considering it's basically a brand new gun. Don't bother contacting me if you are gonna low ball me please, I don't have to sell it. If someone knows they want it and wants to save a couple hundred on it then this is the deal for you. txt or call (574) Three15-zero473"
