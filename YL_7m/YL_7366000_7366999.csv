Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAAMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAAMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty.DISCLAIMER: Crimson Trace Corporation© DB .380 specific laser mount is not designed for the DB9.

Not completely broken in, having put less than 150 rounds down the barrel. The rifle has the AccuTrigger on it. The bolt has a Savage Tactical handle on it. The barrel is by McGowen. It is 26"" tapered stainless bull barrel, 1:10 twist, crowned on the end. The barrel is fixed to the action with a matching stainless nut. The stock is a Choate Tactical Savage Long action synthetic stock. Very nice and sturdy, stable. Comes with two shims to adjust the length of the end pad. The action has been bedded and the barrel is fully free floating.  Last included is the bipod that is mounted to a nut that runs up and down the track in the Choate stock. The gun was intended to be my all purpose rifle. Deer, coyote, prairie dogs, this gun can do it very well. I hate to see it go but I am no longer shooting and it's too nice to spend the rest of its life in my basement. I have over $1100 into it, looking to sell for $700 cash only. Will include some of the ammo I have laying around as well. Thanks for looking."

It shoots like a dream, and is beautifully made. .22LR with a bolt action, 28"" barrel, and iron (tangential) sights. The problem is, I'm too old for it! If I wear glasses to see the sights, I can't see the target. If I don't wear glasses, and can see the target, I can't see the sights! I already have a 455 with a scope on it, so I don't need another rifle with a scope. Besides, this rifle is made for iron-sight shooting, not a scope.I really hate to part with this thing, but I don't deserve it. I've had less than 100 rounds through it. Even with my old man eyes and my amateur ability, I was still having no problem tagging the 2"" dot at 25 yards. It really is fun, and the long barrel makes a great sound.This model will allow you to swap out barrels that you can get from CZ: whether it's a shorter Lux barrel in .22 or a change in caliber to a .17 HMR.I will include the case that I bought for it from Midway (shown in picture) and the 10 round magazine that came with it.I will take PayPall or cash. My first choice is face-to-face in Louisville, but I will sell in Kentucky, and will travel half way if you're not in Louisville. I will consider shipping to an FFL outside of state, but you'll pay shipping.I think it's priced fairly. I paid more than asking price for it at Bud's, but my price is flexible -- I'll take offers..I also have the original box and paperwork.Price dropped until I sell it."

The stainless steel slide sports custom high visibility X-ray day/night sights and front cocking serrations for better handling. This P220 DA/SA has a reduced and contoured Elite Beavertail that allows for a higher grip and reduced profile. Aggressive front strap checkering and checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip while an X-5 undercut has been applied to the triggerguard for a higher grip and greater control. It features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced and polished action with the short reset trigger is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. P-SAIT trigger.  It has a solid steel guide rod and comes with two standard P220 magazines, one extra capacity P220 magazine, original box, papers, special SIG P220 Legion presntation case with Legion medallion.  The MSRP of this firearm is $1413.  If you took a new P220 and added these enhancements you would spend over $1600.

It is an AK-47 type Saiga in caliber 7.62x39mm and was built by the one and only Izhmash factory in Russia, the very factory where real AK’s are made. It is stamped, ""Made in Russia by Izhmash."" Considering all Russian rifles have been banned from importation since 2014, the opportunity is running out to own an authentic high-quality AK-47 from the motherland. I am the original owner and I purchased it brand new. The rifle has an authentic Russian receiver, barrel and trunnion. The furniture is US made by Timberland. The muzzle brake and fire control group are Tapco so the rifle is as Russian as possible, while meeting 922r compliance. This rifle is in great condition; I have put 200 rounds through it. The barrel itself is also Russian made, and thus has a strong chrome lining, thicker and more robust than anything you are going to get that is US made due to environmental regulations when chrome plating. You will note in the pictures that the muzzle brake has small spots showing wear of the finish as well as some wear of the finish on the magazine release. Aside this, the finish is great!Included with the rifle is one Tapco slab side magazine dyed to look like Russian Bakelite, a surplus rifle sling, cleaning kit with oil bottle, and cleaning rod. All original Izhmash documentation is included. Also included is the original Kalashnikov USA packaging. Buyer must make local pickup only please. I am pretty laid-back and easy to communicate with if you have any questions. Thank you."

I don't use it, as I prefer bullpup rifles so I figured I'd list it. For those not familiar with the SIG rifles, they are piston driven, which is cleaner and more reliable. Since piston driven rifles also have no buffer tube, these can also be fired with the stock folded, to give you a more compact defense option.This DOES have a rear sight, it's a small flip up pee sight built into the back of the rail. These were designed mainly to use red dots and other optics, but you can put a larger iron sight on the rail if you'd like.This rifle is in good condition, has the usual wear from ejected shells, and being used.Package:- SIG 556- Upgraded Hogue grip- 3 mags (One Hexmag, two Brownells standard aluminum mags),- SIG STS-081 red dot- 4 Magpul rail attachments for the handguard- Single point sling- Soft case that can hold the rifle and 3 extra magsI took the rail attachments off, but I have a picture below taken before, so you can see what they look like.I'm asking $900 FIRM for this. This is a very low price for what you're getting. When I sell stuff, I like to give good deals. I lose money, but it means it sells fast and someone gets a good deal.The ONLY trades I'd be interested in would be: FN Five Seven, FN PS90, FN FS2000, Beretta 92A1, Walther PPK .32, CZ Scorpion (old style .32 or new Evo 9mm) Tavor X95, Kel-Tec RDB, semi-auto shotguns geared towards home defense (shorter barrel), or other bullpup style rifles. I have cash I can add for higher valued trades.Located in Northville, willing to travel a bit buy nothing too crazy.

The safe had 5 exploration holes drilled into the sides and back to see where we needed to drill the front open. 4 of the holes have been repaired. The front door is hard plate and the sides are safe steel. The inside has compartments that can be locked individually. I have 5/7 of the inner compartment keys. Safe is great for pistols, ammo, passports, gold bars, etc... I have the change key for the dial and can teach the new owner how to set the new combos. The safe needs the last hole repaired and painted. If you want the TL-15 rating, I can show you what needs to be done to get the rating back.

It is the double humpback with sliding ""suicide safety."" My research indicates it was made in 1920 or earlier but no earlier than 1912 when production started because 1920 was the year they apparently changed the safety. Serial number is 70,xxx. The US military used these as trench guns. Oh, and I have a generic barrel shroud you can have if I can find it. Text me at REDACTED or message me through this site. Pictures to come. There is a wikipedia page on this gun but I cant post the link.
update: I loaded a pic i had on my computer of a case for one of these guns so you can see what they look like and maybe have somebody make you a case like it. The gun in the picture is not the one for sale and there is no case for it. I will post pics of the actual gun for sale tomorrow."
