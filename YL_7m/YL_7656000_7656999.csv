It has a Centurion Arms C4 9"" quad rail, Knights Armament rail covers, a Tango Down stubby foregrip, a B5 Sopmod stock, a Troy folding rear sight, Mod 4 BCM charging handle and a Battlecomp 1.0 flash hider/compensator. The lower has its original ALG trigger. This rifle is in great used shape. Well maintained and cycles smoother than any other AR I have had the pleasure to handle. I would approximate that this rifle has around 600 rounds through it. This is a weapon I depend on, so it has small red witness marks on critical component fastener heads. These could be removed if you wish. I can include the small box BCM ships their lowers in if the buyer wishes, but I no longer have the box that the upper came in. $1300. I am am firm on my prices.

There are quite a few 7.62x25 jungle conversions that came out of Vietnam and are mostly very crudely done out of a lot of worn and junk parts. This gun appears to be mostly WWII original Colt parts. I tried to show in the pictures the careful welding and machining that was done on this one. Notice how nicely the slide face is machined and the extractor moved over for the smaller cartridge head and the ejection port is opened for the longer case. Also look at the magazine well and how it is relieved both front and rear by machining instead of just grinding it larger. The High Standard barrel is sleeved and reworked and the bore and chamber are nice and shiny with no pitting or corrosion. When you look at the assembled gun it looks like a standard Colt until you look closely. ++++++I want you to be happy with your purchase, so please ask any and all questions you want BEFORE bidding."

There are quite a few 7.62x25 jungle conversions that came out of Vietnam and are mostly very crudely done out of a lot of worn and junk parts. This gun appears to be mostly WWII original Colt parts. I tried to show in the pictures the careful welding and machining that was done on this one. Notice how nicely the slide face is machined and the extractor moved over for the smaller cartridge head and the ejection port is opened for the longer case. Also look at the magazine well and how it is relieved both front and rear by machining instead of just grinding it larger. The High Standard barrel is sleeved and reworked and the bore and chamber are nice and shiny with no pitting or corrosion. When you look at the assembled gun it looks like a standard Colt until you look closely. ++++++I want you to be happy with your purchase, so please ask any and all questions you want BEFORE bidding."

There are quite a few 7.62x25 jungle conversions that came out of Vietnam and are mostly very crudely done out of a lot of worn and junk parts. This gun appears to be mostly WWII original Colt parts. I tried to show in the pictures the careful welding and machining that was done on this one. Notice how nicely the slide face is machined and the extractor moved over for the smaller cartridge head and the ejection port is opened for the longer case. Also look at the magazine well and how it is relieved both front and rear by machining instead of just grinding it larger. The High Standard barrel is sleeved and reworked and the bore and chamber are nice and shiny with no pitting or corrosion. When you look at the assembled gun it looks like a standard Colt until you look closely. ++++++I want you to be happy with your purchase, so please ask any and all questions you want BEFORE bidding."

Info from Wikipedia:Sales of the Five-seven were originally restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers, but since 2004, the pistol has also been offered to civilian shooters for personal protection, target shooting, and similar uses. Although offered only with sporting ammunition, the Five-seven's introduction to civilian shooters was met with vocal opposition from gun control organizations such as the Brady Compaign, and the pistol has been subject to ongoing controversy in the United States.The Five-seven is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations, including Canada, France, Greece, India, Poland, Spain, and the United States. In the United States, the Five-seven is in use with numerous law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service. In the years since the pistol's introduction to the civilian market in the United States, it has also become increasingly popular with civilian shooters.Craig REDACTED, please call, do not email.

Other than a couple of times at the range it has pretty much been a safe queen ever since, and is as received from the DCM. The original tag and paperwork has long since been lost, along with the ""dope/range chart"" that was taped to the inside. I also had a letter of confirmation from Springfield's archive documenting the rifle's National Match build and acquisition. I have ordered/received the replacement receipt from the CMP, but have no idea who now has the Springfield archive information today, to get a replacement. The receiver has a recorded type 1 NM serial number, and the barrel is correct, and almost certainly original to the receiver. There are no rearsenal marks or signs of barrel change, and wear, condition and date range of each are as expected of an original type 1 NM barreled receiver. Everything else about the rifle appears consistent with early type 1 NMs. However, since only the barrel was marked ""NM"" on type 1s, it's pretty much impossible to guarantee what's original or not. Furthermore, I don't know what (if any) parts the DCM or original armorers having this in their inventory swapped. Like I said earlier, there was a small range/dope chart taped to the inside of the floor plate (visible when empty). To me, that placed the trigger group, and likely the stock at a match range. On the other hand, the bolt is W.R.A. D28287-1 and the gas plug is marked HRA. I am knowledgeable in firearms, however I do not consider myself an expert in Garands. If you have any questions, just ask and I'll do my best to answer them. The saying goes, buy the gun, not the story"". Accordingly, I am selling this at a price that is very good for an excellent condition Springfield Garand with a type 1 NM dated receiver, type 1 NM barrel that should gauge around 1+ ME & TE as received from DCM, excellent walnut stock, and is the most accurate Garand that I have ever fired."

Like all Mossberg 500s the barrels can be changed if you wanted to use it for hunting etc.  i paid 475 for the gun. 125 for the stock. 20 for the rail and 60 for the red dot. $680 into it but im only asking $400. Buyer pays transfer fee. Local gun store by me only charges $10 for transfer. Have the original stock and box as well. You can text me REDACTED. Thanks."
