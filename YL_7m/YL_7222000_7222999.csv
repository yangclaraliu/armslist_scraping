This Glock 94 Lock can lock all calibers from the 42 lock all the way to 41 long lock... Hey thnx for checking out my post and feel free to ask any questions.  oh and I forgot to mention- feels good in the hand, bore axis, stipple, tactical , recoil, high capacity, beaver tail, flat dark earth, night sights, muzzle flip, gets back on target, sight aquasition, my personal favorite is  sight radius ,high grip, nice crisp break, tactile!  My locks are LNIB & they are worth more than what you can pay for them in the store..man - forgot to add manipulation- you know that one handed deal, cause when you rack the slide normally with one hand it called racking the slide, but if you get your arm blown off in a war of locks it's called manipulation.."

Double/Single action.
2.5 inch barrel
.357 Magnum/.38 special
Up for sale is a classic Smith and Wesson Model 19-5 six-shot revolver chambered in .357 Magnum. This is a K frame with a 2.5 inch barrel and adjustable rear sight. This firearm was manufactured in the 1980’s. The bore is still nice and shiny and the rifling looks pristine. I just fired a box of .357 magnum out of it on Saturday morning and its as accurate as can be, and I had no light primer strikes or any malfunctions. There is a little bit of holster wear on the cylinder and barrel, and the trigger and hammer have some coloring. The back of the frame on the right side has some light surface rust, but it’s not out of control. Overall, I would say that this firearm is in good – excellent condition. The gun comes by itself, I don't have the original case or grips. 
This is a private sale, and I’m willing to meet at a shooting range if you want to inspect and test the gun. Please include your phone number when replying to this ad and I will get back to you same day. I am selling this for dirt cheap already so please don’t’ lowball me with ridiculous offers for $250. Thanks for looking."

You've never seen a Dragoon like this, and likely never will again. This is a 2nd generation Colt percussion Second Model Dragoon pistol, still one of the most powerful handguns ever made. Has custom shorty barrel 4.5 inches long. 28xxx serial range from the 1980's. This is the only one of these you have ever seen. Has been fired but is in excellent condituion. Not just a chopped off barrel but complete with custom reduced ramrod assembly and beautiful contouring as found on certain 19th century conversions.  And importantly, unlike many second generation Colts that do not work properly when they are put into use thirty-five years after they were made, this one functions perfectly. It can take several hours just to tune up a second generation cap and ball Colt when it comes out of the box because Colt intended these guns to be 'collector items' and not shooters. Additionally, it takes many hours and special tooling to do the custom reduction and contouring to the barrel and front end. This pistol has an extremely smooth action and works perfectly. I have fired it, but as with all black powder pistols I offer, there is no warranty of any kind, express or implied, as to the use or safety of this or any other percussion pistol regardless of age. A beautiful piece and something no one else you know has! Please email any questions. Trades possible!"
