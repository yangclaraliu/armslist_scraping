S. Springfield Model 1903 sniper rifle that is fitted with a “Warner & Swasey Telescopic Musket Sight, Model of 1913”. This original M1913 scope/base combination is numbered 6141 on the left side of the scope receiver and retains approximately 95% of its original black enamel finish. All surfaces and adjustment wheels clean with no corrosion. The sight is complete with the original rubber eye piece. The optics are in fairly clear condition. The crosshair reticle is intact as are the three stadia lines for estimating distance. The left side of the receiver is fitted with the original Warner & Swasey mounting bracket secured by three screws. The left side of the stock is inletted to clear the feet of the scope mounting bracket. The bracket screws are flush with the inside of the receiver and are staked in place to rifle receiver. The rifle’s s/n is 577970. According to Bruce Canfield’s U.S. INFANTRY WEAPONS OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR (page 106), M1913 sights in the serial number 22XX to 69XX range were fitted to rifle serial numbers in the 577XXX to 935XXX range. The inside of the telescopic sight mount is not stamped with the rifle s/n indicating that the scope is an “unissued” example. The barrel is roll-stamped ""S A"" immediately behind the rear sight base above the ordnance ""flaming bomb"" insignia and the date ""7-16"" which is about two years later than the receiver date, indicating that the rifle was re-barreled at some point. The bore is in excellent condition. An ""H"" is stamped on the underside of the bayonet lug. The steel lot code ""C 7"" is stamped on the underside of the bolt safety lug. The rear sight is the correct 2750-yard folding leaf type that is adjustable for elevation and windage. The trigger is grooved with a cross-hatched tip. The oil-finished, black walnut, ""S"" type stock with the high hump handguard are in excellent condition. The final inspection cartouche ""J.F.C."" (Inspector J.F. Coyle) in a rectangle is stamped on the left side of the stock behind the magazine cut-off. An encircled ""P"" proof mark is stamped on the underside of the stock behind the trigger guard. A stock is stamped “21” below the trigger guard. A ""R"" sub-inspection mark is stamped in the cut-off recess of the stock. The buttplate has fine checkering. A vintage WWI type nickel-plated oiler and thong case is located in the butt trap recess. Included with the rifle is a scarce, excellent condition, russet leather, case for the Model 1913 Warner & Swasey Musket Sight. The back side of the case is stamped with the manufacturer’s name DIAMOND “D”/ logo/ and initials “A.B.D.” It does not have the shoulder strap or adjustment tool in the front pocket. These rifles are extremely scarce in the well documented serial number range and in this exceptional overall condition."

Thanks for looking.   New for 2015, after a lull of almost 25 years, IWI US is proud to bring back the world famous Galil ACE family of pistols and rifles to the US commercial/civilian market. The modernized Galil ACE is based upon the reliable mechanism of the original Galil assault rifle first developed by IMI in the late 1960’s. Drawing inspiration from the legendary Russian AK-47 and the Finnish Valmet RK 62, the IWI Galil ACE has been continuously improved over the last 40+ years, resulting in today’s extremely reliable and highly accurate Galil ACE. Improvements made since the original Galil was first developed include:Charging handle (reciprocating) moved to the left side of the milled steel receiver allowing for weak hand operationAKM/AK-47 magazine compatibility. (Note that the Galil ACE rifle is assembled in the US from imported and US parts under 18 U.S.C  § 922(r). You should only use magazines made in the USA in your Galil ACE rifle. Use of an imported magazine may put you in violation of 18 U.S.C § 922(r).)Weight reduction with the use of modern polymersFull length 2-piece Picatinny top railPicatinny tri-rail forearm with built in, slide on/ off rail covers with pressure switch accessSide Folding adjustable telescoping buttstock with 2 position removable comb on all rifle modelsFully adjustable iron sights with Tritium front postCaliber-7.62x39mmAction-Semi-autoOperating System-Closed rotating bolt, long stroke gas pistonMagazine Type-MAGPUL MOE AK/AKM PMAGMagazine Capacity-30 roundsBarrel Material-Cold hammer forged, CrMoV, chrome linedBarrel Length-16""Overall Length-34.5"" (Buttstock Unfolded and Collapsed) Weight-7.5 lbs w/out MagazineRifling-Right Hand, 1:9.45 inch twistStock Color-Black"

CX4 and PX4 leverage the same full-size Beretta magazines (as long as they are of the same caliber). The common magazines afford existing Beretta users the ability to utilize the magazines/clips without the expense of having to buy additional proprietary gear for each platform. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this design versatility is an additional reason why the Beretta Storm Series firearms (pistols and carbines) are highly prized by tactical shooters. When Beretta Storm pistols and carbines, are utilized together it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available on the market today as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following and the PX4’s wide adoption by Military and Law Enforcement Agencies."
