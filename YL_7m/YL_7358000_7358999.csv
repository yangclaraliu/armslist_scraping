Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. There is a safety stop on the hammer as well as a firing pin block safety. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.

It also comes with the Wilson Combat spring set, additional set of new factory internal plunger springs to keep it tight and smooth if its used heavily like I had planned to do myself, new factory second hammer strut and seat for fast spring changes like going from carry to competition and some other misc. bits. I can toss in some 357mag ammo to start off with depending on the trade. Only listing it because I had more custom work planned for it but I haven't used it in a while so I would like to see whats out there for trades but I would also consider selling so just ask except please dont bother with lowball offers as I dont actually need to sell it. The pic is one I found I took a long time ago but its still in the same condition because I rarely shot it and never carried it, I have no idea why the trigger looks dark in the pic but it is matching stainless steel. I would prefer to transfer through a FFL for my side of the trade or sale and will pay my own fee, would like to save a couple personal transfers where its still only late September.

Picked it up thinking it'd be a fun gun to teach my son to shoot pistol with. He liked my buddy's MkIII a lot better, and I'm a 9mm guy, so up for sale it goes. Comes with everything that it came with from the factory: pistol, books, trigger lock, extra fiber optics for the sights, hard case, and two 30 round mags. Plus 200-250 rounds of 22WMR. It's had less than two mags through it: had to finish off what I had loaded when my son put it down, after all. Fully cleaned and lubed after that only outing with it. Fun gun, but hasn't been out to the range in too long.Specs are on Kel-Tec's website.Trades for double stack 9mm pistols, full size or compact, will be considered.All federal, state, and local transfer laws will be followed.

I'm done fucking with it and I really don't want to try and fix it and I'd rather just get rid of it to someone who has time and more knowledge. Rifle comes with a ammo can full of 303 British. Don't know approximately how many rounds but I can count if you really need to know.

This pistol comes in the original cardboard box, and includes all accessories with which it shipped, including: (2) factory ten round magazines, (2) additional magazine baseplates (with or without pinky extension), and (1) additional grip (large or small size). The only thing missing from the box is the cheap cable lock, which I gave away.The condition of this pistol is ""almost new in box"". I am the original owner of the firearm, and I have fired it less than 100 times. The exterior is 99% or better. The internals are nearly perfect as well, with only the lightest spots of finish wear on the slide rails. Otherwise, the gun appears brand new. The bore and crown are 100%.This is a great firearm, and it deserves to be owned by someone who is actually going to shoot it. My interests have simply strayed elsewhere."

In addition, I'm including 600 rounds of Golden Tiger 7.62x39 ammunition which I will be shipping separately via UPS Ground. I bought it brand new form the dealer a few years back, took it to the range one time, and then it has been a safe queen ever since. The original stock, hand guard, and grip have been replaced with a beautiful Ironwood Designs set. There are no issues with the rifle. The action is smooth and the magazines seat positively. It's a fun gun to shoot but I've got to downsize and stick with just the guns that I'm shooting on the regular. One magazine is shown in the images but I'll include any other ones I have lying around as this is my only AK47. USPS Money Order is preferred.

Pythons have a distinct appearance due to a full barrel underlug, ventilated rib and adjustable sights.[3] Originally, Colt manufactured Pythons with hollow underlugs but left them solid to work as a stabilizing barrel weight. When the revolver is at full cock, just as the trigger is pressed, the cylinder locks up for the duration of the hammer strike. Other revolvers have a hint of looseness even at full-cock. The gap between the cylinder and forcing cone is very tight, further aiding accuracy and velocity.[2] Starting in the 1970s each Python revolver was boresighted at the factory with a laser and was the first mass-produced revolver to do so."

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 model year SKUs (91351/01351 and 91352/01352) feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. Starting at just $849, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck."
