This firearm is completely functional and its in good condition for its age. It also comes with 2 mags and that is another item that is hard to find. Plus one box of original 32 cal ammo. All numbers match on this beauty. Bluing is about 95%. I have shot this beauty and she shoots good and it's easy to break down to clean  as well. Not just a collectable it's one that actually works.
