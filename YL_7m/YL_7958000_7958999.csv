It is one of the early models. I purchased it shortly after Sig came out with the handguns. I have less than 500 rounds through it. The pistol comes with 2 magazines, I may have a third (I have to look for it, no promises on the 3rd magazine). I have less than 500 rounds through it because this firearm has been a total piece of crap since day one. I literally hate this pistol. I have sent it back to Sig for repairs twice. I own several Sigs, and this is the worst one. The last time Sig sent it back (after repairing it) I refused to shoot it, but the Sig gunsmith swears it is fixed and that he put over 100 rounds through the gun with no hiccups. Sig is 100% certain it is fixed now though. I want to stay ignorant of whether it is fixed or not. This gun has had numerous FTE and FTF in its life.  After getting it back from Sig the first time, I took it to the range and it had numerous Failure to Feed, Failures to Extract, you name it, this gun has had it. So I sent it back to Sig for a second time. I have all of the Sig Armorers notes to show the new buyer. The gun may be fine now. I am being totally honest and want the new buyer to be aware of the history I have had with this firearm. This firearm will be sold as-is, not warrantied or guaranteed by me (the seller). I just want the pistol gone so I can purge the bad memory of its existense. Sell of firearm must be done at a Licensed gun dealer so that the transfer can be legal. Photos can be sent upon request. ***Please note: I have recently lowered the price of this firearm by $50.00 so the buyer will pay the $20.00 transfer fee."

No tarus revolvers. or maybe a semi auto 308 or a ruger gunscout. Be realistic on trade value. No interest in shotguns or hunting rifles. A Taurus 85 and 100$ will not work. Bill of sale will be signed on the rifle. If you will not sign a bill of sale we cannot do business. Will meet within reason.

It simplifies the act of aiming, eliminating the need to focus on and align the front sight, rear sight and target. With the FastFire II, the aiming red dot and target are always in focus and properly aligned for the ultimate in accuracy. The FastFire II provides the only fully waterproof unit in its product category. The FastFire II sight is very small, mounts very low, and weighs a mere 1.6 ounces. And it has repeatedly proven it’s toughness on the slides of high power semi-autos, on slug guns, on shotguns and on high power rifles. The FastFire II housing is made of metal for strength and durability. It’s lenses are precision ground and polished to exacting geometries to virtually eliminate parallax and to provide a very clear crisp sight picture. It is fully windage and elevation adjustable and lockable. It features both an on/off switch and a light sensor that automatically adjusts the dot’s brightness to the available light. The included plastic hood covers the light sensor and puts the unit in sleep mode when the on/off switch is set to on. FastFire is powered by a lithium CR2032 battery, which is commonly available and long lasting because of the highly efficient electronics and the battery-saver mode. A battery can last as long as five years. The Picatinny Mount allows mounting on just about any rifle. Special bases are available for the most common firearms."

The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear.

Mostly Remsport ( supplier to many companys that rebrand it under another name, ) , with some EGW , Wilson, Brown parts thrown in to finish it out. No sights are on the pistol ( wasnt sure what I wanted ) , but I do have some I can include. Grips are a custom checkered, brand unknown. I have a S&A 1pc msh/magwell I can included in place of the standard mainspring housing shown in the photos. Can also swap out the trigger for a flat one if the buyer wants. This is in an unfinished state right now, meaning it's in the natural stainless steel finish. I was going to cerakote it, but as with most ss firearms, you can leave it as is and if it gets scuffed or worn, hit it with some Scotchbrite. Everything is drop in.  The frame and slide were near finish dimensions and needed less than .0004 material removal. Parts were measured. The rest od the parts were drop in. The trigger is ok but could use some finessing by one of the.local gunsmiths. A trigger job is something i will not tackle.   The pistol is better looking in person . I""ve had a few 1911's, and they dont come close to this in terms of finish and feel. This is a duplicate of a.pistol i already have and shoot on a.weekly basis.  Hence.the reason for the sale.....too much redundency in the safe and looking to add some variety and to burn through some reloads i forgot i had. I'll include a basic padded case too. And, if you reload, I have some top notch components that i can offer up as well.  Basically an identical load to what the military pistol teams use. $650 cash , which is alot less than what I have into it, or possible trades. I can include cash to even it out. So, for the same price as a base model 1911 in the stores or a 20yr old glock here on AL, you can have this optioned out 1911.
