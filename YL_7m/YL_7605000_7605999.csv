The SEO engraving is sharp and detailed. It is so beautiful with delicate little lines, no mars running through it anywhere. The backside of the trigger guard where the middle finger rubs has some finish loss. There is a scratch on the right side of the bottom barrel just in front of the forend. The top of the rib has some thinning to the finish. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear and crisp. Overall, this shotgun rates in about Excellent condition."

I am willing to pay cash on a per visit basis for access to an area of your privately owned land, for a few hours, once every month or two. So that I may enjoy some good old manly 12 gauge plinkin'!!! Why am I looking for private land and not a public range? Simple. because sometimes Im going to want to use 00 buck, #4 buck, or slug loads for exploding water filled bottles and jugs!!! Destroying those enemy Watermelons!!! Or honey dew melons, cantilopes, ballistic gel blocks, or old doors, etc... the kind of 12 gauge fun you can only have on private land.  I promise to comply with all rules set by the property owner. I will comply with all federal and state law, I promise to observe and practice firearms safety at all times. I have no criminal record, or any legal issues. In fact I have never been arrested in my life and am 36 years old. How does $40 bucks sound, for myself and one guest to plink on your land, a 2 hour session, you pick the dates available, the times, the conditions, etc.. let me know if you have any counter offers or ideas."

For the Gen4, GLOCK further modernized the pistol for comfort and control. GLOCK started by including a reversible magazine catch so that now both right- and left-handed shooters can enjoy the pistol. The modular back strap system allows a shooter to tailor the length of the rough textured grip to their hand size for optimal ergonomics. To tame the recoil of the powerful .40 S&W cartridge, GLOCK introduced a dual recoil spring system that not only makes the GLOCK 22 softer-shooting but also significantly increases the service life of the pistol."

Glock acknowledged that sentiment with the development of the Glock 21. Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the Glock 21 Gen4 delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 Auto round with a 13 round magazine capacity. The modular backstrap design lets the user adapt the grip to hand size, and the frame surface exhibits the scientifically-designed Gen4 rough textured technology. This model features a dual-recoil spring assembly that substantially increases the life of the system, and the enlarged reversible magazine catch easily accommodates left- or right-handed operators. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment. The Gen4 system is the perfect complement to this iconic .45 caliber cartridge."

Its supposed to be more accurate and obviously more compact. It has about 80 rounds through it and shoots like a dream. I have never had a single malfunction of any kind with this gun.  The recoil is similar to a 12 ga with bird shot(seriously). The Concussion however is a whole different story. I really don't want to sell it, However I am having some Financial problems so it is up for sale.
