This was my dream gun for a very long time, however I need money for a 3D printer and for some of my other projects.
If you think that my rifle is to expensive than please go to Gun Broker, there you will find SVT-40’s for about $1600 which you can pay to have shipped to a store, and then you can pay the stores fee to hold the firearm and tax on the rifle.

Less than 2000 rounds in either.The one on the left has some slight rusting on the left side for some reason. All I can figure is that case must have had moisture in it when stored, which has been most of the past 23 years.The Glock 23 is shown for scale (and will eventually be sold as well). The A75 slides are about 5/8"" shorter (very close to Glock 27) with roughly the same grip length so think of a 23 grip with a 27 slide so would be good carry guns.$240 for one or $450 for both. The only trades I'd consider are compact striker-fired 9mm such as S&W M&P 2.0 Compact, Ruger SR9c or LC9s Pro, Gen 4/5 Glock 19, Sig P320, etc.I will only meet in a public place (a range is fine if you'd like to shoot). Must be >= 21 with a valid IN DL and LTCH.If the ad is up, then I still have one or both, no need to email and ask.I have 100% feedback since 99 on Ebay (https://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&userid=topshot-rhit) You can send me a message via Ebay to verify it's me if you want."
