Everything else is unmodified and all original parts are still included. I've never had even a slight misfire or jam with this unit. I posted a similar add a few months ago and with the recent tragedy these slide fires are likely going to be soon banned from further construction and consequently I've seen the price of these things sky rocket. To be completely honest I've only tried the slide fire once and didn't get a consistent high rate of fire beyond a few quick 2-3 round bursts. However like I said it's the only time I've tried a bump fire style in my life and I'm most likely doing something wrong."

I shot this weapon from 15 to 25 yards and usually had (if I did my part) right around an inch & a half or smaller group....consistently! It has the best out of the box trigger I have ever felt too. I got it around a year ago and it has (for the most part) been in my safe. It has 3 15 round magazines with it,  the manual and plastic H & K box, plus all the original things that came with it new. (several different backstraps and shims and things). GREAT weapon.. I am mainly wanting to sell it, although you never know.. might be into a trade if its something that interest me.

The Leupold Mark 4 will only be sold to military and law enforcement units starting sometime in, 2017.The Leupold Mark 4 series of scopes has been very successful in the civilian market over the years because of their success and endorsement by the military. With that being said, Leupold’s target market for the Mark 4 is the military..Up for auction is a new in box Leupold Mark 4 LR/T 4.5-14x50 Mil Dot Scope. Leupold keeps their successful tradition of delivering state of the art sport optics alive with persistent attention to detail, precision and quality. This American optics company, located in Portland, Oregon, pioneered the process of nitrogen purging to waterproof riflescopes in 1947. Since then and to this day Leupold continues to develop new technologies, and use advanced materials to push the envelope to produce some of the world's finest sport optics.Leupold's Mark 4 series of riflescopes have been designed to meet specific challenges as well as similar broad needs. The 4.5-14x50 Mark 4 LR/T M1 Riflescope is an extremely versatile sighting optic that is well suited to any long range tactical firearm. Suitable for both urban and more rural settings, the 4.5-14x zoom range of this scope delivers fast target acquisition whether you're perched on a roof top or stalking along a tree-line at the edge or a wide open field. The optical system features legendary Leupold quality; the Index Matched Lens system ensures accurate color rendition and crisp brilliant detail.Dynamic weather conditions will have no effect on your sight picture; like all Leupold scopes this Mark 4 is nitrogen purged for absolute water and fog-proofing. Because repeatability is a concern that is tantamount to all concerns, the Mark 4 series feature a rugged 30mm main tube constructed from a single piece of 6061-T6 aluminum with generous tactile and audible precision adjustments. The tracking on these scopes is world class; your return to zero will be spot-on every time. Leupold has done their part; the repeatable precision is here.

The integrated electronic ballistic computer couples directly to the Nightforce NXS 3.5-15 riflescopes acting as the upper rear scope ring. The Barrett BORS measures air temperature, barometric pressure, and bore line angle. The BORS also calculates a ballistic solution for a specific user-selected cartridge eliminating the need for “counting clicks”, calculating mil dots as target ranges change, or using a handheld computer. The BORS allows the shooter to focus on environmental conditions, assess the tactical situation, and quickly engage multiple targets at varying ranges. The BORS simply takes the mystery out of bullet drop.Each BORS includes Barrett Ballistic Software, USB to BORS data connection cable, 100 preloaded cartridge table, tool kit and CR-123 lithium battery.

They all exhibit the early Colt parts and markings as follows; the left side of the frame has the small ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY"". Directly above the magazine catch release button is marked with the circled intertwined ""WGP"" of Major Walter G. Penfield the US Ordnance inspector at Colt. The right side frame is marked with the serial number and the top of the frame has the early acceptance proofs of the letter ""H"" and ""T"". The left side of the slide is marked with the very early Colt two-line patent/ address markings of ""PATENTED APR 20 1897/SEPT. 9 1902, DEC 19 1905, FEB 14,1911"",and ""COLT'S PT. F.A. MFG CO./HARTFORD. CT. U.S.A."" with the Rampant Colt behind the serrations. It also has the early round top rear sight and narrow front sight. The various parts and components are all the early versions such as; blue Colt barrel with the single ""P and H"" on top, early 1911 checkered slide stop, thin thumb piece, short grip safety, flat mainspring housing and the early short Colt hammer with the wide checkered spur. Two tone magazine with lanyard ring on the base and fitted with checkered walnut grips with a diamond around the screws and lanyard ring on the heel. But we must remember as these Colts 103 years old where disassembled for cleaning , many parts were picked up my mistake during reassembly serial Number: 84109, this was the third contract in 1914. The pistol shows mostly an artificial dark plum brown finish on the slide and frame with light wear through turning a gray patina on the front edges of the slide and the front grip strap. Condition 100% original parts ,with 50-60% finish , The grips are very good with a few minor dings and wear, and very crisp checkering. Most of these USMC 1911's saw heavy use and went through many rebuilds. very few Marine Corps 1911’s remain as most were lost in battle during WWI,the Banna wars and WWII To find one in any condition is difficult .All FFL fees apply when required, C&R License accepted Colt letter included.
