This rifle is made from nickel steel and was not blued. It still shoots ( I shot it this past week). It is actually the carbine model as it did not come with the forend caps of the longer barreled rifles of the era. It is a saddle ring carbine but there is no ring only the stud. It has the tang sights for elevation although the little cross piece is missing ( can be bought) I use it with the regular open sight. I bought it to hog hunt with when I was a Park Ranger in the mountains but no longer live there and after heart surgery, I do not hog hunt. You do not see these every day and it is 100 years old. It has the walnut stock and fore piece and is quite a beautiful gun as well as a working gun.  People go on about the pre-1964 Model 1894s, well this is about as pre 64 as you can get.

Heat cured ceramic based coating. Strongest/best available. 2) If you don't like coated weapons (and you prefer to carry a black ""target indicator"") fine with me, but not reducing the value of this rifle because you do not know what you are doing or don't like this color. Lay this rifle in a field next to a black rifle and see which one is obvious. 3) the ONLY true criticism that could be made about this rifle is that some don't like the plastic mags. They work well but the FAL surplus metal magazines (that are AWESOME) yet sometimes harder to get are available but you gotta pay more if you want those from me.Other than the above mentioned.... You can't beat the reliability and accuracy at this price range."

In times of civil unrest, many lawmen considered the scattergun as the best town tamer and express companies especially realized the value of these smoothbores and armed their messengers with them. They each knew the threat of scattered shot from a shotgun's blast had a greater chance of dissuading an unruly crowd or a road agent, than would the single projectile from a rifle or pistol.Cimarron's 1878 Coach Gun, inspired by an original in our collection, is available in either the full-length 26-inch barrel, or the 20-inch barreled model, both capable of handling 3-inch shotshells, with the traditional exposed sidehammers, a pistol grip stock and schnabble forearm, blued barrels and a blued receiver.

The bolt action functions fine and shoots just fine. This model has an internal 5 round magazine and manlicher stock.The second rifle is the model 1909 and is slightly larger than the model 1891.

This was one of the ones made for Arrmalite by the Sterling Armaments Company of Dagenham, Essex, in the United Kingdom between 1979-1985. It's in great shape and shoots like a dream. Based on my internal inspection when I bought it, it doesn't look like it's been used very much at all. I've put about 200 rounds down the pipe.Background for those who don't know much about them:The AR-18 was designed at ArmaLite in California by Arthur Miller, Eugene Stoner, George Sullivan, and Charles Dorchester in 1963 as an alternative to the AR-15 design, which had just been selected by the U.S. military as the M16. It wasn't adopted by the US Military, but the AR-18 sold in small quantities to police and law enforcement organizations, as well as armies and security forces of nations such as Botswana, Haiti, and Swaziland. It's also pretty famous for being the IRA's weapon of choice, they loved it so much they've written multiple songs about it. It's a solid rifle, amazing design, and will run anything you put through it. The mounting for the scope on these is one of a kind, only used by ArmaLite on this rifle. It basically slides on from the rear and locks into place within seconds, which allows you to remove it and install it easily, without tools, and it will always hold a zero. It's also piston driven (so you can fold the stock) and side charging, so it's awesome!This rifle comes with an Armalite scope mount (very rare), a late 70's era Redfield scope (I think it's 2.5x, and also rare), a 1980's era sling, and also an early 1980's era military bayonet (not Aramalite) to complete the package and keep everything old school. Also comes with one 20 round factory magazine and one standard 30 round AR aluminum magazine.I'm asking $1300 FIRM for everything. This is a REALLY low price the rifles usually sell alone for $1300+, the scope mount is worth well over $100 and the scope itself sells for $100+, then you have the bayonet and sling. It's priced ultra low to sell fast, trying to get some extra spending cash for the holidays! NOT interested in trades on this.Located in Northville, willing to travel a bit but nothing crazy. Face to face deals only, I will NOT ship.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time.Thanks for looking!~ Mike**I CAN ONLY ADD 3 PICTURES TO THIS LISTING.

BUT; please respond to emails, give a full description, get good pics of both sides and all pieces included in sale, treat others as you would like to be treated. It’s all really that simple. That’s if you want to really sell your weapons. Way to many people who list there weapons on Armslist are just fishing. You want to fish? Then go fishing.  When my friends & I are looking to buy weapons we don’t want to play games, we’re looking to purchase/trade for what you have. So if your serious about selling, then let’s make a deal, save the games for your family and friends because what your selling is serious business to me, and most other people. PS (Price it realistically) Thx Wise !  I apologize if my title was a little misleading, just done with all of the games. Thanks for reading, be safe, be alert, stay alive!"

It does have some Springfield parts on it.  I can provide details on those if interested.  The stock has one piece of different wood as you can see from the pic and the rest looks to be the same stock.  It is in decent shape but does have its share of dings in it which some say gives it “character”.  The steel is all in good shape with still having some of the cosmoline on it.  I probably haven’t shot this in 15 years or so but it shot well the last time.  Kept in a dry safe and I run a patch through it from time to time.  I am just fielding offers for this at this point and if I get the right one I’ll sell, if not I won’t so please no lowballs.  Located in the Minneapolis Metro area, face to face meetup only, cash only NO SHIPPING.  Looking mainly for cash.  Trade items: Used pinball machine of certain types for which I will include cash.  Please respond to the ad if interested."
