Their self-luminous aiming systems empower you to execute any shot with complete confidence in bright light, low light or no light at all. Although ACOGs have many features which are very advantageous for military use, they're equally well adapted for sporting and tactical applications. These compact telescopic sights are internally adjustable, and their reticles are illuminated with tritium /fiber optics for positive target acquisition under any lighting conditions. The 1.5x16 ACOG Riflescope offers a very wide field of view which in turn results in excellent fire-control capability. This makes targets, moving or otherwise, easier to acquire, lock on to, and hit successfully with the first shot. Follow-up shots are also executed with greater speed and accuracy. Sighting with the 1.5x16 enables the shooter to make great use of the Bindon Aiming Concept. This ACOG is configured with a dual illuminated Red Circle Dot reticle and a Special Ring Short Housing. This low-profile scope is designed to be mounted with one of Trijicon's proprietary Special Ring Adapters.Rugged Construction Forged 7075-T6 aircraft aluminum alloy housing Special Ring Short Housing Low-profile housing must be mounted to one of Trijicon's Special Ring Adapters (B&H# - TRMM08, TRMM07F, TRMM01) Broad Band Anti-Reflective Coated Lenses Multicoated lenses provide enhance clarity by minimizing flare and glare Waterproof and Fogproof Nitrogen purged and waterproof seals ensure clarity and reliability under any conditions Bindon Aiming Concept The Bindon Aiming Concept was devised by Trijicon's founder, Glyn Bindon. The BAC method of aiming with both eyes open ensures a far superior sense of balance, and a wider field-of-view. Combining these benefits with a magnified Trijicon sight gives you a considerable advantage over your target.

These uppers are extremely high quality and well built, Look around and you will see what I mean. They are no longer produced by this company so they are sought after. It has been used some probably 100-200 rounds of subsonic 300 blackout through it. It is on great condition I'm just re-working my blackout build and taking it in a new direction. It comes with the upper and the 5.56/300 blk BCG. These sold new for $400-$500. This was used lightly so I'm asking for best resonable offerWill consider trades for guns or AR parts. Mainly looking a good standard BCG and charging handle but will consider other parts or optics/AR scopes like 1-4 since I've switched to a more standard upper. Might be wiling to take a loss since I'm in need of a good BCG, charging handle, and an optic/scope for my new build, so this might be a perfect chance for all those ""must be in my favor"" types. With that being said please be reasonable."

I am selling my Ruger SR 1911. I flat out love this 1911 but am selling it so I can purchase the 10mm version. This 1911 is chambered in .45acp. It is very accurate were new shooters can hit bottles at 25 yards and more seasoned shooter can get hits on targets out to 100yards. My buddy I bought it from did have his gunsmith mill out the feed ramp to make it longer to help aid in ammo feeding reliability and polish the trigger components. The pistol has about 350-450 rounds through it. It's been a safe queen for me. The trigger is one of the best production 1911 triggers I've ever shot. Shoot me an  email if interested. Thanks!

I Hate this rifle. I've only shot around 400-500 rounds through it... but I detest bolt action. I only purchased it because a friend and I were supposed to get into the long range stuff, I'm more of a rifle (semi auto) and pistol kind of guy. I gave it my best and still don't like it. But I don't need the money, just want another gun. Just throw some offers out there if you really want it and we'll go from there. No crazy scratches dents or dings just regular bolt wear, comes with two mags 10 rounds the stock, scope, and the bipod also a case and maybe a hundred or so rounds. Local only please no trades you can email me via armslist and we can go from there if you need pics. Also if you wish to purchase must be with entire setup for $850 OBO. Thank you"
