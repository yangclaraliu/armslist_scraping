I have had a request for Authentication Paperwork, and after speaking with a Couple of Gentlemen that specialize in items like these, they both went on to tell me to find the original history and the exact date it was created would be virtually impossible without Provenance, or the location it was actually created, or a name of who made it.  They both went on to ask me why I would need an authentication, and I said for possible sale or trade, and this is what they told me-  It is in fact authentic and would date it around WWII or a little earlier, based on the width of the Sheath and its Thickness, probably around the late thirties, earlier sheaths are much slimmer in thickness and if fact much wider. The Next Indication of the time period are the carrying Lugs (or The loops that hook to your belt) are made in the ""V"" design which is also typical or the WWII Era designs. The later designed Carrying Lugs are Vertical Double Loops, or a single wide Loop, and according to the Blade width it is typical of a Government Issue Blade. The blade is Wicked sharp and according to my Grandfather as long as hes had it has never been sharpend. They Also said it is more than likely a Kothimora White, which was typical for Officers to carry. I have researched their assessment to find it 100% accurate, feel free to research it yourself. If you need more proof than these facts about what time frame it’s from, I don't know what to tell you.Shoot me some offers, lets make a deal."

Taurus 12 + 1 Round 45 ACP w/De-cocker & Black Grips.
The Taurus 24/7 OSS features Taurus' revolutionary single action/double action trigger system that fires normally from a smooth single action mode, yet, if a primer fails to ignite, it provides a lifesaving second try at firing a faulty cartridge, a feature no other pistol on the market offers. The aggressive checkered grip allows a glue like purchase on the gun, even with sweaty or bloody hands. Add the combat necessary ambidextrous de-cock/safety levers that allow for cocked and locked and/or double action carry, SA/DA indicator on the rear of the slide shows whether the pistol is in cocked or de-cocked mode, a reversible magazine release and the 24/7 OSS versatility becomes immediately apparent. Field strip the 24/7 OSS and you'll discover a remarkable 18.5 lb. recoil spring that cycles the slide faster, a heavy match grade 5 1/4"" barrel and a stainless steel guide rod that adds just the right amount of front end weight for improved recoil control and rapid fire accuracy. The 24/7 OSS gives you a lifetime of hard charging performance, bullseye accuracy and unrelenting dependability.

I'd like to trade them both for a higher quality AR. Something like BCM, Daniel Defense or something similar. Both rifles have been taken extremely great care of. Stored in a BluGuard VCI vacuum sealed bag specifically for resisting corrosion and rust. The first is a Smith and Wesson M P Sport II with only 90 rounds down the tube. It's like new and will come with everything that originally came with it including Magpul 30rd pmag and Magpul rear sight handguard stock. I don't have box anymore or book although I did buy it new. Also it will come with a Magpul stock, quad rail and Barska Illuminated Scope 1-4. I'm asking $600 for it which is way less then I got it in. The scope is $150 stock $40 rail $45. So in upgrades ive got $235 take that off the $600. Your basically getting the S&W for $365. Won't find it cheaper for a like new M&P Sport II. It's not even broken in yet. The next rifle I have up for sale or trade is a brand new PSA premium rifle. It's not the freedom series and hasn't had a round fired thru it. It comes with the 13"" free-float keymod handguard, Magpul stock, Magpul Moe grip, POF 3.5 trigger BCM Charging handle. Stock was $40 grip $20 trigger $150 BCM CH $50. All are brand new not seen a round. $260 in upgrades upper was $360 new and lower was $130. Upper didn't come with BCG or Charging handle. The BCG is a unengraved Daniel Defense that has seen about 100 rounds. I'd like to get $700 for this rifle. I'm asking $50 less then I got in it not including the cost I have in the BCG. It's all new so I feel that's fair. Must come to zip code 40108 and if your trading something I want to shoot it first which we can do at my home. If your interested in buying one I have no problem letting you shoot them beforehand also at my home. I'll provide 30 rounds for free. If interested feel free to text me at (27O)945-3OO2."

Prices range all of the place but we will start here, it does work and it is heavier than it looks. Serious inquiries only, will not respond to junk/spam asking a bunch of questions. Legal NC sale and a bill of sale plus valid Id will get you this item. Rough price range is $500ish on auction. I really would rather trade for now. Figure with bid, shipping and ffl transfer we will out it at $600 trade. Trade wants stated below. Ftf around Raleigh only and no shipping for now. Putting it up for weekend then onto gunbroker. All you get is the gun and maybe some 45lc Glock 19 not available but used for size comparison"

Newer gen rifle with 5 position finger adjustable gas and upgraded trigger. Many rifles claim to be modular weapon systems just because they have a M1913 standard rail system used to attach accessories. The XCR is truly modular.With one XCR-L Lower Receiver (the serialized part), the operator can configure the XCR as a shorty for close quarters combat, a light weight carbine, or a longer marksman's rifle. The XCR-L's quick change barrel system is unmatched in terms of ease of use and repeatability. Barrel and caliber changes can be made in less than 5 minutes. The XCR is the most ergonomic rifle available. Professional users report that the XCR has the fastest magazine change and clearing times of any rifle. Whether the rifle is supported by the right or left hand, the operator can manipulate all the controls while keeping his eyes on target and index finger near the trigger. Local Sales ONLY!"
