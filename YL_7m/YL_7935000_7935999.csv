Up for sale is my Desert Tech HTI in 50 BMG and with a 408 CheyTac Conversion, 60 rds of Hornady 50 BMG ammo and 20 rds of HSM 408 CheyTac ammo. It has an SWFA 10x42mm scope on it. I bought it with the 408 barrel installed and slightly used (10 rds to sight it in). When it arrived, I installed the 50 BMG barrel and didn’t shoot any 408 with it, so the 408 barrel is essentially brand new and not even broken in. I still have the box from Desert Tech with the papers in it, but the manual of arms they sent was for an SRS. However, the PDF for the HTI can be downloaded from Desert Tech’s website for free and is very clear.
 
 
Since I’ve owned it, I have put about 50 rounds of 50 BMG down range, with ZERO malfunctions. I clean it every 5-10 rounds, so the barrel is pristine and the action is smooth. This rifle is a tack-driver and is sighted in for 100 yds (yes this is short range for the rifle, but that’s the longest range I have available).
 
 
Please, no low-ball offers: this package is already an awesome deal at what I’m asking. To build this yourself would cost around $10,600 with glass and ammo, so at $9,000, I am not going to move on my price. I also will not split up the package and sell only one caliber with the chassis or sell you just the ammo: it’s an “all or nothing” deal.
 
 
I prefer to meet in person at an FFL to make the sale and transfer, and I will drive up to 2 hrs/75 miles from my location to another FFL to accommodate your needs. I can ship it to your FFL of choice, up to a cost of $100 on shipping on my part. Anything above $100 shipping charge will be on you; however, I’ll of course need payment before I ship it out. If you require shipping, please contact me. I’ll be shipping it out of a local FFL (GA Firing Line in Marietta, GA), so we can make arrangements that will work for both of us.
 
 
I am selling to fund a new venture (opening my own business), but I will accept trades. The trade value for the rifle is the same as the cash price, but I have listed the trade value I’ll give for each rifle/handgun that I’m interested in. At this time, I am not interested in any vehicle/trailer/equipment trades or SCARs, Vectors, Muzzle Loaders, or high-end AR’s, but if you have something to trade that is not on my list, feel free to contact me with an offer: the worst I can say is no thanks, but I’m being pretty open on what I’ll take. I really like big-bore/dangerous game rifles, so if you have one to offer, I’m listening! Otherwise, thanks for looking!!

Ready Gunner Description:
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.
The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

While the rifle utilizes a 10.3 barrel, it is not classified as an SBR (Short-Barreled Rifle) because the suppressor is permanently attached. The DDM4ISR 300's sound suppressor is threaded and welded to the proprietary ISR Integrated Gas Block, bringing the barrel length to 16.145. While the rifle is at the 16 legal limit, the ISR's integrated suppressor will require an NFA tax stamp. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.Using the tool provided, the ISR's baffle core is removable for cleaning. With the inclusion of the Daniel Defense Modular Float Rail (MFR) 12.0, it provides the shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability.

Sorry, no trades.   This package includes a .308 Win Scout mounted with Swarovski Z3 3-10x42 Optic 4A Reticle and Leupold Mounts. All colors include a 1/2x20 threaded barrel from the factory. The Steyr Scout provides the ideal solution for versatility, durability, accuracy and reliability in a compact and lightweight bolt-action rifle platform. Developed in a nearly decade-long collaboration with legendary Marine Corps Lt.Col. Jeff Cooper, the Scout boasts an extensive list of innovative features. The lightweight bolt-action, all-purpose Steyr Scout rifle was designed to accept a low-powered, forward-mounted scope for accurate fire and both-eyes-open operation to detect flanking dangers. Backup “ghost-ring” iron sights integrated to the top rail can be deployed within seconds should the optics fail. The rifle can also be fitted with a standard scope, should the need arise. In keeping with Cooper’s requirement for a magazine cutoff, Steyr incorporated a two-position magazine system that allowed the rifle to be fed individually with the five-round magazine in a lowered position. The magazine could be seated one step further with minimal pressure, allowing the bolt to feed cartridges directly from the magazine. A second five-round backup magazine is contained in the buttstock in case of an urgent need to reload. With a fluted, cold-hammer-forged barrel measuring 19 inches, an overall length of 38.6 inches and an out-of-the-box weight of just 6.6 pounds, the Scout is a breeze to pack out on long adventures, patrolling the farm or taking a quick trip to the range. The compact design of the stock features an innovative integrated bipod that is hardly noticeable until it is folded out from the stock. Between the bipod legs is a UIT rail for attachments, and the stock is outfitted with five press-and-twist sling-swivel attachment points that allow the addition of Cooper’s favored Ching Sling on either side of the rifle. The Steyr Scout is built on the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action with a unique 2+1 safety function that offers three settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The FIRE mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot, and the first level of SAFE mode disables the firing mechanism while allowing the bolt to be cycled. The second SAFE position locks the bolt, at which point the bolt can be pushed down against the stock, locking the firing pin and firing mechanism out of firing position, allowing safe transportation with a round in the chamber. Simply pressing the safety’s release tab and rolling it forward returns the bolt to either the SAFE or the FIRE position. The Steyr Scout is available in a choice of Black, Grey, Mud and Green, and it is available chambered in .308 Winchester. Two 5-round magazines are included. A high-capacity conversion kit and hi-capacity magazines are also available to increase carry capacity to 20 rounds. The unique features make the Scout a self-contained platform that can easily be carried in a rifle scabbard without any need for attaching/detaching a bipod or finding extra pockets for a spare magazine, perfect for use on horseback, ATV or on a vehicle rifle rack."

Selling a very good condition AK74 circle D side folder in 5.45x39. Got this a few years ago, ran a mag through it and right in the safe it went.Comes with one circle D mag, 2 unmarked and a tapco.2 750 round cases of wolf, 18 boxes of 30 each surplus rounds, and about 55 lose surplus. So you're getting a great example of a AKS-74, right at 2100 roundsof ammo, and 4 good condition magazines for that I consider a good price at 1700$. Somewhat flexible, but I think this is a fair price"
