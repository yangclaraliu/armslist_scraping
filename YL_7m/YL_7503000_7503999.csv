The barrel is shortened to 18 inches – something you’ll appreciate on those longer hikes over the mountain and through the alders. The forward position scope mount brings you the added versatility of extended eye-relief optics. The Scout Squad™ also features a specially designed muzzle brake to help tame the recoil.Whether you’re looking to save some space on your next big hunting trip, or you need a ranch rifle that will be a constant companion, the Scout Squad™ will give you the maneuverability of a scout rifle with the same power and features of a legendary American battle rifle."

Ambidextrous Bolt Release with Enhanced Bolt Catch2. Ambidextrous Safety Selector3. Receiver Tension Screws4. Oversized Mag Well Flare5. Ambidextrous Recessed Finger Rest6. Ambidextrous Magazine Release7. Oversized Integrated Trigger Guard w/ Grip Relief8. Ambidextrous Bolt Hold Open9. Available QD Rear Sling MountE2 DUAL-EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGYPOF-USA’s patented E2 dual-extraction technology consists of four small channels cut into the walls of the chamber allowing a small amount of gas pressure to push against the neck of the spent case. This pressure assists in extraction by breaking the seal between the chamber and case as well as pushing the spent case to the rear as the extractor is pulling to the rear. This removes a tremendous amount of work that would otherwise be left up to the extractor.DROP IN FLAT TRIGGER SYSTEMThe flat-face single stage, non-adjustable drop-in trigger boasts a crisp 3.5 pound pull weight, red aluminum housing, and urethane feet for immediate competition, hunting, and tactical applications. Wire EDM cut from American A2 tool steel the trigger, disconnect and hammer are all nitride heat-treated for ultimate strength and corrosion resistance. All POF-USA triggers come with KNS Precision stainless steel non-rotating anti walk pins specifically designed for our ambidextrous lower receivers.DICTATOR ADJUSTABLE GAS BLOCKThe DIctator Adjustable Gas Block lets you tune your rifle to the exact operating speed it should be. When your rifle runs too slow, or too fast, it’s more prone to failures. With the DIctator’s 9 adjustable settings and included straight gas tube, you and your rifle are set for just about any situation. So go ahead and suppress it, run different ammo, or don’t. Experience a smoother shooting rifle than ever before. To adjust, use a flat head screwdriver or the included tool.OVERSIZED HEAT SINK BARREL NUTThe patented oversized heat sink barrel nut is one of the most significant innovations. At three inches long it completely encompasses the chamber and throat area of the barrel where expanding gas temperatures peak. Take into account the radiation properties of aluminum compared to traditional steel and you have 17 times more heat dissipation than a standard AR. Our barrel nut’s 3” length also gives the operating rod substantial guiding surface assuring constant positive contact with the bolt carrier. Our enhanced backbone receiver also move the upper’s natural stress point forward. This adds a massive amount of rigidity to the overall platform and is critical when vertical fore grips are being pulled on the upper assembly.RENEGADE FORENDComplete modularity of the Renegade and Renegade Plus is achieved by the 14” Renegade Forend. Sleek and rugged mounting system, lightweight, and QD mounts in all the right places – 2 per side. Add to that M-LOK® compatibility on 3 sides and a cut out to easily adjust the DIctator Adjustable Gas Block and your new Renegade rifle is ready to defend, compete, or hunt.ULTIMATE DI BOLT CARRIER GROUPOur one piece high phosphate nickel coated bolt carrier is manufactured with the mechanical key built into the body and positioned behind the cam pin. This patented design helps reduce carrier tilt. Our bolt carrier group features a chrome plated bolt, extractor, and firing pin. The finishes are both corrosion resistant and introduce lubricious characteristics to the action.ROLLER CAM PINOur patented roller cam pin is just one more example of how we strive to reduce friction and drag in the action. Standard AR cam pins feature a square steel head that literally grinds and carves away at the inside of the receiver. POF-USA’s NP3 coated roller head actually rolls inside the channel of the upper thus eliminating friction and prolonging the life of the upper.NITRIDE HEAT-TREATED BARRELEvery shooter knows that the beating heart of their rifle is their barrel. Our match-grade chrome-moly barrels are 5R button rifled with polygonal rifling for extreme accuracy and an incredible boost to bullet velocity compared to mil-spec AR barrels. We then finish our barrels with a Nitride Heat Treatment to Rockwell 70 hardness for unsurpassed strength, heat and corrosion resilience, and an average lifespan well into the tens of thousands of rounds. There is no better barrel on the market.TRIPLE PORT MUZZLE BRAKEDesigned to precisely compliment the POF-USA platform; our nitride heat-treated muzzle brake controls gas dispersion and reduces muzzle rise. It is effective in allowing the shooter to have faster follow up shots and has unbelievably soft felt recoil. It features blunt strike prongs and includes our nitride heat-treated collar jam nut.TOMAHAWK AMBIDEXTROUS CHARGING HANDLEHow can you say it’s a premium rifle without complete ambidextrous features? That’s where the Tomahawk Charging Handle comes in. Big enough for positive traction and small enough to stay out of the way, the Tomahawk rounds out the ambidextrous controls for the Renegade Plus.ANTI-TILT BUFFER TUBEOur mil-spec aluminum anti-tilt buffer tube features “carrier cradle” extensions to ensure that the carrier is always supported by the buffer tube even when the bolt carrier is fully forward. This prevents carrier tilt and premature wear of the buffer tube. The buffer detent now doubles as a lock that inhibits the buffer tube from rotating and becoming loose under adverse conditions. The anti-tilt buffer tube also features three drain holes.Trades: anything unusual, Kel Tec RDB, K&M Arms, CZ, 300 blk out, optics, Glock 31, 34, 35,  1911’s, high end bolt action rifles.
