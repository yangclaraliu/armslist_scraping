The gun is in perfect condition and was purchased new only 2 months ago. It works flawlessly and has only fired 42 rounds while I was adjusting the sights. It is single action with 2nd strike capability. So if you got a light primer, it goes into double action and you just pull the trigger again to fire the round. I have an extra mag I bought from pro mag that is brand new. But the pro mag does have a major issue where it refuses to feed on every round. I’m sure it can be fixed, I’m just not experienced enough yet with semi autos to mess with it (always had wheel guns till I got this). The gun also has a mag pouch to carry the extra mag if you can get it to work. I have added a pinky extension to the original mag. But I have the original bottom as well. I also have 150 rounds of brass federal fmj ball ammo as well as a quick mag loader. I also have a cheap nylon holster I’ll throw in as well. SO YOU GET THE GUN, NEW EXTRA MAG THAT NEEDS WORK, MAG HOLSTER, NYLON HOLSTER, PINKY EXTENSION, HOGUE GRIP, QUICK MAG LOADER, AND 150 ROUNDS OF BRASS FEDERAL CHAMPION 115 GRAIN FMJ BALL AMMO ALL FOR $215 OBO. (Must be ok with signing a written bill of sale with just our names, signatures, Description of weapon and serial number, and our DL numbers. No other info needed."
