However, it can’t be too old since the model number itself isn’t very old. It does have a few scratches on the top portion of the shotgun from rubbing against the wall in the closet it was in. I will include some ammunition. 10 Winchester Home Defense, 10 Winchester SXZ, and 25 Winchester Bird shot. Also including a Masterlock three digit trigger lock. If you have questions, email me. I live in Newton Iowa so that is about 25-45 minutes drive from Des Moines depending on where in Des Moines you are. I will only meet at a public location (such as Walmart or something similar).

Refusing to be constrained by tradition and previous design limitations, the Rhino has improvements that move the revolver forward into the 21st century. Unconventional in appearance and superior by performance, the Rhino fires from the bottom of the cylinder rather than the top. This dramatically reduces muzzle rise and recoil felt by lowering the axis of the bore almost to the palm of the shooters hand. An aluminum alloy frame and barrel shroud make the Rhino lightweight and easy to carry. Accessory rails on the bottom of the barrel shroud on the 4”, 5” and 6” barrel models easily allow mounting lights or lasers. The snag resistant “hammer” is actually a cocking device because of the Rhino’s innovative completely enclosed firing mechanism which can be fired either single or double action. A cocked indicator is clearly visible to indicate the internal hammer status. Another innovation is the hexagonal cylinder which keeps the revolver’s width to a minimum. all Rhino revolvers feature an easy to see fiber optic front sight.Contact Red Rifle 888.968.3925 BY APPOINTMENT ONLY"

Tanfoglio Witness. Includes 2 magazines, factory box, owners manual.  (Condition is like new -- the picture is BAD but the gun and mags are like new!)
Based on the proven CZ-75 design! Proven in combat and civilian use and one of the best grips you’ll ever find!Condition:  Like new!  I'm not sure I ever fired it as I see no signs of wear.  (Sorry I could not get a good picture but gun really is like new when you see it.)
Grip: contours are pleasant and there is no superfluous material at the front or back of the grip to unnecessarily lengthen it. The grip has an aggressive texture as well that helps to maintain a solid purchase, even with wet hands..
The CZ-75 design is a solid foundation, featuring a low bore axis and a true DA/SA, or double action/single action, trigger. Double action means that the trigger both cocks and releases the hammer, while single action means that the hammer is only released by the trigger. The single action trigger stroke is short and light!
One of the more striking features of the CZ-75 and the Witness is the unusual design of the slide. While most automatic pistols ride atop the frame on rails that fit in grooves on the inside of the slide, the CZ-75 and the Witness has a slide that rides inside the frame on rails that fit grooves along the outside of the slide. This results in a clean, unique look.
Perhaps the greatest benefit of the design of the slide is that it results in a much lower bore axis than more traditional designs. That means that the barrel is situated lower in the frame, more directly in line with the shooter’s hand and forearm. The perceived recoil is lower.* This item is for sale.  It is not necessary to ask if it is for sale.  If you can see the ad, it is for sale.No trades. No silly low offers - these responses will not be returned."

The big money parts are in the stock system. It is a Fab Defense GL Shock stock which reduces felt recoil by up to 70%. These are expensive but well worth the money. I got this one built just as you see it but have been running Fab Defense products for about 3 years on other AKs and ARs and they are fantastic to say the least. The stock itself runs 80-120 depending on time of year and if you can catch a sale or not. The magic is in the buffer tube which runs 80 dollars itself. The cheek riser runs around 30 dollars. I have 3 additional butt pads that run 25-35 dollars each that go with this stock as well. They are obviously all different sizes for different sized shooters. These stocks have hidden compartments for extra batteries for your optic and no snag sling mounts. The entire stock is snag free and extremely well thought out. This rifle is also running a Fab Defense ergo grip. Very soft and comfortable and it should be for 40 bucks. The scope is a BEC 3x9x42 IR BDR that averages right at 100 dollars everywhere you look. Occasionally they pop up for 80 on sale somewhere plus shipping. Great optic for the money. The red is very bright.  Trigger is a Tapco G2 and the 4 prong flash hider is also a Tapco right at 40 dollars. Scope mount is rock solid with zero wiggle. Assorted rails here and there are of varring quality. Bipod is nice and functions perfectly but is just a 60 dollar Harris copy and not an actual Harris as it would have been had I put this thing together. 45 Degree forward grip is nice for added control. The rifle is very heavy and a fantastic bench rest shooter out to about 300 yards. I have not had a chance to push out beyond that. As of right now, the rifle will come with 2 steel 30 round mags and about 200 rounds of ammo. I had 12 mags and 1500 rounds of ammo when I put this into storage in a shared safe a couple of years ago but that turned out to be a bad idea as this is all I had left when I pick the rifle back up last week. It seems that my little brother got a bit rowdy when taking his things from our dads safe to move them to his new home. Family. What can I say? I had given this rifle to my dad 2 years ago when his cancer got to his bones and the recoil from a standard AK was too much. This was still doable. Now his bones are crumbling so I took this one back since he can not even lift it let alone shoulder it and gave him a 6 pound AR15 that he instantly fell in love with. Now I want to sell this rifle and buy him a nice .45 acp that he can handle. It has to be a double stack like a Springfield XD or maybe a Para P14 or something along those lines. He no longer has the grip to control a slim 1911 which results in too much recoil. I am worried about more bone damage. We were just informed last month that he only has until about Christmas so I am up against a short deadline. Normally I would just go out and buy him one but I too am fighting cancer and the bills are litteraly rolling in daily. I go to surgery the day after Christmas. I finished my 6 weeks of radiation and am on my last course of Chemo so I have been super sick and pretty much missed the entire summer and didn't get to go shooting even once with my dad. The only thing we got to do together was radiation and chemo. I can certainly think of a lot more pleasant father and son activities to do together but we are playing the hands we were both dealt. Due to all the medical bills, I am looking for a cash sale that will give me the money to by my dad a . 45 and pay some bills but will look at all trade offers. I am in this rifle well over 1200 dollars but am listing it for just 900 due to my short time frame to make this happen. Thank you for taking the time to read my ad...........PS............ I will gladly look at guns in the 400-500 dollar range if you are willing to make up the difference in cash. I will also take multiple guns in trade as long as they are good quality. I do not do crap guns. Thank you."

Style:  1911
Very classic 1911 style pistol reminiscent of WWII era guns.Pistol carries the Military Proof Marks of the “X” Knight,  “P” flame, and “P” star on the slide, trigger guard and barrel indicating that it passed the proof test from the Eibar proof house that was the only proof house for the Military in the last century.
Very rich history.   After John Moses Browning delivered his outstanding 1911 to the world, a whole bunch of manufacturers decided to incorporate those same design elements into their own handguns.
The Spanish LOVED the 1911, and in 1922 Star Bonifacio Echeverria, SA, launched it.  Star went through several development cycles, birthing theiewent through several develoment ent of  Star Model B in 1931, which we see today and has recently become prized by shooters and collectors alike.
 
During the Second World War, Spain was officially neutral.  However, Spain provided material support to Nazi Germany. And one of their exports was case after case of Star Model B handguns!
German High Command didn’t see the need to have the typical Waffenmark stamped on the guns when they entered service and so these handguns are one of the only examples of a Nazi firearm that doesn’t bear that mark.
While the Third Reich made their own handguns and in enough numbers to supply front-line troops, they still needed to arm their civilian police force and other rear echelon units. The Star Model B used the same ammunition as the rest of the German handguns, so it fit right into the supply chain.
Trigger break is damn sweet. In fact, it beats many of the triggers on modern guns.  It has a very short takeup, and then a glass smooth break.
Shoots great!   The action feels smooth, the trigger is nice and it’s accurate at 25 yards.
The Star Model B is an interesting piece of history available. It gives you all of the cool points of a 1911,  it hits key points on WWII milsurp bingo card  -- USA design and Nazi use. And it does all of that while keeping ammo costs low.

Inspired by the famous 1911 Design:  This is a beauty of a gun and “Classic” all the way:  All steel construction that Star is famous for.  Solidly built with a steel frame, slide and barrel.  Completely of forged steel parts as it precedes the age of MIM. This gun represents the classic style of handguns with forged steel manufacturing, instead of stamped steel, alloy frames, plastic and polymer so common today.
Performance and Handling: Recoil is light and still very controllable even with hot loads.   The weight soaks up what normally would be snappy recoil from a compact pistol.  Love the accuracy and reliability shooting all kinds of ammo, JHP, etc.
Colt 1911 Commonalities:   The many similarities to the 1911 ACP make this pistol a favorite.  First, the look and feel are squarely 1911.  That very classic and natural pick up.  Teed ramp design is the same as on the 1911.  Throated from the factory.  Removable bushing as well as the swinging link.
Like the 1911, the Star using a Browning style lock up as is evidenced by the swinging link and locking lug on the barrel along with the removable barrel bushing.  The Star BM uses a FLGR with a captive recoil spring. 
Action & Trigger: single-action with locked breech.  Single action trigger break is excellent – very clean!  Serrated finger pad for a sure grip.
 
PREMIUM FEATURES:
Checkering milled into the hammer and BACKSTRAP for a sure feel. 
Magazine well is beveled from the factory.
Safeties:  Thumb safety on left side like the Colt 1911.  You can carry cocked and locked. 
Sights: notched rear blade
 Easy to pick up at speed.  The sight picture is easy to obtain in both slow and rapid-fire drills.  The rear sight is drift adjustable for windage.
 Grips: checkered brown
 Trigger has serrated finger pad.
