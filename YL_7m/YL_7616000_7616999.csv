I am partial to Sig so it must be a Sig, I'd prefer it to have a picatinny rail so I can mount a light, I'd like it to have night sights, NOT striker fired, and I want it chambered in 9mm. 1911 would be a bonus but it's not a complete need, and I can be tempted in another 938 I don't have or maaaybe a unique 238, but there would need to be some extra cash thrown in on your behalf. If not, I will sell it all at the price listed. It is a hair less than you'd pay retail for all of it. I do not ""need"" to sell her so I'm not going to give her away but also keep it in mind when offering trades or money, she'll continue to be oiled and be a paper weight before I let her go for a low ball offer. I'm a reasonable guy, lets talk, lets shoot and lets make a deal. I am responsive to email or you can call or text REDACTED. Merica'"

I also have 178 of the surplus ammo. The bore was the best of the bunch by far when I purchased it and I have cleaned it every time after I have shot. I am a decent shot with rifles and had pretty good groupings from when I would shoot it, I even had a few people come up and ask me what gun it was and once a guy talked my ear off about mosins because he recongized it by the bolt. Just looking to sell because I am in college and don't really have the money to keep buying ammo for it and Haven't shot it as much as I had wanted to. I would rather sell it all as a lot(listing price is for the lot) but I guess if you don't want something thats on the gun or the ammo I will work with you on the price.The only flaw is the wood stock has a cut in it which looks bigger in the picture than it actually is.If you have any questions feel free to contact me and I will get back with you, thanks!"

Just needs buffer assembly, end plate, and rear take down pin with according springs and detents. This hasn't had a buffer tube attached, never had an upper attached, so it can be built as either a pistol or rifle configuration. I bought this with the intentions of completing it and tourture testing it but got too busy and never got around to it. Now work is slowing down for the year and it will sit til work picks back up in the spring. So i figure why not see if someone else could use it sooner or maybe trade on some other things i could use. Cash price is $50. Well under retail so the price is very firm and only available for local pick up at that price. I will meet outside of town but the price will chnge based on travel time. Not willing to ship. Trades are trades so let' not get our panties all knottd up over values. If I can use it it's of value, if I can't it's worthless regardless of its retail value to me.

When changing from one caliber to another within the same caliber family, no bolt head change is necessary. If going outside of the caliber group during a barrel exchange, the bolt head has to be changed as well. However, the bolt head can be exchanged quickly and easily.Changing barrel contourEvery Blaser R8 receiver will accommodate all barrel contours. However, for an appropriate fit, the proper forearm is also required. Using a forearm for a larger contour is not a problem if the user does not mind the extra gap between the barrel and forearm. A larger barrel contour will not fit in a standard professional stock or wooden forearm though. NOTE: Except for the Blaser Saddle Mount, no R8 components are interchangeable with R93 components.SpecsEuroOptic SKU:R8_BR7S_375_SelousRifle Barrel Length:Approx. 25.75 InchesRifle Barrel Twist:1 in 12"" - 6 GroovesWeight:Approx. 3.6 lbs"
