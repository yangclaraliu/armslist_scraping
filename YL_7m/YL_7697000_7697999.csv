Features include a 14.5 inch chrome lined, 5.56mm NATO barrel that is manufactured to military specifications. Attached to the muzzle is the Knight's Armament 3 prong flash hider. New on the Mod 2 is a proprietary mid-length gas system that increases reliability and durability while also reducing felt recoil. The gas block no longer uses taper pins or set screws but is held on by a castle nut which allows for an air tight seal. Keeping with the air tight theme, the unique gas tube uses a compression fitting where it meets the gas block. This is very similar to what is used in automotive hydraulic brake lines. With these two features you won't have to worry about gas system leakage which can cause malfunctions, especially with lower powered ammo. On the opposite end of the barrel is Knight's Armament's proven E3 round-lug bolt which both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. The bolt is desigend to outlive the barrel. The E3 bolt rides in a full auto carrier. Surrounding the barrel is Knight's new URX 4 keymod handguard, 13 inches in length. The extended length handguard allows for a forward grip which makes moving from target to target much faster. The keymod handguard will accept all standard keymod accessories such as hand stops, rail covers, light mounts or picatinny rail sections. One 5 slot picatinny keymod rail section is supplied with the rifle. The URX 4 handguard design increases cooling characteristics and reduces weight and bulk compared with standard 1913 rail attachment methods. An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offer left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternative methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. Included parts and features, such as the two-sided receiver end plate QD sling swivel mounting point, collapsible six-position SOPMOD stock, hybrid ambidextrous selector lever, and folding 200-600 meter sights, round out the package to deliver a cutting-edge carbine right out of the case. *NFA rules apply, must ship to an FFL dealer with an SOT.

Cosmetically it is a little rough, camo is peeling but it is a black synthetic stock underneath. Has a folding stock and a 30 round magazine I also have the stock 10 round non-detachable to go with. Local pick up only must show me you are of age and have no criminal history. Would prefer you have a hunting license to show or a permit to acquire. Let me know if you have any questions. Would be interesting in trading for a conceal carry pistol, no junk please.

Dont have room in the safe to keep everything so i have to let some of them go. This jc higgins 101.16. was made for sears by savage/ Stevens in the 1940. It is the same as the savage/Stevens 87A from what i have read. It has a tenite stock that makes it a little more rare than the run of the mill 87A. The rifle is in descent condition for a 75 year old gun. Blue is faded and there is minor pitting on a few spots of the barrel/action. Bore looks good. I cleaned and lubed the action and ran a few round threw it and it worked as it should. Was looking for trade but would sell for $75 cash obo.  Would like to Trade for quality ar15 fixed or folding rear sight. Would entertain other trades in the same general price range. Let me know what you have.
