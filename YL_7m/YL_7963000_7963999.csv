An absolute dream to shoot, very well bAlanced shot about 2000 rounds through it which is nothing for this bull barrel 1911. Has minor holster wear and grip wear but purely cosmetic. Another kicker and unique thing about this EMP?? #6000! yup this is the exact 6000th one that rolled off the factory line. Perfect carry companion and comes with three mags. Grips are different.Innovation can take many forms. Sometimes it’s a brand new idea – like the XD®. Other times innovation is the fine-tuning of a classic – like the EMP®.How could the enduring design that is the 1911 be improved? Springfield Armory® answered that question in 2007 with the introduction of the Enhanced Micro Pistol™. The EMP® changes what a compact 1911 can be.The action of the EMP® is 1/8 inch shorter than that of the original 1911. This translates into several concrete advantages for the shooter. The shorter grip radius produces a shockingly comfortable shooting experience. You have to shoot the EMP® to believe how controllable it is. The shorter dimensions also work to increase reliability – something that’s crucial in a concealed carry pistol. And of course, the overall dimensions are one of the smallest 1911s out there.The good news doesn’t stop with the innovative design. The EMP® comes loaded with all the features you expect in a 1911 of this class – like low profile 3-Dot tritium combat sights and a match grade fully supported and ramped barrel. And with 9+1 rounds of 9mm the EMP® packs an amazing amount of punch in one of the smallest 1911s ever.If you’re looking for a 1911 to carry with you every day, look no further than the Springfield Armory® EMP®CALIBER=9mmRECOIL SYSTEM=Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide RodSIGHTS=Low Profile Combat, 3 - Dot TritiumWEIGHT (WITH EMPTY MAGAZINE)=27 ozs.HEIGHT=5""SLIDE=Forged Stainless Steel, Satin FinishBARREL=3"" Stainless Steel Match Grade, Fully Supported Ramp, BullLENGTH=6.6""FRAME= (FRAME DESIGN PAT# 7,340,987)Forged Aluminum Alloy, Black Hardcoat AnodizedMAGAZINES=3 - 9 Round, Stainless Steel with Slam Pads This cost me 1300$ will let go for $800 or best offer because of the wear marks.Text me with your offer .

I bought it from Keiths about six months ago and the only things that are not stock are the trigger and sear. I've put about 100 rounds through it myself with no jams. Comes with two extra mags, one of which is definitely colt. That holster is a G WM Davis, it is really damn sexy and he is very dead now, but I'd be willing to negotiate something if you just have to have it. You'll get whatever 45 ammo I've left, which I think is like 20-40 rounds. Those grips you see there are sweeet for large hands. I have the original grips too, and both sets are yours if you want them. Oh, and it does still have the Colette bushing. I have a solid one if youre concerned, but it's fit is a touch looser. Still plenty accurate. The only suggestion I'd have about the beauty is its about time to replace the recoil spring. I think. Though this is based on my history with really stiff ones, so you'll have to judge for yourself. If the ad is up, its still available. Will trade for a S & W 629 preferably -5 in 4"" or below, or a decent winchester 1897. Otherwise, Cash Only. We can negotiate who covers the ffl fee. I wont ship, so dont ask. Name and number gets a response. Without those I know that either A) youre a bot/scammer/sack of shit time waster, or B) you cant read three simple paragraphs and comb out the relevant info, and in that case, I'd just as soon pistol-whip you with the thing as sell it to you, especially after this long ass ending.

I bought these glasses, misplaced them, and when I found them my eyes had started rejecting contact lenses, so now I don't need these because I can only wear prescription glasses and these don't have a prescription.  These glasses help the shooter because the polarization cuts out glare and allows you to see the target on a bright, shiny day. The wrap around feature allows a very comfortable fit and has the effect of preventing light coming in from behind you from getting inside the glasses frame and reflecting back into your eyes. These glasses help the fishierman for the same reasons listed above, such as cutting out all glare, but also allow the fisherman to see down into the water, which is invaluable to a fisherman.   $39 for these glasses is just about half price.

The barrel was cut down to roughly 23 inches, sporter stock that's in rough shape. It seems to originally have been the long rifle variant, the bolt was bent down during the sporteriztion process. Bolt, barrel and reciever all match. Still in the original 7x57mm chambering. I've not fired the rifle, but mechanically everything seems in order. Finish is present, but there's a rust, though it seems to be only surface level. Bore seems good, no pitting as far as I can see. I can meet locally, I will not ship it. It comes with 20 rounds of Sellier and Bellot fmjs and possibly a bayonet accuate to the rifle (though I believe it may be older than the rifle itself)."

I wouldn't want to shoot many 12g rounds in a gun as small and light as this !). This is a very cool little unit, in minty,low-miles condition, and runs perfectly. The barrel is 20"" long, but feels shorter. Baikal is an old and respected Russian firearms manufacturer, and their weapons have almost universally excellent reviews. The shotgun has a very nice glossy blued finish, and the stock set is a gorgeous walnut (it looks MUCH nicer in person than it does in this bleached-out photo).  Included is the original box,manual, and accessories (chokes,tool).Also included are several boxes of ammo, mostly some Federal and Remington target loads, as well as some Federal buckshot, and some Winchester slugs (nearly 100 rds total), making this is an excellent Zombie Apocalypse starter kit !!Asking $300,firm, no trades (unless maybe it's a deal too good to pass up). Buyer must be legal to own firearms, and be legal Georgia resident with ID. As always, I'll show my Ga DL and carry permit. To avoid the scammers, please try and sound like a legitimate local buyer, or I'll simply ignore the message (like asking if I still have it, or asking me to text/call a distant area code).Thanks for looking......(edit: Local FTF cash only, no shipping/checks/travel.

I replaced the cam module last year with the updated version because the old one was cutting into the serving. I also have a new cable that bowtech sent with the cam module that I never got around to putting it on. The bow is in great shape and it has an Octane rest, Truglo three pin sight, Octane stabilizer, wrist strap, peep sight, and d-loop. I will also throw in the 4 Redhead x5 envy arrows with the 100 grain Rage broadheads if you want them. My favorite part about the bow is that the riser is carbon fiber so it doesn't make your hands cold like the typical aluminum riser bows. I bought it new in 2015 from Bass Pro and I am selling it because I only shoot my longbow and I don't use my compound anymore."

983,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7963983,For Sale:  IBM - AO M1 Carbine .30 Caliber WWII USGI,"doltha AL, Kentucky, United States",$ 800,"Listed On: Monday, February 12, 2018",Rifles,no type,30-30 Winchester                                                                                ,Lever Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is  a beautiful WW2 era M1 Carbine manufactured by the IBM Corporation. IBM-made M1 Carbines have long been sought after for a variety of reasons, one of them being the nostalgia that a company that ended up being known world-wide for making computers actually made carbines for the war effort. This M1 Carbine is what it is. I have no idea where it has been. It is simply an IBM U.S. M1 .30 Caliber carbine, stamped with an ""AO"" (built by subcontractor Auto Ordinance) marked receiver and original IBM Corp undated barrel.  Warning: Do not take this IBM technology into your local Apple Store for service. They just don't have a sense of humor!All kidding aside; explaining the true and correct history of this unique piece of technology will make even a liberal sit up, pay attention, and actually think!   YES, I AM IBM CERTIFIED! Any questions? This Carbine comes with an original IBM ""OI B"" marked 15 round magazine that was in the carbine when it was originally presented to me. I added (upgraded to) an additional single 30 round ""high capacity"" magazine that is marked only with ""Made in U.S.A."" (one that I had for years) to this display, simply because it was the proper thing to do to demonstrate my ""proper respect"" for the state of California's ban on high capacity magazines. It too will ship with this carbine. Note: Should you live in a liberal socialist state that doesn't like these particular magazines, give me a call and we CAN/WILL work something out!      A little statistical information on the I.B.M. M1 Carbine:   Main Manufacture and identification codes: ""B""   Main plant location: Poughkeepsie, NY.   Average Cost to U.S. Government per completed rifle, $42.29   I.B.M. only made 350,000 +/- units during the production run of the M1 Carbine, or about 5.7% of all M1 Carbines made. An even smaller percentage of those carbines were made from the receivers produced for IBM by Auto Ordnance.    Below is the information on the internal components in this fine IBM M1 Carbine: IBM manufactured only 346,500 M1 Carbines in one assigned serial number block, accounting for approximately 5.7% of total M1 production during the war. IBM's assigned letter code was ""B."" This carbine has an IBM marked receiver bearing serial number (3880433) which places its date of manufacture in the January to March 1944 time period. It has an IBM marked 18” barrel with a shiny bore, post front sight, and the early Type 1 rear flip sight, and a fantastic (considering its age and history) an early high wood with ""I"" cut variety of walnut or birch stock that I believe is an arsenal replacement stock. The serial number is visible so you too can look up and verify the date of manufacture. The Barrel has the later IBM characteristic circumferential milling lines along the length except for the gas cylinder area and the front sight area. The barrel is marked ""I.B.M. CORP."" in clear visible stamped letters. There is no date on the barrel because IBM ceased dating their barrels after December 1943. There is a small ""P"" firing proof approximately halfway down the length of the barrel on top. The Barrel Band is a later Type 2 wide type, marked ""AI"" (for Inland or one of its subcontractors), and this carbine shows no sign of ever being ""upgraded"" to accommodate the wider Barrel Band with the bayonet lug. The post Front Sight is that is fabricated and is marked on the left side with an ""IA"". The rear flip sight is marked ""S"" on the right side.    The trigger housing is Type 2 single bevel marked ""Q-NL"",  which were made by Quality Hardware. The trigger markings are not visible or unmarked, and the hammer is marked ""WA"" for Winchester. This carbine still has the original unmarked ""Push Button Safety"". The slide is a Type III (Arm Joint 19/32"") marked clearly with a ""UN"" and also has a very faint ""O1(?)"" stamp indicating that it is National Postal Meter (Underwood) located in the center of the piston well. The flat bolt is marked ""AI"" (Inland). It should also be noted that I was reminded by another extremely knowledgeable collector that there is often a difference between an all matching carbine and how it left the factory, as many M1 Carbine contractors shipped parts to other Contractors. Just because it has all matching doesn't necessary mean that is how it left the factory. So it's also possible that is exactly how it was when it left the factory! (An example, say Underwood was low on sears, Inland would ship some Sears to them. Sometimes marked or unmarked). There are known and documented shipments of bolts to I.B.M. (Inland shipped approximately 10,000 bolts to I.B.M. in late 1943), however there could be more shipments that occurred that are unknown. but this is a good reference. The dark matching high wood stock and two rivet upper hand guard are not marked by or for any contractor or subcontractor. While I do believe that it is not an factory original stock, and while I have been told many different things as to where this stock originated from, I believe this stock is an armory replacement of presentation quality done by Springfield Armory. I have been told that the ""boxed S.A. over FLJ"" cartouche makes this an ""import"", while others disagree, however I have yet to find anyone who has ever seen documentation or knows of this ""importer"", or even of anything close (again; I have been told a great many things over the years). This M1 Carbine stock also has the ""Crossed Cannons Cartouche"" on the right rear side of the stock just forward of the ""I"" cut sling well. There is also a ""circle P"" acceptance proof on the bottom base of the curved hand grip. The wood is dark and clean, however has a few very minor dings here and there from the many excursions to and from numerous data centers over the years. The hard wood is sound. with no soft spots or deep imperfections.To find a complete I.B.M. M1 Carbine .30 caliber with all ""match-able"" parts is amazingly rare, and assures its maximum ""collector/safe queen"" value. I have indeed had a few of those in my day and this carbine is neither. I will say that this is the finest looking carbine I have ever owned. I have never fired this weapon because ""it just looks so nice on the wall"". The past 10 years that I have been living in the Nevada desert, it has been stored ""dry"" (with no lubrications or grease) because of the dirt and dust in the dry desert air (it's nasty and gritty when it settles on oiled parts). Should the new owner decide to take this to the range to run a few rounds through it, I would first apply a liberal coat of gun oil and grease to the appropriate areas and parts. Check out the photos and see for yourself. This is truly one of those rare opportunities to own a “one of a kind” collectible. This is a fabulous M1 Carbine and it will be the envy of all you choose to let handle it.You can contact me via my personal email....newleetonytharpe@gmail.com"
