It has lots of extras including FAB Defense GL-Shock, FAB Defense MWG Mag. Well Ext. Grip, Aftermarket Pistol Grip, extended charging handle. The RRA upper has had less than 100 rounds through it and it is very accurate. The scope is a Nikon Prostaff held in place by a M223 xr scope mount. It has worked perfectly for me. There are YouTube vids of people shooting deer at 450 yds. Far as I am concerned, out to 175-200 yards you are ethical (if you practice with it) but I would not go beyond that.   Three possible configurations: $1,199 with everything (except bipod) or $999 without the scope or mount or $749.00 for just the upper without scope or mount.  If you want the bipod, add $49.00.  If you want 20-25 rounds hand-loaded (Hornady FTX 325gr) add $50 to the price and I wll send them along. (The rounds are what made those holes in the paper and bigger holes in the deer I took this year and they are right.)   The target in the picture was shot just before deer season 2017 at 100 yrds under much less than optimal conditions. The top group are almost touching and the second group are within an inch and those were made at last light. This rifle hits where you aim.   NOTE: I will only ship to a FFL dealer and the shipping fees will be added to the cost of the rifle. I will not ship until I receive payment and payment clears. Money orders will be accepted but they will be checked. I have had buyer try to rip me off with very real looking money orders. Never had worked yet because I check them out. Not suspicious, but not stupid either. Most people are honest but this place seems to draw the other type so I am cautious. I will not ship until the money is in hand. If you are close by and want to see the weapon, I will meet you are our local police department and you can look all you want. No negotiating these prices. I am conflicted about selling this rifle as is and I have room in my safe for it and am not needing to sell it. If you don't think it is a fair price, understood but it is ""my"" price.   I am not a big fan of trading so I doubt I will be interested. If you have a really nice 7 mm Remington magnum rifle, maybe."

Check out Berettausa for much better info.  If the email is up, it's still available.  The only reason I'm selling it is I'm thinning out the herd a bit and I have another.  Thanks for looking.  $1250 / nego."

Also, the Obama-era bans that ended the importation of Russian firearms like the Saigas, also affected these.I got this in a trade with a good buddy a while back, who bought it new at Shooters. It was a favorite toy for a while, but now it's just sitting around, and I could use the money to get into another toy.My buddy shot a couple snakes in his yard, then just parked it in his safe for a couple years, and I've shot another 40+ rounds through it since I got last year, that's about it.The gun has chromed bores, is in near-new condition, very clean and very tight, and runs flawlessly. The bluing and walnut stocks are gorgeous, this is a very nice piece, and a very cool little gunIncluded is the orginal box,manual and other factory stuff, as well as several 25-rd boxes of bird shot, and at least a couple boxes of Federal buckshot, and a box of Winchester slugs (a pretty decent pile of ammo).I tested the Federal buckshot myself through this gun, and it prints a consistently-spread, shoulder-wide pattern out at 19 yards (which was better combat-effective distance than I expected, but that's probably about it's max effective range).Buyer must be legal to own firearms, and be a legal Ga resident with valid ID. As always, I'll show my Ga DL and carry permit. I'm ok with a bill of sale, or not.Anything sounding like scammer questions will be ignored (asking if I still have it, or if I'll ship, or asking me to text a distant area code,etc.)Price is $300,firm. Mostly looking to sell, but might consider interesting trades, can't hurt to ask, you never know!Thanks for looking.......(edit: YES, IF THE AD IS STILL UP, THEN I STILL HAVE IT!!

Here is your treat! Manufactured in May of 1943, this rifle has weathered 73 years quiet well.  All of the number identified parts of this rifle are Springfield Armory. Receiver (4/43-7/43), Bolt (10/44-12/44), Trigger Assembly (5/41-7/42), Hammer (9/40-6/42), Op rod (1/36-12/57), and Safety (10/40-7/41). Barrel is a Springfield Armory part but from 2/55. The stock and sling are likely not original based on their condition being too nice for being 77 years old.  I hope I can load more than one or two pictures, because there shows no wear on any of the parts. If you are seriously interested I can email you pictures and part ID numbers.  This rifle was also inspected and certified by the CMP, but the certificate has no grade rating on it.  Package comes with rifle, sling, CMP hard case, manual, CMP Certificate of Authenticity, and 4 loaded enblocs.  I just ran 6 enblocs (48 rounds) through this rifle today (12/4/2017) hitting 12oz. water bottles at 100 yds. with very few misses. The picture of the muzzle explains why; the barrel looks new inside.  Muzzle wear is .5 and Throat wear at 3 out of 10, and Headspace checks good.  All measure well within spec. I feel at $1299 a buyer can have a lot of fun with this rifle, and with care can always recover or gain value on the investment. Cash is the accepted method of payment. I will not ship this rifle; only face to face transaction. Transaction must comply with all state and federal firearms sales rules and regulations. NO TRADES! Rifle is sold in as is condition and carries no expressed or implied warranty."

The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operators forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.  Features:  - Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.  - ATF compliant*  - Veteran designed  - Made in USA  - Quick and easy to install  * ATF has reviewed this product and determined that attaching the SB15 to a firearm does not alter the classification of the firearm or subject the firearm to NFA control."
