I do have the box, test target, two mags , the cleaning rods, paperwork etc....    like I said the gun feels great, shoots great, and is accurate. The cz p10 c does fit in all glock 19 holsters just a FYI      These guns are very hard to find in stock right now.    I will take 600 cash or will consider trading for a glock 19 with upgrades   I do do have my Missouri ccw license im located in Columbia mo but will drive a reasonable ways down 70 to meet up.    I've probably made 30 gun deals with folks in STL and every one has been pleased with meeting point and transaction."

Wanted to leave in orginal state. This gun was oringinally setup as a bench rifle with with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes for the mounts on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina around the holes) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very accurate rifle, bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1840-1861. Barrel is marked with J - F, believed to be Jacob Fordeny, he was a gun maker from Lancaster Penn. 1837-1857 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel, under the rear sight. Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. I am willing to part with the old dog for the right deal. I have seen these priced 700-3500$ Im not wanting to break the bank just a fair trade and hoping to send to a good home. I am open to trades for other firearms. I am looking for a Glock 19 gen 4/5, Browning Hi-power, or a decent 1911. email or text 918-4o2-o854"

Get instant response with all-day comfort.– Steering Lock: When you take your foot off Ultrex’s foot pedal, the motor head remains pointed in the direction you left it last – so you can keep your heading without loosing your bite. There’s no recoil or readjustment – just easier steering every day.– Ultrex Foot Pedal: The Ultrex foot pedal is like nothing you’ve ever used. Classic heel/toe steering with Power Steering gives you instant response without the fatigue. Steering Lock keeps the motor pointed in the direction you left it last when your foot leaves the pedal. Features Spot-Lock and AutoPilot buttons directly on the foot pedal, so you can lock onto a fishing spot or set a course directly from the foot pedal.– Lift-Assist: Lift-Assist’s stainless steel, nitrogen-charged gas spring makes stow and deploy easy. When you deploy, let go of the motor and Lift-Assist will gradually guide it into the water – quickly, but without impact. And stowing your motor is 50% easier – as easy as lifting your SUV tailgate.– Counter-Tension Stabilizer: Utilizes an integrated spring that applies force whether the motor is stowed or deployed. On the water, that translates to a motor with no play, no give, reduced steering torque and years of silent operation.– Digital Mazimizer: Motors with Digital Maximizer provide up to five times longer run time on a single charge by drawing only as much power as you need, so they don’t waste any energy. These motors are variable speed, so dial in your precise speed and let Digital Maximizer deliver the right amount of power, while conserving your battery – extending your time on the water.– Weedless Wedge 2 Prop: Push weeds away and take on the thick stuff without battery-draining chopping and hacking. Weedless Wedge 2 features swept-back, flared blades for unrelenting, reliable prop performance.– Advantage Minn Kota: Indestructible Composite Shaft: Pound for pound, our composite shaft is stronger than steel. It flexes on impact and won’t break, kink or corrode.– Cool, Quiet, Power:Nothing runs cooler or quieter than a Minn Kota. The extra large windings and commutators dissipate heat, resulting in cooler operation, extended battery power, and longer motor life. And the unique bearing system reduces friction to cut fish-spooking noise. Specifications: – Control: Remote and Foot Pedal– Volts: 36– Max Thrust: 112 lbs.– Shaft Length: 45″– i-Pilot– Universal Sonar 2– Speed Control: Variable– AutoPilot: Incl. on i-Pilot– Max.

It is designed to be used with both eyes open, providing the operator with maximum situational awareness. The large aperture and tapered light path maximizes the viewing area in such a small optic, allowing for fast target engagement – especially from non-standard shooting positions. Advanced lens coatings and electronics produce a crisp red dot. The brightness control dial on the MRO is specifically designed for ambidextrous usage. With a mid-adjustment “off” position and eight discernible brightness settings, this brightness dial allows for quick and ergonomic adjustments. The MRO features fully protected adjusters that maintain zero even during rough handling, and can be adjusted without the need for special tools. Hard-anodized, forged 7075-T6 housing is fully sealed and waterproof, providing durability in demanding conditions.
