The Model 028 Cozy Partner Holster from DeSantis is a compact, durable and easily concealed holster that deserves a spot on every gun enthusiast's belt. Designed to rest as closely to the body as possible, the holster features exterior belt loops that allow it to be secured behind the belt. A flat back prevents any bruising caused by hard gun parts and helps to prevent any side-to-side movement. The easily concealed Cozy Partner is crafted from top-grade saddle leather that has been tanned and treated to perfection so it can be displayed with pride when discretion is not essential. Each holster is custom-molded and features a tension screw system for secure pistol retention that can be adjusted to user preference. A memory band integrated into the holster's mouth helps it keep its shape for effortless reholstering."

I haven't shot it, but I cleaned off the cosmoline except for a faint scent from the wood, so I can only assume the only time it's been fired is by the slavic conscripts making it. I think it's actually a M48B from the trigger guard being stamped (I THINK) but it's still marked as an A. Has the cleaning rod, wood has some scuffs around the takedown band but no cracks, all matching numbers, and the barrels got an import mark along with the receiver. Bluing has wear, but it's milsurp and not some 4k Kar98k with some SS marks or anything. Bore's nice and shiny.I'm more than willing to ship, but since it's a (((bit))) larger than a handgun I'd like to keep it to the continental US. This gun isn't worth an extra 100 to ship to Hawaii or Guam. So probably $35 shipping. And you're going to need an FFL willing to accept from a private seller along with being able to pass a 4473."

I have a Patriot Ordinance Factory P308 Gen 4, 16"" barrel, for sale. As a very experienced used of US Army M110 SASS I will say this. The P308 is better in almost every way. Lighter, much more reliable and just as accurate. The P308 is almost new. Only 500 rounds through it, shows almost no signs of wear. It has been 100% reliable. It will come fully loaded and ready to shoot. Just throw your favorite 30MM Scope on there and have at it. It will come iwth a Spuhr Ideal Scope Mount, model SP-3001. The lower height of this mount sets up the perfect cheek weld for the P308 and is widely known as one of the best mounts on the market. Worth $400. It has a Surefire War Comp on there. Perfect blend of muzzle control and flash supression. I is ready to go for a Surefire socom supressor or a Surefire Warden. Worth $134.

The buttstock is precision formed for mil-spec receiver extensions to have very little forward or lateral play that is so common in many other buttstocks. This eliminates the need for a tensioning device or friction lock. All of this results in a durable buttstock that will give the shooter a comfortable and repeatable cheek weld and unprecedented control of the firearm. The buttstock can be run with one of two included buttpads or without any buttpad at all to custom fit the rifle to whatever gear the operator must wear. The buttpads come in two sizes: a thicker convex shape (0.8""), and a thinner concave shape (0.5""); designed to keep from snagging when shouldering the rifle. Limited rotation QD swivel attachment points are integrated on both sides of the buttstock for ambidextrous sling connection. Specifications: - Black - 7"" Long - 5.5"" Tall - 1.75"" Thick - Weight: 0.50 lb. - For Mil-Spec receiver extension tubes Pistol Grip: The Daniel Defense pistol grip is an improvement to the old standby A2. The grip was designed with ergonomics and controllability in mind. The grip shares the angle of the classic 1911 pistol for the most natural hand position and comfortable feel. This pistol grip incorporates an oversized trigger guard covering the gap between grip and lower receiver which can wear on the shooters hand and easily accommodates for gloves. Installation is simplified by the fact the integral trigger guard doesn't require a roll pin so there is a reduced chance of damaging the lower receiver. A soft touch overmolding section enhances grip, wet or dry. Specifications: - Black - 4.25"" Tall - 2"" Wide  - 1.38"" Thick - Weight: 0.20 lb.  Vertical Grip: Updated in 2014, the improved vertical grip now includes soft touch rubber overmolding for enhanced grip, wet or dry. Inside the grip is a Dual O-Ring, water tight storage compartment capable of storing small parts. This vert grip is extremely lightweight and utilizes a simple yet durable mounting method. Specifications: - Black - 4.5"" Tall - 2"" Wide  - 1.38"" Thick - Weight: 0.15 lb."
