Troy, a company that knows its way around fighting black rifles, has answered the call for a fully functional MSR that delivers uncompromising performance and accuracy, and they’ve packaged it in a form that most of us know and respect. The PAR remains true to its AR-15 roots, and it is 50 state legal.Before we get too far in, let’s clear up some confusion. Some early press and comments on this gun implied, mistakenly, that this was simply a pump action AR-15. PAR stands for pump action rifle–not pump AR-15. It is an honest mistake, I think, and one I caught myself making, at least causally. The Troy Sporting Rifle is not, despite the visual similarities, an AR-15. The Troy Sporting Rifle is clearly a branch on the AR family tree—but AR means ArmaLite  Rifle, and this, dear readers, is a Troy. Even if you were to use the relaxed nomenclature associated with the abbreviation AR, (like automatic rifle, or–worse–assault rifle,) you’d still be off.  This is a pump gun meant for sporting purposes. The upper and lower of the PAR are not interchangeable with those of the AR-15; ergo, this is not an AR. This is, however, a truly fine example of a modern sporting rifle. And it will be instantly familiar to those of you who know your way around black semi-automatic modular “assault” rifles built in the style of ArmaLite and hundreds of others."

Add up the $412 for the gun and two magazines, $132 for four additional magazines, $40 for the holster and mag holder, some shipping for the magazines and holster/mag holder, plus your FFL transfer fee puts you at $584+. You can buy this complete package from me with only 50 rounds through it for $350. I am offering this excellent condition Springfield XD-S 9mm and the entire package shown in the picture as I move to keeping my older S&W revolvers as my carry conceal guns. I bought this XD-S in May of this year and didn't take it out to the range until August. I took it out one day when I was shooting my Kahr and put 50 rounds (25 Federal and 25 Hornady XTP self defense) through it for comparison purposes. They are both great shooters and reliable, with the XD-S having the advantage from a capacity aspect. This package includes the XD-S 9mm pistol and six stainless steel factory magazines (one 7 round, three 8 round, and two 9 round.) The 7 round and one of the 8 round magazines were used when I test fired the gun, but the two other 8 round and the two 9 round magazines have never been used. This also comes with two interchangeable back-straps that allow you to custom fit your grip, a cable lock, and a bore brush, all inside of a lockable hard case. Caliber: 9mmWeight: 23 oz.Barrel: Melonite®; Fully Supported RampSights: Steel Dovetail Rear; Fiber Optic FrontSlide: Forged Steel, Melonite FinishFrame: Black PolymerOverall Height with Magazine: 4.4”Overall Length: 6.3”Overall Width: .9” This gun is in excellent condition, having been only fired one day before being cleaned and stored ever since in a treated gun rug. The only marks are the standard wear on the top of the barrel hood, but that is something every Springfield (and Glock) I have seen show after the first dozen rounds. This XD-S came with a red tinted locking pin block. I thought it might have been a special model as the red tint looks pretty cool, but since my first XD-S didn't have this color I sent pics in an email to the Springfield factory. They indicated the red tint sometimes can occur during the bluing process, but they sent me a new one anyway. I had no reason to change it since it looks good and performs as it should so it comes in this package deal.

Additional 6 round magazines are $30 each.Add up the $340 for the gun and one magazine, $60 for two additional magazines, $10 for the Hogue grip sleeve, some shipping for the magazines and grip sleeve, plus your FFL transfer fee puts you at $410+. You can buy this complete package from me with only the 200 break-in rounds through it for $275.I bought this Kahr CM in July of this year intending to make it my carry conceal gun. I bought an additional magazine (it is still new in package) and used the one that came with it and the additional one Kahr was offering. I also purchased and installed a new Hogue Handall Jr. rubber grip sleeve for the Kahr.This Kahr is in excellent condition and, while not new, is as nice as you will find in a used gun. Over the summer I put the suggested 200 break-in rounds through it (150 rounds of store bought Federal 9mm and 50 rounds of Hornady 9mm XTP hollow points) without a single issue and have stored it ever since.I have decided to carry my older S&W Model 49 and 36 S&W revolvers so I am offering this Kahr and a Springfield XD-S for sale. This package comes with the gun, three magazines, Hogue Handall Jr. rubber grip sleeve, box, and paperwork. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine.The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale.

The officer owned a huge collection of various type guns, so none of them saw much use. This particular revolver was fired on a few special outings, but never carried, and was eventually stored in a protective gun rug until it was sold.The serial number indicates this gun to be of late 1976-early 1977 vintage. It is a S&W factory nickel plated steel .38 Special with a 2"" pinned barrel, shrouded hammer, and five shot capacity. The gun is striking to admire, but it is also a wonderful shooter. I took it out to the gun range and put 25 rounds through it (have to shoot all of the vintage guns!) I was so impressed with both the single and double action trigger pull and accuracy. I can see why these Model 49's with the shrouded hammer were such popular carry conceal weapons by law enforcement officers.As was the case with many officer owned revolvers back then, this gun had its original grips taken off at initial purchase at an officer-frequented gun shop, discarded as many thousands were, and replaced with different grips. Those custom grips eventually found their way to a different revolver owned by the officer and another set of wood grips were put on this gun. I thought those grips were functional but not attractive, so I replaced them with some S&W grips I purchased so it now has the grips you see in the attached pictures that are nice but not numbered to the gun.This gun is in very nice condition. As with any nickel plated gun that has been shot or stored, there are a few handling marks on the gun but none that take away from its brilliant shine and eye appeal. The bore and chambers are bright, shiny, and clean. It is much too pretty for me to carry conceal, so I will carry a couple of S&W revolvers that have ""more character"" and won't mind a few more carry marks. In fact, I bought a blued and much less pristine condition Model 49 to use as part of my S&W revolver conceal carry rotation. This Model 49 will come enclosed in its very own Bore Stores fitted and treated gun rug.Before you go any further, please verify that you meet the following conditions and are willing and able to provide verifiable contact information in your initial correspondence.""Able to complete at this time a local face-to-face cash sale.
