Within minutes you have a modular, free-floated rail.Features:M4 Feedramps.250 takedown pin holesLazer engraved T-marksComes assembled, with dust cover and forward assist installedM4E1 Specific Details:Handguard mounting platform is forged into the receiverCompatible with Aero Precision Enhanced and Quantum Series handguards but also fits most BAR-system handguardsBarrel nut and wrench are includedThese uppers are not piston-kit compatibleWill support barrels with a diameter up to 1""Includes:AR15 M4E1 Upper Receiver in Anodized BlackPort Door and Forward Assist installedBarrel nutBarrel nut wrenchhttps://aeroprecisionusa.com/ar15-m4e1-enhanced-upper-receiver.htmlOur Enhanced M-LOK (EM) Handguards provide a lightweight free float design for your custom AR15 build.

Information from the main listing;
The field proven Vortex Viper HS LR has gained another extraordinary tool with the addition of the First Focal Plane Reticle. The HS LR was designed for long range shooting and now you can extend that range even further. The elevation turret features 1/4 MOA adjustments with 12 MOA/Revolution and 86 MOA of travel in windage and elevation. With a generous eye relief and ample field of view, the HS LR FFP is in a class of its own. The 30mm 1-piece tube is 100% weatherproof and the extra low dispersion glass is XR fully multi-coated for increased light transmission and maximum brightness. The HS LR also comes equipped with the CRS Zero stop to prevent dialing more than one rotation below your zero when dialing for extreme long range.
