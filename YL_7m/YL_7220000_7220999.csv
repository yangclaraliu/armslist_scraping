Spray to cool, clean, share, and drink. Ready for GEIGERRIG plug-n-play, on-the-go, in-line filtration. Reversible and dishwasher safe (top shelf). Really, it should be called a Personal Water System rather than a Hydration System. Why? Because a hydration system has come to be known as a plastic bag with a drink tube that can only be used for hydration for one person. The GEIGERRIG system dramatically expands the uses and access to water. BPA FREE – PTHALATE FREE. Features 1. The Engine: Slide Top, Water Tube, Air Tube, Reservoir, and Power Bulb. (Power bulb has a depressurization button, but you can also depressurize by disconnecting the tube from the bulb. Either way works just fine.) 2. Wide Mouth: The Engine has a large, wide-mouth opening for easy refill with water and ice. It also provide convenience for maintenance, cleaning and drying. 3. Slide Top: The Hydrapak Slide Top provides a very strong seal that is leak free and holds back the pressure of the GEIGERRIG system. 4. Quick Release Valves: The quick release valves allow you to easily disconnect the tubes and leave them positioned in the hydration pack while you remove the reservoir for filling and cleaning. 5. Filter Ready: Ready for plug-and-play, on-the-go, in-line water filtration using a GEIGERRIG filter or other in-line filters. The water found along the trail is now available for your use-ON-THE-GO! 6 and 7. Reversible and Dishwasher Safe: Reach down inside through the large wide-mouth opening, grab the port at the bottom of the Engine, and turn the system inside out for placement in the top shelf of the dishwasher or for easy cleaning in your sink.

Please click link below. http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/new-spyderco-ark-2-56-h1-steel-plain-frn-handle-with-sheath-black-fb35pbk/ ***Authorized Spyderco Dealer*** Description: The heart of the ARK is its deeply curved clip-point blade ground from H-1 steel. The curved edge and deep hollow grind ensure exceptional edge geometry and pack as much edge length as possible into the compact blade. Spyderco decided to invest in the tooling to mold a fiberglass-reinforced nylon (FRN) handle directly onto the blade’s tang. An FRN handle allowed the use of Spyderco’s proven Bi-Directional Texturing pattern, which provides unparalleled grip control even when wet. To ensure convenient, universal carry with any style of clothing (including none at all) the logical choice was to equip the ARK with a neck sheath supports the weight of the knife and resists the force of a rapid drawstroke, but cannot be turned against the wearer as a choking weapon like the paracord lanyards found on many neck knives. Features Blade Length: 2.5 inch Overall Length: 4.98 inch Blade Style: Clip-Point Blade Material: H-1 Stainless Steel Handle Material: G10 Weight: 2 oz. Includes: Neck Sheath ARK 2.56″ H1 Steel Plain FRN Handle With Sheath Black MODEL NUMBER: FB35PBK SPECIFICATIONS: Length Overall: 4.98″ (126 mm) Length Closed: N/A Blade Length: 2.56″ (65 mm) Blade Thickness: 0.080″ (2.0 mm) Blade Steel: H-1 Cutting Edge: 2.10″ (53 mm) Handle Material: FRN Weight: 0.9 oz (26 g) The ARK—or “Always Ready Knife—is a purpose-designed personal-defense knife conceived by U.S. Army combat veteran John Shirley and his friend Sam Owens. While deployed to Afghanistan, Shirley learned that an alarming number of U.S. personnel were falling victim to sexual assault, particularly while showering. Drawing from his knowledge of the Japanese martial arts and with the help of Owens’ skills as a craftsman, they developed the ARK as a lightweight self-defense tool that can literally be carried anywhere. To ensure universal carry, the ARK includes an injection-molded polymer neck sheath with a breakaway ball chain. Best of all, the ARK and its sheath together weigh only 2.0 ounces (57 grams), so you’ll hardly know it’s there—until you need it."

I had pipe dreams of getting into long range shooting and/or moose hunting, however my wife got pregnant so all my time went away and I never got around to getting into long range. The rifle is a Winchester Model 70 chambered in .300 Win Mag. It's had a bunch of work done to it by ""Tumbleweeds Custom Rifles"" out in Round Rock. The shop created a custom muzzle break for it which can be seen in more detail here (http://www.tumbleweedsrifles.com/BarrelAction.html). I've never seen anything like the muzzle break before... they cut a piece of the end of the barrel, thread the barrel and the piece, drill holes into the piece, and then reattach the piece (now the muzzle break) to the barrel. The machine work is so precise that it's impossible to see the line between the muzzle break and the barrel with the naked eye, so it looks like it's built into the barrel but you can unscrew it if you want to attach a suppressor. Other work by the shop includes jeweling the bolt, trigger work, and I believe the gun was ""blue printed"". I'm not an expert on bolt guns (this was my first entry into the area) so I don't know/understand what else has been done to it, but when I saw my buddy's buddy hit steel at 1100 yards with it I knew I wanted it. I bought the rifle for $1600 and then picked up about 100 rounds of various factory ammo along the way. The first $1400 cash gets it. I'm also interested in trades of equal value with cash on your side if needed (no cash on my side).I'm in Houston today (Saturday) visiting family and then I head back to Austin tomorrow morning, so I'd like to do something with this rifle today."

It allows you to swap your upper with a dedicated 22 upper. No swapping parts...just the slide.It makes it a lot more ecomical to go shoot a lot when you're using 22 instead of 45. It's a blued slide with an adjustable target rear sight. I've had it for several years now and just don't use it much anymore so I'm putting it up for sale. I have probably around 1000 to 1500 rds through it (estimate) but it shows no wear on the slide. You can see wear on the inside of the slide which looks normal. I'll ship anywhere in the US for $10 flat rate.

I was going to go with an MPX but wanted something I could customize more and came up with this. It is a 7.5"" upper with a 7"" Keymod rail. A big Ambi Raptor-style charging handle. I have the Maxim Defense deployable brace with the JP Silent Capture internals. The brace alone was $550. ATF approved braces to be ""shouldered"" without changing the configuration of your pistol. I threw some HK style front & rear irons on top along with a Sig Romeo 5 Red Dot optic which has an ""auto-on"" feature that turns on when you pick it up and shuts off after some time of no movement. I have a Magpul rubberized pistol grip added as well. The angled grip is a skeletonized Trinity Force grip which is an angled grip, I still have the package for it just for you to have that. It will come with one of the 33-round clear mags. A BOS is required for this build. I have easily $1500 into this build with everything listing and only looking to trade because I have a Kriss Vector that I have decided to SBR and I don't get to shoot this one. Only put about 90 rounds or so through it, just three mags and the red dot is zeroed in already. I am looking for a trade value of $1500 but would accept $1200 cash. Trades can include guns plus cash, sigs, Hk, glocks, Desert Eagle, Tavor, X95, Hk Mark 23 with a little cash on my end, Chiappa Rhino 200DS plus cash. Hk USP, just let me know what you have. Please make sure your offer for trade or trade plus cash is atleast $1500. Doesn't have to be dollar for dollar but don't offer a trade and cash that is $1200 or $1300. Not looking for bolt guns.
