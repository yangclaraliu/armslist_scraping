I wouldn't be surprised if it's never been fired. The barrel was packed with cosmoline when we got it. It has a cleaning kit also.  Looking to trade for milsurps but will entertain cash offers near my asking price.I'm asking $600 OBO. Send me an offer, worst I can say is no. Like I said, I'm not in a rush to get rid of it, but it doesn't fit my collection and I don't shoot it, so why not post it? For trades, mostly looking for all original WW1/2 stuff, German especially.

The subcompact model of the renowned P30 handgun, P30SK (SubKompact) series has all of the sought-after characteristics of the larger frame P30 and P30L pistols but in a more concealable design.
The completely adjustable P30 grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.
Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated de-cocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.
An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.
Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm.

It originally started out as their ""16 inch Recon (Gen 1)"" model (that complete factory upper is included also), and kind of grew from there. It's the smoothest shooting .308 I've ever fired, bar none. If I could compare it to an m1a... I wouldn't. My friend's Super Match kicks like an elephant compared to this gun! I no longer have the time to drive an hour to my nearest outdoor range to really shoot it the way it's meant to be shot, and there are better places for me to apply the money I have wrapped up in it at this point. I've replaced the upper with a 20"" Bull Barrel upper from Alpha Shooting Sports (came with Lantac Dragon muzzle device) and had the following components replaced in it:JP Rifles LMOS Bolt Carrier Group JP Rifles Enhanced Bolt ExtractorTac-Ops Oversized Charging HandleLower Receiver:JP Rifles ""Silent Capture"" Buffer (Gen 1) w/ complete, unused spring kit includedSeekins Precision Ambidextrous Safety Wilson Combat TR-TTU-M2 2-Stage Trigger GroupMagpul PRS Stock (Gen 1)JP Rifles Rear Tensioning Takedown PinMagpul Miad Pistol GripEnhanced Trigger GuardThe scope that comes with the rifle is a Trijicon Accupoint TR 22-2 w/ Amber mil-dot reticle. Its 2.5x10x56 w/ 30 mm tube. It also comes, mounted, on Trijicon Scope Mounts.The rifle also comes with a like new Blue Force Gear padded ""saw sling"", and a GG & G Heavy Duty QD Bipod.(6) 20 round Magpul mags; most have been stippled to some degree but are in like-new operating condition. I may also have more of them lying around, but I have (6) 20-rounders for sure.(1) 20-round factory DPMS mag (steel)Most, if not all, take off parts are included. It's two complete uppers, and then there'll be an extra factory trigger, extra charging handle, extra bolt carrier, factory buttstock (as well as spring and carbine length buffer), a2 flash hider, pistol grip, standard safety, insert grips for the miad, and then there's a vertical, adjustable pistol grip I'll include that I personally really didn't care for. Also included are 162 Federal military ""T762TNB1"" OTM rounds, as well as 11 Hornady low-recoil rounds (the silver ones in the pic).Round Count:Factory Recon Upper- 180 PMC Bronze .308 rounds, 100 Federal T762TNB1 7.62 rounds Alpha Upper- 38 Federal T762TNB1 rounds, 9 Hornady Fusion Low-Recoil roundsI have taken care of this firearm and have over $4200 dollars invested into it since I first bought it from Cabela's 3 years ago; with that said, I feel like $3300 is more than a fair asking price.

Built around a 9”, Cold Hammer Forged barrel that is fluted along with a target crown and a standard pistol-length gas system, this versatile, high-performance rifle is the complete package, accurately delivering both subsonic and supersonic projectiles downrange with unrelenting reliability. Because the suppressor is an integral part of the barrel, this weapon system is ready for service right out of the box. There’s no attaching a suppressor and wondering if it’s mounted correctly and/or properly aligned. There’s no re-zeroing for suppressed vs. unsuppressed fire. The DDM4ISR’s integral suppressor extends the barrel to an NFA-required 16 inches in length, so this platform is not classified as a Short Barreled Rifle (SBR) and therefore only requires a single tax stamp (for the suppressor). The suppressor’s lightweight outer tube is constructed of durable, heat-resistant metal alloys and coated with a protective high-temperature Cerakote-C finish, which is able of withstanding extreme temperatures and harsh environments. The suppressor is also user-serviceable, so its baffle core can be easily removed for periodic cleaning in order to maintain peak performance. The DDM4ISR comes standard with Daniel Defense’s MFR XL 15.0 modular handguard, which features a continuous 1913 Picatinny rail on its top, for the mounting of iron sights or optics, and Keymod attachment points on the sides and bottom. This longer, multi-functional handguard, in conjunction with a Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip, make the DDM4ISR as ergonomic and maneuverable as it is versatile. A resilient, attractive Mil Spec + Cerakote finish not only protects this weapon system from the elements, it also adds to its overall aesthetics—so while you’re sending rounds down range; you’ll also turn a few heads. NFA DISCLAIMER This firearm is a regulated item by the National Firearms Act (NFA). Please check with your local and state municipalities for any further regulatory requirements. It is the buyer’s responsibility to make sure they comply with all NFA rules and applicable laws. MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION Precision crafted from the highest quality material available today with meticulous attention to detail, the DDM4 is a proven benchmark in the industry; The DDM4ISR takes it a step beyond what other manufacturers UPPER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Indexing Marks and M4 Feed Ramps LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point UPPER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Indexing Marks and M4 Feed Ramps.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" OAL and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3"" rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1.75"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube which is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail accepts many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward. Specifications Action: Pump Gauge: 12 Gauge Barrel Length: 18.5"" Capacity: 12+1 Chamber: 3"" OAL: 26.1"" Weight: 6.9 lbs Stock Description: Synthetic Gray Metal Finish: Gray Recoil Pad Type: Rubber Sights: None, Optic Ready Chokes Included: Fixed Cylinder BoreWAS $869.99 NOW $799.99 WILL SHIPEMAIL OR CALL 314-252-0GUNWE ARE NOW OPEN COME SEE US TUES-FRI 10AM-6PM, SAT 10AM-4PMLOCATED AT 2745 HIGH RIDGE BLVD SUITE 6 HIGH RIDGE, MO 63049.
