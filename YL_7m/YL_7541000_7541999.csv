About the Tikka T3 300 Win Mag:  Awesome rifle, about .6 moa with factory trigger, maybe better. I have only fired one type of bullet through it, and not many of those, fewer than 15, and I have not adjusted the factory trigger. The ammo is Federal's Fusion 180 grain bullet. I'm sure rifle is capable of even finer accuracy. Only 14 rounds put through it. Stored in gunsafe inside the air conditioned home, the rifle Includes factory rings and original box it came in. Rifle has upgraded Kick-eez recoil pad, a $45 pad plus install. If you are not familiar with Kick-Eez recoil pads, they are a step or ahead in quality of a Limbsaver and will definitely outlast a limbsaver, and they are decades ahead of a simple Pahmeyer, which I have had on guns before and won't use again. You will great ly appreciate this recoil pad. The pad makes a noticeable difference in recoil and will outlast a Limbsaver. I still have the original factory pad that came with the gun.  Rifle is in excellent condition, and has good mineal streaking lines (figure) for a standard factory rifle.  The pictures don't do this rifle justice. You will see and appreciate the mineral streaking lines better when you hold the rifle in your hands. This is an excellent gun light for carry in the mountains and thick forests, and is highly manueverable, yet you can still make a long shot with it and make it count! 24.3 inch barrerl. Call or text me at REDACTED.  JeffNOTE: Value of Kick-eez installed is $100, as pad is $45, the rest was labor. I will include a box and roughly a half of the Federal Fusion 180 grain bullets which cost $32 a box I think. I used just enough to sight it in at 200 yds and shot one deer with it. The bullets are good for deer and elk, and have a high enough BC that they will reach about 550-600 yds and still expand. It's good ammo and is included in the price of the gun. So, you save this way, big time. Gun was 659, plus 100 for the pad installed, and about $50 worth of ammo, so that's $809 except that you get it all for 600, and I have the original rings (pictured) and the box it came in.  IT'S ACCURATE AND GOOD WOOD FIGURE. You can't beat all that! Give me a text or call. REDACTED. Thanks. JeffNOTE: I am selling it cause I am getting ready to buy a house and make a move. I need the money."

That’s a shame because it’s ultra-slim for concealed carry and small enough to easily disappear in any pocket or purse.The full package comes with everything that came from the factory (as shown in photo) and includes the two factory 6-round mags with flush baseplates installed (and a couple of extra pinkie extensions), a ProMag 10-round magazine, lock, soft carry case, box and all paperwork.

RARE SS192 “Green Ammo” was produced for ONLY 3 months before FN turned to the SS195LF. The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

496,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7541496,For Sale:  French Model 1924 .8 Cal,"Raeford, Fayetteville, North Carolina",$ 400,"Listed On: Tuesday, November 28, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a French Mc. Armes .8 cal French handgun manufactured in 1924. This handgun is in great shape for its age and everything seems to function as it should. The handgrips are original. This was purchased at an auction and I am no longer keeping it in my collection. Below is some listed information regarding this firearm.
The modèle (mle.) 1892 is commonly referred to as the “Lebel” revolver or the “St. Etienne.”  The latter makes sense as the revolvers are stamped “St. Étienne” but the former is a misunderstanding as Nicholas Lebel does not appear to have played a part in their development.
Production began in its namesake year and continued until 1924.  Barrels have been dated up to 1930 but these are refurbished revolvers.  Manufacture date is stamped right on the barrel, so no confusion for collectors.  M1892s served with the French armed forces through WWI until they were officially retired in 1935.  WWII, however, had other ideas and the pistols were not completely replaced until after 1945.  In many places formally under French rule they remained in service well into the 1960s.  Commercial models, Belgian, and Spanish-made copies also abound with slight variations of fitting, markings, and caliber.  Using the mle. 1892 is a mix of old and new revolver styles.  The internal mechanism should be very familiar to American shooters but the operation will seem a bit odd.  To load the gun pull back on the lever on the right side of the frame behind the cylinder; yes the one that looks exactly like a loading gate.  This, surprisingly, will release the swing-out cylinder.  Now gape openly as it drops out of the right side of the revolver.  This is a left-handed shooters dream.  Insert your ammo, close the cylinder and you’re ready to fire.  The revolver may be used in single or double action.  Once done the spent casings are ejected using a single ejecting rod set in the center of the cylinder.
