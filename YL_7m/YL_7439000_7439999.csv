This is one of the original M45A1 pistols that was manufactured for the United States Marine Corps. A modified variation of the famous Colt 1911, the M45A1 was adopted by the Marines in 2012 with its intended users being the USMC Special Operations unit, including Force Recon. After some service in Afghanistan & Iraq it was deemed that the Cerakote finish used on the pistol was not quite durable enough for the Marines. The original pistols were sent back to the factory in exchange for M45A1 pistols with an improved finish. This was a boon to collectors as Colt was then free to sell these surplus pistols on the commercial market. These original military pistols were ""decommissioned"" by engraving an ""X"" through the USMC marking on the left side of the slide. The ""U.S."" property marking on the right side of the frame is not defaced. The M45A1 is constructed of stainless steel finished in tan Cerakote. It features a distinctive M1913 Picatinny rail along the underside of the frame and is factory fitted with a set of G10 grips. It has a National Match barrel, front & rear slide serrations, a long solid aluminum trigger, enhanced hammer, upswept beavertail grip safety with palm swell, ambidextrous safety, flat serrated mainspring housing with lanyard loop, and Novak Low Mount Carry three-dot night sights. When decommissioned, there were two groups of pistols...those that had been issued, many showing significant wear...and those that has not yet been issued.This pistol is in excellent overall condition. I'd grade the original Cerakote finish at about 99% with just a few small marks on the front grip strap. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent. The night sights are still bright. One magazine is included. It comes in the original factory box which numbers to the gun. Also included are two Colt factory documents. One is a Colt letter which indicates this pistol was originally sold to the United States Marine Corps. The second document gives some history behind the M45A1 and describes its features.It is interesting to note that these are the first new Colt 1911 pistols to be purchased by the United States military since the end of WWII in 1945. Being adopted for the second time, over a century after initial adoption, speaks volumes to the timeless design of the 1911...the greatest battle pistol ever devised. A must-have for the serious 1911 collector!Buyer pays $25.00 shipping."

And this time it’s a fierce one. We all know what happened in Las Vegas by now, but many do not know there has been legislative action brought forth in a bill by a REPUBLICAN named Carlos Curbelo. This bill goes beyond AR rifles or AK’s. This is going to involve everyone, even deer hunters. The bill that has been introduced does not just ban “bump-stocks” it will ultimately ban all semi-auto rifles and pistols. The bill is very loosely written and does not even mention the term “bump-stock”. It states it will ban “parts that is designed and functions to increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle”, which will mean triggers, disconnects etc. I am asking you to please be involved with this process because we cannot solely rely on president Trump or the NRA. Representatives need to hear the voice of WE THE PEOPLE. They work for us. Please call these representatives and leave them a voice mail (be courteous) and state “I am a registered voter and DO NOT approve of the Curbelo Bill. Thank You.” I have compiled the list of representatives that have backed this bill and their office phone numbers, I am aware that they are not here in Missouri, but they still need to know that lawful gun owners will not stand by and forfeit our second amendment rights. Even if you just call one, that’s better than doing nothing. So please, take 2 minutes out of your day and leave a message. Don’t count on others to do it.

But it looks brand new. I had to double check many different websites to be sure of its year. It is a 1970. I don’t think it was ever shot and always kept in the safe.  The bore is flawless and the wood is immaculate. It was passed down to me but I don’t think I will use it. So I am putting it up for sale. Will trade for a nice AR or cash always works too. REDACTED thanks

And this time it’s a fierce one. We all know what happened in Las Vegas by now, but many do not know there has been legislative action brought forth in a bill by a REPUBLICAN named Carlos Curbelo. This bill goes beyond AR rifles or AK’s. This is going to involve everyone, even deer hunters. The bill that has been introduced does not just ban “bump-stocks” it will ultimately ban all semi-auto rifles and pistols. The bill is very loosely written and does not even mention the term “bump-stock”. It states it will ban “parts that is designed and functions to increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle”, which will mean triggers, disconnects etc. I am asking you to please be involved with this process because we cannot solely rely on president Trump or the NRA. Representatives need to hear the voice of WE THE PEOPLE. They work for us. Please call these representatives and leave them a voice mail (be courteous) and state “I am a registered voter and DO NOT approve of the Curbelo Bill. Thank You.” I have compiled the list of representatives that have backed this bill and their office phone numbers, I am aware that they are not here in Missouri, but they still need to know that lawful gun owners will not stand by and forfeit our second amendment rights. Even if you just call one, that’s better than doing nothing. So please, take 2 minutes out of your day and leave a message. Don’t count on others to do it.

I bought it as a toy essentially and it has been fun but I want to get into something else now. I have fire roughly 300 rounds through it and have cared for it meticulously. It has recieved the same treatment I give to my high dollar ar's and 1911's; it was cleaned and lubricated out of the box and has been cleaned right after shooting, or every 3 months, whichever is first. Although it has fired corrosive ammo, there is no corrosion anywhere; it never had time to set into the metal.Included is a genuine 6x42 POSP scope purchased from Kalinka optics in Belarus. It is fixed at 6x, has BDC calibrated to the weapon and has marks for 100-1000 meters. It has red illumination which works perfectly, as well a scope cover and front cap.When shot prone I can hit 1.25-1.5 inch groups at 100 meters.If you are unfmailiar with the VEPR, it is a Russian made AK type rifle which is made in the MOLOT factory which historically produces the RPK light machine gun. They are made with the same tooling, so as opposed to most ak's which are made from stamped metal and are not lined, this is a milled reciever made from 50% thicker steel, and has a chrome lined bore and chamber. It is essentially one of the highest quality AK's you can buy without getting a high end arsenal or rifle dynamics rifle.Inluded is all factory paperwork, POSP and paperwork and the 2 factory magazines plus one extra factory magazine. All are 5 rounders.The rifles are going for 1100 new, and the scope is 350.00 without the overseas shipping. Extra mags are in the 30.00 range.All things considered this package new costs about 1500 without sales tax.My price is 1100 firm and I am in no rush to sell. Lowballers will be ignored.Possible trades from most desirable to least: high quality ar-15s, high quality ar15 upper recievers, high quality red dot sights, G19 parts, and thats about it. I will consider other trades but im not likely to accept them. Anything of quality is worth a shot.My name is Ian and the fastest way to me is 615-six0four-four55one    via text.ADDED NOTE: Molot is not a listed manufacturer so I just picked a random one in the drop down box.."

Please contact me if you want more photos. I'm not really interested in trades for this one particular, but ask me about the other firearms I'm selling and I'll be willing to consider them. The picture I took shows 3 mags, but I have a 4th as well to go with it.Sig Mosquitos are DA/SA, equipped with slide safety, slide hold-open, and decocker, all accessible with the right thumb. The safety is ambidextrous and they also have adjustable rear sights. They're deceptively small, but have a good grip feel, at least for my smaller hands. This one is dirty, since I haven't gotten around to cleaning it, so it needs a good scrub. It is otherwise in good condition.This one comes with 4 10-round magazines, and an unopened brick of Winchester .22lr ammo, since I won't be doing any shooting for some time. I'm asking $300, which I feel is a fair price.Mosquitos are known to have feeding problems, like many magazine-fed .22s. I recommend polishing the feed ramp with a dremel and buffing bit if you have the spare time for some added reliabilty with weaker rounds. It's a pretty accurate shooter from my experience with it, even with the cheap stuff.Give me a shout if you're interested!"
