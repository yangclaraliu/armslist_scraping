It is the civilian version of the Heckler & Koch G36.The rifle fires the .223 Remington or 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and feeds from a 10-, 20- or 30-round detachable magazine. Unlike earlier types of HK rifles, it is not a roller lock bolt but rather a lug-type rotating bolt system as seen on the AR-18.As imported, the GCA required they only import the 10-rd single stack version. This rifle has been converted to accept the standard double-stack 30rd magazines and even a 100-round drum magazine. All of the original parts and magazines for the single stack version are included as well as two ""wide"" mags.The SL8-1 features a lightened trigger pull, adjustable cheekpiece and buttplate, and a heavier, more accurate barrel.The SL8-1 can have additional parts replaced to make it a G36. Suggest you Google the conversion for more details.Included is the gun case, two 30-round mags, one steel, the other is a PMAG. All the conversion parts, two 10-round stock single-stack mags, and a ProMag 20-round single stack mag.This is a private sale on behalf of a client.NOTE:  Due to excessive spam received in replies to the ads, primarily people phishing for email addresses, I will not reply to a response if you don't provide a phone number, or if I am unable to Google your email address and confirm it is valid."

Sauer und Sohn of Suhl, Germany (nowadays known as Sig Sauer). The Kriegsmodell/Late War stock is quite rare and has no cracks. The action is smooth and the rifling is still very crisp. Blueing (as you can tell in the photos) is excellent. This firearm also features the rare plum bolt/receiver exclusive to J.P. Sauer und Sohn's '39 & '40 models.The production code on the receiver is '147'. All Waffenamts, proofings and Reichsadler's (black eagles with swastikas) are intact and weren't peened off after capture. The only things removed during capture (as usual) were the magazine capture screws (which I replaced) and the small front metal plate of the Kriegsmodell stock. I simply never got around to replacing it but there are plenty out there. If you would like more photographs, let me know.My end of the trade would include the rifle, a reproduction leather sling, a reproduction leather ammo pouch and ten stripper clips."

If you DONT KNOW what VEPR is, then look it up. Compared to a Saiga, it is a much beefier AK all-around in any caliber, starting with a Thy nicker wall receiver and a heavier barrel designed to shoot a lot more rounds much faster.Vepr rifles came to US “sporterised.” They came with a rear slant-cut receiver, a beautiful cherry wood furniture with thumbhole stock and matching one piece lower handguard covering the barrel and and almost to the top of the gas tube. But it did not lend itself real easily for conversion as the parts aren’t always easy to find.So this Vepr features a Russian-made, heavy-duty like a T-34 slant-cut adapter that allows the Vepr to accept M4 MILSPEC buffertube and related hardware. The buffer tube screws deep into the adapter. The Slant-cut adapter also mounts deep into the trunion.  The Molot factory pistol grip is bolted into the mounting bracket allowing for an additional point of contact. In the Russian ad, they show a big guy doing pushups off the pistol grip while holding onto the stock and the barrel. Strong stuff.The result is a factory-looking modern AK/RPK rifle (back end).The front features a 2-piece Russian handguard retainer adapter “type VEPRtoRPK” to allow the use of genuine (real military) RPK handguards (new composite, plastic or old wood) on the Vepr rifle. The pinned muzzle cover nut was removed and a muzzle brake installed. It uses the the standard AK/AKM/RPK 14x1LH pattern and has a plunger in the front site block to index and lock in place your AK muzzle device.So, to recap - brand new, banned from import into US, Russian made and converted into RPK/AK, Vepr rifle chambered in 7.62x39. 16” heavy barrel. Russian, factory installed into left side of receiver, scope mounting “rail” compatible with AK and SVD mounts.totally reversible conversion using all Russian parts (except for MILSPEC M4 buffer tube hardware) & M4 stock. ONLY if you wanted to revert back to hunting rifle look.Bullet Guide, (installed into the front trunion) for 7.62x39 Modified Magazine Release lever - allows use of any MILITARY magazinesMolot Pistol GripRPK front handguards - new, military parts; upper and lower.Vented Gas tube with upper handguards mount - vents hot gases and dirt into the atmosphere- NOT INTO RECEIVER. Gun runs cleaner and cooler.threaded 14x1LH heavy barrel with plunger (“index/lock”) in front sight blockMILSPEC M4 6-position Buffer tube and MAGPUL stockScope mount - AK/RPK - slide into side rail; mounts any red dot or scope using picatiny or weaver mount.Red/Green Dotthis looks like it is supposed to look - a modern RPK / AK. Not a “tacti-Kool” Tapco-bolt $100 conversion. Do the research - verify what I am saying.HOW MUCH: I would like $1,350 for the rifle (magazine for display only) which is what the cost of hardware alone is. If you can find some of the parts, since Russian front/rear adapters no longer imported. I tried keeping as much “Russian” as possible without making a permanent “RPK” rifle. That is another project and not for sale.I am, however, OPEN A TO REASONABLE OFFER - I can always say no.I am also open to some trades - high end pistols - 1911, etc.  Prefer cash. Thank you for looking"

This allows you to run your firearm with less oil/lube, and makes cleaning much easier. Another plus with Titanium Nitride is that the average coating adds only 3 micrometers of thickness, so it will enhance the function and look of your firearm. Comes in I s original box with all original accessories and two 15 round magazines. There's not another one anywhere around and this is better than new and never been fired!Please ask any questions via email or call/text REDACTED before 8pm. Sorry, will not ship!

I put roughly 30 rounds through since I bought it and it has been my everyday carry since Sept 2017. It is in excellent condition and easy to breakdown. Bill of sale and Id required. FFL is optional and at your cost for transfers and all bg checks. Fully concealable. Prints more like a cellphone when in pocket. No one will know if you are carrying it unless you tell them.Safety features include: Built in trigger lock and key, will not fire without mag installed.Please do not offer trades for services. I will consider trades for other firearms only. However I am not interested in obsolete models, target pistols or single round plinkers."
