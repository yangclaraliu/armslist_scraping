I also have a Colt Archive Letter to go with it to show where and when it was shipped and that it IS a true Coltguard not one that has been refinished like a few I've seen recently.I have more pics that I can send to serious buyers and I can also take a picture of the colt letter if you'd like to see it. I would rate the condition at 99%.There is NO holster wear, pitting, rust, bad scratches, etc. There is only one small handling mark that isn't very easy to spot located under the barrel. I know when it comes to these high end pieces every mark matters. It has been fired but not much. Trigger feels amazing, no creep, just smooth as glass and breaks like thin glass, with perfect Lock Up & Timing. I'm only considering selling it because it's a beautiful piece of art that is just sitting in the back of my safe.This Does NOT mean I will give it away!

FN 5.7x28 ammo,"San Diego / Ramona, San Diego, California","$ 2,200","Listed On: Saturday, November 11, 2017",Rifles,FN Herstal S.A.                                                                                ,5.7x28mm                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I have a FN PS90 I custom ordered to be built fully comply with new CA legislation so IT DOES NOT have to be registered as an Assault Weapon - this is done with a simple piece of kydex that is sandwiched together with an allen screw and bolt in less than 5 seconds to cover the natural 'thumbhole opening' of the stock. *Note: What may appear as a forward hand grip is absolutely not. It is solely a hand stop which aids in super fast grip and positioning of your hands as you bring the rifle up to put on target, preventing you from accidentally touching the barrel and allows a secure purchase on the firearm without thought. However, if you ever get questioned by someone thinking it is, I am including an additional piece of molded Kydex to cover that area. From what I understand, the rarity of this configuration allows this gun to avoid the  dealer's installation of the dreaded 'bullet button', allowing ultra-fast mag swaps.
 
The gun is completely ambidextrous with low profile, dual (side) charging levers, dual magazine release levers, safety located adjacsent to the trigger's face, as a rocker switch allowing simple and natural operation with either a left or right trigger finger, and the ejection port is located in the bottom of the stock, preventing any possible FTE or 'surprise' slap in the face upon firing whether left or right handed, as the spent shells eject straight down. 
 
As for this rifle's history,,, I ordered and bought it brand new, through a local FFL able to request this setup configured at FN, just this past November (2016). I have only fired it at two trips to the range, going through two boxes of ammo (50 shells each, blue tipped FN ammo). So it has only ever had a total of 100 rounds run through it. Unfortunately I had some medical expenses arise from my other hobby - motorcycle racing - and I have to part with a few of my firearms as one way of paying these bills.
 
So this is what I must sadly let go... I've been told this rifle in its configuration is a bit of a unicorn in this state. It is caertainly a bonus that you can easily revert the rifle to its original design by FN  and fire the 30 and 50 round mags it was intended to use were you to leave or sell to a more gun friendly state.  It will become quite clear how this rifle excels at what is was originally intended to do.  This PS90's condition is flawless. I have also purchased 3 magazines my dealer ordered for me to be CA Compliant (50 round mags blocked to 10 rounds). 
 
SO, for $2200, the rifle will come with these 3 magazines, and I will include in the purchase the black, 36"" Allen Tactical, soft rifle case I also picked up with the rifle which includes forward, elongated magazine pouches, optimal for these type of magazines and additional zippered compartments. 
 
I also have 11 boxes (just over 1/2 case, 550 rounds) of blue tip, FN 5.7x28mm, factory new ammunition, I will bundle with the rifle for an additional $150,,, $2350 for the package. If you would just like to buy the ammunition, I will sell it to you for $220 shipped (UPS ground) alone.
 
I really need to put the moeny all towards my bills, but against my better judgement, I will consider a partial trade for certain firearms or accessories: I am particularly interested in a NEW Glock 19; a Benelli Super Black Eagle - 28"" preferrably; any type of quality optics for AR-15's or a fine Sako precision rifle (Trijicon ACOG; 1-4/6/8 variable scope; hi quality red/grn ""red dot"" or ""prism"" fixed magnification; Lucid P7; etc.); a .308 or 30-06 high precision rifle (Tika/Sako); a H&K Mark 23, USP 45 Ultimate or P30L;  CZ Pitol or ? I have a friend here in town (actually his shop is a mile from my residence) who is happy to smoothly facilitate the PPT for a very low/fair price (for his work, but as a friend's pirce), or I can take payment ahead of time and will ship the firearm (at your cost) to the FFL of your choice, and you can take it from there - just understand, if you take that route, it is your responsibility to pass the background check and qualify to own the rife, otherwise I will take 25% of the transaction to re-stock and seek another buyer if you are seeking a refund (your other option is to work out an arrangement with your FFL, but this is out of my hands). I want to work with you to facilitate as smooth a transfer as possible, so I am not going to abandon you, I just need you to be aware of my policy if I need to refund for the time lost in the purchase process.
 
Thank you very much for looking and God Bless!"

LOOK AT THAT WOOD AMAZING I bought it at first sight, and if I could shoot it I would. I have had 6 back surgeries and I tried to shoot skeet again (the last surgery felt better then all of the previous surgeries did), but I can't. I picked Beretta because I have sot them in the past and loved them. I picked the A400 XCEL because of the recoil reduction system and fast cycling times. I picked this one because of the recoil reducer in the stock and the Limbsaver recoil pad and then of course I could not pass up that wood. Which is why it has taken me 2 months since I shot it last to bring myself to list it. It is a gun I thought about just keeping for its shear beauty as another one to match it would be hard to find.this A400 has had the following modifications ,Graco adjustable comb stock,professional trigger job,recoil reducer in the stock,limbsaver pad,and it comes with a wide range of 7 chokes (Cyl, SK, IC, M, IM, F, & EF) so you can shoot just about any type of shotgun shooting event you can find. Skeet, trap, sporting clays or anything in between and this shotgun and chokes can hit it.Shipping will cost $30,for any questions contact me,"
