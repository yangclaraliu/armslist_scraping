From the research I've done on Blue Sky is that they brought M1s back to the US from Korea and that there was a wide range of quality returned. IMO this looks to be at or near the very high end compared to others I have seen on GB. Overall it looks to be IMO very good condition. 1943 manufacture. I have never disassembled the rifle so I don't know if the individual parts match/don't match. Bore is bright and shiny. There is a scratch or shallow crack on the butt. It appears to be surface only and does not separate down into the wood. I also collected a really nice bayonet to pair with the gun. That will go with it plus 3 magazines, plus a brand new US field manual. These all make for a really nice PACKAGE DEAL and set collection. PLUS I'll include about 100 rounds of 30 cal bullets.

This is a J&R Engineering M68 Pistol. The J&R Engineering M68 is the pre-Wilkinson Linda pistol and Ray Wilkinson was a partner in J&R Engineering prior to starting Wilkinson Arms. Although the carbines are rare enough, the pistol is almost non-existent. I consulted Wilkinson Arms, sent them numerous pics and it is believed that Ray Wilkinson may have made this for himself. The first question was whether or not someone converted this from a carbine to a pistol. Inspection of the sling mount and barrel indicates that it was either made in the factory or someone who really, really knew what they were doing did the conversion as the barrel work and stepping for the cone is done perfectly. It is not believed that anyone would have taken the time or expense, to do this precisely to what the factory specs. This is a rare find.If you are a collector of rare pre-ban firearms you should check this out."

The Low Effort Slide (L.E.S.) requires 27% less effort to manipulate compared to striker-fired handguns in the same class. Chambering a round has never been easier thanks to the patent-pending hammer design. The result is far fewer slipped pulls, and easier operation for possibly life-saving operation when it counts. Active grip texturing engages every part of the operator’s hand, with three different surface grains to provide secure control of the weapon and a uniquely comfortable fit. For customers who are hesitant to carry a striker-fired pistol in their waistband or handbag, the XD-E offers an undeniable set of safety features that will give new shooters the confidence to carry concealed. The visible external hammer allows you to both see and feel gun mode for added safety and confidence, and the loaded chamber indicator provides the ability to both see and feel if a round is chambered. The double action trigger has a smooth, yet long and intentional trigger pull giving shooters a sense of comfort while carrying on the go, while the follow up shots from the single action trigger are light, crisp and accurate. An ambidextrous thumb safety/decocker and magazine release is designed for both left and right-handed shooters in mind and various options for mode of carry. Active grip texturing engages every part of the operator’s hand, with three different surface grains to provide secure control of the weapon, and the confidence of a sure grip. For easy sight acquisition, the XD-E .45 features high quality steel sights right out of the box. The fiber optic front sight paired with a low profile white-dot rear, provides a positive sight picture that’s easily picked up in low light conditions. The serrated rear surfaces help to reduce glare. The 3.3-inch barrel is hammer-forged with a precise 1:16 twist and Melonite treated to match the challenge of constant carry in all conditions. Beneath the barrel, a dual recoil spring system, managed by a full-length guide rod, facilitates steadfast reliability and a soft-shooting feel. The XD-E .45 ships with a 6-round magazine with “pinky extender” installed, or a 7-round mid magazine with the grip extension, personalizing concealability and capacity. It also ships with an interchangeable flush base plate for maximum concealability. Everything you want in your reliable daily sidearm, now in your first-choice caliber.

The latest edition of Springfield’s most popular pistol is engineered in a slim, single-stack frame, holding 6 rounds of .45 ACP in a premiere concealed-carry firearm. Springfield Armory’s XD-S Mod.2 offers upgrades from the inside out. A higher hand position, enhanced grip texturing, thinner slide, an Ameriglo® Pro-Glo™ front sight with tactical-rack rear sight, and an enhanced trigger advance this polymer-framed pistol’s acclaimed “point and shoot” ergonomics. Other features include a loaded chamber indicator and a grip safety that immediately readies the gun for action yet renders it virtually incapable of firing if dropped. The XD-S Mod.2 frame moves the shooter’s grip higher on the weapon, closer to the bore axis, to enhance control, soften recoil and improve accuracy. This Mod.2 improvement, coupled with the thinner extended beaver tail, makes this lightweight pistol even more comfortable to shoot than its predeccesor. The width of the grip is a mere .975”, and the Mod.2 grip texturing gives the operator a solid feel and secure hold of the pistol – especially important in defensive encounters. Longer Posi-Wedge™ serrations make the slide easier to grab and rack. The new XD-S Mod.2 features an Ameriglo® Pro-Glo™ green tritium front sight inside a yellow luminescent circle, paired with a tactical-rack serrated steel rear sight with U-notch, making target acquisition extremely fast in low-light. The enhanced short-reset and consistent trigger is the perfect choice for a defensive carry pistol. Chambered for .45ACP, this latest edition of Springfield’s most popular pistol is engineered for a slim, single-stack frame just 6.5 inches long and under 5 inches high – ideal for the invisible fit and easy draw required of a concealed-carry pistol. The 3.3-inch barrel is Melonite® treated hammer-forged steel, with a 1:16 twist for outstanding accuracy in a sub-compact size. Dual springs and a full-length guide rod manage .45 recoil and help keep rounds on target without punishing the shooter’s hands. The XD-S Mod.2 comes with two stainless steel magazines: a flush-fitting 5-round mag, and one 6-round mag with Mid-Mag X-Tension™. These magazines, unloaded and seated in the pistol, give the XD-S Mod.2 a weight of 21.5 ounces and 22.5 ounces, respectively. The single-stack magazines provide ample capacity in a remarkably slim design, giving the XD-S Mod.2 the ideal profile for concealed carry purposes. For those looking for a constant-carry pistol, the new XD-S Mod.2 is the perfect choice.

This is a Marlin 35 remington. Its an excellent hunting cartridge. In the past it was used to take down Grizzly bears. The effective range of this  cartridge is 100-200 yards. The scope and plastic case is included in the rifle. On average whatever this hits will absorb 2000ft lbs of force.  The scopeneeds to be sighted in. This also comes with the sling. This is NOT a black rifle, make sure you understand how to use this before purchasingso you can avoid a negligent discharge. If you don't know how to use it please ask me to show you first. There is no shame in it, there is shamein blowing a hole in your ceiling for being a prideful dumbass. 3. I'm not going to meet in a parking lot,  field, or in the woods. Meet me in my apartment. I'm not a criminal. If I was, I'm not so stupid to rob someone after having an email trace and on arms list. In addition, odds are you are a concealed carrier and I don't want to get shot or go to jail because I'm not a criminal. You can conceal carry when you pick  up the weapon, just take your shoes off so you don't ruin the floor. I don' t want my wife kicking my ass.4. Yes, I'm black, contrary to youtube videos, and world star hip hop shit, I speak proper english and I'm an American first. I don't hate you because you    are white, and i could give a shit as long as the content of your character has integrity. I'm a conservative even though I don't trust any politician.6. This weapon was only fired about 10 times, succssfully used to take deer. I bought it to help out an old friend. However i don't hunt since I'm now   stuck in suburbia, the land of nuerotic yuppies and skinny jeans.7. You need to have no criminal record, and have a ID and sign a bill of sale/trade. So incase you sell the gun or do something illegal I can show the    authorities that it not my gun anymore.8. I work all the time so I will only be able to answer email once a day, this doesn't mean i'm ignoring you. Just means I prefer not to spend my free time   checking email and using facebook. I will do my best to respond to everyone, if I can't its nothing personal. 9. Cash price 400  Will trade for:Ar15, glock 19, .357 sigs, glock 32, optics, bulk 556/223 ammo,"

I've never used it, but apparently the previous user had based on the scuff marks. It seems to be a discontinued model from Burris, 1.5-4 power. Mounted onto a Super Redhawk the eye relief was great for my arms, at both high and low power, and the sights don't appear to be canted. I was surprised by the clarity of it. But like I said, I never personally used it. Pistol weighs enough without it. Humorously, the eye relief is also almost good enough for mounting onto the handguard of an AK pattern rifle, but that's kind of silly. But that does mean it would make a good scope for a scout rifle."
