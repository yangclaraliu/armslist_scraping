The Model 1903 Pocket Pistol was way ahead of its time. They are so iconic, popular Colt re introduced them a few years ago. This one was made in 1915! By todays standards its not the smallest, lightest piece of plastic, but it is still small and light enough to carry in your pant or coat pocket. Plus its a sleek gun, no hammer or sharp corners to hang up. I've had this gun over 30 years and run many magazines through it without a failure of any kind, so it is reliable. Comes with 2 mags and 130 rnds of ammo. A big surprise to me was how incredibly accurate it is. Mechanicly it's in xlnt condition and not peened or battered internally(happens to most high milage semi autos), rifling is sharp with some frosting. apparently not shot very much.   At some time in the past it was reblued, done well. Some people don't think a 32acp is powerfull enough, but they were issued to US Military Field officers(Patton, Eisenhower) and millions of police and millitary all over the world through the years. Besides, it's not what you shoot 'em with, it's where you shoot 'em. It's also easy to shoot fast, very controlable. A good gun for a beginner to intermediate collector, or fun Hollywood gun you can shoot and show off without degrading the value. This is a gun that is going to continue to increase in value. If you go on Gunbroker.com you will see that these are expensive, valuable guns.    Because this one is refinished it's not going to be a top doller gun even though it's in top shape mechanicly. I'd like to get $650 or best offer. Call or text is best. Don't waste my time with scams. Mike 931-62two-575four with questions. I sometimes don't check my emails for days. Check my other listings.   Will trade for glock 19 or 26 + extras, ammo, $ or whatever it takes to work out a dealMaybe interested in other 9mmMaybe something else in $650 range"
