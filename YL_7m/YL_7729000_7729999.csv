TRY A LIGHTWEIGHT BEFORE YOU BUY! Single or Double Action, Stainless with stock grips. Bought used for snubbie target practice. We carry S&W Airweights and practice regularly and didn't want to put wear & tear on the aluminum frame snubbies. This steel beauty shows no wear as we use .38 SPL ammo. The 3 "" barrel gives a longer sight radius and has been used out to 50 yards but we practice at 25. The hammer can be cocked for precision shooting or used double action for faster close work. The grip is a bit longer than most snubbies , so IF you want to use .357's you have something to hang on to. If you try a light 357 you might find it very unpleasant to shoot at best.  This sturdy revolver would be good for practice OR self defense for ANY member of the family. We DON'T DO PICTURES OF ANY KIND so available for local cash sale to OHIO RESIDENT ONLY, CCW holders preferred. NO TRADES or shipping. Price is firm, condition is very good.

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the stock allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward."

Unconventional design, unmatched performance, and familiar AR handling.

Completely ambidextrous, the SIG MPX is great for left- or right-handed shooters with its dual-sided selector switch, magazine release, charging handle and bolt release. The SIG MPX operates from a fully- closed and locked rotating bolt, offering enhanced reliability and safety in use. A short-stroke gas piston allows the SIG MPX to run all weights and brands of 9mm ammunition with no adjustments to the gas valve. A full-length picatinny rail allows for solid, consistent mounting of optics and targeting lasers.
