M59/66 because it's the variant with the grenade launcher attached at the end of the barrel and A1 because it has the flip up tritium nightsights as well. It's in immaculate condition. Bought it unissued, as a lot of yugos are. Don't have the Arsenal paperwork some of them come with though. Includes cleaning kit & sling. All numbers matching, but one thing about it is kind of weird which I put off as a mistake on the part of whoever assembled it. Serial is 60572, and every part except the receiver cover and trigger group has that 60572 #. The receiver cover and trigger group are numbered 60672. I put it down to whoever assembled it mistaking the 6's for 5's. Shoots great, only put about 100 rounds through it in the time I've owned it. CAI import. Probably the best condition SKS I own besides my 1953 Tula ""ex-ddr / Liski"" the stock is perfect , handguard has like two dings from being stored im guessing. Sturdy shooter , the yugos seem to have used thicker stocks than Chinese and Russians. Anyway, I'm asking $450 for it. Thanks"

So it doesn't have a grenade launcher, gas shut off switch, grenade sights, or flip up night sights. This was the first Yugo SKS they made. This rifle has most likely seen some action, it's not in perfect condition and shows wear as well as some of the bluing having faded away. It has dings and some scratches but the stock itself in color and ""shine"" reminds me of the Russian artic birch somehow. Some of the parts have been refurbed so this is not an all matching SKS, but I've out around 100 rounds through it without any malfunctions or problems. It's still an M59 and a nice piece of history to own. I'm asking $375 for it. Thanks"

There is a spring that while being in the gun correctly is either stretched out or bent causing malfunctions when operating the handgun. Extractor could also be the issue. This isnt a burner. Its a ugly looking P95 I overpaid for a year ago and should have had a professional reassemble not myself.

I cant really justify having both of these right now so this one goes.I have attached to it a Jpoint 8MOA red dot sight. By itself it runs about $280 or so. I did not use the stock glock adapter plates and instead opted for the JP Enterprises ultra low mount which goes for $90With this mount you are able to achieve cowitness in case for some reason the red dot fails you still have clear sight picture with the irons.To purchase I will require a bill of sale be signed and provided with a copy of your drivers license or CCW for my personal records.Gun includes sight, mount, 2 magazines, and all glock mounting plates and documents that accompany the gun when brand new.I will sell without the sight for 570"

This rifle comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. This rifle does have some minor signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, but was well taken care of, and only lightly used. This rifle is free of all major flaws/defects, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, rusting, staining, or discoloration. There are a handful of minor nicks and cuts throughout the wood stock, as well as the receiver, and a minor chip in the end of the bottom side of the forearm, but that's it! This rifle has a bandolier sleeve over the butt for holding additional shells, and comes equipped with a gold trigger, and a hammer set behind the receiver. This rifle DOES NOT have a scope attached, though it does feature the original iron sights. This is a fantastic rifle that would make a great addition to anybody's collection! Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this rifle, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have, or if you would like to receive additional photo's of this rifle."

The glasses will include the Microbag and Oakley box.Oakley has partnered with Cerakote in the past in an effort to provide customers with the most durable and mission critical eyewear protection possible. These are Gascan SI model sunglasses by Oakley. These glasses have been Cerakoted a Sniper Gray, Magpul FDE or Burnt Bronze color using a Cerakote H coating applied by a Cerakote Certified Applicator.Two lenses are cut from the curve of a single lens shield, then mounted in the frame to maintain the original, continuous contour. The lenses are Black or Bronze Iridium and made of Plutonite. Plutonite is one of the most optically pure materials used in eyewear today, it maximizes clarity and impact resistance while filtering out 100% of all UVA, UVB, UVC and harmful blue light up to 400nm. The UV protection is not a coating, the UV protection is from the lens material itself. The lenses are NOT polarized.The Oakley icon is not plastic on these. These are metal and are a gunmetal color.The look of these glasses is unique, lightweight O-Matter frame material offers premium comfort. Peripheral vision is maximized by XYZ Optics, an innovation that maintains visual clarity at all angles of view. Impact protection meets ANSI Z87.1 standards, and Three-Point Fit retains the lenses in precise optical alignment. The Three-Point fit is a patented innovation that ensures the frame makes contact only at the bridge of the nose and the sides of the head. It holds lenses in precise optical alignment with a secure fit that eliminates the pressure points common with frames that hook the ears. Oakley performance eyewear offers uncompromising protection against high-velocity and high-mass impact. The protection is a benefit of the premium materials and unique architectures of Oakley lens/frame combinations.Important Note: Use care when installing/removing lenses. Scratched lenses cannot be returned and are NOT covered under Oakley's warranty policy.Technical InformationANSI Safety Rated: YesFit: StandardFrame Material: O-MatterNormally you must provide proof you are in the military or law enforcement to obtain Oakley SI Gascans.

It's got a full Cajun Gun Works trigger kit (the only part of theirs I chose not to install was their aftermarket hammer.) It's been ported by Magnaport. The barrel was coated in TiN by Warfrog Industries. Has a fiber optic Cajun Gun Works front sight. Also comes with a couple different recoil springs of different weights.
