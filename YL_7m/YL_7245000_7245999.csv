You won’t find a more beautiful rifle in a world of black rifles. The anodize finish on both receivers and the stainless fluted barrel with the one of a kind muzzle device sets it apart from all others.  I bought this rifle from someone else who just purchased the rifle but never shot it nor registered it. I registered it with Black Rain as the only owner. The gun has a lifetime guarantee. It has been sighted for 100 yards. 
 
I never intended it sell it but life changes your priorities.  I will not acknowledge any low-ball offer. Cash only. Meet face to face in a public area. You must be over 21. Must have state or federal ID and willing to sign a bill of sale.

The world’s most elegant carry pistol family just added a new member. For those who emphasize extra-discreet concealed carry, we’re proud to introduce the new Springfield Armory® EMP® Lightweight Champion™ with Concealed Carry Contour.
Back in 2007, the original Springfield Armory® EMP® set a new bar for quality, performance, and style. Combining the near-perfect ergonomics of the time-tested 1911 design with a new patented short-action, the original EMP® redefined what a carry 1911 could be. Among the community of those who know, it has earned a reputation as one of the most shootable compact pistols ever.
The all new EMP® 4” Lightweight Champion™ with Concealed Carry Contour model improves on the original by combining a longer barrel with a frame trimmed for ultimate concealment. The new bevel cut on the mainspring housing does a lot more than one might think. The rounded contour molds to the shape of the shooters hand, preventing “palm bite” during fire. For carry, the contoured shape helps to prevent snags during the draw and virtually eliminates the telltale bulge under a cover garment. Now, the EMP® is easier than ever to conceal.
The new Concealed Carry Contour model features a four-inch, stainless steel, Match-Grade bull barrel with a fully supported feed ramp. The barrel is housed in a forged stainless steel slide with an exquisite satin finish. The slide assembly is complemented by a black hard coat anodized forged aluminum alloy frame. The front fiber optic sight facilities instant sight acquisition while the low-profile combat-style rear sight ensures a smooth draw from concealment.
The EMP® Lightweight Champion™ with Concealed Carry Contour handles even better than it looks. Checkered black G-10 grip panels combine a slip-free hold with incomparable durability. Both front and rear strap frame surfaces feature our smooth, but effective, Posi-Lock texturing pattern.

YOUR CHOICE OF SIDEPLATES. A New Era of Perfection ""The beginning of a new era of perfection"", is how Blaser CEO Bernhard Knoebel has named the launch of the new Blaser bolt action rifle R8 in his preface of the brand-new catalog. For the past five years, there has been one lingering question for the hunters and engineers at Blaser, regarding the Blaser bolt action rifle R93: How can this technically superior concept be taken to the next level? In order to answer this question the Blaser engineers, most of them passionate hunters themselves, kept a close connection to hunters around the world in order to respond to their requests. Detachable Magazine When the development of the R8 actually started the detachable magazine was right at the top of the optimization list. Blaser found an ergonomically superior solution that essentially supports fast and intuitive handling. Magazine and trigger unit merged into one compact module. The magazine buttons are positioned right above the trigger guard. Thus, the magazine can be released blindly and within a split second. When removing the magazine, the R8 automatically de-cocks and once the magazine is removed, the cocking slide cannot engage anymore. Today, this is a very important safety feature securing the rifle against misuse by unauthorized persons. Blaser Precision Trigger The detachable magazine is just one of a multitude of innovations that turn the R8 into the new worldwide benchmark when it comes to bolt action rifles. Enhancing the reliable and precise performance of the trigger posed a very special engineering challenge that has been brilliantly mastered. The new Blaser Precision Trigger breaks crisp as glass at a trigger pull of 750 gram / 1 5/8 lbs. Thanks to its extremely short release time it turns the shooter’s thought impulse immediately into an accurate shot. The innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing, which marks the next leap in rifle technology. The desmodromic trigger mechanism offers unsurpassed reliability in extreme conditions such as freezing rain and blowing dust. Perfect Stock In order to make shooting with the R8 as comfortable and safe as possible, Blaser attached immense importance to optimizing the stock, reaching a new level of perfection here, too. Different from traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. This results in increased muzzle stability and a substantial reduction of felt recoil. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Design Besides achieving maximum performance, Blaser gave particular attention to superior style and design. Concave and convex lines discreetly shape the rifles appearance. Contours of stock, action, mount and bolt handle blend perfectly, giving the R8 a dynamic and unequaled elegance..SHIPPING IS $40"

YOUR CHOICE OF SIDEPLATES. A New Era of Perfection ""The beginning of a new era of perfection"", is how Blaser CEO Bernhard Knoebel has named the launch of the new Blaser bolt action rifle R8 in his preface of the brand-new catalog. For the past five years, there has been one lingering question for the hunters and engineers at Blaser, regarding the Blaser bolt action rifle R93: How can this technically superior concept be taken to the next level? In order to answer this question the Blaser engineers, most of them passionate hunters themselves, kept a close connection to hunters around the world in order to respond to their requests. Detachable Magazine When the development of the R8 actually started the detachable magazine was right at the top of the optimization list. Blaser found an ergonomically superior solution that essentially supports fast and intuitive handling. Magazine and trigger unit merged into one compact module. The magazine buttons are positioned right above the trigger guard. Thus, the magazine can be released blindly and within a split second. When removing the magazine, the R8 automatically de-cocks and once the magazine is removed, the cocking slide cannot engage anymore. Today, this is a very important safety feature securing the rifle against misuse by unauthorized persons. Blaser Precision Trigger The detachable magazine is just one of a multitude of innovations that turn the R8 into the new worldwide benchmark when it comes to bolt action rifles. Enhancing the reliable and precise performance of the trigger posed a very special engineering challenge that has been brilliantly mastered. The new Blaser Precision Trigger breaks crisp as glass at a trigger pull of 750 gram / 1 5/8 lbs. Thanks to its extremely short release time it turns the shooter’s thought impulse immediately into an accurate shot. The innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing, which marks the next leap in rifle technology. The desmodromic trigger mechanism offers unsurpassed reliability in extreme conditions such as freezing rain and blowing dust. Perfect Stock In order to make shooting with the R8 as comfortable and safe as possible, Blaser attached immense importance to optimizing the stock, reaching a new level of perfection here, too. Different from traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. This results in increased muzzle stability and a substantial reduction of felt recoil. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Design Besides achieving maximum performance, Blaser gave particular attention to superior style and design. Concave and convex lines discreetly shape the rifles appearance. Contours of stock, action, mount and bolt handle blend perfectly, giving the R8 a dynamic and unequaled elegance..Shipping cost $40"

This is an Armalite M-15 Light Tactical Carbine AR-15 semi-automatic rifle designed to fire .223 Rem and 5.56 NATO rounds. It has never been fired, kept in my climate controlled home since I bought it.  I have added a new 4X32 compact scope with Fiber optic sight with illumination in red, green and blue, each color with 3 brightness settings so its ready to go without having to purchase sights.  It comes in a double padded case capable of carrying a second rifle (or clothes, beer or whatever).Cheaper-Than-Dirt's web sight lists their discounted price for this AR at $824.84 but that amount will increase with fees and taxes before it gets to you. My price is $825 and I don't think it will be around for long. I will accept cash only and will meet the buyer in a suitable public place that I will pick in Columbia or Lexington, not your home or mine.  If you don't have a valid drivers license there's no deal.  It also helps to have a CWP and we will exchange that information before the sale is complete.  The price is firm.  Pictures will be added soon.  I wanted to get this on quickly and maybe won't need to add pictures."

Inside the admittedly-cool exterior lies one of the finest firearm innovations we've seen in some time: the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down and away from the shooter, virtually eliminating felt recoil and muzzle climb. The low bore axis takes it a step further, ensuring that the recoil travels back, not up. THE GEN II SDP: THE VECTOR SELF DEFENSE PISTOL. The Vector SDP is the Non-NFA semi-automatic pistol variant of the Vector platform. It features a short, threaded, 5.5” barrel. A rear quick detach sling point assists with carrying the firearm. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector SDP are the Magpul MBUS sights, full-length Picatinny top rail and a Glock Magazine. Although this SDP maybe small, it still has the same capabilities as its larger counterpart, and is civilian legal in most states. Additionally, the SDP features all the Gen II enhancements of its larger counterparts, like a chrome-lined barrel, beefed-up barrel contour, improved fire control group, and a re-positioned fire/safe switch, among others.  Closed bolt, delayed blowback operating system Super V Recoil Mitigation System redirects recoil energy down and away from the shooter for better control and faster follow-up shots Compatible with Glock 17 magazines Upper and lower Picatinny rails for accessories Short-throw ambidextrous safety lever Rear sling point for attachment Comfortable pistol grip Flip-up sights Alpine finish   Brand new comes with Hard Case from KRISS $899.00 plus tax / if paying with credit card please add fee. We are an FFL so you will need a PTP/PTC and a valid MN drivers license with address matching on both!"

Operation, controls, and maintenance are the same however, the AR-10A family is designed to accept early Armalite AR-10 “Waffle” magazines and other magazines copied from them. The AR-10B family still accepts our proprietary steel magazines. Neither family of rifles will function correctly with the other alternate magazine.
The Armalite AR10A SuperSASS™ rifle is an eye-catcher but it’s what is on the inside that counts. Its aircraft-grade forgings have no die-cast or extruded parts in the receivers. The interior surfaces of the upper receivers are hard coat anodized per military spec, as are all aluminum parts. SuperSASS barrels are ceramic coated, stainless steel match. The patented bolt assembly is stronger than those found in similar firearms and the trigger is a finely tuned Precision two-stage.
The SuperSASS is configured as follows:
Adjustable Gas System to Optimize Rifle Function with Suppressor
Armalite Floating Rail System with Rail Covers
**Check manufacture website for additional specs**
Included with basic rifle:
Bushnell 3.5-21x50 ERS, LaRue LT104 scope mount, Tenebrex flipcovers, GG&G XDS-2 bipod, BA Battlecomp muzzle device, ERGO Tactical Deluxe w/Palm Self, CTK Ultimate Rail Pod, Viking Tactical sling, Wheeler anti-cant, Pelican 1700 custom cut case, (2) 20rd mags, (2) 10rd mags, Various factory hardware
This rifle has 150-200 rounds through it, basically load development. Will be glad to share load information with high bidder. This is a 1 MOA rifle with Fed Gold Medal, and sub-MOA with handloads. As far as condition goes, it still looks new to me, and I'm the original owner. Well over $5K invested in setup."

Comes with all the paperwork, hang tag, even the original paper the rifle was wrapped in. The previous owner had a gunshop and bought many rare rifles and just squirreled them away for years. Anyway, these Angle Eject rifles are fairly rare and hard to come by, especially new in the box. They were only made a few years and then discontinued. The .307 is essentially a flat nosed .308 for tube magazines. These were made from 1983-1998. earlier ones had and XTR suffix after the model (ending in '89). Later ones had the AE. Also the crossbolt safety, which was added post-'89. I called Lenny, the Winchester/Browning historian and he told me from their records that this was made in the last year of production, 1998. 30 years next year!looking at asking and actual selling prices of these on many forums and auction sites, they go from $750 for a shooter with a scope mounted and rust freckling on the receiver, to over $2500 for a brand new in the box example. As this rifle has has the small tie wrap cut(can be replaced by any new tie), a small tear on the top corner of the hang tag and a small tear on the side flap of the box, I feel confident to ask $1200.00 plus actual shipping.

I can tell you that this thing was badass at the range when I shot at West Coast Armory. I got some pretty good groupings too, so I know it's accurate.Specs: Height: 5.5""Barrel: 5""Length: 8.6""Weight: 39 ozs.Sights: Combat, 3-DotSlide and Frame: Forged Carbon SteelHere is a description off of the Springfield website:The Stainless Steel Mil-Spec is built on a full-size frame and slide. The pistol is made from stainless steel, which has a polished finish on the flat surfaces and bead-blasted matte finish on the rounded areas. The 5 inch barrel is match grade and made from stainless steel. The slide features slanted serrations on the rear only. The mainspring housing is the original arched style found on GI issue 1911-A1s, but it includes the Springfield Armory® I.L.S.™ The pistol also has a standard spur hammer and standard grip safety. The single-sided, non-extended thumb safety and short military combat trigger are true to the original 1911-A1 design. The combat 3-Dot sights are fixed, and the ejection port is lowered and flared. Each Mil-Spec comes with a beautiful pair of cross-cannon emblazoned walnut grips that are held in place with slotted grip screws."
