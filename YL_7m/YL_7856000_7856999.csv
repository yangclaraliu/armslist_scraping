The grip screw is sharp and the markings are clear. Overall, this handgun rates in about Excellent condition.The action functions correctly. i did not fire this handgun. This pistol is housed in the original black plastic factory box with matching end label to the gun. The Walther P5 compact is a shorter and lighter version of the full size P5. Production of the compact started in 1988 at serial number 150000. Approximately 24000 P5c’s were produced and the first 800 pistols (up to serial number 150800) can be considered as the early variation. These early pistols are fitted with wooden grips. Pistols with serial numbers above 150800 commonly have plastic grips. All full sizes Walther P5's have the magazine release in the heel of the grip. A few compacts were produced with a comparable heel release but these are considered to be very rare. This gun falls just outside of the first 800 (216 later) retaining wood checkered grips and the magazine thumb release, instead of the heel. Having the box is a great addition. With the limited production and importation of this gun, we imagine this will find a great home in a Walther Collectors safe. No trades but i can ship."

The Echo AR-II trigger does not come with a bolt carrier. You will need a full auto bolt carrier in your firearm for the Echo AR-II to function.   The Echo Trigger allows the shooter to select from 3 different settings  Safe Mode: Firearm will not fire. Semi-Automatic Mode: Firearm fires when trigger is pulled. Echo Mode: Firearm fires when trigger is pulled and also when trigger is released.  The Echo Trigger is designed with safety being the utmost priority. When the shooter is in the Echo Mode and depresses the trigger one round is fired, if the target moves, the shooter can move the selector to the safe position and a second round will not fire upon release.Check out this product here: http://www.battlecreekarmory.com/product-p/ftecho2t.htm"

The pistol comes with softcase, two high quality aftermarket Mec-Gar 18 round magazines and a mag loader. Also included is a 90 lumen NcSTAR pistol light that attaches to the front lower rail. The firearm is in great condition aesthetically and mechanically with less than 1,000 rounds through it since it was purchased in the summer of 2009. The Mec-Gar magazines are far superior to the factory mags (which were the only downside of this pistol out of the box). For those not familiar with the Taurus PT92 it is a clone of Beretta's iconic 92 series pistol which are still in widespread use by the US's armed forces today. Taurus purchased a factory, machining and tooling from Beretta in the '80's and improved on their design with a frame mounted safety/decocker. While Taurus's later design shortcomings may have led to a less than stellar reputation today, the PT92 stands out as practically equal in fit, finish and mechanical durability to its Italian cousins. Priced to move but I'm firm on the price. Buyer must have a valid Wisconsin DL and/or CCW (CCW preferred). Cash only. Tax return season will be here soon, pick up this package deal while it's still available!
Thanks for your interest."
