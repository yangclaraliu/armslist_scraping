I just purchased this pistol from a gun store one week ago. It's had 3 mags run through the gun to make sure it functions correctly which it does I had no malfunctions. It will come with original box, paperwork, gun lock, 3 mags. 2 12 round mags and 1 17 round mag. Gun comes standard with a big dot front sight which is very nice, easy to get gun back on target for follow up shots. The absolute only reason I am wanting to trade or sell this pistol is because I'm such a glocktard I can't get used to shooting other pistols and I've got glock mags running out of my ears so I'm wanting to trade this FN for a glock 19 or will take 500 cash. For the right deal I can throw in a nice OWB leather holster for the gun. I am a Missouri resident with my MO CCW license located in Columbia,MO but will do a reasonable amount of driving to make a deal no problem. I've made plenty of deals with folks in STL and everyone has been pleased with our meeting point. Thanks email only please"

Nickel outside is pitted of course for a hundred year old revolver but still looks great and rifling is good. Made off the Smith model 1 it has the free spinning cylinder.  (Meaning cylinders on these do not fully lock and will spin when cocked which is why gun shops don't recommend shooting them)Breaks open with a simple lever push and ejects spent casings very easy and fast to reload.Ejector works amazing and has good trigger pull in single action when cocking hammer and smooth easy pull in double action then push trigger forward if you pull it in double action to reset it.Gun does shoot and actually pretty accurate at 25 yards but for the age of course gun shops don't recommend you shooting them and because of it being the free spinning cylinder model.  Great conversation piece or great display item.Pick up in Utica or Newark area. thank you.Was gonna ask $200 but dropped to only $100 cash for a quick today 11/30/17 so of course sold as is."

There is not a lot of information you can find about these rifles, I will post one informal link below.These rifles are Iranian manufactured copies of Czech VZ24 rifles, which in turn are copies of German Karabiner 98ks. The Iranians purchased some Czech rifles under contract which should have Persian script on the side of the receiver, and on the graduations for the elevation adjustment, with a Persian crest top of the receiver. These rifles should should be marked BRNO. As I understand, the Iranians shortly after started to produce their own, which should have sight elevations in standard english numericals and the inscription on the side of the receiver should read ""made by Army Arms factory.""The serial number on this rifle matches the bolt. If there is a serial number on the underside of the barrel, I'm not sure if it matches. The stock appears to be an original Iranian Persian Mauser stock, however, the number on it does not match the bolt and receiver. I believe these stocks originally came with a brass slingplate, I could be mistaken. It is missing from the rifle. There is a little bit of damage on both sides of the forend of the stock around the barrel band. The front sight protective wings are also uniquely uneven. I've only shot this rifle once or twice, the bore seems to be in decent condition, it can hit torso plates at 200 yards repetitively. I have not tried to group this rifle on paper.Below is the link, (it is informal.) If any interested party has more information on these rifles, or if I made an error in the description, I would love to know.http://www.aliparsa.com/brno/brno.html"

For personal and property defense in rural areas or for police use in patrol vehicles, this is the .223 rifle that you’ll be seeing, because it will flat out-perform anything that has ever been built. As with all our AR .223 rifles, we guarantee this Thunder Ranch rifle to shoot 1/2 MOA groups.

I mounted it on my 6.5 Grendel upper and realized for me and my eyes, it is just a bit too small. I got this scope just a few months ago and it has basically sat in the safe. I want to get a different NIghtforce scope so I am letting this one go. This is the latest model with the Power Throw Lever (PTL), Illuminated reticle, AND Zero Stop. There are other models without these additional features that are less expensive but this is the fully loaded version! I will trade this for another Nightforce NXS or SHV as long as it is zero stop and MOAR. I would consider a Vortex Razor in trade but not a 1x variation. Minimum upper magnification would be 10 power, so a 2.5-10 or 3-18, or 4-14 etc. I don't want a huge scope, though I would consider the 5-25. No 8-32 etc. Please note: if this is listed it is NOT sold. I will take down the listing just as soon as it sells. If you ask me if it is still available, if you tell me your representative is going to handle the pickup or any other nonsense, you will be ignored. I will not answer you.
