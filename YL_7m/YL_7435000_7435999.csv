The dust covers are Strike Industry and the bolt carrier group is nickel/boron plated from WMD Guns.

It was made in 1999, and I believe I am the first one to ever fire it. It was purchased brand new from a gun store in 99, that owner had it for 17 years until he sold it ot the gun store that I purchased it from. It's in excellent condition, and I've only put 3 mags through it. It looked unfired when I bought it, it's an absolutely gorgeous hand...I just don't really like .45.This was one of the models sold with the Eagle Industries gray tactical soft case that has the cleaning kit and everything. The different pouches can be moved around in any position or replaced, as they are attached with velcro. These cases sell for $200+ online alone when they come up for sale, definitely something cool to have.It also comes with 3 mags (2-10 round mags, 1-12 round mag), Talon Grips (not installed) a GG&G rail adapter which lets you attach standard stuff, an HK Flash hider, HK thread protector, and 118 rounds of S&B 230gr range ammo I will also list everything below and approx how much they go for, so you can know this is a REALLY low price I'm asking. If you'd like, I can install the Talon grips for you before we meet for the deal.

Around 500rds on it. I’m willing to sell all or some of this package for the right price. Make offer, I’m more interested in a trade.The main thing I’m interested in is a .44mag. A Ruger Redhawk, Blackhawk, or Super Blackhawk is at the top of my list. A S&W 629 would also be keen. I would do a 10mm also. I’m really want a 4-ish inch barrel. I would consider other .44’s, 454, 460, 500. Its going to hurt a little letting this pistol go. I just started hunting and I really want a .44 for a hunting sidearm. I understand that there is about a hundred plus dollars differents in price between a Redhawk and a SR1911. I plan on making up the difference in extras. If you have ammo and a holster to offer I would be happy to work that into a trade. A Blackhawk is about a hundred dollars less than SR1911 so.....I travel between Denver and Fort Collins regularly. I go hunting in a week. If I can’t get a good trade by then I’m keeping the 1911 and will save up for a .44mag for next year.Please leave phone number if you want more pictures and details.

It comes with an aftermarket Silencerco Threaded Barrel ready to accept a suppressor, muzzle brake, compensator, or whatever else you would like to thread onto it. The slide is complete with Ghost Ring sights that double as night sights. I actually really like these sight and am going to install some on my 1911. The package is complete with a lower parts kit, and 1 standard OEM Glock magazine. This is perfect for Polymer 80 builds since that was what these parts were on. I am also throwing in the Polymer 80 locking block/ rail mechanism with the screws to fix it to the polymer 80 frame; however, you will not need this if you buy a new Polymer 80 frame as it will come with a brand new one. You could also buy a stripped Glock 17 Generation 3 frame and put this build together that way. The barrel, sights, and channel liner were all installed by a gunsmith. I shot a total of 7 rounds with these parts attached before realizing that I do not like the way Glock type handguns feel in my hands. Everything functioned decently; since I shot such a small amount of rounds through it, you will still have to go through a break-in period for the handgun especially if you go down the polymer 80 route. I am selling everything for under what I paid for it excluding the installation fee I got from the gunsmith!! I am selling it because I know it will sit in my safe and never be touched so I do not mind letting go of it for less than what I put into even though everything is still practically brand new (there are some moderate wear marks here and there). I can ship anywhere (legally of course) with either FedEx or UPS and it will be completely free for you, or we can meet up anywhere in Atlanta or Augusta since I go there from time to time. Make sure these components are legal in your state if you want me to ship; I would hate having to cancel because of legality issues! Thanks for looking at my post and have a great day!!"
