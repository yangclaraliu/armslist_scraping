With our new Solomon trigger with the pre-travel stop built into the trigger, over-travel adjustment, and a flat face for a better feel. All of the springs remain the same so that you still get the pull weight reduction as well. You can't go wrong with our new Solomon Short Stroke Trigger Kit, get yours today! -This complete trigger kit includes the Galloway Precision hammer, reduced power hammer spring, reduced power blocker spring, reduced power lifter, reduced power firing pin return spring, along with the all new Solomon short stroke trigger. -This will create, when correctly installed, a lighter by 1.5 lb trigger pull that has a 50% shorter than stock trigger pull length and reset. The break is still at the rear of travel but reset and rest are at the half way point of stock pull. -All parts must be installed to get the correct performance and the use of the Solomon trigger does require removal of the mag disconnect spring and plate. Be aware on older 320 and 321 prefixes we are seeing the trigger cross pin (2 on parts diagram) is undersized and or worn and will need to be replaced to correct erratic disconnect issues. This part is available directly from Ruger via shopruger.com We strive to make all parts we manufacture to be drop in, although there is the rare occasion where a part will HAVE to be fitted to the tolerances of your particular pistol. We cannot control the tolerances of mass produced firearms, therefore we highly suggest that if you run into a tolerance issue to contact us at tech@gallowayprecision.com before taking it to a qualified armorer to fit the part. We also offer installation of all triggers, trigger kits, and parts that we make for a nominal fee. -Fits Ruger LC9 and LC380 Pistol. Will NOT fit the LC9s. -Select from Black, Red, and Hybrid trigger colors. *** A 20% restocking fee will be applied on returned trigger kits that have been installed. Non-installed parts will receive a full refund minus shipping. ***"

This watch is the ultimate in a high end Dive/Sport/Dress watch, and is priced at almost 1/2 the cost of the 2017 comparable models, at our local Breitling authorized dealer, which is Osborne Jewelers here in Huntsville. This is like finding NEW/OLD stock from a Breitling dealer at 50% off. Everything about this watch is in Pristine Breitling condition. It has the official Breitling box's, warranty card and authenticity booklet form from Breitling. Breitling has been making fine time pieces since 1884 and is considered in the top (3) major manufacturers of watches like Rolex, and Omega in the world. 1. Breitling Calibre 74 SuperQuartz movement that is COSC Certified (thermo-compensated ETA Thermoline 955-652 ebauche), with stated accuracy to within +/-10 seconds per year. These watches are fitted with a lithium battery (with an expected 8 year battery life and 'EOL' indicator). Just changed out the battery, so you should have no maintenance expenses for the next 7+ years. 2. WR is 500m/1650' vs. the newer comparable models having only a WR rating of 200m. 3. Dial is 'Volcano Black', with a 'Guilloche' concentric circle pattern (see pic), and white '3-D' Arabic numbering. IMO this watch dial is absolutely beautiful. 4. The case has a Satin-Brushed finish to the upper surfaces and bezel, with a contrasting High- Polished finish to the sides and case back. 5. Sapphire crystal with anti glare coating. 6. The watch is mounted on its original stainless steel Professional II bracelet, which is a very smart 'slash-cut' link style in a satin-brushed finish, and it comes with (2) extra links. 7. Case is perfect size at 41.1mm Stainless Steel Case, and it is only about 13.5mm thick, which includes the crystal and bezel and it will fit comfortably under a dress shirt cuff. 41mm also makes it the perfect size for a Dive/Sport/Dress watch category, 8. Signed Screw down crown & back. 9. Guaranteed 100% original Breitling Aeromarine “Super Quartz” model: A74380 10. There is no doubt that Breitlings are well made Dive/Sport/Dress watches. They have superior manly looks with great utilitarian appeal. They are built like armored tanks, but yet they don't look like a tuna can on your wrist, as some Dive/Sport watches do. Knowledge is a powerful thing when placed in the right hands. Un-informed buyers are paying $6000+ for 12+ year old used Rolex Submariners (which are considered in spec if they run +/-3 to 6 seconds per day in accuracy, and have a “WR” rating of 300m.) I have owned several Rolex Subs in the past, and they are not only very expensive to buy, but very expensive to maintain every 4-5 years at $500+ each time for that service. The Submariner's can't compete with this Breitlings specifications, like “WR” to 500m and accuracy to within +/-10 seconds per year. Gee! What's not to like about this watch.This Breitling is the perfect grab and go watch from anyone's collection. Perfect Xmas gift for yourself, dad, son or grandson, because it is a watch that can be passed on from one generation to the next. If you are military and getting ready to deploy this is the watch to have on your wrist. I will donate $100 to the “Wounded Warrior Foundation” upon purchase of my watch. I will consider pistols as trades with cash or multiple pistols as trade collateral. Please no hunting rifles or shotguns. I'm 71 y.o. and just selling off some of my nicer possessions, because of total retirement and really no place for me to wear them anymore. When you are considering trades, please use a reasonable cash value for what you are offering. Please see my HK P30SK I have on armslist as well?*******NO TEXT WILL BE ANSWERED********"
