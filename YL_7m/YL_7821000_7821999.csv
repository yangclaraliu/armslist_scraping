I'm a domestic violence victim . Didn't know it until it was too late that my now ex spent time for attempted murder . Live on my own but only for a few days now.  Things are very uncomfortable and I need some sort of protection . This all happened very quickly and has caught me at a time I have no money . I now know what this man is capable of and I do not see that it would be smart of me to be unprotected. I can not move or relocate at this time so I'm a sitting duck. I have no family to turn too so I guess that's the reason for my add. My daddy didn't raise a fool and he taught me how to be a marksman I'm a dead eye crack shot trust and believe that so here's my plee to the gun lovers out there. I'm in need of a packable but perferd heavier pistol Im not really a composite stock kinda girl I like to know what I have in my hand ... 9mm or larger please I don't need this psycho looking at me saying ouch and me having to unload  on him he's a dangerous man . I'd prefer a pistol because I have no car at the moment and have to walk a lot of where I go . I don't want to be a moving target . I live in fallon out in the country kinda so you never know what's lerking I'm the shadows . if a pistol is unavalible a shot gun will work for a home defence gun. short barrel would be nice I live in a travel trailer so there's not much room . Pump action only i want to only have to jack one in and pray that he knows I'm not kidding. I again don't have any money currently but I do have $300 in Lowe's gift cards and some of MY tools I can trade . please text me at REDACTED that's the best and quickest way to contact me ... thank you
