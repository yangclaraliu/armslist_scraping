It is
designed for use by civilian and security markets. The MKA 1919 Match - Pro is unlike many other 12 gauge shotguns, it is very light and ergonomic, this is due to the use of modern and high strength composites. The mix of AR and semi-auto shotgun features balance out well to create a very workable, flexible shotgun.
The MKA 1919 Match - Pro semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from high grade aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer. On the upper receiver, an integral picatinny rail exists which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments.
EAA's MKA 1919 Match Pro has an aluminum handguard allowing for additional accessories to be used. The shogun comes with two 10 round magazines, different chokes for different applications and choke key."

The inertia-driven system does not use gas pressure generated by the firing of a shell to push the action back. This means fewer moving parts which generally translates to fewer problems.
Stoeger Model 2000 Tactical 12ga 18 1/2"" Barrel Reliability, versatility, and value make the Model 2000 the ideal semi-auto shotgun. Inside the Stoeger Model 2000 semi-auto shotgun is the Inertia Driven operating system, the heart of the world's most prestigious and reliable autoloaders. The Inertia Driven system has only three moving parts in the bolt, the inertia spring, the bolt body, and the rotating locking head, for more reliable operation. The operating system is mostly contained in the receiver, giving the Model 2000 a trimmer for-end with better balance. The Stoeger Model 2000 fires everything from 1-1/8 ounce field and target loads to the heaviest 3"" waterfowl loads without adjustments. Plus, with no propellant gas venting into the operating system, the Model 2000 stays cleaner. The bolt assembly includes an inertia spring and a rotating locking head and a cavity is designed into the butt stock of the Model 2000 to allow installation of an optional, mercury-filled recoil reducer. The Defense version of the 2000 features a matte black synthetic stock with a pistol grip and a blade front sight.

Prefer S&W but open to others especially of its something uncommon like a Rhino or a special edition. I appreciate their history and value but I'm not really looking for collectibles right now. 38spl, 357mag and 44mag would be my first pick but open to other calibers. I lean towards DA/SA but would consider DAO. Preferably stock. Not really interested in ammo or multiples of the same extras like holsters. For the trade I have a still practically new 2017 production SIG P225-A1 9mm (all black model with G10 grips and SIGLITE sights plus the standard SRT from the factory) in the original case with the manual, lock, plastic wrapper, tags, sticker and 2 8rd mags. I always use a revolver for carry and I have other well worn SIGs just for the range already so I haven't touched it. Even trades or trades withe extras/cash, normally I'm fine with adding cash but I just cant think of any at a higher price I must have cause I already have the ones I absolutely had to have.... so far. The SIG will be transferred on EFA10 only since its not approved but you can still use a FFL for yours if you need to. I wont answer ""Got a S&W XXX-XX"" type replies that really don't provide much info. If your local and have a personal transfer I can be free just about any time if not we can figure out another time. All laws will be followed. Thanks."
