These were manufactured as a standard Army contract pistol and are distinguishable only by the serial number ranges. They all exhibit the early Colt parts and markings as follows; the left side of the frame has the small ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY"". Directly above the magazine catch release button is marked with the circled intertwined ""WGP"" of Major Walter G. Penfield the US Ordnance inspector at Colt. The right side frame is marked with the serial number and the top of the frame has the early acceptance proofs of the letter ""H"" and ""T"". The left side of the slide is marked with the very early Colt two-line patent/ address markings of ""PATENTED APR 20 1897/SEPT. 9 1902, DEC 19 1905, FEB 14,1911"",and ""COLT'S PT. F.A. MFG CO./HARTFORD. CT. U.S.A."" with the Rampant Colt behind the serrations. It also has the early round top rear sight and narrow front sight. The various parts and components are all the early versions such as; blue Colt barrel with the single ""P and H"" on top, early 1911 checkered slide stop, thin thumb piece, short grip safety, flat mainspring housing and the early short Colt hammer with the wide checkered spur. Two tone magazine with lanyard ring on the base and fitted with checkered walnut grips with a diamond around the screws and lanyard ring on the heel. But we must remember as these Colts 103 years old where disassembled for cleaning , many parts were picked up my mistake during reassembly serial Number: 36434, this was the second contract in 1913. Condition: Fair as refinished. The pistol shows mostly an artificial dark plum brown finish on the slide and frame with light wear through turning a gray patina on the front edges of the slide and the front grip strap. The various early components noted above are all correct period manufacture but some have been touched up or exhibit less browning as they have a bright blue finish. The grips are very good with a few minor dings and wear, and very crisp checkering. Most of these USMC 1911's saw heavy use and went through many rebuilds. very few Marine Corps 1911’s remain as most were lost in battle during WWI,the Banna wars and WWII To find one in any condition is difficult"

I do not know if it was converted by the Military, or by Law Enforcement, or by the Prision system....all of which used the trench shotgun.   It is a solid frame shotgun. The bore does not have any corrosion, but is a little dull. I feel that it will shine up witha few rounds fired thru it. It has the "" slam fire "" feature that was popular back in the day for shotguns , if you decide to shoot it that way.   It comes with the proper period sling. The heat shield / bayonet assembly is the WWI variety with the PAT. APPL FOR marking. Exposed hammer. This is a very nice classic shotgun in very good condition. $1895 .  Face to face in Oklahoma."

It's in great mechanical condition, but it was carried, and does have holster wear. Anyone who has had buying one of these on their radar, knows how tough it is to find one—especially in the Tupperware, and If you haven't considered adding one to your collection, why not? They aren't going to get any cheaper!Since deciding to part with this Glock, I have been watching similar gen 1 17's selling on GB for $1,400-$2,800...just in the last couple of weeks, and can prove it. That said, I think those prices are outlandish, and would never expect that, though it's probably warranted in states like Massachusetts, which allows pre-ban ownership.  All things considered, I'm asking $1,100 OBO, or trade!

The pistol is comprised of a Caracal International frame and a Caracal USA slide, and is assembled in the United States. Only a limited number of these pistols will be placed into the market, commemorating Caracal’s commitment in the industry and Caracal USA’s first consumer product release.
The Enhanced F – Limited Edition pistol features a redundant safety system consisting of an integrated trigger safety, firing pin safety and a drop safety.
The ergonomically designed contoured polymer frame, with its intuitive grip angle, incorporates a rail interface system for mounting lights, lasers and other shooting accessories. With an 18mm (0.71”) distance from the center axis of the barrel to the apex of the tang, the low slide profile puts the recoil axis close to the shooter's hand, which greatly reduces muzzle rise and felt recoil. The trigger shoe, trigger safety and trigger bar have all been designed in conjunction with a one-piece multi-function unit to provide an exceptionally smooth and crisp trigger press. This low bore axis principle, with the intuitive grip angle, the low-profile slide and proprietary trigger system make the Enhanced F an extremely comfortable and intuitive pistol for shooters of all skill levels.
The one-piece multi-function unit (MFU) incorporates the full length (4.25”) steel slide guide, which greatly increases rigidity and durability, and diminishes felt recoil by reducing torsion and flexing of the grip frame during firing. The MFU sub-assembly, which bears all internals, provides for ease of manufacturing and assembly, as well as disassembly for routine cleaning and armorer level service.
The Enhanced F provides a fully supported chamber in a 4” cold hammer forged barrel with a right-hand twist.
Sight configurations on the Enhanced F consist of a standard 3 dot steel, full-length (6.5”) sight system with both front and rear sights are now dovetail mounted, and the slides will be compatible with many aftermarket sight products.
The Enhanced F also marks the return of the “Quick-Sight system,” which features a rear sight that is machined into the slide and located just in front of the ejection port. The “Quick Sight System” places both the front and rear sights on a single focal plane allowing the shooter to acquire a flash sight picture on a target extremely fast. While reduced sight radius increases the need for proper sight alignment at extended distances, the pistol maintains its inherent accuracy standards and is more than capable of accurate fire out to 50 meters.
The metal parts of the Enhanced F receive a QPQ salt bath nitriding process, which results in a very durable surface that also protects well against rust and other forms of wear.
All parts are produced and tested under exacting tolerances to ensure interchangeability for Military and Law Enforcement applications.
The Enhanced F – Limited Edition pistol is shipped in a Caracal branded hard case with two 18-round magazines, an Otis cleaning kit, cable lock, and user manual. MSRP for the Enhanced F – Limited Edition is $599.00 and is backed by a limited lifetime warranty, which covers all material and workmanship defects for the life of the product under the ownership of the original end user."

My dad loved shooting his Nylon 66, when he passed it down to me, I loved it and now my son has it and loves it. This stock is in very good condition, the exception is its missing a piece on the front of the stock. The missing piece will not interfere with your Nylon 66 functionality or shoot ability. Since these stocks are Nylon/Plastic, they can be finely cut and joined together via plastic welding or using plastic-weld epoxy. Anyways hope this is what you are looking for to get your Nylon 66 up and Running.  Questions please feel free to let me know. Bob call or txt: 336-944-7878"

It is still STI's number one selling pistol, for good reason. Dave designed the EDGE to be as heavy as possible in a 5 inch platform, no flat top or lightening cuts means that extra weight tames recoil and shoots softer. This helps tame major loads down, and those hot 9mm loads that 3 gunners use. Still true today if you own an EDGE you have an EDGE on those who don't. It starts with a state of the art 2011 long wide frame which adds weight and reduces felt recoil. CNC machined unique barstock slide, match grade bull barrel fit to ultra tight specs. Adjustable bomar style rear sight for a perfect zero, ambi thumb safety and magwell. If you're going to shoot in USPSA limited, this is the pistol that dominates that class. When you're ready to buy, remember we only work on the pistols we sell, to provide our customers with the fastest, most knowledgeable service available. Dave knows STI."
