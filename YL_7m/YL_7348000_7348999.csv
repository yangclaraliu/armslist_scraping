A beveled loading port, redesigned carrier and a new two-piece carrier latch have all been incorporated into the new SBE 3 to make loading the magazine effortless.

The 5-25x56 PM II line is no different. The 5-25x56 PM II riflescope from Schmidt & Bender is known for its versatility with a large magnification range. If long distance is what you're after, then you'll enjoy the ability to see over 6500 feet with the 5-25x56 PM II. One of the big features is the MTC (More Tactile Clicks). MTC makes it easier for the shooter to count the necessary clicks when adjusting the reticle. There's nothing quite like the 5-25x56 PM II from Schmidt & Bender. The Schmidt & Bender 5-25x56 PM II is one of the most universal scopes that will meet the most demanding needs of shooters.

As with our previous compact range finder (CRF) models the CRF 1000-R is small and compact. Perfectly molded for easy, one-handed operation and small enough to fit in a pocket. As the number in the name implies, the unit will range targets effectively out to 1,000 yards, but the CRF 1000-R adds a new and exciting twist as well. The Leica CRF 1000-R not only offers lightning fast line of sight distance to target, but also accounts for angle of inclination/declination, to provide Equivalent Horizontal Range (EHR) (using ""rifleman's rule"") from as little as 10 yards out to 600 yards. This makes it ideal for the bow hunter in a tree stand taking a short shot at steep angle, or for many rifle shots taken in mountainous terrain as well. The CRF 1000-R will replace the existing CRF 1000 models and will be offered at the same price in the market. As such, it remains an affordable option for the shooter who wants Leica precision, but does not require the advantage of extended range and/or the ballistic capabilities provided by the Leica CRF 1600-B and its sophisticated Advanced Ballistic Compensation (ABC) system. Not surprisingly, the physical specifications & dimensions remain the same, only the functionality & versatility have changed. We expect our friends in the archery market to especially appreciate the new twist though!

The CTR stands for compact tactical rifle and it features a black synthetic stock, stainless steel barrel, 10 round magazine and integrated picatinny rail across the top of the action.     The Tikka T3x is the next generation of the renowned T3 rifle. These new T3x rifles are built to the same standards that so many have come to rely on from the original T3, and continue to boast a hammer forged barrel, sturdy stocks, and smooth bolt actions. They still offer a 3-shot sub-MOA accuracy guarantee right out of the box, and will continue to represent the great value of the Tikka rifle line. Some new features that set the T3x apart from its older brother include the following:  Modular synthetic stock allows the pistol grip to be changed out for a more personalized and comfortable fit Improved asymmetrical grip pattern and shape that will better accommodate grip in any condition Upgraded recoil pad to mitigate felt recoil Foam insert to lessen noise that is produced from the stock (not available in models with adjustable cheek piece) Redesigned ejection port that creates easier single feeding through the ejection port Improved rail attachment via an extra screw placement on top of the receiver for sturdier rail placement A robust metallic bolt shroud to cover and shield the rear of the bolt body and firing pin Steel recoil lug to decrease deformation even in larger calibers compared the aluminum ones in use in T3 rifles Chassis made by Tikka are short action only.

Serial number dates this revolver to 1918. Great mechanical condition, reliable and accurate. This is a shooter with the collectability of a well used war horse. Finish is blued (most likely refinished some years ago) with a couple of spots of rust on the cylinder and frame, thin spots around muzzle and some scratches (I'd call it 75% condition). Wood grips have several scratches but are sound without cracks or chips; currently wearing vintage k-frame square but grips (not pictured). Lanyard loop has been removed. Included are one full moon clip and four half moons, however this model can be loaded and fired safely without the use of clips (just need to pluck out the empties). NO SHIPPING, don't even ask. Face to face transfer in Morganton. I will need to see a permit and I.D. Thanks for looking."
