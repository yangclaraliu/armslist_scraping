Oakley’s Three-Point Fit retains the lenses in precise optical alignment.  FEATURES Plutonite Lens One of the most optically pure materials used in eyewear today, it maximizes clarity and impact resistance while filtering out 100% of all UVA, UVB, UVC and harmful blue light up to 400nm. Not a coating, the UV protection is from the lens material itself. High Definition Optics High Definition Optics (HDO) is a collection of patented technologies that allow Oakley eyewear to meet or exceed the testing standards of the American National Standards Institute for optical clarity, visual fidelity, and impact resistance. Impact Protection Backed by decades of innovation, Oakley performance eyewear offers uncompromising protection against high-velocity and high-mass impact. The protection is a benefit of the premium materials and unique architectures of Oakley lens/frame combinations. UV Protection Eye damage attributed to ultraviolet light includes cataracts, pterygium and macular degeneration. Our Plutonite® lens material filters out 100% of all UVA, UVB, UVC and harmful blue light up to 400nm. The protection is from the lens material itself. O-Matter A stress-resistant frame material that withstands environmental extremes, it is lightweight yet highly durable. Controlled flexibility enhances impact resistance while contributing to the all-day comfort of frames made with this innovative synthetic. *Prescription Lenses Not Available*"

I bought this rifle because of its coolness factor and large caliber. but realisticly, I am not going hunting for large game or even deer anytime soon, so I need to let this go. the cheapest 300 winmag large ring mauser on gunbroker is $600 and the average price for one is $1000+. I would consider $600 for mine or trade for something of equal price. I am not a hunter, so it needs to be something I can enjoy at the range. cash is king REDACTED"

Frame has been modified with standard stippling, and groove under trigger guard sligltly ground a little higher for a higher grip, and finger grooves on front of grip ground off. This is the same pistol that was listed a week or so ago, but it was removed as I had a buyer agree to buy it. I've been doing this long enough to not remove the listing based on ""I'm ready to meet. Let's meet."" I know better. Anyway, here she is, listed again.At any rate, this is a brand new firearm, priced not much higher than the best prices you'll see on a Gen 4 after tax. You end up paying very little for the frame modification.Price is fairly firm, but open to offers. NO TRADES (unless you want to offer a P226 Legion SAO or something similar. Sorry, but I dont want your used AK).DO NOT SEND ME EMAILS TELLING ME ABOUT HOW YOU ARE OUT OF STATE AND CANNOT MEET, BUT WILL SEND A CERTIFIED CHECK, blah, blah, blah. WE ALL know that scam, and I am already dealing with a number of them right now. Just dont bother.We will meet face to face and exchange cash for a handgun, or you will wire me money and I will ship the firearm to an FFL."

It is a post-Korea Harrington & Richardson build, 1954/55. All parts are original and entirely HRA. Everything is in excellent condition, see pictures. It has appropriate Department of Defense and Proof cartouches on original walnut stock. An extremely good looking rifle. This is also an EXCEPTIONALLY accurate rifle. Ive only ever used iron sights/never mounted any scopes or boogered with the reciever etc. Once dialed in, I continually ring small steel plates at 300 yards. I am hoping not to sell but will if my price is met. I am wanting to trade for a equal or similar condition Winchester M1 Garand. I could POSSIBLY be interested in an early, good condition Colt SP1 AR-15 as well. Not interested in anything new, sorry but I have tons of new guns and all manner of AR stuff.
Rifle is currently located with me in Tallahassee but I make frequent trips to daytona beach on some weekends and can get to the central florida/Orlando area easily."
