The pics show it all but more than just the die set I'm including a spare primer removal shaft, 4 spare primer removal pins, a RCBS #10 shell holder and a sample-size container of Imperial Sizing Die Wax. Together the worth is well over $50 but I have used it twice in my Dillon 500RL so technically it is no longer ""new"" so pricing it accordingly.   Here is a little description detailing the selling points of this setup. First paid = first owned. Local pickup available only at a either my home or a location of your choosing.  The RCBS AR Series die set is a must for any progressive reloader. Each set comes packaged with a full length small base sizing die and a taper crimp seating die. With this combination reloading for an AR-style, semi-automatic, pump action or lever action rifle just became a lot easier. Small base sizing dies size brass to minimum specifications and help to ensure that cartridges will chamber every time. The taper crimp seating die is helpful as it is a bit more forgiving die for crimping cases that have variable case lengths; helping to reduce the number of bulges and buckled shoulders when crimping in bullets with a cannelure. Due to the fact that this product sizes more than regular dies, it is crucial to have a sufficient amount of high quality lubricant to prevent stuck cases. These dies will also work with any single stage or turret press that will accept 7/8""-14 threaded dies, Shellholder sold separately.  RCBS® AR Series Die Sets are a must for progressive reloaders. They feature a Small Base Sizer Die designed for semi-automatic firearms, and a Taper Crimp Seater Die. The Small Base Sizer guarantees the cartridge will rechamber in AR-platform weapons."

Two toned and well cared for and is the later model with an F serial number. This gun is patterned after the P226 and is only 10% smaller so in your hand this gun feels like a compact 9mm not a little toy like so many 22 guns. The breakdown for cleaning is just rotating one lever. I bought the gun used and it had a gritty trigger and I had ftf almost every magazine. I took the gun apart and cleaned up machining marks on the internals and polished the feed ramp (which had a ridge on it causing the ftf’s) and changed the recoil spring to the supplied lighter one. The trigger is now smooth and I have had no failure to feeds with the mini mags I usually shoot or with a box of Remington Golden Bullets. It is now far superior to a new one in my opinion. The sale includes the gun, one magazine, two additional front sights of different heights to customize the gun to you and your ammo, the paperwork, the heavy recoil spring, the safety lockout key, and of course the all important cable lock. Internet reviews are mixed but with the work done to it this is an excellent gun with the big gun feel and in 22 so it’s affordable to shoot and enjoy. Any questions or to see it let me know. The small print: cash only. Must see photo ID showing IN residence. And must be legally able to purchase and own a handgun in Indiana. We must meet face to face and no shipping."

At the heart of the 101 is a low profile steel receiver that enhances quick and instinctive shooting needed for upland hunting. With the low profile receiver, recoil occurs in-line, directly back, reducing muzzle jump for faster follow-up shots. A Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad absorbs recoil also aiding in getting off rapid second shots, while reducing shooter fatigue so you can stay alert and ready to instantly shoulder the gun again when another bird flushes. The Model 101 uses the field proven Invector-Plus™ interchangeable choke tube system that works hand-in-hand with .742 back-bored barrels to reduce shot deformation and promote uniform shot patterns to consistently down birds. Hard, chrome-plated chambers and bores provide surfaces that are highly resistant to wear and corrosion, and clean easily. The Winchester Model 101 Ultimate Field Over/Under Shotgun comes with a finely finished walnut stock and forend with 20 lines-per-inch cut checkering that looks elegant and provides a non-slip grip. All metal components are machined to exact tolerances, and wood-to-metal fit is extremely tight. Comes with 3 Invector-Plus choke tubes (F, M, IC).

This is a hard to find, highly collectible rifle, I can't find another Model Six for sale on the Internet, they were only made from 1981 to 1987. Rifle is in Excellent Condition, action is tight, has hand cut checking (not stamped/pressed) front and rear. Bore is bright, rifling is crisp, the finish on steel and the walnut is very nice, no signs of abuse, the quality of the wood is exceptional. Stock has small area between butt plate and wood where the stock is lightly elevated, it is not soft or rotten and the finish is perfect there. Stock has Monte Carlo raised cheekpiece, and sling studs front and rear. Rifle apprear to be little fired, everything works, nothing missing. I got this rifle in a trade so I dont know the history, but it is a catch for a Remington collector or anyone looking for a fast handling hard hitting woods gun for North American game, and Remington pump rilfes have a reputation for fine accuracy and reliablity. Will meet buyer in Southern Maryland as far north as Upper Marlboro for a FTF cash and carry, legally compliant sale during daylight hours in a public setting, buyer must be MD legal resident with no arrest record.  Active duty military stationed in MD ok.

Broken in with one shot, clean, one shot, clean for 15 rounds (took 2 seperate 5 hour shooting days to complete) then cleaned after 5 rounds twice (third shooting day). Has since been cleaned after every 5-10 shots. I bought it with the intent to compete, however 2 job changes and 3 states later, I don't have the time to, and also don't believe there are any competitions in my area. I don't expect to get what I paid for it, however I am not in any dire need to sell it. The cheapest I can find it for online is $3,500 before taxes and fees. I am willing to sell for $3,300 for the rifle, however $4,200 is the out the door price, as I will only sell it with the stainless steal case ($500) and the monopod+bipod set up.I didn't skimp on the accessories, bought the hard case and the ""essentials kit"" from Allied Precision Arms which was just over $1,000 with taxes and fees. I will drop $100 off the accessories as the case has standard wear and tear. Note that this is the only case specifically designed for the national match rifle, and does not require any parts to be disassembled to put into the case (other than the bolt being removed). I also have about 500 or so rounds I can sell for $3.50 a shot (same cost as the cheapest BMG ammo I could find online, however this is 750 grain ammo I paid $5.00 a shot for almost 2 years ago).I will not ship. I will pay any filing fee to have the ownership document with a licensed firearms dealer.Pre-Purchase fire is encouraged, however I want to discourage people from coming out just to shoot it. I will require a $20 non-refundable deposit on the rifle (that goes towards the purchase price of the rifle if purchased), and $5 per shot fired (My ammo, If you purchase the rifle, you get 2 shots [$10]refunded, and any shots past the initial two are reduced to $3.50/round). Please feel free to call/text me with any questions at REDACTED."

Most of these were used by SS and Luftwaffe field-division units during 1941-45. The Luftwaffe started phasing out Mg.15s out of Long-range bombers and JU87s in late 1940 to be replaced with Mg.181s. Mg.15s still serviceable found their way to ground-service conversions. Some found their way initially to DAK units and later to SS and Foreign-volunteer Divisions in the Eastern front as weapons demands began to place a toll. This is one of such machineguns. Originally designed by Kreighoff and manufactured by Rheinmetall, Borsig A.G. They were marked St.61 on all receivers ( MG.15 export code) to initially be sent as military-Aid to Hungary, Romania and other Axis-allied countries. As the tides of war began to reverse, SS and Wehrmacht troops put these in service. All Mg.15s pulled from Luftwaffe service were sent to MAS in France and redesigned for ground-role with the addition of a water jacket and new barrel bushings in 1942 and sent to the Eeastern front.Excellent condition overall, with undented water jacket, and the correct, shortened Mg.34 bipod. Luftwaffe nazi "" Eagle/over/2"" marked on the right side of the trigger guard, on the trigger, on the cocking lever, on the magazine lock, on the sustained-fire button, on the front sight and on a few other places. A very interesting water-cooled variant, complete with elevated sights, huge water jacket and original bipod. Brass plug still in place. RARE bakelit housing.

Barrel rifling and lockup is sharp and looks brand new. (Some dust/lint is hiding in there. Carpeted safe.)I'm a perfectionist with my CZs, so for good measure I swapped the sear cage springs, trigger return spring, and hammer spring for new Cajun Gun Works long life components. Old springs were fine upon further inspection but it's better to be safe than sorry.Also installed a new CGW firing pin, firing pin spring, and firing pin retaining pin for good measure.The old grips were dry and cracking, so I also purchased new OEM rubber grips. Now she's looking clean!This pistol as it sits has a near infinite service life. I hope it goes to someone who will shoot the heck out of it. Please keep in mind that these sold for $450 without any of my upgrades added ($150 worth!) New ones retail for $600. I feel that my asking price is fair. Therefore the price is fixed. Thank you for understanding.Will come with one 15 round full size magazine (what it came with) including it's original box and whatnot. I can include blue G10 starburst grips (made by CoolHand) for $480 total. They look sharp and I paid $60 for them off Amazon. $450 without the grips."
