Gun is AMAZINGLY tight, like I said, sock drawer gun from an amazing time in quality for S&W.  I'd wager it hasn't been shot much over the years.  One chip in the grips (pictured, grips are defined and not worn down). A little finish wear under the trigger guard (maybe from a holster at some point?), some short cracks in the grips under side near the top (by the trigger guard area, towards the front strap, I have lots more pictures of this pistol I can send anyone interested). I've got a pile of revolvers right now (got on a Smith kick for a while there, still am a bit), but I just don't shoot this one... I feel like it is too nice, plus I've got a 15-2, a couple of model 10's... I'd rather have something different, I bought this on impulse because it was a nice clean example.  I've been offered my asking price probably 3 years ago when I first bought this, so that's what I'm asking cash (prices are pretty high on these things in good shape).  Trade value maybe a tad above my asking price unless I'm really into your offer.  Some older guns people are afraid to shoot because they're fragile (not so here)... I just don't shoot this one much because it is so nice for the age!  Think I've taken it out twice since I've owned it for a few shots... I mostly just show it off to other gun guys!  For any pistol trades I do have pistol permits in hand!"

Has the fixed barrel for unparalleled strength and reability and bottom eject for ambidestrous use. I've had it for about 3 years and it's just sat in my safe since I got it, maybe put about 50 shells through it when I first got it. This gun is built like a tank but it's not too heavy as solid as it's made. Just don't use it and really don't want to have anything happen to it as nice and expensive of a shotgun as it is. Would sell it but I'd really like to trade for a Mossberg I would get more use out of. All laws apply must be legally allowed to own and have valid OH ID CCW preferred.
