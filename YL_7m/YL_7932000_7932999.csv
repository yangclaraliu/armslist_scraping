Please click link below. https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/hogue-ar15-g10-grips-olive-drab-green-camo-15168/ AR15 G10 GMa Grn Description: Hogue AR15 / M16 G10 grips are precision machined to fit securely and seamlessly to your AR15 or M16 lower. Hogue G10 AR grips will even fit any other firearm that uses standard AR15 / M16 grips. Our G10 AR grips have been specifically designed to work with our CMS (Cargo Management System) kits, as well as with Samson AR15 field kits. G10 grips are precision machined from the highest quality G10 material available to exacting specifications. G10 is a high-pressure thermoset plastic laminate consisting of multiple layers of woven fiberglass mesh cloth impregnated with an epoxy resin binder. It can be produced with many layers of the same color, or different colors to achieve a specific cosmetic look. Typical G10 is made of only flat layers. Hogue Inc. has a new patented method of producing G10 material called G-MascusÂ®. This method produces different patterns within the colored material which produces a unique look. Grips made in this style take on a similar look to Damascus steel, hence the name G-Mascus. Our G10 grips are designed for a lifetime of use."

I had them removed by a local gun shop that had to use heat to get the front sight out. It still works fine but has a black mark on the white dot (not the tritium). These run anywhere between $75-$100 but I’m letting them go for $25. They’re great sights but I had trouble getting used to “dotting the I” after shooting 3 dot sights so long. ***See pictures***

So you can guess this class of love spells is the easiest to do. There are very many great benefits that you can enjoy when you cast these spells.

It is in near perfect condition with no mars or scratches other than a pin-head size factory blemish in buttstock.  (It came that way).

I have no idea who built it, but whoever it was knew his stuff ! It is a series 70 Colt with the slide tightened, lowered and flared ejection port, BO-MAR sights, bobbed hammer, Beavertail grip safety, extended thumb safety, custom trigger, and an awesome 3 lb trigger job that breaks like a glass rod. Pistol retains the original Series 70 Colt barrel and bushing. Colt grips and Colt stainless magazine. I am sure that the pistol has been re-finished after the work was done. It retains about 100% of the matt bluing . No scratches or wear anywhere on the pistol. Slide sides are polished some. The Custom work alone would cost more than I am asking for this great shooting pistol. Thanks for looking. $40 covers transfer to your FFL and Priority mail in the lower 48."

Must meet at Markley’s gun shop in Watsonville The action of the EMP® is 1/8 inch shorter than that of the original 1911. This translates into several concrete advantages for the shooter. The shorter grip radius produces a shockingly comfortable shooting experience. You have to shoot the EMP® to believe how controllable it is. The shorter dimensions also work to increase reliability – something that’s crucial in a concealed carry pistol. And of course, the overall dimensions are one of the smallest 1911s out there.The good news doesn’t stop with the innovative design. The EMP® comes loaded with all the features you expect in a 1911 of this class – like low profile 3-Dot tritium combat sights and a match grade fully supported and ramped barrel. And with 9+1 rounds of 9mm, the EMP® packs an amazing amount of punch in one of the smallest 1911s ever."
