I really hate to sell it, but bills are coming due. She's an excellent shooter, I've put probably a thousand rounds through her without a single malfunction. She's got Romanian surplus dong furniture on her, and I have some spare furniture lying around that I'll throw in. Outfitted with a bakelite grip, bungee sling and a 74-type muzzle brake. Also comes with an A2 flash hider - the previous owner had the barrel threaded in 1/2x28 threading. Still has the original Chinese trigger group installed, has a very nice, crisp reset.There are a couple of minor spots where the original bluing has come off on the dust cover, but there isn't any pitting or any actual damage to the firearm. The front sight is a little canted, but I've sighted it to 100 yards and she hits straight.So aside from the rifle, package comes with some extra grips (Tapco, Zastava and standard Century), a set of Tapco handguards, some spare mounting hardware (metal stock plate, cleaning kit trapdoor and sling mount), an A2 flash hider, a bungee sling, and a steel Euro mag. (I wanna say the magazine is Polish, but I'm not 100% sure.)Asking for $750 - this thing is miles better than any WASR that you'll get for $700."

Includes give Glock 15rd 40sw magazines, Blackhawk Serpa holster and Blackhawk mag pouches. I think I have NIB Dawson fiberoptic sights for this too.

Well, while shopping online I came across a Hi-Point 916 9C 8+1 9mm pistol for the low price of $140 shipped to a local FFL. I figured hell...why not!? I could use this as a truck, boat, tool box gun, etc. So, today I stopped by Repent Arms in Concord, NC to pick up my lower and this pistol. And I will say as soon as I picked up this pistol I realized, it's just not for me. But, it can be one of yours!!! This gun has literally been out of the box/bag to hold in the store, and take these pictures when I got home. I have receipts showing I paid $140 for the gun, and the FFL transfer fee of $15 TODAY! I will sell this gun for $120. It is brand new, never shot, and has been handled for less than 60 seconds. I will not accept lower cash offers. Otherwise, I will just keep it. Also, I don't need the money. Just figured someone else could use a firearm, and get it at a decent price. But, I will possibly trade for parts for an AR15 like an upper, lower receiver set, etc. Anything to get this new build going. Text or call me at REDACTED if you're interested...Thanks, David"

The slide work and cerakote work was done by slideworks engineering in Texas. The burnt broze looks great and sets it apart from traditional black glocks, and the front slide serrations are minimal. They offer a slight reduction in weight that helps offset the weight of the rmr, and provide functionality when manipulating the firearm. It feels great in your hands with a mild stipple textured grip that is comfortable to shoot and carry. The concept of a red dot furnished pistol is something that is becoming increasingly popular, and with the quality of trijicon, the rmr is built to last. In contrast with traditional iron sights, the red dot allows the shooter to ""threat focus"" which is beneficial for fast target acquisition, and also provides substantially increased accuracy at distance. The internals are completely stock, keeping the reliability of a glock. Always well maintained, never dropped or abused. Estimated round count is roughly 500 rounds. All things included, there is well over $1300 invested in this firearm.

In 1908 Colt introduced a new medium frame revolver to replace the New Army & Navy models.The new revolver used the much better action pioneered by the Colt New Pocket and New Service models. This new model would be the basis for every medium frame double action revolver Colt produced up to the Colt Python of 1955. The design changed so little over the years that many parts from a 1908 Army Special would interchange with a Python made in 2003. The new revolver was designed to allow use of more powerful ammunition like the .38 Special and the .41 Colt.It was an immediate success with police departments and under the Official Police name would be the standard police issue service revolver up into the 1960's. The Army Special was available with blue and nickel finishes. Barrel lengths were 4"", 4 1/2"", 5"", and 6"". Calibers were .32-20, the various .38 Colt Long and Short cartridges, .38 Special, and .41 Colt. Grips were black hard rubber with molded in checkering and Colt logos until 1923 when checkered walnut with silver Colt medallions became standard. The Army Special was produced from 1908 to 1927. In 1927, since the Army had never bought it but many police departments had, Colt simply changed the name to the Official Police and continued making it until 1969 virtually unchanged."

Super fun to shoot, but I'm not a revolver guy, so onto new things. I will say it shoots unlike anything I've ever fired. Rather than kicking up and away, it recoils back into your wrist (due to the barrel being at the bottom rather than the top) thus driving the pistol into your hand - feels more like a 22 than a 357. Includes everything which came from factory including hard case, paperwork etc. Also includes speed loaders, a 2nd set of rubber grips (ordered seperately) and a custom kydex holster in FDE. A Box of Hornady American Gunner ammo is also included. Not looking for any trades at this time. $1,050.00 OBO - First decent offer takes it as I have my eye on something at a local store which I don't want to lose. I will be in Debarry for the next couple hours and will have the Rhino with me. After that I'll be back in New Smyrna Beach and won't want to travel much further than where I4 meets State Road 44."

Griffin M2 sights offer an industry first, patent pending, modular base plate system. Constructed from QPQ Treated 17-4 and ordnance grade steel, Griffin M2 Sights were designed to be the correct product for every backup sight application. A shooter can use these durable, low profile sights in a 12 o'clock mounted application while having the flexibility to reconfigure them to ambidextrous 45 degree angle sights using the alternate and available angle plates. This flexibility ensures these sights can be used by anyone and will never end up in a box of undesirable legacy kit. The full M2 deployment kit includes the front and rear sight assemblies as well as both vertical and angled bases for a complete modular system. However, sights and bases are available separately for users who wish to buy parts as needed. The front A2 sight provides elevation adjustment while ensuring maximum aftermarket support for your favorite post, be it tritium, fiber optic, match grade, or otherwise. An extremely low profile, snag resistant, slotted rear windage screw, affords easy but more importantly secure adjustability. Robust spring tension of both front and rear flip up assemblies ensures accurate repeatability every time the sight towers are actuated.Never before has a product in this category offer this degree of flexibility. Griffin M2 Sights have a minimal foot print, and are among the smallest backup sights on the market. For a mere 2 and half ounces your rifle can be equipped with a durable iron sight system, to provide aiming capability in rain, snow, or fog, on or off axis without dependence on batteries or glass."

It is in Amazing condition, with a deep blue that helped make early Colt Pythons legendary. This revolver spent the vast majority of its life in a dresser drawer. I see no handeling marks or loss of blue. The only thing I see barely worth mentioning is a slight mark on the bottom of the wooden grip that is not through the clear. This revolver locks up tight and the trigger pull and timing are superlative. I can see little to no signs of use. Hardley a ghost of a turn line.  You do not see these vintage Colts in this shape everyday. I have included pics, but due to the shiny bluing, it is hard to photograph. The last pic of the barrel roll mark appears to be chrome, but that is because the light reflecting off the brilliant bluing makes this revolver glow. I have additional pics. *****I've had a few people ask if it is a hollow lug barrel. It is. This makes it a premium example for collectors.No box. I am looking for $2,750. oboI will accept partial trades for other firearms. I like Smith and Wesson revolvers, from the 70's and newer. I like most hand guns and some rifles, so don't be afraid to ask. I would prefer a face to face transaction, but if you're viewing this from a state other than Ohio, I may consider shipping, but payment must be through US postal Money Order and we can discuss shipping cost."
