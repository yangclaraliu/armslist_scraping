Brand new Sergeant seat (more comfortable and lets you sit back instead on right on the tank), CRG bar end mirrors so you can see behind you. Adult owned and never down. Too many hobbies so time to sell. Has arrow exhaust, lowered foot pegs, etc. this bike is ready to go and needs nothing. All it needs is a new rider. Have original mirrors and seat too. I split the difference between low and high retail to come up with the price.BASIC SPECS: Power is provided by Kawasaki's compact 649cc parallel twin featuring liquid-cooling, semi-downdraft fuel injection, twin cams, four valves per cylinder, under-piston oil jets, counterbalancer, and a state of tune providing greater low-to-midrange torque than that of its Ninja 650R sibling. The steel-trellis frame is identical to the Ninja 650 and carries a 41mm inverted fork featuring 5.9-inch travel, adjustable rebound damping, and spring preload. The single offset laydown shock offers adjustable spring preload and 5.7-inch travel. Its 17-inch diameter cast-alloy wheels, sporty tires, and dual 300mm front disc brakes are clear cues to an on-road focus despite the bike's ADV-inspired styling.WHY IT'S DESIRABLE: ""Versys"" is a contraction of ""versatile system,"" says Kawasaki, and true to the company's word the parallel twin has proven itself as a solid commuter, tourer, and even sportbike. With its rev-happy engine, good suspension, and ample cornering clearance, the Versys will go just about as fast as anyone dares to go on public roads. The big appeal for many is its upright and roomy riding position and adjustable-height windscreen."

Its distinctive features enable the concealed carry of a handgun from a variety of carry positions while facilitating the acquisition of a full firing grip on the weapon prior to the draw. Inherent are adjustments in the depth of carry, angle of carry, the position of carry and security of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting points on the holster and the use of variable mounting components. Combined they maximize function respective to the users: body type, deployment tactics and personal preferences. The holster is adaptive to varying operational environments and mission requirements. The mounting clip Incorporates a negative angle designed to force the holster closer to the body. This improves the conceal-ability of the holster without increasing the bulk and supports a higher positional carry without compromise to the positional security of the holster during use. This higher position facilitates faster weapon presentations from deep cover. The mounting clips also have multiple mounting points further increasing the range of carry options and adjustments. The mounting clips open and slide down over the belt and lock in place. The clip is actuated via a finger tab, and is flexed to open allowing quick installation or removal from the belt. Holster is $30 grey fuzz on black kydex. Minimal wear from standard use (visible in pics) Contact Andrew by text (preferred) or by phone 865-6zero4-48zero5. No trades please."

This is a rare mount as described to me by the owner of AWP/Blackthorn Engineering. These mounts have been offered up for sale by companies like USO and also EuroOptics under their own name. They stopped making this mount in FDE. I added the bubble level EuroOptic is still selling for it and was 47 shipped alone. These mounts have enough room for the USO optics. Flash Hider is a Noveske Flaming PigI bought this rifle recently and understand it is quite rare; found info online that says only 400 were made in total and only 151 in this color. This is a great setup but regretfully, I'm in a situation where I need cash for a project. Please forward any questions, no trades please. I'm offering it this at a very low price of $2700 which is about what i have in it. The rifle alone is selling on GB for a minimum of $1600 in the gray color, the FDE is getting near $2K. The scope and mount can be sold separately but only after time has passed without the rifle selling.

It is a long slide, 9mm, polymer frame handgun that uses a locked breach system referred to as ""Safe Action"". This is the combination of a trigger safety, firing pin safety and drop safety that render the loaded pistol incapable of firing, even when banged or bumped, unless someone actually squeezes the trigger. Because it does not have a hammer, the spring loaded striker (firing pin) is technically blocked off, partially retracted and not in geometric alignment with a chambered cartridge. It is only by squeezing the trigger, which fully retracts and then releases the striker, that makes the pistol then capable of firing. The absence of a hammer also provides a sleeker profile that reduces both size and weight, while optimizing a smoother draw from concealment. The Glock 17L Gen3 has the advantage of not having a manual safety, thus eliminating the need to consciously think about deactivating such a device during a deadly encounter. This is the ultimate point and shoot pistol. With 50% fewer components than conventional handguns of the same caliber, it means there are fewer parts to break, and you can literally disassemble and then reassemble the gun within seconds. The frame is made out of a synthetic polymer that is actually stronger than steel, yet 86% lighter and virtually indestructible. It can withstand temperatures ranging from -40 F to +158 F and still continue firing. An integral accessory rail provides the added benefit of quickly attaching lasers and / or lights for low visibility applications. The ergonomic grip angle is designed to allow the shooter to rapidly deploy the pistol under stress fire conditions. This pistol series is referred to as ""Gen3"" and has an advantage over its Gen4 counterpart. Without a rough texture finish, the standard Gen3 Glock has a grip surface that is virtually non- abrasive. When carrying concealed, this translates to less grating on the skin of your back, hip or stomach. It is also far less likely to cling to clothing, especially lighter materials, leading to an easier and more consistent draw from concealment. Textured finger grooves still provide a solid grip, while square-shaped, raised dimples on the sides of the frame, frontstrap and backstrap provide even more security and excellent control while shooting.The Glock 17L Gen3 features an outstanding ergonomic design, where a highly efficient bore axis-to-weight distribution ratio ensures controlled shots, even under rapid fire conditions. In addition, the polymer frame also provides much softer felt recoil than most conventional metal frame handguns. This pistol weighs in at a little over 22- ounces and has a DAO trigger pull of roughly 5.5 pounds.Two full capacity 17- round magazines are provided with Glock 17L Gen3 pistols. The Factory sights have been replaced with Fire Sights that really light up so you can see the end of the LONG barrel. The 6.03"" hexagonal hammer forged barrel of the Glock 17L Gen3 increase muzzle velocity and provide greater accuracy than conventional rifled barrels.For repair, even though Glock does not officially provide anything in writing, the pistol is backed by a service commitment that has traditionally been far superior to any other company offering a so-called 'lifetime warranty""-- which is not the customer's lifetime, but what they deem to be the life of the gun. Overall, the Glock 17 Gen4 is a lightweight, ultra-reliable, high capacity handgun you can depend onThis weapon was set up for one of my customers with the ZEV Trigger set at 3.5 Lbs but is fully adjustable. I also installed a set of Fire Sights that are very bright. The controls Slide Lock, Slide Stop, Magazine Release have all been extended. The recoil spring has been replaced with a Lightning Strike so the recoil is more like a Gen 4.MSRP: $749.00ZEV   : $180.00Ext    : $  75.00Rod   : $  25.00Sight : $  85.00"

Really a beatiful little sixgun that someone decided to put a Millet red dot sope on. The gun is wearing imitation ivory grips with an eagle on one side. I think it is a bit of a weird combo but she works very well and would make a great squirrel sniper. Scope is currently adjusted for the unfluted and unjeweled magnum cylinder that also comes with the gun (zero on scope has to be reset between the 22lr and 22mag). Red dot seems to hold zero well although I havent honestly put more than a box of each ammo through this gun. It was an impulse buy and could use the cash more.All transactions will be conducted face to face at an FFL of your choice.

The 870 Express® is a rugged, value-priced workhorse, making it one of the most useful tools that an outdoorsman can own. The versatile, no-nonsense 870 Express can be used for hunting waterfowl, upland game, and deer, as well as a home defense shotgun, and informal clay pigeon shooting. At the heart of the ultra reliable 870 Remington is a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength, and twin action bars that prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action. 870 pump shotguns have great pointing characteristics. They come to the shooter's shoulder and acquire targets instinctively, and swing fluidly on fast flying birds. The Remington Model 870 Express Pump-Action Shotgun comes with an ultra durable laminated hardwood stock and fore-end, and a matte blue/black, bead-blasted finish on the receiver and barrel. The barrel has a vent rib and a bead sight, and uses standard Rem™ Choke screw-in choke tubes (comes with 1 modified tube). A durable, rubber recoil pad dampens recoil and helps shooter to stay on target for faster follow up shots. All 870 Express shotguns function with either 2-3/4"" or 3"" shotgun shells interchangeably. A myriad of aftermarket Remington 870 accessories enables owners to customize the 870 Express for specific purposes. • Receiver milled from solid billet of steel for maximum strength • Twin action bards prevent binding and twisting • Barrel has a vent rib and bead sight • Uses standard Rem Choke screw-in choke tubes (comes with 1 modified tube) • Functions with either 2-3/4"" or 3"" shotgun shells"

Ruger is proud to introduce the new Ruger LCP II. Since its original introduction in 2008, the LCP has set the industry standard for compact, reliable .380 Auto pistols. Rather than rest on that accomplishment, Ruger has built upon that solid performance to produce the new, best-in-class LCP II pistol. The LCP II features a short, crisp, single-action trigger with inner trigger safety, improved sights for superior visibility, a larger grip surface for better distribution of recoil forces and an easy-to-rack slide with an improved slide stop mechanism with a last round hold-open. With its compact size (just 5.17"" long and 3.71"" tall), this new lightweight compact pistol comes with a pocket holster and is designed to fit a variety of holsters and concealed carry options. Weighing in at just 10.6 ounces and equipped to hold 6+1 rounds of powerful .380 Auto ammunition, the LCP II is the ideal back-up gun - compact and light enough that you never have to leave it at home. The American-made LCP II is built on a rigid, one-piece, precision-machined, anodized aluminum chassis with integral frame rails and fire control housing. Additional features include rugged construction with a through-hardened alloy steel slide; a black, one-piece, high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame; a textured grip frame to provide a secure and comfortable grip; a finger grip extension floorplate that can be added to the magazine for comfort and more secure grip, and a blued, alloy steel barrel. The LCP II ships with one 6-round magazine. Note: Six-round LCP® magazines are compatible with the LCP® II, but will not activate the last round hold-open feature of the LCP® II. Seven-round LCP® magazines are NOT compatible with the LCP® II. Firearm Features  Short, crisp, single-action trigger pull.

BEHOLD! The Insight L3 / EOTech AN/PAS13C(V1) LWTS thermal weapon scope!I either own or have owned virtually every thermal scope and clip-on -- FLIR T70, Trijicon / IR Defense IR Hunter 60mm MKIII, ATN ThoR 640 5x, Armasight Zeus 640, FLIR Recon M18, you name it. Nothing comes close to the AN/PAS-13G. Period.As you can clearly see by the photos of the ACTUAL UNIT (taken by me), this particular unit is the very latest-generation of the AN/PAS-13G(V1) -- the TWB-002-A3. I've also left the Serial Number visible! ***Armslist only allows three photos. I have more that I can text upon request.***Do NOT get burned buying a STOLEN .MIL unit!I am the original owner of this unit. It was purchased new, by me, in October 2015 from a legit L3/EOTech dealer in Texas (Night Vision 2 Go, now merged with Ultimate Night Vision) and comes with ALL accessories, manuals, and the balance of the full EOTech factory 2-Year Warranty!**********It also comes with the coveted, impossible-to-find, L3 video cable! This is a $1,350.00 option that L3 rapes people for, if you can get them to sell you one!**********Well... if it's so great and all that, why am I selling it? For the simple fact that it has been sitting in my climate-controlled safe for the last 22 months. I've taken it out maybe 10 times since I got it. It's awesome, for sure, but it just doesn't get enough use to justify keeping a $14,000 military thermal weapon scope. I travel 200+ days per year for work and when I'm home I rarely have the time to enjoy my gear -- so it just... sits. ;-(NON-NEGOTIABLE TERMS OF SALE: Face-to-face is preferred, of course. You MUST be a US Citizen (!!!) with valid ID to prove it. This is an ITAR restricted item, which means ONLY US Citizens can touch it (literally, a non US citizen is prohibited, by law, from even looking through it -- believe it or not). This CANNOT be shipped or otherwise taken out of the country, so DO NOT ASK! Payment must be by cash, cashiers check (will be validated), or bank wire prior to transfer of ownership. If you want to pay by personal or business check, you're welcome to, but know that you will not take possession of the unit until your check has completely cleared.TRADE: I'm always interested in full or partial trade items. I'm looking for a tricked-out SCAR 17 (not 16), or other high-end rifles. I'm a night vision and optics nut, so if you have something that has legitimate, provable provenance, I'm all ears. I'm a dork, so other cool toys are always welcome. I'm also warming up to very high-end 1911's and *professionally* tricked-out Glocks (19/17/34). I'm also interested in a solid, fully functional farm tractor with loader and/or skidsteer.Text, email, or call. I'm traveling (as usual), so if I'm slow to respond it's because I'm probably half-way around the planet."

I shimmed the bolt to tighten the headspace.  I also upgraded the 8 screws in the scope rings to 3/32 allen head bolts, instead of the factory flat head bolts.  I reduced the trigger pull with a lighter sear spring.  The current trigger pull is in the 4 pound range.  I will include the original spring.   This rifle has the factory brown laminate stock, instead of that ugly green laminate.  It will shoot 3/4 in groups at 100 yards, if you do your part.  It seems to really like the 40gr V-Max bullets over a midrange charge of Lil'Gun powder.  Included are a set of RCBS neck dies, 95 brass(a mix of Federal, Hornady, and PPU), 95 rounds of factory ammo(35 Hornady 35gr V-Max and 60 PPU 45gr soft points), and 2 Berry's 404 ammo boxes.
There are a couple very minor scrapes on the stock and a paint scrape on the barrel.  These scrapes were there when I purchased the rifle.  I am the 3rd owner.  I can email or text more pictures upon request.
I don't have to sell this gun.  I would consider trading everything for a CZ 527 Varmint in .17 Hornet."
