My feelings on As Delivered to the Military, verses Mix-master M1 and M1 Carbines.If you want a War Relic, you want a Mix-Master. I can say with certainty, that 99% of any of these rifles that served in Combat, will be a Mix-Master. There were a very high number of these that were mixmasters when delivered to the Military to meet production requirements, and were surely made into mix-masters during group cleanings and repairs. All of theses that were returned, inspected and repaired for reuse or resale, were future disassembled and repaired.The only ones that did not go through this process, were either presentation ones, or non issued ones. Even the Non Combat ones that were used in the States for Training, were dissembled and mixed.If you are buying a War Relic, it will be a Mixmaster, or a rifle that someone destroyed the history, and Made it All ""Correct"".My feelings: I would much rather have a True War Relic, that had seen battle, went through rebuild, and had the needed improvements done to it, than a recreated All Original.Inland front sight (n)Sa amco bayonet lug trigger housing Winchester (w)Winchester push safety (ew)Underwood bolt (.u.)Inland trigger  (ri)IBM hammer (wmb)Type 4 or 5 mag catch (m)Slide 2 or 3 IBM  (aob)Trigger marked inland (RI on top )WILL NOT SHIP DON'T EVEN ASK Colt 1903M1 garandGlock 21 Walther SteyrBeretta DpmsGlock 27Glock 33"

The trigger pull is very short but positive and crisp, not mushy, and has a very short reset.)Warren Tactical Sevigny competition series sights with fiber optic front and serrated rearLWD stainless steel takedown pinsExtended slide stop leverExtended magazine releaseFrame work: finger grooves removed (no stippling under the A-grip wrap-I prefer the wrap), double undercut, stippled, and flared trigger guard, relieft cut around magazine release, very slight palm swell reduction (this serves more to make the grip feel more vertical without reducing the size of the grip-I have large hands and it fits great), wedge cut stippling on the index points, custom mixed storm grey duracoat, A-grip synthetic suede grip wrap (most people don't know what this is, but I love it and have it on all my guns. It is soft but very high traction. It works great when wet or dry, doesn't grab on clothing and feels soft when carried concealed. It also lasts literally years, but I just replaced it.)I obviously have a lot of time and money into this gun. It is a formidable competition/race setup, but it's not finicky or unreliable. It still feeds any ammo, has all stock functionality, and it's a fun pistol to shoot. It's had plenty pf rounds through it, but was always maintained well and is 100% reliabe. There a few minor cosmetic issues: Ships/scuffs in the duracoat on the bottom of the trigger guard-this happened while the coating was fresh and still soft. There is also a blemish in the coating on the left side of the slide-it's slightly discolored in a spot. Please contact me with any questions."

The slide rides inside the frame allowing for a more solid lockup and lower bore axis.Its probably seen 250-300 rnds in its lifetime. Has a little bit of finish wear on the outside of the barrel and a crack in the factory grip which has been repaired but could easily take cz-75 grips with a little fitment. The barrels on tristars/canicks are chrome lined and can handle +p rounds no problem. It has been 100% reliable not one fte or ftf the whole time. Its taken several different brands and loadings and functions flawlessly.These pistols will take cz-75 magazines and they function as they should so magazines shouldn't be a problem. I just use the mec-gar ones that they come with but tried my actual cz-75 mags in it with no problem. The mec-gar mags are pretty cheap around $20 or so. I have always had good experience with them.

I've added a strip of Talon Grip tape to the front strap, otherwise the pistol is stock. Comes with box, manuals, and lock.Ruger has discontinued this pistol, what many argue to be the best of the SR series as it forgoes the loaded chamber indicator, and has large slide serrations that are preferred over the smaller serrations of the other pistols in this series. So, now is your chance to get this pistol while you still can. Many of the online retailers have already sold out of this particular model, especially the 10 round variants. Makes a great starter pistol, but is very reliable and durable.
