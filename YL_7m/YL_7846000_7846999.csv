The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns.

This firearm was manufactured in 1888 and has been very well maintained with no signs of refinishing, and has been inspected, tested, and fires to ensure it is safe with modern .38 S&W loads. This firearm maintains roughly 95% of its finish, with some minor wear giving it a nice overall patina. Everything on this fine weapon functions as it was originally designed, to include the ejector and safety systems. This firearm has a 3 & 3/16th inch barrel that has zero pitting or damage to the rifling. This pistol has the original hard rubber grips which have a small break on one side: this is a common issue among these pistols, and replacement grips severely diminish the value. The 2nd Model of Safety Hammerless had several QC improvements over its short lived predecessor, but still had less than ten thousand units produced overall. This is a wonderful piece of history that is ready to endure another 130 years with your family.I am asking $450 OBO for this revolver, which includes roughly $100 dollars worth of ammunition thrown in as a bonus to the buyer. I am not willing to sell the ammunition separately. I am available to meet in most areas of Northern Kentucky with notice. Pistol has been kept in a climate controlled safe, and comes with a Soft Case. Call or text 859 462 9602, more pictures available upon request.Buyer must have a valid Kentucky Driver's license at the minimum, but a CCDW is preferred.

It shot much better than other shotguns I've tried and I never had any issues with it. There is zero sign of age / wear. Everything on it looks flawless. I even made sure to buy directly from Benelli because I didnt want a shotgun that had been handled by a bunch of people in a gun shop. It comes with everything you see. All 5 chokes and shims. Manuals and all other paperwork. I also saved the serial number sheet ( which matches the # on the gun ) so you can verfiy this shotgun is a newer model and still has around 5 years of being under the Benelli warranty.4+1 capacity. AA grade satin walnut stock. 49.5 inches total.   These cost around $1,700 new.
