Dated 1936 makes this gun is a 2nd issue PPS. Barrel was once 4in and has been cut down to 2in. This gun has seen a lot of use. Mechanically its sound but looks, well that's somethign else. Original finish is gone. I've cold blued it, but that is only so limited to the metal being pretty. Most of the surface area has some pitting on both sides. Replaced the grips with a pair of NOS herrets faux pearl. Timing is a little slow in SA but its very minute. I have fired this gun in both SA/DA. Barrel is missing front site and will either need to be replaced, or a substitute barrel brazed on. This is a perfect candidate for someone looking for a beater Colt to keep as is, or fix it up, refinish it, and still be under what a well used on costs these days. Only motivation for selling is I have another project I'd like to fund so I'm not in any rush. Asking $150 FTF in Howell/Brighton and FIRM on price. Its well worth it for a functional Colt, much less the parts value. Buyer must have valid Drivers License w/purchase permit, and/or CPL."

The Richards cartridge conversion was an instant success. On July 2, 1872, William Mason, another Colt employee, was awarded a patent for an improvement to the Richards model. Conversion models remained popular with cowboys (many originals will be found with imprints of fence staples on the butt) even after the introduction of the 1873 Colt®. This was due to the low cost of conversion models.SPECIFICATIONSFinish Case HardenedType RevolverAction SingleCaliber 38 SpecialBarrel Length 7.5""Capacity 6Grips WoodSights FixedWeight 2.8 lbs"

LOP can be restored on this gun for anything from $200 to $900. Price was given to me by the stock doctorIt features sideplates that act as extra canvas for the lavish hand-chased engraving, as well as a specially-selected walnut stock that gives it a true heirloom quality. But while it certainly figures well while on display, the Diamond Pigeon’s worth as a game gun is equally striking. Weighing about 7 lbs (12-ga version), and with the point of balance right at the hinge-pin, it is a shotgun that comes up naturally to the shoulder while still having enough of a lively feeling forward of the supporting hand. This is an over-under with the feel and allure of a classic, for the discriminating hunter who appreciates all the finer points of a perfectly-made gun.The full sideplates of the 687 EELL feature a super-fine classic game scene, and are enhanced by intricately detailed motifs of branches, leaves and flowers that extend to the trigger plate, trigger guard and fore-end iron lever. The proportions of the engraving blend wonderfully with the dimensions of the shotgun, giving you the sense of a work of art within a work of art. The stock is a classic semi-beavertail, with premium-quality European walnut and a newly designed fine-line checkering. An oval brass shield, inlaid on the stock, will allow you to personalize your gun with initials or a family crest, while the handsome and durable carrying case will protect the shotgun on all your hunting adventures.This shotgun will shine in any hunting situation. This is because it is built on a receiver that is equally strong and low-profile. The 687 action has two conical locking lugs at mid-height, meaning that it will always lock up strongly and positively while not requiring the extra bulk and weight for a top locking lever. This further means that when you bring it up to the shoulder, the vertical distance between your eye and your supporting hand is minimized: this shotgun will follow your sight easily and instinctively. And in spite of its beauty, the 687 action is noted for its strength, so this is a shotgun that you can confidently pass down to the next generation of hunters."

It was my grandfathers, grandfathers gun and has been in our family a very long time and possibly from new. It was well optioned from the factory being graced with nickle plating, folding hammer, full factory ""punch dot"" engraving including an intricate hunting dog scene on the left side panel, jewel color highlights, very rare ""GOLD WASH"" cylinder, and beautufully finished off with stunning factory authentic ""Mother Of Pearl"" grips. The top of the barrel rib has the MFG / city / and patent dates. The left side of the frame is marked 38 CAL. This revolver is 100% all original with all it's origial born with parts and has all the matching serial numbers present: on the main frame under the Pearl grip area, on the rear face of the cylinder, on the rear face of the barrel assembly, and stampings on the side of the hammer.  Sights are the factory pinned blade at front of barrel with notch at rear. Condition: Over-all EXCELLENT in appearance retaining it's original nickle finish which is overall bright and shiney with some normal wear for a gun manufactured this age. The case hardened finish on the exposed trigger and hammer is still present. The ""Gold Wash"" applied originally to the cylinder assembly is still clearly visible but has been worn from all the years of wiping the gun down. Given it's age, one should expect some accidental scratching and misc dings as to be expected. The double action /single action / and first position safety cock all function perfectly and the timing of the action seems perfect as well. The inside of the barrel is shiney and rifeling crisp so it appears to have had an easy life. Grips are fabulous, no cracks at all and nice Pearl coloring. There appears to never have been any corrosion on this fire arm and you would be hard pressed to find one in better condition with more options & features making this a very desireable collectable gun in fantastic shape with all the bells and whisles a true collector could wish for. 
I may consider trades for interesting firearms. I prefer pistols over rifles. Would consider a collectable motorcycle as well or ?"

I purchased it as a safe queen from a friend, and the problem is it has been doing the same thing in my collection. With two young kids, and plenty of other project guns. This one is expendable. It'd be a fun toy to build out into a sniper-style precision bolt action. Afterall, this is the same action and barrel the U.S. military uses for its sniper rifles. This gun is in excellent used condition. It'd be undistinguishable from new except for some finish wear on the bolt, which is to be expected. The rifle includes a Nightforce 20MOA scope rail/base, and I also have the original documentation for the rifle.This 700 5R is chambered in .300 Win with a 24 inch fluted 5/8-24 threaded Stainless Steel Barrel with 5-R rifling 1:10 inch twist. Rifle also features a tactical bolt knob and X-Mark trigger in a H-S Precision sand and black web color stock to match the black Cerakote factory finish to the barrel and action. This is the Gen 2 variation of the Remington 700 5R. I am selling this private treaty and am willing to meet someone to arrange pickup/sale."
