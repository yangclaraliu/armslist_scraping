This particular model comes standard with an underfolding metal stock and a synthetic pistol grip and handguard. As the M70 was designed to be able to fire rifle grenades (using blank ammunition), it needed the ability to withstand a good deal of pressure, a 1.5mm heavy reinforced stamped receiver. To replicate the look and function of the military variant grenade laucher sights are included. The rifle’s stamped-steel receiver is actually based on an RPK receiver, and being that it is thicker than the standard AK’s, it has a distinctly bulged front trunion.Please message me any questions you have and I'll try my best to answer them promptly.

I also have 14 mags for it, 4 of which are Magpul and the other 10 are original Steyr waffle mags, a mix of both 30 and 42 round mags. Let me know if you have any questions. I am a little flexible on the price, and the only trade I'd be interested in is an AK, plus appropriate cash to make up the value. Please, ask whatever questions you have. Asking $1650."

This item is on consignment as part of an estate.Quick to your shoulder and fun to shoot, the compact Browning Buck Mark Rifle is based on the popular pistol that shares its name. These lightweight rifles are easy to load and shoot for every member of the family. A Buck Mark Rifle is equally adept hunting squirrels or plinking swinging targets. The Buck Mark Rifle is still made in the USA. The Browning Buck Mark Rifle is one of the most unique rimfires ever produced. These nifty little rifles offer everything you need: dialed-in ergonomics, fast handling and modern styling. Plus, like their namesake, the Buck Mark Rifles provide outstanding accuracy, dependable blowback operation, a crisp single-action trigger pull and magazines that are interchangeable throughout the Buck Mark line. Take a Buck Mark Rifle afield, and you'll immediately appreciate the lightweight, compact design that comes to the shoulder fast and onto a target even faster. You will also appreciate these rifles on the range, where the easy to load magazine, reliability and superb accuracy makes an afternoon punching holes in paper an event that won't soon be forgotten. Machined to exacting tolerances from a solid billet of 7075-T6 aluminum. The stock structure is a part of the pistol frame, reducing weight and the number of parts. Built-in recess and raised side panels for better grip. The convenient manual slide release is easily operated with the shooting or support hand. Magazines are interchangeable with the Buck Mark Pistol. Heat treated magazine body for long-term feeding reliability and long life. Coil spring provides more consistent follower angle than typical Z-spring. 10 round capacity. The trigger is light, crisp and has far less creep before it breaks and far less overtravel after breaking than other rimfires.  Specifications and features: Browning Buck Mark Target Semi Automatic Rifle .22 Long Rifle 18"" bull barrel with matte blued finish 1:16"" twist Target crown 10 round magazine (interchangeable with Buck Mark pistol magazines) Alloy receiver with matte blued finish Integral scope rail Blowback operation Walnut stock with oil finish 15-1/8"" length of pull 7/8"" drop at comb 1-1/2"" drop at heel 33-5/8"" overall length 5 lbs 6 oz unloaded YOU CAN BUY IT HERE:http://shop.redcircletactical.com/catalog.php?search_for=REDACTED91 FOLLOW US:  FACEBOOK TWITTER GOOGLE+ YOUTUBEINSTAGRAM PINTEREST BLOGWEBSITE"

This general purpose weapon sight is like no other rifle scope on the planet. It is far and away the best moving target acquisition rifle scope system available today and is a must have for the avid shooter whether as an addition to their tactical gear or hunting gear. The P1 has Shepherd’s patented reticle range finding system designed specifically for modern rifle platforms. It also features Shepherd’s One Shot Zero Feature allowing the user to dial in the gun in a single shot. The 310-P1 Shepherd rifle scope gives shooters the fastest, one step, target range estimator and ballistic drop calculator in the world. This unique rifle scope allows even an inexperienced shooter the ability to just “Fit and Fire”. The rifle scope features Shepherd’s PVD multi-layer coated HD optics which deliver a crystal clear image through the entire field of view. The model 310-P1 has 18” range-finding circles for use on large targets including deer and military silhouettes. The circles can be adjusted up for flatter shooting rounds or down for rounds with a bit more drop. The 310-P1 rifle scope is ideal for the BMG 50 Caliber Sniper Rifle and the Browning BLR. The bullet drops match up almost perfectly for the Hornady 750 grain BMG A Max and the PMC Bronze 660 Grain FMJ Boat Tail when using the BMG 50. If you have the Browning BLR an ideal ammo would be the 7mm Remington Black Hills Gold 154 grain Hornady SST. If you want to check the fit of this reticle to your gun/round please visit our scope finder. This is definitely a must have hunting or tactical accessory for anyone using high powered flat shooting rifles. This rifle scope is extremely accurate at all distances out to 1000 yards.https://shepherdscopes.com/product/310-p1/"

It is distinguished from the 96/11 rifle by a curved buttplate and by a stock with an integral semi-pistol grip. It uses a graduated tangent sight which begins at 300 meters. The 1911 and 96/11 rifles are characterized by exceptional accuracy and were made with excellent craftsmanship.
