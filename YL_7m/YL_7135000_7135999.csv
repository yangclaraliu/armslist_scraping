It’s a commander 9mm designed around a tri-cut, angled design. The slide, frame, mainspring housing, and grips have been tri-cut for a futuristic design. These unique cuts not only add to the appearance, but they make the grip thinner. A pneumatic stippling device is used to hand stipple the front strap, mainspring housing, bottom of trigger guard, flattened trigger, and magazine release to achieve a cutting edge design. To top off this distinct model, we have added a polished barrel that shows through ports near the front of the slide. FEATURES   Finish: black nitride Forged commander size frame and 4.25"" barrel Match grade 9mm bull barrel Thinned tri-cut mainspring housing with the center flat stippled Tri-cut front strap with the center flat stippled Stippled bottom of the trigger guard Round butt mainspring housing Tri-cut slide with arrow serrations on the top of the slide Course rear cocking serrations Heinie Ledge Straight Eight Tritium rear sight Nighthawk tritium front sight Full length guide rod with bow tie plug Angled mag release with stippled top Curved Nighthawk slide stop with the bottom stippled Black tri-cut aluminum grips Semi-crowned barrel flush with bushing Flat faced Nighthawk Custom trigger with the face stippled Completely dehorned for comfortable carry New ultra hi-cut front strap   *LE only in CA*3% for card transactions"

Huge improvement over the factory sights. Comes with 2 mags, the FN cardboard box it comes in plus the FN soft case. Asking $450 FIRM for this. They sell for $550 online + shipping + FFL fees + $100 for night sights, so $500 is one hell of a price for a barely used one. Priced low to sell fast.

I really like it, but need to offload this thing for some vehcle repairs, but I'm not desperate.
