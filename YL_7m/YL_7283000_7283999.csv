61,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7283061,For Sale:  JM Browning 1919A4 Parts Kit (.308),"SE Michigan, Detroit, Michigan","$ 1,385","Listed On: Thursday, March 22, 2018",Gun,Remington                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"1919A4 parts kit! It's an Israeli build of the platfor, or perhaps an American made .308 that was shipped to Israel and then brought back as import as a parts kit.
 
I've had a few of you to ask about trade and consulted my dad about it and he's cool with it. (his kit, I wrote the sales copy because he's bad with computers) - We have an FFL dealer set up to receive shipment if any of you would like to go this route. He is looking for .308 battle rifles if any of you have an extra you'd be willing to part with in trade.
 
Right sideplate is destroyed per ATF but the rest of the parts are solid (I have a hard time imagining how anything John Moses Browning designed wouldn't be.)
 
Firing pin was still wrapped in paper when we found this kit and opened it up (it's nested in the block in the picture above). Got some belt links (not a lot but throwing them in for grins) and a service manual for it as well, but I need to dig these out of storage. In the event I can't find these I'll knock a little off the final price for the 1919 parts. Look over the picture carefully to make sure the lot has that rare part or crucial element you need to finish your replica build or make repairs to a legally owned functional weapon (if you're forunate enough to have one of these!).
Some of the surplus paint appears to have been buffed off while removing some gellied / lacquered (cosmolene-like?) substance, but the external metal is fine and the internal parts all seem to be in good shape.
 
Owing to their rarity, I don't know a great deal about belt fed weapons and I want to be honest about this up front. I'm happy to answer questions to the best of my ability and provide review material for any serious inquiries in the lot.
 
 
 
 
Shipping is available / preferred and included in the stated price. I can't find the option on Armslist to change this in the listing."

Features an easily removable (for storage/travel) 16.25"" barrel, pic rail forged into the upper, adjustable stock and Glock magazine compatibility, hard anodized finish in dark earth. The TNW is lightweight (5.5lbs) and compact - when the barrel is removed (no tools needed), the total length of the parts fit into a space of less than 19”. This gun is perfect for packing in a backpack, suitcase or even keeping as a truck gun. The gun shoots very well, recoil is mild. Approx. 50 rounds through the gun. I threw a red/green dot on the gun which works well for this application.As a bonus, I’m including a separate lower – one that is compatible with .45acp/10mm Glock 21/20 magazines to get you one step closer to swapping to those calibers. This lower is $149 on its own from TNW, so it’s a great deal with the gun. TNW Aero Survival Rifles can swap multiple calibers. With both lowers included, all you need to swap calibers is to purchase bolts and barrels. The bolt that comes with the gun is good for .40SW, 10mm and .357sig! With the 2nd lower, all you would need is to buy just the 10mm barrel from TNW and you’ve got a 10mm survival rifle! TNW is located in Forest Grove, OR and you can buy caliber swap components directly from them.Here is what you get:(1) TNW Aero Survival Rifle, in Dark Earth, .40S&W – the gun is ready to go for .40S&W, the lower is good for 9mm, .40SW and .357Sig, the bolt is good for .40, 10mm and .357Sig, the barrel is .40SW - you can buy other parts from TNW for caliber conversions(1) TNW 10/.45 Lower – New, never used (costs $149 just for this piece)(1) SGM 30-round .40SW magazine(1) Glock 22 OEM factory magazine, 15 round(1) UTG Red/Green dot sightPrice is $650 cash, firm, buyer pays the transfer/BGC at the FFL (I have one in Oregon City that only charges $20 total if interested). I can also meet in Vancouver at Tropic Pawn for a Washington buyer. Before you ask, I do not ship. Sales will be cash only and FTF at a local FFL of our mutual choosing. I'd prefer to sell, but I may be open to a limited number of trade options - I can't add cash, so your proposed trade would either need to be equal value or trade plus cash on your end. Some things I might be interested in are: .357 lever gun (such as a Rossi, stainless, octagon barrel), Ruger MKIV pistol, Tikka or Savage Model 10 in .308, Mossberg MVP in .308 - if you have something you want to offer, send me a message - I'll politely decline if it's not something I'm interested in. If we trade, we'll each pay our transfer fee.The lowers are not considered the firearm on these guns, the upper is, so this is considered only a single gun transfer, not two.Send me a message using the 'contact seller' button if you're interested. I can usually get back to you in 2-3 hours during the day, most days.Thanks for looking"

It's a very good looking rifle. Still has the ""fabrica de armes"" and crown crest. I have taken off the bluing down to bare steel, and tried to polish it up as well as I can. It has minor pitting, as most mausers do. Serial numbers all match other than the floor plate. Comes with a S&K scout mount, and an AIM Sports 3-9by40 long eye relief scope.

This item is regulated for export by the U.S. Gov't under ITAR.For an entertaining and interesting review of this red dot sight, go to the Vortex Sparc Review on the AR-15 forum.  They won't let me provide any links here.
Price is firm.  You can spend approximately $200 and get the new one, which some say is better, some do not.  First one to reply gets this listing. Price is for a local pickup. I will ship under the following conditions:  Paypal plus 3% and $5 shipping (that's $133.75 all in).  NO RETURNS!  I'm not a Vortex service facility and it has the best warranty on the planet anyways.NOTE: This red dot sight is very small.  Suitable even for pistols.  Looks big on the box but is roughly the size of an Aimpoint T1."

Unfired new in box, still has GLOCK factory copper grease intact on internals. I purchased this to use as the basis for a custom build (aftermarket barrel, custom slide milling, etc) but I never got around to it so now it is for sale. It really would be a great basis for a build and you don't really see too many of the made in the USA GLOCKS which is really a nice touch. Willing to travel a reasonable distance. Not interested in trades. Thanks for checking out my listing!"
