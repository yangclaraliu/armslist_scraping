The major feature that helps LMT's BCG's to run very fluidly under adverse conditions and also fully automatic fire is the bolt design. LMT made relief cuts on on the locking lugs so that carbon build up has a lessened affect on lock up, as well as added an extra extractor spring to help with rim pressure. Contact rails have also been re-designed to reduce the drop of the carrier in the receiver. The cam pin pathway has been slightly re-designed to lengthen the time it takes to open the bolt, reducing back pressure and blow-back into the upper receiver. This carrier is designed for 14.5"" & 16"" carbine rifles to help fix the over-gassed characteristics, especially when using a suppressor."

The 17rd mag comes with an ex-grip mag sleeve that gives you a full size grip with the compact slide like the discontinued Centurion variant. This pistol was purchased new by me less than a month ago and has had exactly 150 rounds put through it. Nothing wrong with it, I just purchased it on layaway and couldnt change my order without losing my money. I'm looking to trade for a Sig P226, P229/228, P220, P938, or a full size p320 with night sights. Doesn't have to be in brand new or perfect cosmetic condition, but not looking for something completely roached either. Would also consider a quality 1911(no Philippines ones please). If you would prefer to buy would sell at 550 firm at this time. The best way to reach me is by text to REDACTED. Have my CCL and will need to see a valid ID for my records. FTF in the Winfield/Wellington area preferred but can travel as far as Wichita for the right deal. If the listing is still up, it's still available."

But only a select few are tough enough and accurate enough to be called a SIG. The SIG516 is the natural evolution of the platform, with a host of enhancements designed to survive anything, anywhere. Built for Harsh Tactical Environments - The SIG SAUER advanced short-stroke pushrod system reduces carbon fouling, excessive heat and unburned powder in the action, ensuring reliability and function that is unmatched. A standard 5.56mm NATO Nitride chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment. Adjustable Gas Valve - An adjustable gas valve allows operators to increase the flow of gas when using lower pressure ammunition or when adverse conditions require additional energy. Reduced flow and the off-position enhance the use of suppressors. Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded 1/2×28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts. Ambidextrous Charging Handle and Controls - Whether you’re left- or right-handed, there should be no compromise in shooting performance. The SIG516 features an ambidextrous selector, bolt release, magazine release and charging handle. One of the most tested and proven weapons systems in the world achieves ultimate refinement in the SIG516 rifle. With its Nitride treated, military grade barrel and adjustable, four-position gas regulator, the piston-driven SIG516 incorporates all of the most desirable mechanical improvements. Add to these a free-floating forend, and you have the most advanced, versatile AR-based rifle available.    SKU: R516G2-16B-P    SRP: $1,888.00    CALIBER: 5.56 NATO    BARREL LENGTH: 16 in (406 mm)    MAGS INCLUDED: (1) 30rd Polymer Mag    MAG TYPE: AR-15    SIGHTS: Folding    ACTION TYPE: Semi-Auto    STOCK TYPE: Telescopic    BARREL MATERIAL: Carbon Steel    TRIGGER TYPE: MIL-SPEC    COLLAPSED/FOLDED LENGTH: 33.3 in (846 mm)    TRIGGER WEIGHT: 5.5-9.0 lb (24-40 N)    TWIST RATE: 1:7    FOREND TYPE: Alloy    GRIP TYPE: Polymer    RECEIVER FINISH: Hard Coat Anodized    OVERALL LENGTH: 36.5 in (927 mm)    OVERALL WIDTH: 36.5 in (927 mm)    HEIGHT: 7.75 in (197 mm)    THREADS: 1/2 in - 28 tpi    ACCESSORY RAIL: M1913    OPERATING SYSTEM: Gas Piston    WEIGHT: 7.4 lb (3.4 kg)"

It is FDE / Flat Earth color. Has never been used, just looking to sell it. Shoot me an iffer, thanksFrom the website: 
SIG SAUER introduces the SBX Pistol Stabilizing Brace, an update to the SB15 Pistol Stabilizing brace, a shooter's aid that is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols. The SBX features a more slim design with a thicker strap for extra stability. This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil when using an AR-style pistol. Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0” – 1.2” in diameter.
The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user."
