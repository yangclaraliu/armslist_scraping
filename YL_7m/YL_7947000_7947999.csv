Swiss 7.5x55 The Private Series were guns that the Swiss citizens could opt to buy when they had to turn them in. These were typically more well cared for and excellent shooters. Private Series K31's are marked with a ""P"" by the serial number or on the grip. This one has a ""P"" on the grip.Numbers matching, Troop tag in stock (I recall, need to check). This stock looks to be refinished, but whoever did it, did a great job. And the butt of the stock does not have the hell beat out of it like most K31's. The leather cheek rest, even though marked US, looks great on there and helps sight with the large Baraska on it.The trigger is fantasic, better than the other K31's I've shot, which is saying alot because they all have good triggers.The scope mount is a no drilling mount, so nothing was done to harm the gun. The scope is a 3x9x50 AO Baraska (or 3x12x50, dont remember) with a crosshair and a dot. Actually a clear scope. The scope mount is offset, so one can use the front sights also.Includes sling and muzzlecap. $750 FTF in the west Grand Rapids area. If you see what Private Series K-31's are going for, this is priced right as the scope, mount, rings, and cheek rest are an additional $200 by themselves. And the Private Series usually command a $200 premium over the regular K-31's. Lastly, only selling to people legally able to own a gun.Thanks."

Mainly interested in a 23, 27 or 26 but I might also be interested in a 17, 19, or 22.  My first pick would be a pre 2010 production date gen 3 but I would consider newer. Excellent to like new condition only with no permanent modifications. Not really interested in pre ban mags, holsters or tons of non functional extras like engraved slide cover plates. Let me know what model you have including the gen, the condition and all that comes with it. I will not answer vague ""Got a G27 to trade."" type replies, shouldn't have to ask for the gen or the basics. For the trade I have still basically new 2017 date SIG P225A1 9mm (225A-9-BSS-CL which is the all black/Nitron one with G10 grips and SIGLITE sights) in the original case with the manual, lock, sticker, price/warning tags and 2 8rd mags. Love SIGs and have more than a few but I just haven't touched this one yet. I would trade it for a basic Glock if you can add some cash, not being  greedy and I can be more than reasonable but you shouldn't be able to buy either one new in MA and the SIG will run a bit more. I will be using a EFA10 for mine. I can make myself free any time if you can meet local (for sure 8:00am-7:30pm tomorrow) but if not can work out a time and place. All laws will be followed.

The ammo, about 800 rounds, is also for sale.  About 200 are lead cast reloads, which I would never shoot in a rifle, but would be good to go in a pistol such as your Glock 22.  The rest is factory.  Some are hollowpoints, which are more costly.  At $.25/round, that would be $200.  We all know .40 is more than $.25/round.  The Red Lion Sight was over $120 plus the cost of install, and includes a sight adjusting tool.  I have a 100 yard range and would be more than happy to help you get this zeroed in for you.  It is currently running MO body for me at 100 yards with Winchester White.  It works good for me for the price.  There is well over $240 in mags.  The gun it self without mods is worth at least $450.  That's easily $960 for just the gun, the mods, mags, ammo, and it is all  for sale for $750.  I sold the handgun that went with this and am going 9mm on my carry handgun and truck gun carbine due to little wife and children who can't handle a .40.  I am also a Sheriff's Deputy, and we are going from .45 to 9mm.  As much as I like the .45 and .40, I just need to compromise at this point. This .40 has been a great truck gun, and the Glock model 22 is my favorite ever handgun.  Unfortunately, with jobs, wife, daughter, and young son, .45 and .40 do not fit my current needs.  I'm hoping to get back in .40 and maybe even .45 after the ABC .gov are done with their 200 billion of .40  surplus rounds.  I'd really like to go back to .45 and even better, .40 eventually.  Overall, my opinion is .40 S&W is the best round for capicty and stopping power, but my team is not built or trained like I am. I would prefer .45 for me, . 40 for as many others, and 9mm for those who else could not .  wish I could use .40 for everyone, but realize .9mm is what most of the team/family can use..."
