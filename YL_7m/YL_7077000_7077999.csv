Its name was changed to Champion Single Barrel in 1923. They were made until approximately 1978. This version had blued steel barrels, ejectors, a case hardened receiver and walnut stock.
This example appears to have a 28"" barrel; finish about 50%, some surface rust but nothing major, it would probably clean up with steel wool and oil and with some touchup bluing may appear good as new.  Some scratches on front of barrel also, but no rust in that area.  Wood is ready for a refinish.  Plastic Iver Johnson buttpad.  Hammer is stiff, the whole gun could use a stripdown, scrub, and full lube job, but I’m confident it’ll shoot like the day it was new with some oil.  If you've ever handled and shot single shot break open shotguns like this, they just have a wonderful balance and pointability and are perfect for squirrel and bird hunting.  I also have a couple boxes of vintage 28 gauge shotshells, it looks like 2 boxes of #6 shot and a third box of #4 shot that may only be partially full.

At 25 yards nothing was more than 3"" off and most were on or very close to point of aim. The original grips are on it but they were so fat I couldn't shoot it very well, . I slimmed them down to fit my medium size hands and now it points more naturally and I can fire it faster than a semi auto. Also comes with rubber grips that feel ok but have gaps.

In my experience this is the most accurate ammunition for the rifle but it also shoots Hornady GMX and A-MAX very accurately. Even with the 20 MOA the rifle can be sighted in down to 100 yards if you want to use the rifle for deer hunting. The SWFA scope has the M-RAD reticle which allows you to know your yardage as long as you know the target size and will also easily allow you to sight in at any distance.
