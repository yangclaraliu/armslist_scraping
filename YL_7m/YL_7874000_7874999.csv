Willing to negotiate on price for a motivated buyer. Intended for ISPC, Wa1500, bullseye and other centrefire competitive shooting, the X-Five is hand-fitted and assembled in Germany, and its resulting accuracy accordingly rivals the P210"

It comes with a flush fit 6 round mag and an extended 8 round mag. It comes with all original paperwork and a nice Talon brand leather IWB holster which works great for appendix carry. It also sells with the original Bulldog/Taurus Belt Clip holder - it's kind of like a large cell phone holster - which I never used for anything other than holding the paperwork and laser adjustment tools.I have shot maybe 1000 rounds through it. Enough that it is nice and broken in. It has no issues with cheap ammo and feeds well from both magazines. I've owned and carried it for the last 5 years, but now I'm selling it to fund another purchase. This is with the higher end factory installed Crimson Trace laser, not the cheapo ""Aimsot"" one you see advertised. The laser works flawlessly. It activates by pressure from your middle finger whenever you firmly grip the pistol and turns off when you loosen your middle finger. It is very intuitive and the sights both line up with point of impact. Slide locks back and slide release can be operated with your thumb. Magazines drop free on ejection.I can't find this model for sale anywhere anymore, but you can typically get the gun for ~$200-250 (with only one 6 rd mag), the laser grip for $180-$200 and the Holster for $50, so this is about a  $430-500 value for $300.I am more than happy to ship it to your FFL, but we'd have to work out the details over the phone."

This gun ships with a bunch of spare parts and is fresh from being overhauled at HK USA. I am selling it because I'm getting away from shooting 45's but this is a great pistol. I sent it in on a warranty claim which turned out to be magazine related, but the HK armorers completely overhauled the pistol for me anyways. It has two brand new 12 round mags, a fresh extractor, extractor spring, firing pin spring, recoil spring set (a giant PITA to change on your own), barrel o-Ring, and an updated to latest spec DA/SA match trigger tuned to 2.5 lbs and basically zero overtravel in the single stage.This gun is hard to find holsters for, but it comes with a Serpa retention paddle holster for HK USP's. This holster works for it, but takes practice to draw without catching the extra tall front sight.It comes with the Factory Soft Case (which is hard to find).For extras and spare parts it comes with:All the original paperwork including the warranty card, test-fire cartridge, and small toolsSpare hammer (new), spare extractor (used)Wolff extra power recoil spring, spare factory recoil spring, spare firing pin spring, spare guide rod snap rings3 spare barrel orings spare magazine partsA box of Remington Golden Saber +P JHP's with 22 rounds left.I am more than happy to ship it to your FFL, but we'd have to work out the details over the phone."

I have extensively upgraded it since I purchased it in its stock configuration. The rifle stock has been upgraded to a Hogue OverMolded stock. This stock has a fiberglass skeleton with a permanently bonded nylon coating. I also upgraded the barrel from its stock set up. I have personally installed a heavy bull barrel with fluting. I upgraded the standard charging handle to an oversized tactical charging handle. I also installed an auto bolt hold open upgrade. Included in the price of this custom rifle are two accessories; a tactical rifle case and the original factory stock for the Ruger 10/22. Lastly I installed a tactical solutions mil-spec rail on top of the reciever. This custom rifle is incredibly accurate and a dream to shoot. The upgrades have made a night and day difference from its factory set up. I have kept this rifle in great condition in my safe. If you are interested in purchasing this custom rifle, please send me an email. I have many more high definition photos of the rifle. I was limited by the armslist server to the one displayed here. Of course, included with the rifle are its magazine, and owners manual. The buyer is responsible for all shipping and transfer fees.Thank you for your time and consideration.

I haven't shot it in at least five years because I purchsed a Blackhawk and it has become my favorite now. It's a Hawes Texas Marshall manufactured in Germany by J P Sauer and Sons. I listed Sig-Sauer as there is no J P Sauer in the listing options. It's really a high quality gun and I love it but, it just sits in a case and never gets shot anymore. It's Nickel and not stainless but it's a beauty. Everytime I took this out, folks always stared at it and wanted one. Price is firm. No trades please. The last time I listed something, some kid annoyed me with at least 10 emails for trading."
