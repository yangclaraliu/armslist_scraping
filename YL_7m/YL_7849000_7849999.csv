This one is the ""Type III"" with the marking of ""REMINGTON ARMS -- UMC CO, ILLION, NY"" on the barrel rib. Manufacturing dates for this model were 1912-1935. This is one really neat Derringer which appears to be fully functional! The firing pin is cool as each time you cock the hammer, the firing pin moves up or down to the next barrel. The trigger pull is smooth and the hammer drops with authority. I see no reason why it can't be fired and enjoyed at the range or for self defense conceal carry - if you use the appropriate ammo in this baby. There is a shell ejector on the left side of the barrel and it works smoothly with no sticking. Then plastic grips are in great shape with no cracks. As you can see in the pics, there is bluing loss, but no rust on the barrel at all. There is a slight hint of surface rust on the underside of the frame as shown when you lift the barrel into the loading position. The bores are clean with good rifling.REDACTED call or textCASH ONLY AND LOCAL BUYER ONLY.  NO SHIPPINGNO PAYPALTRADES CONSIDERED only if you are willing to accept dealer trade in value."

Only interested in barrel lengths of 18.5,20, or 22"". The more ""tactical,"" the better, but not a deal breaker if it's not a ""tactical"" shotgun. Looking to spend $250 max, but might go a little higher depending on what you have.  Have a valid Vermont drivers license and have no issue signing a bill of sale. Will travel within reason for a deal. I will be attending the Barre gun show that's on the first weekend of February, so seeing what's available before that.

Ammo is new, unused, manufactured by Tula in Russia, in original boxes packed 20 per box, 5 boxes total. This ammunition features a coated steel case, non-corrosive Berdan primers for reliable firing, and a magnetic FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) bullet with lead core. TulAmmo's .223 Remington ammunition is an incredibly affordable choice for high volume sport shooting and range training through bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles and carbines. The phosphate polymer coated steel cartridge cycles smoothly and keeps its qualities under various climatic and weather conditions independent of the season and at a temperature from -20C to +50C (-4F to +122F). TulAmmo converted from a bi-metal jacketed round to a zinc-coated round, which provides up to 10-15% better shooting accuracy. Zinc coating is a chemical method of surface treatment (galvanizing) which gives the bullet jacket a more uniform and consistent protective layer than that of machine-stamped bi-metal bullet jackets.

Lol. In all seriousness, and with slightly better grammar, sellers who list their guns too high eventually learn that no reply request means they’re doing something wrong. Their (not “there”) prices always come down or they just don’t sell. They eventually realize that guns lose (not “loose”) their value as soon as they leave the store. Even if they’ve “never been fired”.  And of course there are those who price their guns a little high and eventually settle for a price closer to what they actually wanted."

I sighted it in with a 50/200 yard zero.  I shoot this out to 200 yards regularly and it shoots like an absolute dream, the FN barrels are great.  I have too many ARs and have decided to start clearing out some safe space, so this is going up for sale to make room for a LaRue that's on the way.  Asking $600 for the package. Scope, mount, bipod and sling included as seen in the picture. Rediculously low but I don't care to make money on this, just see that it goes to someone who will actually shoot it and free up the space for me.  Text me at REDACTED if interested.  Thanks!"

Made in the U.S. of A., of course.  Bought this a few years ago. I've never fired from it. I loaded the rounds you see in the photo, but I've never actually squeezed the trigger while the mag is installed. The previous owner used it once or twice. But he left his SCAR heavy several states away from his oil field job in North Dakota. So I'm sure this did not see the range more than twice. I am happy to ship this wherever it is LEGAL to do so. I have more photos. Let me know if you want them.  $399 or best offer, but I'll do my best to beat any advertised price. Just send me the link.  Nein too 0 ate 7 ate tree floor ate sevin."

$1,800 firm in cash is the price, not interested in taking less at this time, so lower offers will be ignored.  At the places that actually have this model in stock they are $1,800 and come with the std. trigger and no sights.  No hurry to sell this one.Looking for cash, but will consider only really good trade or trade + cash offers as I will likely list anything I get in trade right now for cash to help grow a business.  If you know your offer is not a good one, no need to offer it, sorry just want to save us both some time.  On trades, just let me know what you have and EXACTLY what the deal is up front and I'll get back to you either way.  No reason to go back and forth only to find out the deal doesn't make sense.  The only firearms I would not mind having right now are the the Chiappa Pak-9 + $1,500 cash or the Kriss G2 10mm pistol, prefer with folding brace, so let me know which one you have.Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX and have valid ID.Thanks for looking!"

American Spirit Arms is a reputable AR manufacturing company based in Scottsdale Arizona. In the 5-6 years that I have had this rifle, it has been shot very little, but an adjustable Magpul stock and forend were added along with a Milspec buffer tube. This is one of ASA's earlier 9mm AR's and was manufactured using 556/223 lower and installing a magazine block to accept the 9mm uzi or colt style mags and the upper is a dedicated 9mm of course. One of the great things with this rifle is you can remove the block and put a 556/233 upper and have some variability. Great rifle that is fun to shoot, but I have some other projects that I could use funds from this piece. Three mag and sling are included. I work as a University Police Officer on 3rd shift, but you may contact me via text or call at REDACTED. You may also send an email via REDACTED. Due to my work schedule, I may not answer until afternoon or evening hours, but I responded as soon as possible.
