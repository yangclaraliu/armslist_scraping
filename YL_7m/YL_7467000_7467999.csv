(44-40) caliber. This rifle, serial #95839 is one of the first 3rd Model's made, being manufactured in 1882. The gun letters 100% correct with the Winchester factory ledgers housed at the Cody Firearms Museum. 1st Model 1873's were made to around 30,000 serial number range, 2nd Model's were from 30,000 to 90,000, and 3rd Model's from 90,000 to the end of production (720,610). This rifle has some of the early 1st and 2nd Model features, such as the early rear sight and a heavier #2 round barrel. One of every six 1873's made had a round barrel (octagon being standard). As for condition the receiver retains around 80% of its original bright blue finish with very light spotting in areas. The bluing looking much better in person as the camera lightens up the look of the finish some. The original 24"", #2 heavy barrel and full magazine also retain around 80% of their original bluing. The original walnut stocks are in excellent condition, retaining most of their original finish, with minimal light handling marks. The wood to metal fit is tight and proud. The action is tight and smooth, mechanically like new. The hammer and lever springs are strong as new. The dustcover remains tight to the rail and slides flawlessly when cycled. The dustcover rail still retains much of its original bluing. The bore is in MINTY condition, showing a mirror shine with sharp rifling. I would rate it at 90%. The screws are excellent and many remain unturned. The dustcover screws is a little buggered. The hammer and lever retain faded case colors. The sights are original and in excellent condition. The brass carrier retains sharp edges showing minimal use. In all this is a very good example of an all original, unmolested and higher condition early 1873. I have provided over 90 photos and offer a 3 day inspection period so you can bid with confidence."

This non-serialized model made between 1955-1958 was preferred by hunters over pump action guns for their power, accuracy, and reliability. The bolt action is considered safer for the pressures and is very accurate. Mossberg no longer makes a bolt action rifle and this one usually sells in the  $400 range. Gun is clean and has been taken care of. No mechanical issues. I have used it and it does show normal blueing wear around the bolt handle. It  kicks like a mule but I'm including a slip on recoil pad. Also including 3 boxes of ammo. Price is fair especially with the ammo and pad included, and the mag is usually missing when these come up for sale."

I purchased it brand new and have shot 260 rounds through it (13, 20 round mags). The gun is in excellent condition and has straight sights that are not canted at all. Bolt, trunions, etc are all in excellent shape as well. I can routinely hit chest-sized steel at 200 yards using nothing more than Wolf 123 gr FMJ, so the sights and gun are just fine. I picked through several WASRs at the time of purchase to find the best one. I added a Magpul stock and foregrip set (FDE in color) and an AK74 muzzle brake. The gun also comes with 2, 20 round PMAGs (only mags I’ve used in the gun) and 3, 30 round PMAGs (new, unopened). Price: $650 for gun and 5 mags, and I will throw in 100 rounds of ammo as wellI live and work in Huntsville in the Research Park/Gate 9 area, therefore I prefer to meet at Cabelas for any sale. Buyer must have a valid AL drivers license and either 1) have a valid AL concealed carry permit or 2) sign a bill of sale. My only reason for selling is caliber consolidation and I just don’t shoot the AK as much as I thought I would. Thank you for looking and let me know if you’re interested. I am not interested in trades. -Mike"

These LMTs are incredible firearms...im just in Dental School and this guy needs a good home where it will be shot on the regular haha. The Gun is sitting on the shelf at Pistol Parlour in Mesa and if you bring in cash they wont charge you tax for this rifle in particular (just need to do a background check). If you want the Trijicon Accupoint and american defense mount in the picture (dual illuminated 1-6x24) then just add 900 to the price of the gun (2100.00) The optic is also for sale by itself (900.00) and is also down at the Pistol Parlour. This is a steal if you know what these guys usually go for. The tangodown grip, magpul pro offset sights, or the bipod are not included even though they are shown in one of the pictures. But it does come with the LMT fixed sights show in the one picture. Text REDACTED if you have questionsLogan"
