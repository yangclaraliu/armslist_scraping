It is great for seasoned shooters, and especially new shooters that can be confused with safeties, mag releases, slide locks, slide releases, decockers, etc. Nothing here to confuse a new shooter, just pick it up and squeeze the trigger!  Comes with the factory box and lock. Person to person sale, face to face only, no shipping, must meet in ozark. open to trades, just ask. No hi-points, jennings, cobras, single shot shotguns, etc please.
