I've put less than 500 rounds through it and have cleaned+lubed it after every range day, leaving it in excellent condition. While you might be able to find this rifle for a comparable price online, this AK is different in the fact that it has a Matte Black Duracoat job which, in my opinion, makes the rifle look much cleaner than the standard AK. It also has a polished bolt carrier, NEW UPGRADED wood furniture, and an AR-style muzzle comp/flash hider. These upgrades alone will run you much higher than what I'm asking.As far as the quality of the rifle is concerned, it's quite excellent. The sights are aligned perfectly, the rivets are straight, and it has been extremely reliable. It comes with a steel mag (which is duracoated in the same matte black color as the rifle), TWO 30-rd pmags, a trigger group retaining plate (that I've yet to upgrade), AND a hard-shell case for the rifle. I'm asking $700 for the rifle, which, in my opinion, is a fair price considering the work and money that I've put in the rifle. I'm not looking for trades (unless you somehow have a walther ppk) and, for now, the price is firm. If you want to see more pics or are interested in purchasing it, shoot me a text at REDACTED."

To celebrate this classic design and give its devoted audience something truly special, we decided to spice it up with a unique, one-of-a-kind Sprint Run edition. This elite expression of the Caly 3 proudly showcases a three-layer laminated blade featuring a high-performance HAP40 tool steel core and SUS410 stainless steel outer layers. HAP40 is a high-speed tool steel produced by the powder metallurgy process. Containing generous amounts of tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, and cobalt, it possesses exceptional toughness and high abrasion resistance—key qualities of a superior blade steel. To provide increased strength and corrosion resistance, the high-performance HAP40 core of this knife’s blade is flanked by layers of SUS410 martensitic stainless steel. This unique three-layer construction is evident when the full-flat-ground blade is examined closely, as the transition between the core and outer layers is visible just above the cutting edge. Like the standard version of the Caly 3, this Sprint Run features a handle constructed with full stainless steel liners, a stainless backspacer, a sturdy back lock mechanism, and a reversible deep-pocket wire clip for ambidextrous tip-up carry. However, to further differentiate it from other versions, this elite Caly 3 Sprint Run features textured green G-10 scales.

Accepts Savage 10 round and 4 round magazines. 24"" threaded AND fluted barrel. This is a heavy barrel model. Suppressor ready. Has the Savage adjustable Accutrigger and aluminum bedded Accustock. Price for this as new was $750. Comes with 1 ten round mag. Also comes with a 20 MOA base from EGW (Evolution Gun Works), which was $40 new. Also includes 34mm scope rings from Burris (painted desert tan), which were about $100 new (for two). Also includes a cheek pad which was $20 new. Just add your favorite scope and you are good to go. Has two strap studs in the front and one in the rear. This has had about 300 rounds through it. It is a *very* accurate rifle (0.5-0.75 MOA). Good for long distance or bench shoot competitions. It is a bit heavy to carry for hunting. There is minor wear on the bolt side but not much (just cosmetic). Email me if you have questions. Unfortunately this must go through a FFL (at my expense) as I am an out of state resident only living in NV temporarily. I am mainly interested in cash, or I can also accept equivalent value in Bitcoin or (identifiable) silver bullion. Price is OBO. The only thing I might consider trading for is a Ruger American model# 8305 (has to be this specific model #) plus some cash to make up the price difference (these sell for $300 new). Thanks for looking. I can email additional photos. For some reason Armslist is only letting me upload one photo."
