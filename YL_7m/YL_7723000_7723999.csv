Great size, easily concealable, complete with box, papers, test cartridge and two factory magazines. This cool pink small frame Walther is an ideal for your wife or daughter, encouraging them to take part and enjoy shooting. It also makes a great statement by a guy at the range openly showing his support for breast cancer awareness. This pistol was bought new by me with the intent of encouraging my wife and daughters to enjoy the range with me. Bingo! It worked! They've long graduated to Glocks and Sigs. Owning several .22 pistols, this one fully complete is now available. I am unsure of how many pale pink ones Walther produced, regardless in my humble opinion, this makes a great entry level collectible pistol. Walther has stopped production and with the P22 now retired, this is your chance to grab one up. CONDITION: Outstanding, comes with everything that it did when I purchased this new nine years ago. Pistol has been fired somewhere between 160 to 200 times since its factory test fire for the sake of basic training of my daughter. Since then, it just sits in the safe so its time for a new home. **No low ball offers, I don’t need to sell, just looking to change up my collection a bit. PLEASE also see my other listings** I am open to trades of many quality guns. In addition to guns, I will consider other quality trade items such as solid silver and gold jewelry and coins; high-end wristwatches like Rolex, Jaeger LeCoultre, IWC, Vacheron Constantin and watches of similar quality. NOTE: I’m not a pawn shop and have more stuff than I need. That said, I'm a bit choosy despite my willingness to trade.  I prefer face to face cash transactions, in order to do this you must be a Missouri resident with a valid ID, and be willing to sign a bill of sale that states you’re   of legal age and lawfully able to acquire, and possess a firearm. CCW holders preferred but not required. NOTE: I am not an FFL dealer, authorized transfer agent, nor law enforcement. Buyers who are not Missouri residents MUST use an ""Authorized FFL Transfer Agent."" ALL out of state transactions must be completed and done by an authorized FFL transfer agent. If you don’t know or have one, call and ask for a referral from your state’s highway patrol office or ask a reputable gun dealer in your area, they generally are able to serve as a transfer agent on your behalf. Note: the costs associated with this service and the shipping are yours.**If you are reading this, the gun is still available. Serious inquiries only.**"

The rifle is a bolt action Winchester Model 70 originally chambered in 30-06.  The M70 was manufactured in 1970.  After buying it I mirror polished the bolt and refinished the stock (did a nice bright and shiny super grade type finish on it that looks really amazing).  I then subsequently discover the original standard profile 30-06 barrel attached to the Model 70 action had been previously damaged by a stuck round.  As you cannot return a gun you have started to modify it became a project gun. 
I purchased (2)x Winchester Model 70 donor barrels for the project (a 30-06 classic feather weight barrel and a .222 Remington barrel) to replace the damage barrel.  The bad 30-06 barrel has been removed.  The Winchester Model 70 30-06 featherweight donor barrel has been installed in its place however the head spacing has not been tested since the barrel was swapped and I believe the barrel is going to need to be turned to properly mate with the action.  (Head spacing must be verified before it would be safe to shoot.) 
The rifle has been fully disassembled, cleaned, and all necessary replacement parts have been purchased, and reassembled.   I will include all the original parts and the replacement parts as part of the project package.  (See Photos).  Please email with any questions.Buyer / Trade Partner Requirement: Anyone I conduct a transaction with must have valid Florida Driver's license / ID.  I will not sell to anyone under 21.  I prefer working individuals that are CWP holders.  Individuals I work with must be willing to fillout paperwork and sign a bill of sale. I vet everyone I sell to or trade with so do not contact me if you are a felon.  I will check criminal history and if you have a record it will come out so do not bother trying to lie your way through a transaction. I guarantee trying to circumvent any of these requirements will cause the transaction to fail and ultimately waste everyone's time.  If you are looking for a backroom undocumented or non-registered sale you will want to find someone else to work with."
