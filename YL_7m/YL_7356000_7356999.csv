The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Rogers Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. The stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test.MADE IN THE USA"

I'd really prefer to sell or trade them as a package. They both run flawlessly. If you like, I am fine meeting you at the range so you can experience for yourself just how well they shoot. Barrels are in perfect shape. The AK has Russian furniture but I have the original as well. Comes with 4 mags. Beautiful gun as well. Will probably shoot forever. Norinco made ak's are among the best ever made. Much better than Russian or American made ak's. The Glock 17 was upgraded by the previous owner. Zev trigger, stainless match barrel, mag well and striker upgrade. Upgraded mag plates. Very nice looking gun. Comes with four 17 round mags and two 30 round magazines. The 30 rounders are about 50 bucks a piece. If if you have something to trade that is worth more, then I'm happy to make up the difference with cash. Okay why am I selling/trading them? Well, I just don't shoot  either of them and I'd like to get my hands on something I would get more enjoyment out of. It's just a shame to have them sitting in the safe. So, prices. Right? 750 for the ak/mak90 and 600 for the Glock. UNLESS YOU BUY THEM BOTH....then I will accept 1200. Which is a bad ass deal so please don't insult me with a lower offer than that. Again if you have something more valuable to trade, I will make up the difference with cash. Would like a desert eagle in 50AE, Sig 226-X5, A Zenith MP5-RS, Wilson Combat Beretta 92G, CMMG mutant or anvil.

""The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11 SLW is one of the lightest, fastest-handling rifles available in the DDM4 line-up.  Built around a Cold Hammer Forged, 14.5” Lightweight profile barrel, the V11 SLW has an Extended Flash Suppressor which is pinned and welded to reach the NFA required 16” minimum barrel length.  The Mid-length gas system provides smooth and reliable cycling under any conditions and reduces both perceived recoil and wear on moving parts.  A free-floating SLiM Rail 12.0 handguard offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  With the KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock and an uninterrupted 1913 Picatinny rail on top, the V11SLW has plenty of room for the sights, optics, and accessories the operator may require.  The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip."""

The High Tower Armory 90/22 is a compact, maneuverable stock kit for the Ruger® 10/22® which utilizes a fully ambidextrous bullpup design for superior balance and ergonomics. This incredibly durable, military grade polymer stock will reduce the overall length of most 10/22’s to about 26 1/2 inches, just over the federally required minimum length for rifles. The HTA 90/22 also features a CNC machined monolithic aluminum Picatinny optics rail and aluminum bedding block, as well as an ambidextrous steel charging handle which cycles the factory 10/22 bolt from forward positions. The HTA 90/22 trigger linkage is made of Melonite treated steel for the most consistent and efficient transfer of energy, having a resistance to flex three times greater than aluminum by weight. A safety extension is included to allow the original factory safety to be activated, in addition to a safety selector located near the trigger. Also included is both an extended magazine and automatic bolt release which replace the factory releases and allow for much faster manipulation of your rifle's controls. Additionally, a shell deflector can be attached to the stock making it safe and comfortable to shoot left handed. This kit comes complete with a removable dummy suppressor, two side mounted Picatinny rails, and a detachable ammunition storage box for holding spare rounds in the field. Accepts factory 10 round magazines as well as most aftermarket high capacity magazines. Fits factory 18 1/2"" and .920"" bull barrels at least 18 inches in length (17 1/4 inches from receiver face to muzzle). Made in the USA."
