i'm looking to get around a $1000 for her but i'm totally open to offers since i bought it a few years ago for a good bit more & its rarely been used so has a low round count so i'm honestly not sure of it's current price with all the mods, extra's, & enhancements & everything that's been done to it. I'm also open to possible trades with cash depending on the firearm.
 
If your interested feel free to give me a call or text my number is REDACTED. I have a CCW & would be doing a bill of sale so hopefully thats not a problem. Others with CCW's, Active Military with ID or anything else that proves your legally allowed to purchase a firearm will be needed.
i don't normally sell any of my firearms but hard times right now so i want to do it as safely as possible for both me the seller and you the buyer.

This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user. An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. This model has HK's enhanced double action only ""Law Enforcement Modification (LEM)."" For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a ""light strike V1"" setup - requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger. It is supplied with two 10-round magazines."

These handguns are part of the Axelson Tactical tribute store which contains gear made in the memory of Matt Axelson who selflessly sacrificed during Operation Red Wings. The Glock 19 really is an ideal sized handgun for concealed carry that can easily reach out beyond 50 yards in trained hands. Axe 19 Custom Handgun Package Machined Custom Front Serrations Press Check Point Front Slide Bevel for quick re-holstering This adds a nice touch to the slide. Ghost 3.5 Trigger 1911 Style Grip Reduction - you can achieve a higher grip on this gun due to the fact that they removed some material from the rear of the trigger guard. They have also stippled along the bottom of the trigger guard as a reference point for your grip. The attention to detail is apparent when you look at the grip. The one side of the gun grip has the Axelson Tactical logo in the center of the stippling. There is also stippling for the support hand thumb to rest on. Extra Cocking Serrations on rear and top of slide - These additional cocking serrations at the top of the slide assist with pulling the slide back for field stripping the gun or press checking. Trijicon HD Sights - The sights used are what you would expect from Trijicon. These HD sights really stand out in low light, especially the front sight. Battle Distressed Cerakote - The AXE 19 has a similar battle distressed look on the slide as the AXE 17. This adds a really unique look to the gun. It also encompasses the battle hardened look that many of our American Patriots display when they are down range bringing the fight to our enemies. THIS IS A USED ITEM BUT IN AMAZING CONDITION!

TASER-brand stun guns are designed to use propelled wires or direct contact to conduct energy to affect the sensory and/or motor functions of the nervous system. The Pulse uses a replaceable cartridge containing compressed nitrogen to deploy two small probes that are attached to the Pulse cartridge by insulated conductive wires with a maximum length of 15 feet (4.6 meters). The Pulse transmits electrical pulses along the wires and into the body, which if used successfully will affect the sensory and motor functions of the peripheral nervous system to immobilize the body.   TASER technology is designed to use electrical pulses similar to those in your body’s nervous system to cause stimulation that affects the sensory and motor nerves. Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI) occurs when a CEW is able to cause involuntary stimulation of both the sensory nerves and the motor nerves to render an attacker temporarily unable to control movement. It is not dependent on pain and can be effective on subjects with a high level of pain tolerance. Previous generations of generic stun guns could primarily affect the sensory nerves only, resulting in pain compliance. An attacker with a very high tolerance to pain (e.g., a drug abuser, person in serious psychological distress, or a trained, focused fighter) may not be affected by the pain or might be able to fight through the pain of a traditional stun gun. A CEW may cause NMI if probes are within sufficient proximity to complete a circuit, the probes have a sufficient spread, and an adequate circuit is completed and maintained.     The TASER Pulse has an estimated useful life of five years.     Includes:  TASER Pulse Replaceable lithium battery 2 live cartridges Conductive target Protective soft cover Quick start guide      Technical Information  Battery: Replaceable lithium battery pack Delivery Method: Probes Length: 5.25"" Height: 4.75"" Width: 1.25"" Weight: 0.5lbs (227g)"

This gun is to aid shooters in hitting quick flying, multiple targets, the A400 semi-automatic shotgun uses Beretta's Blink operating system that cycles super fast—capable of shooting 4 shots in less than 1 second. The A400's action features a rotating bolt, and a self-cleaning piston to ensure the shotgun operates in all conditions and is low in maintenance. This A400 Xcel Sporting features 2 advanced recoil reduction systems that reduce shooter fatigue, allowing one to stay on target all day. The spring-loaded shock absorbers in the stock, and a Micro Core buttpad reduce felt recoil by as much as 70%. The Micro Core buttpad is constructed of an advanced polymer that allows the gun to shoulder smoothly without catching or snagging as some types of rubber buttpads do. This Beretta A400 stock allows you to customize drop and cast by means of shims, so the shotgun fits right, points instinctively, and swings fluidly on fast moving targets. A unique Gun Pod digital read-out system is located on the pistol grip cap provides a digital readout of the ambient air temperature, the recoil of the last round fired, and the number of shells fired. At the end of the magazine tube a balance cap allows the use of 3 differently weighted caps to fine-tune the gun's balance. To aid in producing consistently uniform shot patterns, Beretta uses their Steelium for the barrel, a nickel-chromium-molybdenum steel. Chrome-plated bores guard against corrosion and make cleaning much easier. An elongated forcing cone, and Optima-Bore HP interchangeable, screw-in chokes enhance uniform patterns and allow shooter to use both lead and steel shot. The A400 Xcel's receiver is a bright blue aluminum alloy, designating it as a sporting model. The Beretta A400 Xcel Sporting is a highly advanced competition Semi-Auto Shotgun that cycles fast, shoots softly, and balances superbly. This is a must see to believe gun being sold at a firm price of $1,300. Contact me for a showing"

I got this one new and have put about 10 rounds through the 3"" 45LC/410 barrel and the .45 ACP barrel is new and never been shot out of (except maybe test firing at factory).  The gun has some very light scratches / rub marks in the finish, it looks MUCH worse in the pictures...in person you can barely see them and they can probably be buffed out if you wish.   Included is the original box/paperwork as well as a Bond Arms brand pocket holster.    I'll also throw in the two ammo strips, but note there is NO AMMO included.  Asking $550.00 trade value or best offer cash for the whole deal, I will separate the .45 ACP barrel if you don't want it.  I'm also interested in trades and would rather trade in all honesty.  Of particular interest in trades would be a Taurus Public Defender, Double Tap Defense Double tap pistol, a nice coach gun, an entry level AR, .22 pistols, revolvers, etc.   Again, I love all things that go 'bang' so shoot me what you may have.I prefer you come to me for the deal.  I'm located in Sugar Land during the work day M-F near 59 and Dairy Ashford and evenings and weekends I'm on 99 Grand Parkway in Richmond near 99 and Bellaire (close to 99 and Westpark).   Please message for more details or if you'd like to see additional pictures.   Thanks!"

Rifle was one of the very few first DDI UF made with milled Bulgarian kits directly after buying out Waffen Works. The entire rifle is Bulgarian except the Green River chrome lined barrel, tapco G2 trigger kit, Krebs custom handguard. This is one of the slickest finishes I’ve ever seen on an AK rifle.   The quality and durability of the milled receiver helps add to the smooth as glass action. The dust cover fits like a glove. Actually had to take a few thousandths off just to be able to remove it by hand. This rifle came stock with a dark wooden handguard and true Bakelite grip. I’d take $100 less if you’d prefer the wood over the Krebs handguard. Another detail this rifle has is the lower set folding stock which in my opinion is more authentic to the original Russian style than newer models. I’m putting it out here to see if any other offers or trades grab my attention. I’d take $1000 cash or 1100 trade value. Lowball offers will be ignored.  I can send more pics if you’d like.

This would be an excellent rifle for a young hunter, or really anyone who enjoys a compact, quick-handling bolt gun. It's like an old lever-action .30-30 but much easier to load.This rifle is used and has some signs of wear, but is mechanically in excellent condition. There are a few scratches and dings on the stock (pictured above), mostly from the rifle having been in the back of an over-crowded safe. The gun shoots really well and will group 1-inch at 100 yards from a bench rest using Hornady ammo.Three CZ factory 5-round magazines are included with the rifle.The Leupold VX-III 1.5-5x20 scope is mounted to the rifle with Warne quick-detach rings. It's already zeroed, so all you have to do is go out and shoot it. This scope has an illuminated duplex reticle, though the battery died a while back and I don't have a replacement. I have used this scope to nail steel plates at 200 yards at dusk. Its low profile and light weight are perfectly suited for a handy rifle like this.I'm also including one 50-round box of Hornady 123 gr SST ammo, ideal for hunting or target shooting with maximum accuracy.Asking $700 face to face in Knoxville. No trade offers, please."

The bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long. The RFB is the safest bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooter's face by two layers of 1.6mm steel. In the unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well in order to protect the shooter's head and face.The RFB features a short-stroke gas piston operation mechanism and accepts standard metric FAL type magazines, which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be rocked in. The barrel is 18"" long and has a chrome lined chambered and bore and is threaded to 5/8x24 TPI. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference.
