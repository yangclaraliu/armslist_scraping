This gun was originally blued but has been through the arsenal and had a Parkerized finish applied and some later military parts added, including a replacement slide.

Bought this from a guy who used it for competition occasionally.  I've only personally put about 50 rounds down range, if that.  It's a very accurate gun.
It has a one piece guide rod, ambi-safety, extended slide release, adjustable trigger, extended magazine release and Colt grips.
It will come with ONE Colt magazine that is NOT pictured.
DISCLAIMER: The GRIP safety was disabled.  I'm guessing for competition use.  So the gun will fire with or without depressing the grip safety but the SLIDE safety works as it should.  
Other than that the gun is sold as is.  I am not the original owner and have only shot a few rounds once.
I can meet on the FAR EAST around the Old Gander Mountain/Sprouts after work or on the WESTSIDE M-F during work hours.
Must have a valid TEXAS or MILITARY ID and be 21 years of age or over.

So that's good.Condition: Never shot/never usedCaliber: .338 lapua magnumBolt action with 1 five round magazineBarrel: 24 inch fluted barrel without muzzle brake. With muzzle brake it is about 26 inches.Trigger: Savage Accu-trigger...easily adjust it with no special skillsThis is a Savage 110 BA Stealth chambered in the powerful .338 Lapua mag. I bought the rifle in 2017 and I actually never shot it. I never shot it because I wanted a very expensive scope but kept buying other guns instead. It has been in a gun safe ever since. It's never even been out the house except the day I bought it. Though I never used it, I have ""cleaned"" and lubcricated it 3 times and is kept in a humidity controlled safe. I take care of my guns. If you go to Turner's Outdoorsman and get it there it will cost you a lot. It is selling for $1,600 plus tax and fees. I'm selling mine for $1,100. Contacts me. I'm willing to travel to an FFL of your choice as long as it is not too far away."
