I know the AR market is pretty low and you can get a new AR for 450 but after shipping/tax/FFl or whatever you would be closer to 500 and it would likely not be what this one has. If so, no offense, but then buy that one and please don’t try to convince me to sell this one to you for what you found one for. I’m not desperate to sell but would like to so i can get another gun on my wishlist. That said, i will entertain reasonable offers. Thanks, i appreciate the Armslist community."

The Lite Rail incorporates precision CNC-machined M1913 Picatinny Rail surfaces along its entire length for the addition of lights, lasers, vertical grips and/or other tactical accessories. The skeletonized design of the quad rail handguard removes all unnecessary weight and bulk, keeping the rifle trim and lively for better handling qualities. While light weight was certainly a design goal, Strength and Rigidity are the Lite Rail's true defining characteristics, ensuring military-grade durability and performance under the most demanding of circumstances. Installation requires the removal of the factory barrel nut, replacing it with Daniel Defense's proprietary ""Bolt-Up System"" featuring a hardened steel barrel nut and simplified alignment of the upper-to-handguard top rail interface. This requires the use of the included Daniel Defense Barrel Nut Wrench. Six Grade-8 Mil-Spec Fasteners are then used to secure the handguard tube to the upper receiver via a pair of matching aluminum Bolt-Up Plates. The ""Bolt-Up System"" is an extremely strong and proven design, tested thoroughly by USSOCOM who selected it and the Daniel Defense RIS II Handguard for the SOPMOD II Program.

Both of mine are mid grade and all factory assembled expect for the charging handle and BCG on the PSA. I'm wanting a factory assembled SIG, BCM, Daniel Defense, etc.      The first is a like new Smith and Wesson M&P Sport II. This rifle was bought new for 599.99 and has been taken extremely great care off. It has less than 100 rounds thru it. The upgrades include a Magpul stock, BCM Charging handle, Quad rail handguard, Barska Illuminated 1-4 scope. Everything is in superior condition and have the Magpul sight, hand guard, and stock that originally came with the rifle. The rifle has never malfunctioned and haven't tampered with anything other than regular cleaning after shooting.      The second rifle is a brand new PSA premium rifle. It's got the 13.5 free float handguard. It's brand new and hasnt had a round fired thru it. The rifle was a factory competed lower and upper without BCG or changing handle. The BCG is a Daniel Defense that hasnt been abused and maybe seen 200 rounds and that's a extremely high estimate.  (I bought new off primary arms a few years ago but doesn't have the engraving.) The charging handle is just a cheap $30.00 mil spec charging handle off PSA. The rifle is brand new so hopefully it never malfunctioned yet. Lol     Both of these rifles have always been kept in a BluGuard VCI vacuum sealed bag specifically made for keeping rust and corrosion and I'd have to recommend them for anyone storing firearms. I have a spot to shoot at my house and have to shoot whatever I'm accepting in a trade as your more than welcome to shoot mine. I'll provide the ammo. Feel free to email me or text me with any offers and the worst I can say is no 27O9453OO2. Thank you for looking and May God Bless."

Refusing to be constrained by tradition and previous design limitations, the Rhino has improvements that move the revolver forward into the 21st century. Unconventional in appearance and superior by performance, the Rhino fires from the bottom of the cylinder rather than the top. This dramatically reduces muzzle rise and recoil felt by lowering the axis of the bore almost to the palm of the shooters hand. An aluminum alloy frame and barrel shroud make the Rhino lightweight and easy to carry. Accessory rails on the bottom of the barrel shroud on the 4”, 5” and 6” barrel models easily allow mounting lights or lasers. The snag resistant “hammer” is actually a cocking device because of the Rhino’s innovative completely enclosed firing mechanism which can be fired either single or double action. A cocked indicator is clearly visible to indicate the internal hammer status. Another innovation is the hexagonal cylinder which keeps the revolver’s width to a minimum. all Rhino revolvers feature an easy to see fiber optic front sight.

Refusing to be constrained by tradition and previous design limitations, the Rhino has improvements that move the revolver forward into the 21st century. Unconventional in appearance and superior by performance, the Rhino fires from the bottom of the cylinder rather than the top. This dramatically reduces muzzle rise and recoil felt by lowering the axis of the bore almost to the palm of the shooters hand. An aluminum alloy frame and barrel shroud make the Rhino lightweight and easy to carry. Accessory rails on the bottom of the barrel shroud on the 4”, 5” and 6” barrel models easily allow mounting lights or lasers. The snag resistant “hammer” is actually a cocking device because of the Rhino’s innovative completely enclosed firing mechanism which can be fired either single or double action. A cocked indicator is clearly visible to indicate the internal hammer status. Another innovation is the hexagonal cylinder which keeps the revolver’s width to a minimum. all Rhino revolvers feature an easy to see fiber optic front sight.

The systems main purpose is to reduce felt recoil by 30%. There are two functions that happen when the system engages, the primary impulse begins to travel the brass piece rearwards and the secondary impulse begins to travel the follower rearward and the two meet and cancel each other out. Another added feature with this system is the captured spring which allows for a quieter platform as the BCG travels through the buffer tube."

The rifle is in excellent condition. As with all rifles of this type it shoots very accurately. This is an antique collectible you can use regularly, and would also make a great first rifle for your child. It is for sale because I need to make space for some new items in my collection.I prefer cash, but would consider interesting trades, particularly if you happen to have a Winchester lever action rifle to swap.  Thanks for looking!!!!!"
