This is the top shelf AK known for quality and this one is factory barreled in 5.56 NATO. This limited edition Arsenal rifle was built for those that might want to make an SBR (Short Barrel Rifle) eventually so it came with the legal 16.25” barrel but was set up for the future conversion.AFTER the approved Federal (ATF) paperwork comes back you would cut the barrel back to just under 13” and install a thread-on flash suppressor to direct the muzzle blast forward. The threads the flash suppressor goes on also works for adding a suppressor (“silencer”). To hide the skinny extra length of the 16.25” legal barrel that sticks beyond the front sight threads Arsenal designed an aluminum barrel cover that mimics a stretched “booster” that short barreled rifles and full auto guns use to ensure proper cycling. It just looks better!Comes with factory mag and I have 10 Circle 10 magazines that are included. These are top of the line magazines. At $40 each, that's $400 in mags alone."

Meaning that if you hold the trigger down and run the slide it will continue firing until empty.

Has only had 50 rounds down the tube. I am looking to trade for another sig handgun. I would be interested in a p6, p225 maybe a p228 or possibly a nice p220 or sig 1911. Or, what else do you have?? I am set on .40 and .380 so I don't need any of those. I would do a straight trade on a nice gun but can give or take a little to make sure the trade is fair for both parties. REDACTED"

I should not even have to say this but I’ve had issues come up so:  Items are not sold till I have cash in my hand.  1/2 the people who say they are going to buy do not.  Therefore until you have paid me for an item it is still up for grabs by someone else.  If you are traveling for an item however, I will hold it for you from the time you start the journey till you arrive."

Little did they know the Army had already settled on the .45.
