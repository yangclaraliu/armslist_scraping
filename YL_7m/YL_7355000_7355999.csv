Even with my large hands I have zero issues getting 3 to 4 inch groupings at 20 yards. The gun comes with one 6 round magazine w/pinky extender which makes the pistol a 7-round pistol(6 +1 in the chamber) I have also installed a Hogue grip which makes the pistol much more comfortable to fire and feels 1000% better in your hand. I would be willing to trade straight up for a Ruger LC380 or LC9 no other offers will be entertained. I will also throw in a Ultra-Bright tactical LED flashlight and soft side IWB case by  for concealed carry.

With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options.The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. The P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date."

Ignore the default setting that says no shipping*Item: Velocity Systems LE Plate Carrier & Quad 5.56 SwiftClip Placard GP Condition: Brand New/Never Worn Color: Black (both carrier & placard are all black)Size: Carrier is size Small/Medium and the cummerbund is size Small (24-34'' Waist) Asking Price: $95 Retail Price: $285 (Velocity Systems price on their website for both the carrier and placard)Details: Go to Velocity's website at velsyst.com and browse to their ""Law Enforcement Plate Carrier"" and ""Quad 5.56 SwiftClip Placard, GP"".This is high quality gear from Velocity Systems and great for low-profile operations. Just to be clear, I am selling both the plate carrier AND the placard together. I'm selling it because it's not the fit I was looking for. The cummerbund is the Elastic CBN1 Size Small (meant for low-profile operations). It says it will work for waist size 24'' - 34'', however, I have a waist size 32'' and the cumberbund is too tight for me. Check their website for details on sizing. Option 1: If you have a waist size smaller than 32'' and you are relatively thin/skinny then this will work for you.Option 2: If you want to buy the carrier anyway, then call Velocity and see if you can buy or exchange the cumberbund for a larger size. As far as armor plate sizing, this carrier is considered a ""Small/Medium"". Well I wear a size small ESAPI plate and this carrier is too big for my plates. If you wear a size medium-large ESAPI plate or you use 10x12'' plates then this should work better for you. I do not think size small plates work well with this carrier. If you want to buy this carrier, I recommend you bring the plates that you want to use and let's see if they actually fit properly BEFORE you buy this from me. 
 Email me with any questions. This is a good kit, just not the right size for me.   Shipping: Buyer pays shipping (USPS Standard Shipping) In-Person Pick-ups: Willing to meeting somewhere in the Lawrenceville GA area"

I am the original owner of this gun which I purchased NIB a couple years ago, I can provide proof of this at the time of sale if desired. Due to an increase in underage buyers, I will only sell to someone 21 years or older. No, I will not sell this to your mom or dad so they can give it to you, that is a straw purchase and is very, very illegal.

I will sell or trade them all together or one at a time. I just want to expand my gun collection even if it is with something cheap, as long as it works. From front to back in the picture - The first shotgun is a bluegrass brand double barre made bye Belknap hdw&mfg .co in Louisville Kentucky I believe in the 1950s. It is assumed to be a 10 gauge. Everything seems like it functions except the lock is missing. one hammer was brazed back on but it looks good.   The second is a rarer Belgium made Neumann bros ""machine made, laminated steel"" double barrel from the late 1800s The stock is cracked and it has had one firing pin and one screw replaced. Everything else is original. Seems to be a 16 gauge. Everything works on it, except the hammers light strike the firing pins. Both have some pitting in the bore.  A little work and both could be made operable with non modern ammo. Or they could be used for parts for better specimens of the same models. Or fireplace decoration. I also have a single shot forehand arms co 16 gauge made in worstecer massechusets marked patent feb 4 1896 that is in working order despite some pitting in the barrel. Says it is made with ""fine decarbonized steel"" may be safe to shoot modern target loads but I'd just stick to black powder shells unless I knew more. It will be on a separate listing as it is a working shotgun."
