Its compact design makes this an ideal optic for smaller platform guns.The TA47 features tactical hand-adjustable windage and elevation turrets, and a battery-free illuminated reticle to create a versatile weapon sight that is well-suited for use in a wide range of situations and conditions. This Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) sight was designed for use with the both-eyes-open Bindon Aiming Concept for superior sense of balance and a wider field-of-view, and is outfitted with an 9.2 MOA amber triangle reticle that enables fast sighting and tracking for CQB operations and precise shot placement at distance. Anti-reflection broadband fully multicoated optics maximizes light transmission to provide bright and clear views with limited distortion.Trijicon's battery-free dual-illumination reticle system employs a tritium phosphor lamp for low-light and night targeting, as well as a fiber optic illumination that focuses, channels, and filters available light to illuminate the reticle. Using ambient light ensures that the reticle brightness will be appropriate for the conditions without any adjustment by the user. The reticle's aiming point can be adjusted in 1/2 MOA increments, and an internal adjustment mechanism allows the ACOG to reliably hold zero. Complementing the ACOG's optical and illumination systems is a nitrogen-filled, 7075-T6 aluminum housing with a corrosion and scratch-resistant matte black anodized finish that provides the durability needed for reliable performance in a wide range of conditions.To mount on a Picatinny rail you will need an adapter, which sell as low as $45 on Amazon (99669 Weaver, ACOG Mount).Optical Performance2x low magnification20mm objective lensBroad-band multicoated lenses enhance clarity and increase light transmission by minimizing flare, glare, reflections, and distortion29' field of view at 100 yd5.6° actual angle of viewReticle DetailsDual-illuminated 9.2 MOA amber triangle reticleCenter aiming trianglePartially illuminated post on lower vertical axisDual illumination system: Battery-free tritium and fiber-opticsTritium isotope: Interacts with a phosphors membrane to create illumination for the reticle in low or no lightFiber optics: Focuses, channels, and filters ambient light to illuminate the reticleUse and Handling1/2 MOA per click impact point correction±40 MOA windage/elevation adjustment rangeTactical tool-free adjustment turretsDesigned for use with the both-eyes-open Bindon Aiming Concept for superior sense of balance and a wider field-of-view2.1"" eye relief10mm exit pupilConstruction Details7075-T6 aluminum alloy housingNitrogen-filled for fogproof and waterproof performanceWaterproof to 328' (100m)""Model 16"" carry-handle mount: Designed for ""Model 16"" / ""Model 15"" platforms - screw and washer set includedShock-resistant: Tested to withstand recoils on weapons from .22 LRs up to .50 BMGsLightweight: Weighs just 6.4 ozMade in the USAINCLUDED IN PACKAGE:1 Carry Handle Screw and Washer Set (TA30)1 Compact ACOG Scopecoat (TA62)1 LENSPEN® (TA56)1 Trijicon Logo Sticker (PR15)1 Manual1 Warranty Card1 Scope Case1 Allen Key"

(MSRP $785, retail $550)-Additional ten (10) round magazine. ($60)-Miculek-Pro 308 Muzzle Brake Compensator. ($60)-Vortex Diamondback 4-12x40 Rifle scope. ($150)-Aero Precision Ultralight 1"" extended scope mount. ($55)-Vortex Flip Caps. ($20)-Generic Buttstock round holder. ($10)-Rudolph Optics Swivel Pivot Bipod. ($50)This package totals to just under $1000 if bought new retail. I have approximately 30 rounds of .308 ammo I will include in the package.I am asking $700 for everything, which is a steal for this weapon. If you are familiar with purchasing a rifle, you know it takes an additional $300+ on top of the rifle cost to get it ready to shoot. Purchase from me and have a complete package for a fraction of the cost. The rifle is only sold as a complete package, however, if you do not want the scope/mount combo, I will take it off and knock an additional $50 off the total price.This is a chance to get a fantastic rifle package that has the legendary AccuStock and AccuTrigger that Savage is famous for. With the muzzle brake, I estimate about a 40% reduction in recoil, which makes for easy/bearable shooting trips.Cash only, no trades will be entertained as I do not need to add anymore to my collection.Any questions, feel free to email me. I do all business by email until a serious buyer contacts me. Thank you."

Trigger is smooth and crisp. The porting makes this snubbie much tamer. Feels more like a 9mm instead of a .357mag.I spent a long time looking for one of these. I carried it and enjoy owning it. I don't really want to sell it but we all have to do things we're not interested in. $550 cash/$600 trade comes with sticky holster. You won't find another like this. Price is fair. Price is firm. I may have the box around here somewhere. Thx for your time.

My price is $650 FIRM & CASH ONLY  (FIRST PERSON WITH THE ENTIRE AMOUNT IN CASH WILL OWN IT).  Must be 21 and have a valid driver license with either a current Nebraska Purchase Permit or a CCW- NO EXCEPTIONS. 
From the HK website: CALIBER- .45 ACP, OVERALL LENGTH- 7.24 in., OVERALL HEIGHT- 5.51 in, OVERALL WIDTH W/LEVER- 1.54in., BARREL LENGTH -3.94in., SIGHT RADIUS -6in. Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact (HK45C) uses a slim-line grip profile, otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45. Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45."

If for some reason it does not sell, I'll contact the next person in the order that inquiries came to me. I thinks that's only fair. If it sells I will delete the listing tomorrow evening. Thank you for your interest and patience.)Nice Remington 03-A3.I've had this for over 40 years, it is not a pieced together rifle.Date on barrel is 5-43, all proof marks, cartouches, inspectors marks/stamps, and stamps in the stock are intact and correct.There are a few dings here and there in the stock, but nothing major. Markings stamped in the stock show this has been through the Rock Island Arsenal for inspection/rework and possibly the Ogden Arsenal, but, every single part on this rifle is marked Remington.The markings in the stock that most will want to see are, RA, crossed cannons cartouche, FJA in rectangle, RIA FK in rectangle, OG, and circle with P.No import markings.The ordnance bomb with proof mark on the barrel can be seen in the third photo, the proof marks on the receiver and bolt are intact and correct also.I realize the pictures I uploaded for this listing aren't that great, if you're seriously interested, contact me for more better pics or with questions.Please leave a contact name when responding with the ""contact seller"" option on the listing.Due to scammers, I do not respond to anonymous emails.I am in the far north east corner of Oklahoma, one hour north east of Tulsa, but might be willing to travel a little way to meet a serious buyer.Not currently looking for trades.
