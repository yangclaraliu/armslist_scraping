This Gun is safe if dropped, some earlier versions were recalled for upgrade. Requires included tool for take down/cleaning.It Takes me 5 seconds to take down, reassembly is around 30 seconds, its simple despite what some haters on the internet say. These are wonderfulguns, no wonder the other brand loyalists hate them. These feel awesome in hand and that makes for a better on target experience. Local range rental Walthers perform flawlesslyafter thousands of rounds, thats why I bought this one. Already carry a Shield which shoots great with no problems. These sell Locally for 425 to 450 new.I have shot the rentals, this one is unfired as of now. I will take ad down when I get a holster for it. There are lots of videos with rave reviews on these.Again..the takedown is pretty simple to do in 5 seconds and reassembly takes a little longer.

Taurus says its revolver is properly named the “Judge” because it is the gun most judges choose to conceal under their robes while in court. And, it fires the .45 Colt cartridge and .410 shell, which are ideal for close range shooting or self-defense situations.
The Polymer is made of, yes that’s right, polymer steel. What makes it different from the standard Public Defender its 7.5″ overall length, but it’s still comparable in price. Otherwise has identical features including Taurus’s Ribber Grip (ribbed rubber), Taurus’s lock safety that disables the gun with the turn of a key, fixed sights with a fiber optic front sight that’s brightly colored and easy to see, it is hammer fired and shooters can set the action off with a long pull (double) or short pull (single). Also, it uses a transfer bar, so the hammer strikes a flat bar that presses the firing pin instead of the hammer striking the firing pin directly.   Taurus recommends the Public Defender for self-defense.   For question please feel free to email me or text me at REDACTED, thanks for viewing."
