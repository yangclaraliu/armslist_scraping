Striker fired, no manual safety, no magazine disconnect and no ridiculous LOADED WHEN UP chamber indicator on top of the slide. This was my primary carry gun for the last year and I've shot it a LOT. Trigger is very good, it shoots pretty flat so you can double tap pretty easily and accurately. A bit snappy with hot ammo since it's only weighs 17 ounces I think. I would prefer something a bit larger so here we are. I'm including an IWB holster, 3 magazines with flat and extended base pads so you can choose which you prefer and I'll throw in my Ruger hat if you want it. I won't go to Iron City Armory because they're dickheads but please have an FFL in mind for the transfer when you contact me. Master Ammo in Beaver does $20 transfers, we would just need to call them to make an appointment."

This rifle is a 1973 model, meaning it was made at the peak of Marlin's quality manufacturing in the North Haven, Conn. plant and carries the proof stamp ""JM"". The rifle belonged to a friend of mine who bought it new and really hunted only a few times back in the mid '70's. The rifle is original in practially all respects.... except I removed the old yellowish varnish Marshield finish that was hiding some really beautiful American Walnut and refinished it using Wipe On Poly Walnut Stain and several coats of Tong Oil. It has the original front sight hood and a hammer extension that may be a later model put on when he added a scope (which I removed and tossed out). The gold trigger is a smooth crisp 2 3/4 lbs. The action is as smooth as silk as so many of the older Marlins were. The rifle is not ""like new in the box"", but is as nice an older traditional pre-saftey Marlin as you'll find. It has never had holes drilled into the stocks for sling swivels. About the only blemish to speak of other than a couple of handling marks is evidence on top of the receiver that a scope had been mounted at one time. If intererested email me and I will send a link with lots more photos. If interested I have a like new Skinner Express rear peep sight and a brand new Skinner front patridge blade sight for this rifle, $130 cost....will let go with this rifle for an additional $90.I prefer a local face to face cash sale, but would ship from my FFL to your FFL for an additional $50 after receipt of a USPS Money Order.I can be reached by phone at REDACTED.**********Need Christmas cash so will drop price on a face to face only quick sale to $450.*********"

It's super smooth and for the most part well taken care of, with the exception of a few marks. Another plus is that it shares the same style as the Winchester model 1200 and parts are mostly interchangeable. So basically if you can think it, people have made it and you can most likely buy it. That means this can also be a Project shotgun as well. Does come with a shotgun soft case too.
