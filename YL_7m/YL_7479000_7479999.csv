Two toned and well cared for and is the later model with an F serial number.  This gun is patterned after the P226 and is only 10% smaller so in your hand this gun feels like a compact 9mm not a little toy like so many 22 guns. The breakdown for cleaning is just rotating one lever. I bought the gun used and it had a gritty trigger and I had ftf almost every magazine. I took the gun apart and cleaned up machining marks on the internals and polished the feed ramp (which had a ridge on it causing the ftf’s) and changed the recoil spring to the supplied lighter one. The trigger is now smooth and I have had no failure to feeds with the mini mags I usually shoot or with a box of Remington Golden Bullets. It is now far superior to a new one in my opinion. The sale includes the gun, one magazine, two additional front sights of different heights to customize the gun to you and your ammo, the paperwork, the heavy recoil spring, the safety lockout key, and of course the all important cable lock. Internet reviews are mixed but with the work done to it this is an excellent gun with the big gun feel and in 22 so it’s affordable to shoot and enjoy. Any questions or to see it let me know. The small print:  cash only. Must see photo ID showing IN residence. And must be legally able to purchase and own a handgun in Indiana. We must meet face to face and no shipping."

Only about 150 rounds through the gun. 10/10 condition absolutely nothing wrong w/ the gun either aesthetically or functionally. Very clean, I religiously clean my guns after every trip to the range. Just would rather have something else. Comes with all original stuff from factory (Box, manual, soft zip up case, lock, chamber flag, two six round mags). More so interested in trades at the moment, but would consider a cash sale if the price is right, make me an offer. Worst I can say is ""no thanks"". Also willing to add cash from my end if you have something that’s more valuable.  Aftermarket work done on gun: I painted the front sight post orange so it’s more visible against the black rear sights, put on talon rubber grips, If you've ever shot or handled this pistol you know how bad the stock trigger is, so I installed a Galloway Precision Santiago short stroke trigger kit (reduces trigger travel/reset by 35%) & flat face performance trigger (I still have all the original parts). I also put Garrison Grip extension on one of the magazines which allows you to get your pinkie on it and makes for a more comfortable grip on the gun (does not increase mag capacity though).Interested in...Walther PPK (S&W version Blued) or Original German made PPK + cash from me Colt Delta Elite (Stainless) + cash from meSemi-auto rifles + cash from me (depending on what rifle) no .22's pleaseFeel free to email me or text me at REDACTED with any additional questions or if you want more pictures.

However he does not want it, and I'm cleaning out the cabinet-----I'm an empty-nester now.   Like I said, still new-in the-box & never shot, with the latest upgades from Bersa, as the ""PRO"" model.  Bud's sells these now for around $425.00, and that's about the cheapest around.  I'll let it go for $325.00 + $30.00 Ship & Handle from My FFL to Your FFL.

Awesome shooter for what it is, but we rarely use it anymore in favour of our AR-15's. Guess AK's aren't really our thing, and it's kind of become a wall decoration at this point. Rifle has some additional parts on it:* Replaced the orignal stock with a Magpul fixed AK stock, with a QD point installed on the stock (still have the original tapco stock if you prefer that for some reason)* The canted muzzle break is reversible for left or right handed slant.* Quad rail installed in place of original handguard.* Magpul angled foregrip for heat management. The stock also has a cheek riser you can install if you want. Stock parts that came with the rifle is a scope rail on the reciever, and a while I'm not sure what trigger is installed in it by Palmetto State, it's a damn sight better than most stock AK triggers I've ever used. Also have several mags, including the metal one that came from the factory, 2 magpul 30 round mags, and a 10 round magazine in case the 30 rounders suddenly become illegal. Only issue we've had so far is the dust cover is crazy tight, and it doesn't like to switch back and forth between brass and steel cased ammo without a cleaning (this is apparently not unusual). Otherwise, it's a fun range toy for putting holes in paper or laying waste to watermelons."

The mount is for 1in scope, and it is built incredibly solid. Honestly, a bit to a fault since it weighs a bit more than most of the competitors, BUT on the other hand you get 3 scews for mounting with even tension on each side of the scope for a total of 12 screws. This makes for a very solid mounting platform if you're more concerned with ruggedness than weight. Mount does a good job of raising the scope for proper eye relief with an AR-15... humurously, it actually does give just enough clearance for a 50mm objective lens if you need that."
