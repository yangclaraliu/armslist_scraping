My loss is your gain.Vortex Diamondback Rifle Scope 3-9x40 Dead-Hold BDC Reticle, Black - DBK-01-BDC.
The Diamondback - loaded with features! First, the solid one-piece aircraft-grade aluminum alloy construction makes the Diamondback riflescope virtually indestructible and highly resistant to magnum recoil. Argon purging puts waterproof and fogproof performance on the agenda, and advanced fully multi-coated optics raise an eyebrow when crystal clear, tack-sharp images appear in the crosshairs. Look for all this and more in a riflescope you'd expect to cost quite a bit more-but doesn't. We can live with that. 3-9x40 riflescope is ideal for big game, muzzleloader, and slug shotgun applications. Dead-Hold BDC reticle has a customized design that helps eliminate guesswork on hold-over and windage corrections. Good for any hunting or shooting at varying ranges where estimating hold-over would be a concern."

This gun is modelled after the Glock 17, with many of the same dimensions. Good to Very Good condition, great for cheap training. The ISSC M22 shares much in common with the Glock, and is compatible with most fitted holsters for the model 17. The front and rear sights are even interchangeable with the Glock series handguns, as evidenced by the model 43 front sight installed on this handy little plinker. Model 43 rear sights included, but the stock rear sight is windage adjustable and highly visable. The most noticeable difference between the M22 and Glock handguns is the obvious deviance in the slide action, adopting a single action hammer with slide-mounted safety and decocker as opposed to Glock's signature striker firing mechanism. Also included are two replacement front sights, rear sight adjustment screwdriver, trigger lock key, one solid metal 10 round magazine with polymer buttplate, original ISSC case and all original paperwork. 
ISSC is a reputable manufacturer of quality firearms and continues to make this model of .22lr handgun to an impressive standard. Research one of many reviews of the ISSC M22 on YouTube for reference.
I am the original owner of this firearm as it was purchased from BudsGunShop-dot-com back in 2011. I can only meet at my place of residence in Webster NH, and I'd prefer to keep the sale between NH state residents, so please bring proof of residence (i.e. driver's id or bills to address, etc) just to confirm. Email me and we'll exchange phone numbers. More pictures available upon request. Thanks for looking!"

This is a NICE Revolver!! Comes with case. excellent condition. The Ruger Vaquero is a New Model Blackhawk with fixed sights consisting of a front blade and a notch milled into the frame at the rear. Like the New Model Blackhawk the Vaquero does not require the hammer to be half-cocked for loading and unloading, and uses a transfer bar mechanism which prevents the cartridge under the hammer from being fired without the trigger being pulled.   Traditional western-style, hand-filling grip has long been acknowledged as one of the most comfortable and natural pointing of any grip style.   Patented reverse indexing pawl allows for easier loading and unloading, while the traditional beveled cylinder simplifies holstering.   Patented transfer bar mechanism and loading gate interlock provide an unparalleled measure of security against accidental discharge.   Handsome, larger crescent-shaped ejector rod head boasts traditional form, perfect for every cowboy or cowgirl.   Cold hammer-forged barrel results in ultra-precise rifling that provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning."

I will read messages and answer calls when I get them and if I feel like my time is being wasted I will just say I'm not interested and get off of the phone or I won't respond to text messages at all. Also, most likely, I will not travel as I am currently unable to drive my vehicle so if you're interested in making a deal you'll have to come to me but I may be able to meet up within reason if I can be given a ride to meet up with you in a public place (under an hour definitely) and I will let you know if I can when you contact me and we get to that point where I need to mention if I can travel a little bit or not."

I am not picky, but I prefer rifles over anything else. I will also sell the car outright or trade for bows. The car has 117xxx Miles. It has a cracked dash, minor rust under passenger side door, a broken ebrake (but you can park in first gear), off track drivers side window, and a tag light is out. The car has ac/heat, sunroof, radio, and power windows besides the drivers side. The car drives great, I just can’t get the hang of stick or afford a car right now. I do not have a car, and I live in Gainesville. The car is in Dunnellon at my father in law’s house. My boyfriend works full time and it’s about 45 minutes from us, so usually we can’t meet same day. If you have any offers or questions please text or call me at REDACTED."

The only thing wrong with the knife is there's dirt or something on one side of the pins on the side with the Butterfly/Bali-Song logo, probably from being carried in a pocket or sitting on that side for a long period of time. Other than that i'd say it's 95%+ condition overall which is pretty good for spending the vast majority of its existence outside of a box.   *I don't check my email so it's best to call/text me: (440) 714 - 8336 and please don't bother doing so if you aren't seriously interested as I don't want my time wasted. I will not respond to any texted cash offer under $200 as that's most likely the lowest amount of cash I will accept. This knife was not cheap to begin with 24+ years ago and in my recent research it's worth $200+ due to its condition even without the original box and sheath.
