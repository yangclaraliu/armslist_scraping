Emails asking if the gun is still available will be ignored. Price is firm and willing to ship at buyer's expense. Not interested in ammo or gun parts in trade.Model 4 Harrington & Richardson revolver with 4.5"" barrel chambered in .38 S&W. Production of this gun was from 1905 to 1942ish with the serial/batch number putting this one's manufacture somewhere between 1915 and 1920. The gun is blued, has hard rubber grips, fixed sights, 5-rounds, left to me by my late father and is fully functional. The gun was test fired at Gunny's in Maryville about year ago and can confirm that it works. Needless to say it's not been shot since but if push come to shove, will work if need be or simply make a great addition to an older revolver collection. In 100% mint condition, the gun is valued at about $275. Given the condition of this gun, and going prices I've seen whenever I've looked online, $150 is about the going price. Would be willing to sell out right or trade + cash up to about $200. As far as trades + cash go, would be interested in a low-end but functional 308 Win rifle or SKS, Maverick 88 12GA shotgun, or something similarly priced that's not archery-related, black powder or muzzleloader, .22LR, .380, .410 or Hi-Point. Email is the best way to contact me due to bad cell reception where I work. A number where I can be reached via text or phone call will be provided to serious, legitimate buyers or offers. Buyer must have valid TN DL. CCW permit preferred but not required considering mine is currently being processed. If the ad is up, the gun is still available for sale or trade.Thanks"

This optic is fantastic for a close quarter combat battle carbine. I was able to shoot 1"" groups at 100 yards with both my 5.56 and 300 Blackout. I've decided to leave the AR15 platform and put together a long range precision rifle. Optic is like new with very minimal use. Please contact me with any offers. Thanks,BillDescription:A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints. Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions. Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic • Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. No need to fumble with switches prior to use. • 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances. • In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking and maintenance easy. • Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared to iron sights and magnified scopes. Applications Law Enforcement carbines, rifles, shotguns and submachineguns"

I had this setup for a 9mm but I have been informed this will also work in the .40 S&W as well - don't quote me on the 45ACP, that is something I have not personally tested. The holster has only been worn a total of 5 times. It retains the pistol perfectly and the quality is exceptional. I personally find that the gun and holster are just too big for me to carry. Brand new, these holsters sell on G-Code's website for $70+$13 shipping, so all in all you're in about $80 plus 4 weeks shipping. I recognize that this is used, so I think $40 is a fair price. For a used holster, it's in great condition. I will post photos to Armslist as soon as I get home to take them tonight, November 20th. 
 
I am willing to ship outside of St. Louis. If the ad is up, the hoslter is available. Thanks for your time."

The SI Gascan is available in Daniel Daniel Defense Tornado and features a small DD logo laser etched into the corner of the lens for a completely custom look. Two lenses are cut from the curve of a single lens shield, then mounted in the frame to maintain the original, continuous contour. Lightweight O Matter frame material offers premium comfort. Peripheral vision is maximized by XYZ Optics, an innovation that maintains visual clarity at all angles of view. Impact protection meets ANSI Z87.1 standards, and our Three-Point Fit retains the lenses in precise optical alignment.  FEATURES Plutonite Lens One of the most optically pure materials used in eyewear today, it maximizes clarity and impact resistance while filtering out 100% of all UVA, UVB, UVC and harmful blue light up to 400nm. Not a coating, the UV protection is from the lens material itself. High Definition Optics High Definition Optics (HDO) is a collection of patented technologies that allow Oakley eyewear to meet or exceed the testing standards of the American National Standards Institute for optical clarity, visual fidelity, and impact resistance. Impact Protection Backed by decades of innovation, Oakley performance eyewear offers uncompromising protection against high-velocity and high-mass impact. The protection is a benefit of the premium materials and unique architectures of Oakley lens/frame combinations. UV Protection Eye damage attributed to ultraviolet light includes cataracts, pterygium and macular degeneration. Our Plutonite® lens material filters out 100% of all UVA, UVB, UVC and harmful blue light up to 400nm. The protection is from the lens material itself. Three-Point Fit A patented innovation that ensures the frame makes contact only at the bridge of the nose and the sides of the head. It holds lenses in precise optical alignment with a secure fit that eliminates the pressure points common with frames that hook the ears. O-Matter A stress-resistant frame material that withstands environmental extremes, it is lightweight yet highly durable. Controlled flexibility enhances impact resistance while contributing to the all-day comfort of frames made with this innovative synthetic. Iridium Designed to balance light transmission and reduce glare, this premium lens coating is made with superheated metal oxides. It is available in a spectrum of colors for optimizing vision in virtually any light condition.

I've put 500 rounds through it and I clean and maintain the rifle regularly. It’s only been to the range twice. Although you see the rifle with tan accessories, I also still have the original black handgrip, original black buttstock as well as a black Blackhawk vertical grip (see picture). You get everything To do both an all black rifle or a Black and Tan rifle.I'm including everything that you see in the picture, which includes 2 Magpul PMAG mazines, Magpul bipod mount, Magpul rail, bipod, Blackhawk vertical grip (tan and black), black sling, and a Magpul STR butt stock. It also has a Bushnell Dropzone 223 4.5 -18x/40mm with BDC reticles, target turrets and side parallax along with the dust covers and mounted with a Vortex cantilever scope mount. I am including the original hard case that it came with, the original box it shipped in and all manuals and the gun lock. I'm also including the original butt stock. As a sweetener, I'm throwing in 180 rounds of American Eagle 223 ammo, a Gander Mountain tactical bag and the Plano All Weather Tactical case that you see in the picture. That case comes with built in locks and I do have the keys for it.Asking price is $975, but I’m willing to listen to REASONABLE offers. I've researched this package and it's value (brand new) is close to $1,300, so you save more than $300 purchasing this package.***Do not waste my time with low ball offers. I've spent considerable amount of time looking up prices for everything in this package deal and if you purchased these items separately, brand new it would cost you almost $1,300 before tax. I'm not using retail store pricing either. I've researched the cheapest places online to purchase the gun and all of the exact same accessories. I actually paid more than $1,300 over the course of the last 8 months. Anyone that emails me low ball offers will not only be ignored, but your email will be flagged as spam and all future emails will be sent to my junk folder for automatic deletion.***You would need to pay in cash or money transfer via Zelle (it's free if your bank offers it). As a last resort, I can accept credit cards, but you need to pay the $30 in processing fees. I will consider shipping the rifle to a licensed FFL of your choice, but you will need to pay for all of the shipping costs and pay for the rifle in advance and it would need to be paid through Zelle or USPS money order.To complete the sale, you will need to complete a firearms bill of sale that I will provide. There's no background check, but the bill of sale is non negotiable. We must meet in a safe, public place preferably in daylight. If at night, I may bring along a friend to be a witness/protection.More information can be found on the Saint by visiting http://www.springfield-armory.com/saint-series/"

The pistol includes a flat board stock with a newer manufactured holster attached. Experts suspect it is a 1938 production date. The pistol is mechanically sound and includes a new production barrel in addition to the original barrel which is pitted. Because of the fake markings and refinishing the collectors value is minimal. The magazine is an original war time magazine.
