Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.

This pistol seems to be almost exactly like the Walther P99. In fact, I have a Walther P99AS, and this accepts its magazines, holster, etc. I believe Walther made the lower, while S&W made the upper. I bought this pistol used, and it came with a generic magazine that functions with it but does not hold open after the last round. However, it does hold open when using my Walther magazines. This pistol also has night sights, but they are not very bright anymore. If you already have  Walther, this would be a good ""beater"" type gun as it does show signs of wear. If you have any questions, let me know. I make it to the St. Louis area sometimes, but not very often, so the buyer should plan to pick up the pistol in the Desloge/Park Hills/Farmington area. If the ad is still up, the pistol is still available. I will not break any laws by selling the pistol to a felon, an underage buyer, or a non-Missouri resident."

If you are familiar with the Grand Power line of pistols, this is the striker-fired version of the K100.

This takes the same magazines, holsters, etc. as the K100 but just has a different trigger mechanism. This pistol is in perfect condition and has been fired minimally. I am selling because the trigger is too soft/light for my liking. It includes what you see in the photos. If you have any questions, let me know. I make it to the St. Louis area sometimes, but not very often, so the buyer should plan to pick up the pistol in the Desloge/Park Hills/Farmington area. If the ad is still up, the pistol is still available. I will not break any laws by selling the pistol to a felon, an underage buyer, or a non-Missouri resident."

It is the Optics Ready model. SKU is 811311 if you wanna look it up on SWs website. The short story is that it is a super accurate and incredibly lightweight 308 AR that is fully ambidextrous. It has the following upgrades: LMT SopMod buttstock, Magpul forend, Magpul grip. Gun retails for 1600 before taxes/shipping/transfer and the cheapest I can one on Gun broker is more than 1300 after taxes/fees/shipping/transfer. I think 1000 is fair since the gun is new and has a couple hundred in upgrades. Also, I will include the following items: 4 genuine Knights Armament 10rnd precision magazines which are the gold standard and are perfect for hunting (cost me 80 a piece) and 100rnds of 308 Win. ball ammunition.

Each comes with six shells which hold one 6mm bb. One is styled after a Smith and Wesson Model 29 in .44 magnum with a four-inch barrel, the other is a Smith and Wesson Model 10 HB in .38 special with a four inch barrel. The cylinders swing out and the ejector rods pop out the shells. The M29 fires in single or double action, the M10 is double action only. The M29 is excellent shape, the M10 has some wear on the barrel. The M10 features a T-grip style extension that is removable. I haven't used either in years but I have no reason to believe they won't work. The only mechanical issue is that the M10 won't fire in single action. These are great for backyard battles, plinking, or display. They'd make excellent props for an amateur filmmaker as well. I'm looking for $55 for the pair, but I'm open to all offers. Add $15 for shipping for non-local buyers."

What I've got here is a Crossbreed SuperTuck Deluxe, for right hand draw, with leather/color option being the Horsehide Natural, Standard Cut from the manufacturer that I did a nice job custom cutting for myself so I could get a grip and draw, for Glock 20,21,29,30,30sf  AND a Crossbreed Single Tuckable IWB Mag Carrier for Glock 20,21,29,30 magazines, with the leather/color option being the Horsehide Natural, for Left Side Carry
There is no firearm, magazine, nor ammunition for sale in this listing.  Those present in the pictures (the Glock 21, the magazine, and the .45 Auto rounds) are for fit, size, scale, reference purposes only.  A dollar bill in the picture is for size reference and is not for sale nor is it Dan The Mall Ninja's rebate program.  It can only be included in the sale if the final price is raised by $1.If shipping is required, then add $6.50 to the price for it shipped via USPS flat rate envelope anywhere in the USA ( I think that includes Hawaii and Alaska for that rate if not mistaken) I have more pictures of this holster than I could post in the 3 I am allowed with my free account here.  I can email more pictures if someone wants.
In person, I'll exchange for cash, and cash only.   No personal identification necessary for this item - that'd be weird.  I will exchange with buyer at the ""Safe Exchange"" parking spaces, also sometimes called ""craigslist parking"" area of Greer Police Department in Greer, South Carolina.
Please do not contact me with offers to trade.  I will not respond.  I am willing to ship these, but don't see where to check to change ""shipping: No"" to a ""yes"" when I create a listing with my free armslist account.  I would receive and cash USPS money order, or Square Cash (the Cash App) before getting the order boxed and shipping it out via USPS. Next paragraph outlines my shipping restrictions (i.e., freedom-states-only)I will not sell or ship firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms right to an individual (i.e., bypassing the FFL). I will not ship ammunition to PO Boxes, nor via USPS.  I will not ship ammunition or magazines to California, Connecticut, Alaska, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, or Washington D.C.
The Ugly Part:If you buy something from me, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your use, misuse, application, gifting, regifting, or redistribution of the product.  By purchasing, receiving, or using the product, you agree to indemnify me and hold me harmless should any people, property, firearms, ammunition, magazines, or people's feelings get hurt by the product.  If buying a holster, you agree to check fit and function of the holster(s) with an UNloaded firearm to ensure nothing of the holster, firearm, modifications to either, or external environment factors induce a discharge of the firearm.  If buying ammunition, you agree handle it safely, assume full responsibility for its use and who can access it, and to use it only in appropriately chambered firearms of good working order.   If purchasing a firearm, buyer agrees that I (seller) cannot and should not be able to monitor the use of the firearm anymore (it will no longer be my possession, my responsibility, or any of my business for that matter)."
