It is actually better than a new gun as I have spent time cleaning up and polishing the internal parts that usually give these guns a gritty feeling trigger and slide action and now this gun has a much smoother feel. The reason I'm selling it has nothing to do with the gun and ill be glad to explain if you are interested in the gun. The small print is ftf only, cash only, I must see a valid IN driver's license and license to carry also preferred. I will require you to sign a bill of sale. You will get no BS from me and I expect none from you. I am pretty firm at $235 and you are getting an unfired pistol with better than new feel, and no $15+ sales tax or other fees. Also I have the gun in hand so no store's advertise it and then don't have it or we'll ship it and you will get an unseen gun sometime. To set up a time to meet or for any questions just give me a shout. The gun looks gray in the first picture, but it is actually solid black like in the second pic."

So not only are you considering a safe for whatever you want it for but your also getting a little history with it as well. The safe is 55"" tall X 22"" wide X 10"" deep. It also has the 2 trays that come with it and yes they are the original plastic utility trays that came with this safe back when they made them.I live near exit 214 off 69 or you could take one of the Anderson exits. The town is called Edgewood and i live directly off of 32 which is about 5- 10 minutes away from the exits on 69. Anyway, i am home this weekend so please give me a call at your convenience so we can set up a time for you to come take a look at it. If me or my wife do not answer the phone for some odd reason just leave your name and number and i will get back to you ASAP. I am open to morning's, noon and evening's in setting up a time to meet."

Lacking import marks and having seen no degree of refinish or restoration, this uncommon Webley Mk.V represents a sound investment and would be a wonderful addition to any British arms collection.Very fine,the revolver retains better than 95% original blue with the balance consisting of loss from holstering and service wear. The bore rates as excellent-bright and clear, it retains strong, well-defined rifling beneath lint, dust and residue. The lands are crisp and the grooves show light oxidation along with traces of very shallow pitting in places-the bore should clean nicely. As stated above, the weapon is neith import nor export marked.Buyer pays actual shipping costs $30."

It was purchased 2 years ago while I was in the process of upgrading my Hoyt bow but unfortunately due to my draw length, the Hoyt Double XL doesn’t fit and the case has never been used. The Terra Glide has remained in high demand as Badlands ‘temporarily discontinued’ Duffle bag while they address a logistic issue with one of their partners. As always, Badlands stands by their products with a lifetime warranty regardless of who purchased their products.Basic Description (took from website & one of many online reviews) :The Badlands Terra Glide Duffle Bag is the perfect piece of luggage for the hunter on the road or the traveler looking for room and organization. Whether traveling domestically, internationally, or to a hunting camp the Terra Glide’s 4,500 cubic inches of storage and rugged design will stand up to the abuse of baggage handlers, rough truck beds, and also store all your gear, clothing and more!The Facts:I was amazed at how much gear I was able to pack into the very sharp Badlands Terra Glide duffel bag. The 4,500 cubic inches of storage features the same innovative organization and user-friendly convenience as the Badlands hunting pack. Please note the following features that separate this sharp duffle from all the others on the market today!• Cavernous 4,500 cubic inches of storage• Zippered, lower-deck compartment can fit up to three compound bows and all kinds of gear, equipment or clothing.• Bag compartment lays flat when open for quick, easy access.• Heavy-duty ballistic nylon will stand up to any abuse the airline handlers can hand out.• Six exterior pockets leave plenty of room for small items, necessities.• In-line skate wheels make it easy to pull across parking lots, gravel and through airport terminals.• Will stand upright on bottom foot and wheels when not moving.• High impact plastic protects the wheels and bottom of the duffle.• Sturdy side carry handle and shoulder strap come in handy for lifting and carrying.• Comes in Advantage Max-1HD camo or Black.• Weight is 12 lbs• Dimensions of 38” x 18” x 11”."

It's a single stack (8+1) 9mm with an aluminum frame and an absolutely phenomenal trigger and super short reset. S&W is the king of out of box triggers with these things.It's a decent amount of carry wear (mostly the edges of the left side) from whoever was carrying it, probably without a holster. I completely detail stipped it down to the springs, soaked everything in CLP and put it back together. I also replaced the grips with brand new factory ones because the old ones were pretty dinged up. You can see all of it in the pictures, but feel free to request more close up pictures if you need to. It functions absolutely perfectly, and is a great range/carry gun that won't ever let you down.I'm asking $400 FIRM for this. Is an amazing deal, they usually sell for much more.No trades.Price is listed low to reflect the light finish wear and the fact it's the holidays so people are short on cash. I will NOT be dropping the price on this one, I'd rather let it sit for sale for 2 years than sell it for any less. At this price, I'm already losing money on it and it's much cheaper than they usually go for.Comes with a plastic Plano box (not factory) and one magazine. Located in Northville. Willing to travel but nothing too crazy. FTF only, must be 18+ with a purchase permit or CPL. Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

In profile and general dimensions, this Henry offerings are essentially the same as their blued steel counterparts, with 20” round barrel and 5-shot magazine capacity with the same adjustable buckhorn/bead sights. Like the blued rifles, the All-Weathers also wear the same wrist profiles- straight in the .30-30. The major differences lie in the first time we’ve used hard chrome plating on all metal surfaces (except springs and sights), and a durable industrial-grade coating on hardwood furniture. In a tough world where a working rifle might be “rode hard and put away wet”, this is the finish you want on it. A very strong plating permanently bonded to the steel underneath, hard chrome doesn’t flake, chip, or peel, and its corrosion resistance is actually stronger than some stainless steels. The treatment we use increases surface hardness, reduces friction on moving parts, doesn’t normally scuff or scratch, and leaves a low-gloss look that won’t spook game. The furniture is another departure for us; we’ve based a good part of our reputation on our select American walnut over the years, but here we’ve opted for a stained hardwood with a carefully-selected coating that’s formulated to stand up to wear, tear, scratches, moisture, temperature variations, and the angst of the various “character marks” an everyday outdoor tool inevitably picks up during its lifetime. If you want beauty, we’ve got it. If you want a more subdued partner you can depend on to ride any trail with, any time, any season, and in any weather, we do that too.

It is chambered to fire 223 or 5.56 rifle cartridges in the top barrel while loaded & ready to fire a 3"" Magnum 12 Gauge shell from the bottom barrel.  It has a single trigger and single hammer with a selector switch on the hammer to choose which barrel you want to fire.  You can change your mind and flip the switch at any point from before you cock the hammer to just before you pull the trigger while the hammer is already cocked.  It has a black synthetic stock and is in excellent to like new condition.  The gun hasn't had more than a dozen rounds fired from either barrel and has lived in my safe since new.  I even still have the original box and papers to go with it.  This would make an excellent addition or capper to any gun collection, and chances are that it shoots 2 calibers that you already have guns for.  I guaranty that this would make the most unexpected and exciting Christmas gift to any gun enthusiast or collector who has just all they thought they needed or everything they could have.  I would make a safe bet that they have one of these, or maybe never even heard of them.  I am pricing it high as I am pricing it for what I think it is worth to me as well as close to what u have seen the last few of these sell for.  However, I am also realistic and don't expect to get what I am asking, so DO NOT hesitate  to make any offer. The worst that can happen is I say no or make a counter offer.   I also have way too much ammunition for most common calibers that I am liquidating and will be posting that I will be selling for retail store prices, non of the ridiculous gouging that has gone on for a decade.  So feel free to inquire about any ammunition even if you have no interest in the gun."
