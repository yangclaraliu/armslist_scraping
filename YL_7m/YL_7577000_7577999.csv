For a factory rifle this is very accurate, will consistently group 1 MOA or better, so I was very impressed with this Savage rifle, decided to do a custom long range rifle build and so this rifle will help me fund that project. This rifle is ready to go and can reach out to 1000 yards no problem, all you need is some good glass. The rifle has an integrated 20 MOA base, which is a nice factory standard and an added muzzle brake to mitigate muzzle rise and recoil. Will ship to your FFL  for $20 if you can't meet locally. Asking $700."

We can purchase your gun or gun collection as well as accept it for trade-in. We pay cash on the spot, and legally remove guns from your name, ensuring for a legal and hassle-free transfer.   Appraisals Hyatt Guns provides firearm appraisal services both at the shop and at off-site locations depending on individual circumstances. The appraisals may be utilized for insurance purposes, sales, estate settlements, and as a general guide for private transactions. A fee is charged for this service and the amount charged will vary depending on the level of service required. Discretion is assured at all off-site locations. Certain firearms may require specialized equipment or lighting in order to complete an accurate appraisal. These firearms may need to be evaluated at the Hyatt Guns store location. Storage is also available upon request.   Appraisals are conducted by trained personnel with considerable experience in their field and in all levels of firearms. In many instances the original owner of the firearm(s) may have had extensive knowledge of the collection and a surviving partner may need assistance in obtaining realistic values by professionals with no personal interest in the firearms. This information can be valuable when interacting with relatives, potential buyers, attorneys and executors. The information available isn’t limited to value as there are numerous laws pertaining to the transfer of firearms which may be addressed by the appraiser.   Purchase Options Should Hyatt Guns assist with the purchase of the firearms, there are options available. Auction is a great way to ensure that the highest value is obtained for the firearms. Competitive bidding will increase the amount paid for individual firearms. All recommended photographs, firearms descriptions, and Internet listings are completed by professionals. All storage, packaging, and shipping is handled by Hyatt staff. A consignment fee based on the selling price of the item(s) is charged to compensate for these services as well as the research needed to determine the minimum bid, gunsmith services to assure functional and appearance needs, and compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations. This also covers credit card fees and collection of payment from buyers across the United States. Retention of sales records and documentation is completed by Hyatt Guns. Due to the interstate nature of some sales and the bidding process, it may take several weeks to complete sales and deliver payment to the sellers.   Purchase by Hyatt Guns is also an option. Individual firearms or entire collections may be purchased if immediate payment is desired. Many of the same issues and services are required for immediate sales. A percentage of the determined value is retained by Hyatt Guns as payment for the firearms. This percentage is determined and agreed upon prior to the final sale. All documentation is processed by Hyatt Staff for a worry free transaction. Should you have any questions or concerns, please contact Hyatt Guns."

No replaced wood, no buttpad installed, no roached out bore, no cracks in the stock, has original sights, very nice dark blue on barrel and receiver with light fading in the front underside of the receiver and rear sight only as that is where a hand would hold the rifle while in the field (no sling was on this one). There is a small mark on the barrel about a foot back from the muzzle thats a small scratch in the metal..doesnt really stand out as the original deep blue is still glossy and dark (last photo though it is really minor). That list of flaws it DOES NOT have was made from many other recent listings as a large percentage of 96 year old guns will have those issues, so finding an all original with original sights and buttplate, that has a great bore and very nice finish is not that easy....at this price level of course. For a few hundred more there are some super nice ones around. This is an all original rifle made in December of 1922 and according to the stamps, in October 1942 it was sent to Remington for a repair. I took the entire gun apart as I do with any very old one as I usually find decades of crud, but this one was darn clean. It has been cleaned and properly lubed and the pump racks fast and smooth. I included photos of the bore as it looks shiny and great, especially considering that I just ran some paper patches through it..and thats all. This one is in 30 Remington which is the easiest to find except the 35. If you load, it is the same as the 30-30 without the rim, same dimensions and load data. The earliest test examples in 1908 were made with standard 30-30 but the rims caused issues. This model was made from 1913 to 1934 and became the 141 after that with changes to the sight only from what I can tell. If you are a collector, love old rifles like I do, are a pump rifle fan or want something cool and classic for deer...this would be the one to get. You can get nicer ones that you only look at for a lot more, or for this price, you can get a looker and a shooter thats at the top in finish and bore. This is a take-down rifle that can fit into a backpack in under a minute and it will ship in its 2 pieces for a shorter box. SHIPPING-- Ships Fedex Ground to your FFL for $36 and it will come from an individual so make sure your FFL is okay with that. It will be wrapped and packaged very well to arrive exactly as it sits here. For Paypal, contact me first as the address is different. 20 MORE PHOTOS AVAILABLE"

This has been a fantasitc carry gun for me since I bought it when they were first introduced to the market. I am the first owner, and I still have all the original paperwork, box, etc. It has had about 500 rounds of only factory, off the shelf ammunition (no reloads) fired through it. Comes with one 6 round and one 7 round magazine ( as sold from S&W), comes with one additional 7 round magazine, Alien Gear holster, which I also have all the original paperwork and equipment for (holster spacers, allen tool, extra screws, etc.). Will also come with a kydex trigger gaurd which is nice for the glovebox, conceal carry shirts, diaper bag, etc., and a leather outside the wasteband belt holster with snap button retention for a right handed shooter. This is not on of those cheap fake leather holsters you can find on amazon or ebay. It is a very nice form fit, thick leather holster that cost me $75. This Shield needs nothing except for a hip to be carried on. Shoots flawless and for a smaller frame 45 has very managable recoil. Asking $500 which I feel is very fair considering it comes with one extra magazine, 2 holsters, and a trigger gaurd, however I will entertain REASONABLE offers. I wouldn't waste your time, so please dont waste mine.Only reason for the sale is I have a new little addition to the family and could use the money in the savings account.Bill of sale and personal information WILL be exchanged at time of sale, if you have a problem with this, please do not contact me.

These are true Mil-Spec...no junk. They are made from 7075 -T6 aluminum and have a Type III Mil-Spec hard coating. They are compatible with any butt stock that fits a standard AR-15.Â  The rear 2"" of the tube are solid and add a small amount of weight to the rear of the weapon for better balance.Â  They use standard buffers and springs. No other parts are needed. They have Mil-Spec rolled threads...not machined.. which is much stronger. These were designed for a longer length of pull for tall or long armed shooters. They still collapse to a short length. ( but 2"" longer than a standard stock will collapse) These particular tubes are what I have left. They may have handling or ""rub"" marks. No damage. Wipe them down with WD-40 or oil and they will look new. These were built to the high end of Mil-Spec standard measurements for a good fit. No wobbly buttstock.. They have three drain holes in the adjuster slot. At least two will always be exposed for draining or air compression ""bleed"". They are 5 position just as the originals. I also have 1 ( one ) full polished tube without the hard coat. Could be used for a ""show"" piece. Message me if you're interested in that.....The others have two layers of hard coat. Gray coating was not applied to the main threads to protect them from the blasting process and to maintain proper thread dimensions.  I realize these are not cheap. They were not cheaply built.  You get what you pay for.  Made in the good 'ol USA."
