As an added bonus the muzzle brake is removed so you won't need to contend with the heart stopping back blast of a ported 500, which is akin to a quarter stick of dynamite going off in your face. Should you be a fan of the 500 S&W and it's power and cost (financially and physically) the John Ross edition is the one for you, and everything else is just a distant second place.

The John Ross edition is the 500 S&W Magnum as it was meant to be, with a twist rate and barrel cylinder gap that can get the best performance out of the heaviest bullets of the caliber. As an added bonus the muzzle brake is removed so you won't need to contend with the heart stopping back blast of a ported 500, which is akin to a quarter stick of dynamite going off in your face. Should you be a fan of the 500 S&W and it's power and cost (financially and physically) the John Ross edition is the one for you, and everything else is just a distant second place. For the deep pocket collectors, matching numbered pairs of Stainless and Blackened Stainless are available. If PayPal is used for purchase, buyer must add ANY fees to the total final price.

Both of these items are usually sold out and hard to come by. I paid over $450 for the pair and literally fired 40 rounds through the gun before deciding I no longer plan to suppress the rifle. My loss is your gain. Asking $300 for the pair. JP kit comes in factory box. Would consider partial trade for like new hard chrome or NIB-X type complete BCG.

This rifle is in overall good condition. Dents and dings along the stock commensurate with age, the bluing is in good shape, I would rate the bore as Fair-Good. It had strong lands and grooves with slight rounding of the lands and frosting in the grooves. I am considering this a non matching example. The bolt and barrel match but the reciever does not match those two and is only off by one number. Maybe a factory error but who knows. There are other different numbers on the stock and handguard. This rifle is updated to the 8x56R caliber
I also have 100 rounds of 1938 produced 8x56R ammunition on the clips.

This is the up grade and super tough HELL'S CANYON Edition rifle, super nice!!! This gun has a detachable mag that I believe holds 4 rounds. THIS GUN IS LIKE NEW BUT I WILL CALL IT USED SINCE IT WAS OWNED BY ONE OF MY GOOD CUSTOMERS. He never sot the rifle. The rifle will come with a scope rail already installed and that saves you a couple bucks! Here is some information that I found on the Hell's Canyon Rifle: The best factory bolt-action hunting rifle just got better. The X-Bolt Hell's Canyon Speed rifle is built to exceed your accuracy expectations, straight from the box. The action and stiff, fluted barrel are bedded and free floated to ensure straight shooting. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and is easily removed and replaced with a thread protector that is included in the box with this rifle. In place of traditional bluing, a Cerakote Burnt Bronze finish was chosen. Not only does it look great, the flat finish aids in concealment. Cerakote is also tougher than other firearm finishes to keep this rifle looking its best for years to come. Very light to carry yet with heavyweight performance. The lightweight composite stock makes this rifle easy to carry; and the A-TACS AU camo is versatile enough to blend into nearly every background. An Inflex recoil pad tames the recoil of even the most savage magnums by redirecting recoil down and away from your cheek. The features just keep coming. The RECEIVER is Steel and has Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish; Glass bedded; Drilled and tapped for scope mounts. The BARREL is a Heavy Sporter with deep fluting and the barrel has the same Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish. The barrel is Free-floating and Hand chambered and has a Target Crown. The Bolt-action has a 60° bolt lift. Adjustable Feather Trigger and Detachable Rotary magazine. Top-tang safety for easy on/off use and a Bolt Unlock Button. Composite Textured gripping surfaces and Right-hand palm swell and can insure shipment on request for $50."

The X-Bolt Hell's Canyon Speed rifle is built to exceed your accuracy expectations, straight from the box. The action and stiff, fluted barrel are bedded and free floated to ensure straight shooting. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and is easily removed and replaced with a thread protector that is included in the box with this rifle. In place of traditional bluing, a Cerakote Burnt Bronze finish was chosen. Not only does it look great, the flat finish aids in concealment. Cerakote is also tougher than other firearm finishes to keep this rifle looking its best for years to come. Very light to carry yet with heavyweight performance. The lightweight composite stock makes this rifle easy to carry; and the A-TACS AU camo is versatile enough to blend into nearly every background. An Inflex recoil pad tames the recoil of even the most savage magnums by redirecting recoil down and away from your cheek. The features just keep coming. The RECEIVER is Steel and has Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish; Glass bedded; Drilled and tapped for scope mounts. The BARREL is a Heavy Sporter with deep fluting and the barrel has the same Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish. The barrel is Free-floating and Hand chambered and has a Target Crown.

In place of traditional bluing, a Cerakote Burnt Bronze finish was chosen. Not only does it look great, the flat finish aids in concealment. Cerakote is also tougher than other firearm finishes to keep this rifle looking its best for years to come. Very light to carry yet with heavyweight performance. The lightweight composite stock makes this rifle easy to carry; and the A-TACS AU camo is versatile enough to blend into nearly every background. An Inflex recoil pad tames the recoil of even the most savage magnums by redirecting recoil down and away from your cheek. The features just keep coming. The RECEIVER is Steel and has Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish; Glass bedded; Drilled and tapped for scope mounts. The BARREL is a Heavy Sporter with deep fluting and the barrel has the same Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish. The barrel is Free-floating and Hand chambered and has a Target Crown. The Bolt-action has a 60° bolt lift. Adjustable Feather Trigger and Detachable Rotary magazine. Top-tang safety for easy on/off use and a Bolt Unlock Button. Composite Textured gripping surfaces and Right-hand palm swell and can insure shipment on request for $50."

This is an amazing pistol. The Type M is hard enough to find as it is, but this one had a trigger job done by Wilson Combat at the request of the prior owner. No paperwork can back this claim up, but the trigger pull itself is something heavenly indeed! This is the lightest, smoothest DA/SA trigger I've ever had the pleasure to experience, bar none. I don't have a trigger pull gauge, but I'd be surprised if the DA weight was more than 8lb. It does show signs of minor wear and use (light finish wear near the muzzle, etc.), but a simple refinish would have it looking new again, though the wear is far from severe (I'd just leave it and let it have some light character). Includes a set of wood grips (the left side is chipped near the hammer pin head), factory plastic grips, and TWO magazines (valued at about $70/ea). For this rare treasure, I'm asking $725 FTF.I'll ship on the buyer's dime.Local buyers must show an AZDL and CCW or bill of sale required. Any questions, just ask. Thanks!"

Media in the tumbler looks brand new. I have a Maraksberg and a Midway tumbler and if you would prefer one of those instead I am willing to swap.  This is a good deal if you want a progressive press. If you want to complete the kit it will need the case feeder, a nut for the powder measure, and a chain for the powder measure along with a Primer attachment. All of that will run you a total of about $25. So you spend 175 total and have the press, cases, lead, a tumbler, and boxes to hold your reloads (another $75 worth of stuff).

I have tried it a few times. It hides the gun very well in the 4-5 o'clock position. I find I prefer 2-3 o'clock, which does not work well with this holster. I will sell it for $50. Add $10 if it must be mailed. This holster works just as well without a laser on the pistol."
