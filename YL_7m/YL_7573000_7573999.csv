Designed with serious 3-D archers, precision 50metre rounds and field archers in mind the Pro Edge Elite has speed, performance and forgiveness all on the archers side. At 321 feet per second ATA rating with a 7"" brace height the Pro Edge Elite balances speed with extreme accuracy and forgiveness.
The Hoyt Pro Edge has an all new next generation Shoot Through TEC riser design which is wider creating a more stable shooting platform while enabling more room for arrow rest movement, tuning and more vane clearance. The grip location allows equal pressure on the arrow nock giving you improved accuracy in aiming and optimizing fine tuning.
Vibration and hand shock is non-existent with the Pro Edge Elite as it utilises the Air Shox limb dampening technology, Shock Rod Technology and XT Comp parallel limbs creating a shock and vibration free shot allowing for ultimate consistency.
The Hoyt Pro Edge Elite is powered by the Z5 Cam and Half system which is extremely smooth, easy to tune and rock solid at the back wall. To balance the Pro Edge Elite shooters can take advantage of the lower rear facing stabiliser mount for an extremely low centre of gravity, or a more traditional feel by mounting stabilisers and side rods directly below the grip.
With a range of great looking camo finishes, the 2014 Hoyt Pro Edge Elite looks like a trophy and tournament winning machine; the proof isn't how it looks, but the medals that are hanging up next to it.This bow comes with everything you need for competition shooting; sights, balance limbs, weights, arrows & case. Detailed item descriptions available for anyone serious about this bow. I have two Hoyt bows, one for hunting (Charger) and one for 3-D and indoors (Pro Edge Elite). I've recently gotten into duck hunting so the wife wants me to trade in some of my archery gear before getting another shotgun!"

Stock appears to be inletted for a scout scope, but I have not installed a mount for it. Shoots very well and is very accurate with Sellier & Bellot .303 ammo. Not so accurate with other brands that use boattail bullets (this is common with Enfields, they were designed for a flat-base bullet). The action is very smooth. Would be a great deer rifle as-is or with the addition of a scope. The magazine has been modified with a flush base and 5rd capacity for legal deer hunting. I will include an additional 10rd repro magazine that looks more original. These were individually fitted to each gun, so you might have to adjust the feed lips slightly on the repro mag for best function. I can meet at my work most weekdays 9-5.

This is a all original Beretta Brigadie Elite I. This is the original Elite I, not the IA so it has the silver barrel as well as the niced Brigadier slide. This is a rare gun manufactured from 1999-2001. Most of these were .40 but this is the more rare 9mm. This is a collector piece and will only appreciate if kept in this condition. Has both original mags included and one 15 round extra mag. Original box/case is here too. Also included is a set of LPA adjustable sights, brand new, still in the package, never installed. I iwll add more pics at a later time. These pistols are very hard to find and this one is in excellent condition. The gun shop down the street graded it as 90-95%. Has Hogue replacement panels, but the original Beretta grips will also come with it. Would prefer a local buyer, but open to discussion. Buyer must be legal to puchase and be willing to transfer at a local gun shop. Thanks for looking and feel free to message with questions. Price lowered to $850 OBO."

Since then, they have been nested together in a cardboard box, doing nothing. I have been the only owner. I was pleased to discover, upon purchase and receipt, that each magazine comes in a thin layer of light oil, wrapped in plastic, and then placed into yet another, larger layer of plastic that bears barcode labeling and hole for hanging on store shelving. Thus, they stored fabulously and rust/corrosion has not been a concern. Condition: ""like new"" to ""new in plastic"". Caveat: as likely discernible in my photos, there are some spots of wear/abrasion to the thin plastic packaging from shipping.I purchased these back when I was convinced that somebody who wanted to trample fun and freedom was going to get elected for 2017 and my few favorite toys were going to become very challenging to get supplies for. Whoops, more battle rattle sitting around than I really want now.Let my mistake be your gain.At the time of this posting (13 November 2017), Aimsurplus.com, PalmettoStateArmory.com, and 44mag.com are all out of stock for these; natchezss.com wants $40.99 for an 8 Round OEM Sig P220 magazine, and sigsauer.com wants $44 for either an 8 Round or 10 round OEM Sig P220 magazine!I'll sell mine for $30 per, such that you can get Sig OEM magazines at around Glock prices.Of these 8 round magazines, I have 4 in this condition for sale. (I've got the 10 round magazines in a separate listing).I'll exchange for cash. No personal identification necessary for this item. Will exchange with buyer at the ""craigslist parking"" area of Greer Police Department at 103 West Poinsett St in Greer, SC.    And I am willing to ship this item, but don't see where to check such a box for the listing to not say, ""shipping: No"" .   I would receive and cash USPS money order before getting it well padded and boxed and shipping it out via USPS. And buyer would need to pay for shipping.I will not ship magazines to California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or New York."

Since then, they have been nested together in a cardboard box, doing nothing. I have been the only owner. I was pleased to discover, upon purchase and receipt, that each magazine comes in a thin layer of light oil, wrapped in plastic, and then placed into yet another, larger layer of plastic that bears barcode labeling and hole for hanging on store shelving. Thus, they stored fabulously and rust/corrosion has not been a concern. Condition: ""like new"" to ""new in plastic"". Caveat: as likely discernible in my photos, there are some spots of wear/abrasion to the thin plastic packaging from shipping.I purchased these back when I was convinced that somebody who wanted to trample fun and freedom was going to get elected for 2017 and my few favorite toys were going to become very challenging to get supplies for. Whoops, more battle rattle sitting around than I really want now.Let my mistake be your gain.At the time of this posting (13 November 2017), Aimsurplus.com, PalmettoStateArmory.com, and 44mag.com are all out of stock for these; natchezss.com wants $40.99 for an 8 Round OEM Sig P220 magazine, and sigsauer.com wants $44 for either an 8 Round or 10 round OEM Sig P220 magazine!I'll sell mine for $30 per, such that you can get Sig OEM magazines at around Glock prices.Of these 10 round magazines, I have 9 in this condition for sale.
