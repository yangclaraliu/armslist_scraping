WaltThe streamline, lightweight, no-snag design of the Smith & Wesson® Model 642 Airweight® makes it an ideal concealed carry double-action revolver. The internal hammer of the 642 eliminates the risk of the hammer getting snagged on clothing, holsters, or purses when drawing the weapon in a self-defense situation. The low profile, ramp front sight and the fixed notch rear sight also aid in snag-free presentation of the weapon. The 642 is double-action only, making it an extremely fast personal-defensive handgun to deploy in stressful situations, as there is nothing to remember to do except point and pull the trigger. The synthetic grips and inherently ergonomic design afford natural pointability. The Model 642 is built on Smith & Wesson's famous J-Frame, it has a 5-shot cylinder rated for +P .38 Special ammunition. Stainless steel and alloy construction resist corrosion caused by humidity and perspiration when the revolver is carried close to the body. The Smith & Wesson 642 Airweight Double-Action Revolver carries easily, deploys rapidly, and has enough firepower to handle any self-defense scenario. Made in USA.<br>* No-snag, concealed carry design* Internal hammer, double-action only* Stainless steel and alloy construction* Ramp front sight and fixed rear sight* Black synthetic grips* 5-shot, +P rated"

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.The Colt Sistema was produced by Fabrica Militar de Armas Portatiles (FMAP) in Argentina. Production began at the Esteban de Luca Arsenal in Buenos Aires, with the first pistols actually being assembled at the Domingo Matheu plant in Rosario, Argentina in 1945. It is also known as the Pistola Sistema ""Colt"" Modelo Argentino 1927, Calibre 11.25mm, which is basically a 1911 of 1927 vintage built on Colt equipment to Colt specifications."

For those that don't know this is regarded as one of the best AK ever imported into the USA. Google it... You'll find out how awesome these AKs are with the stiffer receiver and thicker barrels. They are some of the most accurate AKs ever produced. These are very hard to find since they quit importing them years ago. This one is as new as you will ever find. My dad bought this new about 20yrs ago and never shot it once. I inherited it seven years ago. I put 3 magazines through it (shoots great) with the hopes of enjoying it and keeping it. Long story short I am not an AK guy and its been sitting for the last seven years. I wanted to keep it since it was my dads and a top notch AK. At this point I rather sell it to fund an AR build in my dads memory that I'll actually take to the range and enjoy. Comes with two 30 round mags and one 10 round.  $1099 OBO"
