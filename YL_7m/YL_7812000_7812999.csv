This is a classic 1911 style handgun that was issued in the Spanish military/police force. Mechanically the gun is in great condition with excellent, smooth function and a shiny bore with no pitting. The trigger is a great single action and the safety is quite positive but not too stiff. Aesthetically it's a little worn, the finish shows significant holster wear but that's to be expected from an issued service gun and the grips are fairly worn. It comes with the original box/documents, cleaning rod/screwdriver, and two magazines. The numbers on the gun are matching. Feel free to contact me for any info or additional pictures. Price is $300 OBO."

This is an excellent gun for competition. It has an Apex tactical forward mounted flat-faced trigger installed, which has made follow up shots so much better as there is less take up and it feels lighter. It also has a DPM 3-stage recoil spring installed which has reduced the snap by at least 40%. I am including both the factory trigger and recoil spring, in case you want to revert it to factory specs. It will also come with 5 magazines which I will go into detail about: Two of the magazines are for the PPQ M2 which has the button style mag release, the other three are for M1 versions (with the paddle style), the reason for this is that the extended mags only hold (13) rounds in the M2 and (14) rounds in the M1, and (12) rounds in the flush M1 and (11) in the flush M2, so I swapped the internals of the M1's into the M2s with great success, as both hold 14 rounds with 100% reliability. With this setup, all you have to do is purchase 2 more M2 magazines to harvest the shells and you will have (5) magazines with extended M1 capacity. The gun also comes with its original box, which has the 2 other replaceable backstraps to fit your hand and a speed loader and barrel flag.

Hutch or something planned a few days out).  Not really interested in a trade, but if you have something you paid over $k for a few years back, worst I can say is ""no thanks"" ;)"

Serpa OWB holster (Paid approx. $30.00).This was my first SIG and it will most certainly not be my last. I questioned my decision to make the move on this one, as opposed to the MK25, until I fired it. Never looked back. If you are looking for a MK25, take my advice and consider this one. I was sold on this gun being the chosen issued sidearm of USN pilots. It has lived up to every expectation, if not exceeding them by a wide margin. Not a single failure to fire, or failure to feed - Which may due in part to luck, as I have shot some cheap ammo as well. In all honesty, I would prefer not to sell it, but like many others I am making an attempt to recover from Christmas. That said, I am not interested in trades and the price is firm, considering the extras included.  Can send more photos upon request. Nick Text preferred - Any time. 6one5.Six6three.9nine1one."
