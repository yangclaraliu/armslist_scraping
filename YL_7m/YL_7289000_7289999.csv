Excellent condition
Features include Marlin’s patented Pro-fire trigger system that allows the shooter to externally adjust the trigger. It has a button-rifled barrel, meaning a shaped metal button tool is passed through the barrel under high pressure in order to carve the grooves. It also has a recoil pad and pillar-bedded stock. Pillar bedded stocks use aluminum or metal sleeves against which the action screws can be tightened, providing an overall tighter fit between the stock and the action. And it has a target crown, which helps reduce vibrations in the barrel while firing a shot. The XL7 is recommended for large-game hunting.

The versatility of the G19 is further enhanced in its fifth generation while also preserving the dependability it is known for.   The G19 Gen5 features a no finger grooved, multiple backstrapped, rough textured frame with hundreds of miniature spikes which results in remarkable traction for extreme environments and gloved operators. The frame also features a smooth trigger, reversible mag release, and ambidextrous slide stop. The magazine comes with a floor plate which is extended at the front for faster magazine change, and a orange follower, while the flared mag-well makes it easier to funnel the magazine into the mag-well. Glock's nDLC finish provides a tougher, more durable protection against corrosion and scratching. The Glock Marksman barrel features a barrel rifling which delivers improved accuracy.

(32 Hornady bullets, 16 Winchester HP bullets, 20 Remington bullets, a strap, still in the box fiber optic sights, and 40 bullets that a guy made for me, but he put the wrong leads in them). I love that gun and wish I could keep it, but I am going to school and just had a baby, so I need money more than this gun. The only thing that is wrong with it is the rear sight is broken. The rear sight is still attached and is useable, but if it is bumped hard it will move. I have been able to accurately shoot it still. I feel that $700 is a very fair price.
