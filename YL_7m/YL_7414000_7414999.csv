It uses any, and all AK-47 mags. (The original Vepr's had specific low round count mags only.) Comes with the upper sighting rail ( was $120 option) for optics as in the pics (Red dot is not part of the deal at this price). It also has the side rail on receiver for adding other optics as a scope. It has a beautiful sporter wooden stock with matching forearm, that can be easily converted to a folding stock or other stock configurations, as all other AK's. I have the “slant stock adapter,” but after careful consideration, I decided not to use it, for folding stock option. I would have had to give up that beautiful stock, and not save any weight in the process. Russian Molot manufactured, and imported by FIME in Las Vegas. FIME had been importing the Arsenal rifles, they deal with quality AK's. All Vepr 7.62x39 AK variants are now banned on import to the USA. Only reason I'm selling this one, is I have two that are just alike, just different optics or sights. Can't shoot both at the same time. With a coin toss, it put this one on the selling block. The 16.5” barrel length Vepr is extremely well balanced, and shoulder's to sight level instinctively, like an extremely well balanced hunting rifle. The Vepr 7.62x39 was the base gun used in the very expensive Krebs Custom AK. I use to own the Krebs, until I got my Molot Vepr's. I have had them all including Arsenal's, and these Vepr rifles are more accurate, and higher quality in build than any other AK platform that I have seen. The Molot Vepr is made from the Russian RPK machine gun, and has the RPK-style hammer forged chrome lined barrel and the RPK-style 1.5mm heavy stamped receiver. It gives the Vepr extra strength, without the extra weight of a milled receiver. You also have to consider that it has the RPK-style reinforced trunnion block. These guns were made to shoot thousands of rounds. $1000 cash w/o the red dot or the Russian Red mag. Comes with two 20 or 30 round mags. Trade value is higher. Don't buy converted AK's (SAIGA) or lower end used up Romanian Wasp AK's, they will not have the quality, accuracy, or built in toughness or re-sale of these rifles, and you will pay as much or more for them, and very rarely will you know the person or persons that did their conversions. Russians know how to make AK's they invented them. Stick with a Russian made AK-47 or one of their variants. I have other gun's that are either NIB or LNIB in .45 acp. 40 S&W and 9 mm for sale as well, let me know what you are looking for? I have a beautiful two tone NIB and un-fired KRISS-SPHYNIX 9 mm here on armslist, with threaded barrel end for $950 if anyone is interested. I am a private gun owner, and just selling off a few, (No Fire Sale Here! But you will save some money.) I only own and have purchased quality firearms. Because of osteoarthritis many of my guns have never been fired. Better make your BUYS now, before congress shuts down private transfers of guns, through web sites like this. “It's coming.” I Will require a “Bill Of Sale” and proof of Alabama residency (AL. DL) to anyone of legal age, on all firearms that I sell."

I shot it at 1000 yards and had no issue hitting 1.5 moa. It definitely reaches out and touches your target with no problem. I just bought the new Nikon BDC P223 Drop in scope  to put on my other rifle but I can leave it on this one for the right price which it will come with ammo, magazines that have a 20 round capacity, and so forth. Fall is right around the corner and this rifle is ideal to hunt anything grazing North America/ pig, elk, deer,moose, you name it. I have always admired the 308 caliber because of its power and punch. I am looking to sell cash by tomorrow if offered the right price.

A400 Xtreme Unico Synthetic: Super-Versatile Semiauto Shotgun This black-synthetic semiauto shotgun is today’s most advanced of its kind. It reliably feeds every kind of 12-gauge shell from steel to lead, from 2 ¾” to 3 ½” and from 24 to 64 grams. It is capable of firing 4 shots in less than one second, and it is extremely soft-recoiling and pleasant to shoot, no matter the type of shell or the length of your hunting or sporting day. Also, it is impeccably balanced and follows your eye naturally to that fast-moving pheasant or clay target, while being quick and easy to field strip and maintain after a long day in the field. Ideal for upland or waterfowl hunting as well as target shooting, the A400 Xtreme Unico Synthetic is the perfect choice for the shotgunner looking for durability as well as versatility.
1. Adjustable Shim The adjustable shim system at the buttpad make it easy to customize length of pull, drop and cast to suit your size and shooting style.
2. Anti Corrosion The barrel features a corrosion-resistant finish that will save you the worry of constant cleanings while in the field.
3. Blink Gas System When a swarm of birds is flying fast above you, there's no time for hesitation--neither on your part, nor on your shotgun's. Thanks to Blink technology, the A400 action is capable of firing 4 shots in less than one second, making you faster and more successful than any of your hunting buddies.
4. B-Lock The new fore-end cap offers a safe and fast locking system that makes it easier to assemble and disassemble your shotgun. The cap is closed simply with a 60° rotation and a “click.”
5. Kick Off 3 Laboratory tests have shown two distinct peaks in recoil. The explosion of the ammunition is the first; the impact of the bolt against the receiver is the second. Kick-Off 3 is a third hydraulic damper that cushions this stress on the mechanical components and further reduces recoil by an additional 10% for a total recoil reduction of 70%.
6. Kick Off Mega The new Kick-Off Mega reduces recoil 60% more than any other shotgun of its kind on the market, and provides comfort because the stock area that makes contact with the face remains stationary. Kick-Off Mega is integral to the design of Beretta's A400 Xtreme and comes standard on all models--together with Kick-Off 3, for a combined 70% recoil reduction.
7. Micro Core Recoil Pad The Micro Core buttpad is designed to do two primary things. First, to reduce recoil as much as possible, so that even a long session at the range will not tire you and leave you sore. Secondly, and thanks to the type of polymer of which it is constructed, it is engineered to flow smoothly to your shoulder without snagging or catching as many rubber buttpads do.
8. Optima Bore HP Optima-Bore HP choke geometry was conceived to offer the best ballistic performance available, with steel or lead shot. Thanks to its design, shot pattern remains perfectly uniform whatever the shell size or load, giving you consistency and accuracy on the hunt. Optima-Bore HP choke tubes further enhance the effect.
9. Steelium Steelium is a proprietary tri-alloy blend that Beretta uses for barrels. Among the many benefits it offers is a combination between lightness and exceptional resistance to shock and deformation. For the hunter, this means absolute shot consistency (steel or lead), accuracy and a shotgun that will give you several lifetimes of enjoyment
10. Unico The Unico system is designed to give hunters unprecedented versatility. You can reliably feed any type of 12-gauge shell—lead or steel, mild 2 ¾” to hard-hitting 3 ½” magnums."

This shotgun comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It has only minor signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was well taken care of, and only rarely fired, despite having been previously owned. There are no major flaws/defects to be found anywhere on this shotgun, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, staining, or rusting. There is some very minor discoloration on the receiver, but that is it! The black synthetic stock, and forearm are in great shape, as is the shotgun's receiver, and barrel. This shotgun featues a Hard Rubber butt stock imprinted with the ""Mossberg"" brand name, as well as featuring a safety switch set on top of the shotgun's receiver, and a nice 28-inch long Vented and Ribbed Barrel topped with a bead sight at the end. This is a fantastic shotgun, that would make a wonderful addition to anybody's collection. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this firearm, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."
