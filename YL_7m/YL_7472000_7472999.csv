However, I put quite a bit of research into this firearm to make it just a bit better than stock. (in my opinion) While you wouldn't catch me complaining about a stock Glock, there were just a few options out there to turn it into a tight shooter.  As with any Glock, bobbles are nearly non-existent and it has fired consistently anything I have put through it. After the upgrades it went from Baby Glock .. to awesome Baby Glock .. tight in the hand and a great smooth trigger with that great Glock reset.This is the perfect CCW package.

Included is a Beretta branded OWB thumb-break holster, a custom IWB holster by Kramer Leather, 3 extra magazines (4 total), a set of Altamont Rosewood grips, and the factory Trident Lasergrips. As Beretta fans might know, for a few weeks in 2004, a very short production run of the lasergrips sold with the 92FS carried the Beretta Trident logo. All other lasergrips since are marked with the Crimson Trace logo. I put the trade value at $1,300, including the lasergrips, or $850 without (I know, but try finding another set online). I'm more interested in trade, however. I'm currently interested in S&W revolvers, CZ pistols, and some pistol-caliber carbines, but I like all kinds of stuff and I'll respond to any reasonable offers. I can travel to FFL's from Mount vernon to Everett for serious offers. Will split the cost of FFL transfer. Buyer must be in posession of valid CPL."

I bought this from cheaper than dirt for $340 plus tax in 2012 (still have receipt). I had a gun smith change out the buffer tube to a BCM ($46.90) and still have receipt. I changed it out due to the fact that the original buffer tube was not smooth inside causing the spring to make excessive noise. I have the old buffer tube to show you the difference. I added a magpul MOE+ grip as well (roughly an additional $25). Lower is in perfect condition. I have $439.95 in this lower and I'm asking $300. Please note you must must have a valid TX DL.

579,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7472579,For Sale:  WWII BSA Boys Anti-Tank Rifle Converted to .50 BMG,"virginia, Virginia, United States","$ 3,500","Listed On: Thursday, October 19, 2017",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This is an excellent example of a re-barreled WWII MK1 British Boys anti-tank rifle as manufactured by the British, BSA Manufacturing Company that was subsequently re-barreled to 50 BMG making it legal to own, transfer and shoot! These rifles were originally developed by Captain H.C. Boys as the Stanchion Rifle, as a man-portable, .55 caliber shoulder fired anti-tank gun. In 1937 just prior to his death, these weapons were officially adopted by Great Britain and renamed as the ""Boys Anti-Tank rifle"" in honor of his technical accomplishments and contributions in his service to the King and country. These weapons were used throughout WWII in all the major battlefields in North Africa, Italy, and throughout Europe and into Korea. Although tank armor continued to improve and eventually made this weapon obsolete as an anti-tank weapon it continued to be used against soft target and was eventually re-barreled into a 50 cal weapon and was then used as the fore runner of the long range sniper rifle in the mid to late 1950s. It has an alloy trigger housing and rear grip assembly with a wood pistol grip (with a chip missing, see photos), to help reduce the overall weight of the weapon. The actual barreled receiver of the rifle is fairly unique for pre-war standards in that the weapon actually slides forward and backwards in a frame assembly during firing, and is equipped with a small hydraulic buffer on the rear of the action to help absorb the punishing recoil of the 50 BMG. The weapon has a standard bolt action mechanism that feeds from a Bren-style, top mounted box magazine,that holds 5-rounds and is located on top of the action. It has the standard blade and peep, front and rear sights correctly off-set on the left side (to be able to see around the box magazine). The 50 cal barrel is fitted a 5-ported, square profile, “harmonica style” muzzle brake on the end. It is complete with a folding Bren-style bipod and one box magazine, wooden cheekpiece and replacement foam shoulder/recoil pad.  Weighs 38 LBS unloaded, and is 5 Feet 2 Inches in length. Rifle had a small crack at the rear of the receiver that was repaired and it has been test fired 12 times and was found to be fully operational.  Excellent as re-barreled with honest wear to the finish. The action is complete and functions correctly."

For sale, package deal. No trades. Low round count. Practically cherry.  This package is for those who want it all, and right now. Use it stock military issue with front iron sight, the MOE popup rear sight, & all the MOE furniture, in desert sand: pistol grip, fore grip, stock, and vertical front grip, for simplistic carry/ sighting/ flash-protected fire.  Stretch out your reach, add the Sightmark green laser, shines effectively to true shot 50+ yards. Visible in daylight — they claim you can see it for a mile at night (not quite, but, very visible laser sight). If you decide that the flash-protected shot will be the first light out of the barrel, for first covert shot, add the 45 degree off-set iron sights.  You can just turn your rifle on it’s side, make your shot through the iron sights.  Want more range without losing either the green laser or the iron sights?  Add the Bushnell 4-18x50 AR/223 scope on top.  Sight the scope in quickly with the red laser boresight (I did it in about 3 rounds.)  Want support under your rifle? Swap out the vertical grip, mount the bipod.  Sit at a table or lie down in the grass, to comfortably deploy the “reach out and touch someone” design features of this Colt, for distance excellence using .223 or 5.56 ammo.  All the possible combinations for near, tactical shooting, and for far, strategic shooting.  This is the quality rifle.  Use the addons of everything, or use it with the simple factory military spec standard equipment, or any combo you wish.  Your call.

Brand new in the box with two 30 round H&K mags. Note, that the box is marked 10rd, but they are 30 round magazines. Part no. M750900-A5Details:Available July 2016 – The new SP5K was developed by Heckler & Koch as a semiautomatic, civilian sporting pistol (hence the “SP” prefix) that matches the look and feel of the famous MP5K submachine gun.  The SP5K is designed and manufactured to meet the definition of a civilian pistol and marks the return of the roller delayed blowback system to an HK commercial product. This operating system is legendary in its accuracy and reliability. Originally developed on the Heckler & Koch G3 rifle, it has been used on several HK firearms.  The SP5K retains many of the critical features of the MP5, including its precision machined components and attention-to-detail quality. The SP5K is manufactured completely in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany.  The SP5K is a safe, robust, ergonomic large frame handgun. For more comfortable shooting, the SP5K is equipped with an elastic “bungee” sling. The sling is easily installed by snapping it onto the sling swivel hardware located on the rear of the receiver. Using the sling makes firing the SP5K more stable and reduces fatigue.   The overall length of the SP5K is approximately 14 inches — slightly longer than an MP5K — due to its unique handguard. The SP5K hand guard is designed with special ergonomic and safety features to protect the shooter’s hand and provide a comfortable and stable grip. Despite its size, the SP5K is well suited for sporting use. Using the proven roller delayed blowback system; the SP5K’s inherent accuracy makes it an excellent choice for target shooting and an ideal home security arm.  And a wide variety of accessories can be added to increase its functionality. A Picatinny rail scope mount is attached to the upper receiver and allows for optional sights to be easily mounted. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK SP5K is a faithful rendering of the iconic MP5K as a semi automatic pistol.Flat rate 2nd Day Air Shipping of $25.
