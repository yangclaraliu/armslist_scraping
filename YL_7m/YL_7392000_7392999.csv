I'm putting up for trade my hard to find Glock 30S handgun. These handguns were only produced in the Gen. 3 format. This handgun was purchased two years ago and has exactly 330 rounds of brass Perfecta ammunition put through it along with approximately 10-15 rounds of PDX1 Defender. It  was purchased for concealed carry purposes and was carried for one Winter. After being carried for said Winter, it sat in a foam padded Gunvault SV500 Speedvault; as I had purchased another carry handgun. It was only taken out every now and then to put a box of .45 ACP through. There were 8 boxes of ammunition purchased for this handgun and I will include the remaining 70 rounds of ammo along with all remaining PDX1 Defender rounds. Never had a single hangup and it was cleaned after every 50 rounds. The only reason I am considering a trade with this firearm is because I am consolidating ammunition and this is the only firearm I own in .45 ACP.In a potential trade, you will be receiving the Glock 30S, two 10 round magazines, 70 rounds of brass ammunition, a full box (and then some) .45 ACP PDX1 Defender rounds, the SHTF Gear IWB Holster and the Kydex IWB Holster. The Glock 30S will also include the case, nylon brush, etc. It also has Talon Grips installed and ready to go.I am solely interested in trades, particularly any full size handgun that is in 9mm. If you have an offer that isn't a handgun or listed below, absolutely feel free to send it to me. The worst I will do is decline. Also, all outdoor pictures were taken just minutes ago today. If you would like more photographs, let me know.Technical Information I pulled from the web:My Glock 30SCal: .45 ACP MSRP: $579.00 Capacity: 10+1 Barrell Length: 3.78"" Overall Length: 6.89"" Height: 4.8"" Width: 1.28"" Weight: 20.28 ozI am quick to respond, easy to work with and can spell correctly.

This cutting edge red dot has a host of features, from enhanced lens coatings that radically improve the shape and clarity of the 2MOA dot to a heavily ruggedized housing for even greater protection. The combination of advanced optical lenses and lens coatings reflect the dot's selected frequency of red light at nearly 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy, while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass through with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible, allowing for use with all generations of night vision, as well as improved clarity when coupled with a magnifier! Last but not least, Aimpoint has added flip-up front and rear lens covers to the optic to protect the lenses from nearly any weather conditions you may encounter in the field or on the range. Features: - Advanced optical lenses for even better light transmission - Front Flip-up lens cover is included - Transparent rear Flip-up lens cover is included - Reinforced protection of the turrets for even greater ruggedness - Ideal for rifles, carbines, shotguns, submachine guns, and handguns - Weight 3.7 oz. including mount, sight only 3.0 oz. - 1X (non-magnifying) parallax free optic - Compatible will all generations of Night Vision Devices (NVD) - 1 Off position, 4 night vision compatible settings and 8 daylight settings - one extra bright for use with laser protection glasses or in bright desert sunlight - Integral Picatinny-style base allows easy attachment to any rail - ACET technology allows 50,000 hours (over 5 years) of constant operation with one battery - Hard anodized non-reflective finish - Submersible to 80 feet (25 meters) - Use as a standalone sight or piggybacked on larger magnifying, thermal, or night vision optics"

Something didn't feel right so I called the number he gave me twice and no answer, even thoough I had already texted him and said I would be there in 10  min. and he said ok. I pulled away and went up the street further and called again. He answered and said that wasn't him in the car and he could come out to meet me now. I said I wasn't comfortable with the situation and he gave me the run around, so I drove back home another 43 miles and a big waste of time.

She never really did take to hunting like I thought she would so we just don't need the rifle. She never could group her shots really tight like I  do mine but we think that because the gun kicks a little she was just kind of jumpy. We called the place we got the gun and they said they would be happy to send it to Savage and have it inspected but we never did because we figured she just wasn't shooting real well. They are willing to look at the gun either way and if it's a factory defect they will deal with it even though it's out of warranty I was told. Comes with ammo and empty cases. Willing to trade for certain S&W revolvers mainly but would rather sell. Not interested in low end guns at all. If you have something nice that I like I am willing to pay cash differance.

Bought this SLR last year, only a few months before arsenal quit making them. I have fired 4 30 rd mags out of it, cleaned it for corrosive, clp-ed it, and kept it in my safe. Still have box for it. Do not have the sling it came with anymore though. Will come with original Circle Ten black mag.Asking $1350 for the SLR-104-FR. Will entertain offers, but have not listed it yet on gunbroker and I see them go for that at times. Also have 13 eastern block, Russian bakelite mags. 7 are the orange, believe all are East German. 3 are Russian Plum, and 3 are Russian Black. All are in great shape. Will take $300 apiece for them, or would consider trades on 30 rd steel Eastern Block 7.62 ak mags. Would also consider trades on high cap Sig p226 9mm mags.Also selling 2500 rds of Russian 7N6. One tin unopened, one tin opened, but I also bought an additional 400 rds. I have not counted the precise number, but its about 24-2600 rds.

Again.....Will take offers on all of it. TRADE CONSIDERATIONS:Would consider a trade on any 7.62 x 39 Polish or YUGO m70AB2 underfolder. Would trade for yugo m72, m72b1 rpk.Would consider trades on a Ruger 5.5 inch barreled Redhawk in 44 mag. I am a little picky here, want one thats close to new and newer production.Would consider a partial trade also on either an older German 9mm p226 sig, or a Beretta 84F .380 to replace the one stolen from me a few months ago.

Sure we all love those $3000 Glocks with golden barrels, heads-up displays, camo and other 'improvements'  that look cool and cost more than your SBR AR build BUT...Here's a new unfired in box Glock 19 Gen 3 with the very rare FACTORY threaded barrel in M13LH as pictured with a nice beefy thread protector***To the guy who keeps emailing me about the fact the barrel is not legal - just... you know what? Google is your friend. There***The barrel is not a Wolfie, Stormie, Silencerco-y, modified-y, nope - real factory original Glock. These are VERY hard to find like a 9x21 Glock, a nice High Point anything or cheap .22LR ammo but here's one!Includes pistol, original box, two 15rd magazines, loader, docs/shells and a Streamlight TLR4 LED light with laser and extra batteriesI got this gem to pair up with a GEMTECH Tundra or multimount but I am leaving the country and can't bring it with meLocated in Minden Nevada about 30mi/45km from RenoPrice is cash, firm, and while you guys always have cool trades - I have to say no this time as I can't bring anything else overseas with meThanks for checking it out and have a good one!"

Thanks also this scope has a feature that's nice,standby mode that cuts the scope on when you put it to your eye. Has a sensor that detects when you want to use it. That's saves battery power until you need it. Instant on when you want it. The night pics has been added.

This gun is a great shooter. I recently took it for trade but it isn't really what I was looking for. I'm more of a rifle sort of guy, but this gun has been a treat to shoot. I have put about 200 rounds through it in the last month or so. Never had a failure to fire.It is a pre-lock smith and locks up tight with perfect timing in double/single action. These are 6 shot K-Frame guns. Comes with 150ish rounds of 38 special +P. Serial Number puts this gun right around February 1992 manufacture date.Lady Smith Features:- Single action target trigger- Brushed stainless finish- Nice original rosewood grips in a box in like new condition- 3"" barrel- Fully shrouded ejector rod.This is a great chance to own a rare piece. The 3"" smith is regarded as one of the most desirable carry revolvers. There were very few 3"" model 65 Smiths ever made in the non-LS configuration. The LS version has the fully guarded ejector rod which is a great feature in a carry gun. Make me an offer."
