I like it a lot, just testing the waters to see if there's anything else interesting out there. Mechanically probably no more or less accurate than other quality handguns, but I find it's a natural pointer that I personally shoot better than most.The pistol is in good condition. Appeared to be fired very little when I got it. I've put around 500 rounds through it, never a problem of any kind. Slight holster wear on the right side of the slide. Tritium sights still pretty bright. Came with three 12 round magazines, and I picked up two used 15 rounders on the net. The 15rds feed fine but don't always lock the slide back -- good for practice but I guess maybe don't use if you get into a lot of high-volume gunfights?I do have the original box and manual. Typical bulky Sig box and it has a broken hinge, so I keep the pistol in an old CZ box I had kicking around, pictured, which is a lot handier. I'll include both, plus whatever .40 ammo I have around the house."

I like it a lot, just testing the waters to see if there's anything else interesting out there. Mechanically probably no more or less accurate than other quality handguns, but I find it's a natural pointer that I personally shoot better than most.The pistol is in good condition. Appeared to be fired very little when I got it. I've put around 500 rounds through it, never a problem of any kind. Slight holster wear on the right side of the slide. Tritium sights still pretty bright. Came with three 12 round magazines, and I picked up two used 15 rounders on the net. The 15rd mags feed fine but don't always lock the slide back -- good for practice but I guess maybe don't use if you get into a lot of high-volume gunfights?I do have the original box and manual. Typical bulky Sig box and it has a broken hinge, so I keep the pistol in an old CZ box I had kicking around, pictured, which is a lot handier. I'll include both, plus whatever .40 ammo I have around the house."

RAVEN CONCEALMENT RCS S&W SHIELD PHANTOM MODULAR HOLSTER RIGHT-HAND. I used this holster for my M&P Shield, but I sold that pistol. It's in great condition, works perfect and outstanding for concealment. RCS is known to be one of the best kydex holster manufacturers and it's made in Ohio. Please let me know if you have any questions.  

The Phantom Modular Holster has become the standard by which all other holsters are judged. Copied by many but equaled by none, the Phantom Modular Holster is the first choice of armed professionals and civilians.The Phantom was designed from the outset to provide the highest possible level of concealment by being adaptable to wear with virtually any style of clothing. What makes the Phantom so unique is its ultra-thin, body-hugging pancake profile. This profile, in conjunction with our Eclipse Modular Mounting System, allows the Phantom to be worn either on the belt or inside the waistband.
We construct the body of the holster from thin, high-strength Kydex-T. We chose to use a pancake-style design in order to minimize bulk and distribute the weight of the firearm over a wider area on the belt. The “outside” portion of the holster body fully enshrouds the weapon from ejection port to muzzle. The “inside” or “body-side” portion of the holster incorporates a full-length body shield. This enhances comfort and aids in re-holstering, while simultaneously protecting the controls of the pistol.
The Phantom ships with your choice of belt mounting option. All Phantoms are designed around the Eclipse Modular Mounting System, and are therefore compatible with all Eclipse Modular Accessories. Through the use of Eclipse Modular Accessories, the Phantom can be converted to one of over 20 different styles of OWB or IWB carry.
The Phantom Modular Holster has been proven under fire through heavy daily use around the globe for over five years. Since its introduction, tens of thousands of Phantoms have been used for everything from day-to-day concealed carry by civilians to offensive operations by Tier-1 military units. No other holster even approaches the versatility and functionality of the Phantom. Nor does any copycat product have the proven track record of the RCS Phantom."

Before the trip I had extensive work done to it along with upgraded parts along the way. The parts used were better than factory whenever possible, and the truck was setup for towing without ever breaking a sweat. The 4wd system works great, and is ready for anything PA winters can throw at it...  If you are looking for a V10 Excursion, this is the one you want...you couldn't build one this nice for the asking price, and you would be hard pressed to find one this clean that has been through 17years of north-east winters... I had plans of making this into the ultimate ""War Wagon"", alas priorities change, and this could just as easily be the dependable ""Family Wagon"" for the next owner...you make the call...!  When I bought the truck (fall of 2016) it had just 106k miles on it. Now, after all the work done, the break-in period, and the subsequent move from WA-PA, the odometer shows ~115k miles on it, with more every week as I use it to commute from time to time...

I've only used it for a 2 day long rifle training course. It has 160 total rounds through it and is just about broken in. It has a Nikon Monarch 3 4-16x42 XR nikoplex scope and Warne quick detach rings. Both were also only used for the 2 day course. I have a card with the scope settings for distances up to 700 yards. There is also an extra turret with distances up to 500 yards marked. You just have to dial in the yardage on the turret. Both the card and the turret are specific for the Hornady 140 gr ELD Match ammo. Nikon can make you another custom turret if you use a different round. The detachable 10 round magazine is included. THE BIPOD IS NOT INCLUDED. This rifle is incredibly accurate. I had never shot a bolt action rifle before and after an hour I was hitting the 700 yard gong with ease. This rifle can easly go past 1000 yards. Pick up only Westchester. I do not ship.

Facing restrictions placed on the German arms industry following the Second World War, main production of the PP and PPK was undertaken in France, with the resulting product considered by many enthusiasts to be the finest of all pistols to bear the Walther name very good to near excellent, the pistol retains its original Manurhin finish, with wear from holstering and flaking of finish on the grip straps.

Click Here To View This HK VP40 Tactical On Our Website The VP Series is Heckler & Koch's first striker-fired HK since the P7 series pistols introduced in the 1980s. It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VPSeries integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels, accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the pistol's grip position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines. VP Tactical models feature a longer and slightly heavier threaded barrel, come equipped with night sights, and include three (3) magazines.
