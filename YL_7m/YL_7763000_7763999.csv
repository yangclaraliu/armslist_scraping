Thank you.Text: 650.575.Eight Nine Zero ZeroWarne 30mm Riflescope PA Tikka Medium Rings are designed to be the strongest, most durable fixed Rifle Scope Ring system available. Typical steel scope mounts in this class use only 2 screws per ring, have a narrower clamping band and in most cases only absorb recoil in the front ring. Maxima Fixed Scope Mounting rings utilize 4 T-15 Torx style socket cap screws for secure RifleScope optics mounting. The Maxima Fixed series fit Tikka style cross slot bases and incorporate a Warne Scope Mounts square stainless steel recoil control key in both the front and rear Scope Base rings. This ensures a ""no slip"" positive recoil surface across the entire slot of the base and is capable of withstanding the heaviest of recoil. The Warne Scope Mounts Maxima square recoil key also protects against swaging or peening of the base when used on softer or less durable materials. The Maxima Fixed ring band width is also substantially wider which offers more ring to scope clamping area to hold the optics firmly in place."

Some of the listing I see they can't even spell the make or model of what they are selling.  Some cases won't give you correct info on the firearm..  For example: lnib. Low round count, but come to find out it was mfg 10-15 yrs ago. Like Glock police trade in thats been cleaned up. LolDon't get me wrong, their a few cool guy's out there that I've met.What's so hard about discussing ahead of time on how you want to do the transaction.  Everyone has their personal preference on bill of sale etc. That's good that you cover your own ass and try not to sell or buy from someone that's not legal or might not act responsible enough to have or sell one..I do bill of sale after the ftf agreement is made 1st.....then exchange ID's and then exchange cash/firearm.  I don't agree with photo Id taking because of identity theft. My preference..Oh, don't forget hotguz dot com. to check serial # if stolen. It's not connected to police records. Call local sheriff's Dept they will run serial number over phone for you. you can go as far as kbi felon registery it's free.

With a mid-adjustment “off” position and eight discernible brightness settings, this brightness dial allows for quick and ergonomic adjustments.The MRO features fully protected adjusters that maintain zero even during rough handling, and can be adjusted without the need for special tools.Hard-anodized, forged 7075-T6 housing is fully sealed and waterproof, providing durability in demanding conditions."

I will also include the factory Glock 19 Barrel & Spring/RodThe Barrel is a new release LANTAC 9INE 9mm Threaded / Fluted Barrel, and it is NICE! I’ve only ran 200-300 rounds through it, so it’s practically new. The Slide has zero wear on the outside, and just normal / very light wear on the inside from running 200-300 rounds through it. It is like new, always kept clean, and in great condition. PRICE: $900 SHIPPED FOR EVERYTHING!!EVERYTHING INCLUDED: - Gen 4 Glock 19 Mod 1 Custom Slide- Trijicon Suppressor Height / Night Sights- LANTAC 9INE Threaded / Fluted Barrel- Upgraded Stainless Guide Rod / Spring- Glock MOS Sight Cover (Cerakoted to match) (This is the cover you would run in place of RMR)- Factory Glock 19 9mm Barrel in great condition- Factory Glock 19 Guide Rod / Spring great shapeA Factory Gen 4 Glock 19 MOS Upper / Slide cost $400 by itself. The Lantac 9INE Threaded Barrel cost $285. The machine work, Cerakote, Trijicon Suppressor / night sights, and stainless guide rod/spring cost $500. $400 + $285 + $500 = $1,185. I’m sure I actually spent more in the process, but that is what it would cost you to build this. I’ll take $900 SHIPPED !!"

(Please do not low-ball me, I don't care about any estimates from online websites.  This is a usable and nice vehicle.  You can't get a decent used car for less than $1200 anymore.) If you would like anymore info or pics, just shoot me an email.  I will now list the pro's and con's:Pros: (I'll try not to be superfluous) -No electronic issues. (Rare for a VW.)-Interior is nice (Other than headliner coming down a bit.)-AC/Heat work extremely well.-Power windows, locks, and mirrors.-5-Speed is very smooth.-Clutch is still very nice, you can tell by it being able to take off in 5th gear with no gas.  Also you can use the old parking brake test.  PLEASE DO NOT BURN OUT MY CLUTCH WHEN TESTING IT.  It is easy to slip it when you are doing high gear launches, do not do one of these tests if you are not experienced enough.  Thank you.-The Turbo allows for great acceleration and higher efficiency.-Gas mileage is about 27 average.-Large trunk space.-Previous owner was a bus mechanic and replaced many things, notably the timing belt and water pump among others.  -I replaced battery, be glad because even with my Autozone employee discount it was still $150.  -Tire tread is still great.-All lights work.-Clean title-Very smooth overall in turning, suspension, etc.-Safety is rated very well, you can google it.  Cons:-ABS/Brake lights are on to what can be deduced as several possible reasons: First, the rear pads and rotors I know need to be replaced.  Second, the ABS sensors might need to be cleaned. Third, I know the brakes need to be bled.  I haven't gotten around to fixing these issues because I am not for sure that any one of them is causing the brake light.  What I do know is that I was able to go to a dead stop from 40 MPH with even braking lines and minimal locking in very little time.  During my daily driving, I can tell the brakes are still functioning with no issues so the brake light has not been an issue for me.  You can test them when we meet.-Clear coat is pealing off in some places.-It appeared to have been side swiped at some point, you can tell in the picture.  It isn't that bad though.-I only have one key and the battery is dead on the key fob.  Meeting:  We can meet in Clarksville somewhere where you can test the brakes, clutch, and drive it around a bit.  Like I said before, you can test them but DO NOT DAMAGE THE CLUTCH OR BRAKES.  After you check it out, we will meet at the County Clerk and I will transfer ownership to you there, I do this to make sure it isn't in my name anymore and to get my plates back.  I also do a bill of sale to have a log of the sale."

My HK USP Compact is in wonderful condition showing almost zero signs of wear. If you're interested I not only welcome but encourage you to break the pistol down for complete inspection; this way you'll see this pistol is mechanically like new. I know it's a bit of an uneven trade but I wouldn't expect any money on your end, but I expect your SPEED SIX to be in equally good condition. I also have an ample amount of .40 S&W ammo to go with it. The only downside is there's just one magazine, but with the somewhat unequal trade you can pick up one or two magazines pretty cheaply. I will sell it but prefer a trade. Other trade offers are welcome but I'm pretty much set on the RUGER SPEED SIX, maybe a RUGER POLICE SERVICE SIX. Lastly, I would do an even trade for a really nice condition SIG SAUER P239 9mm, 40 S&W, or 357 SIG DA/SA, NITRON SLIDE (GERMAN MADE FRAME, NO DAK). Anything else will really have to WOW me for a trade. A S&W Model 65 Ladysmith 357 Magnum falls into the WOW category. My sale price is $675. Please call or text me at REDACTED if you're interested. The pistol will have to be picked up in the Denton, Texas area if you're buying, I will meet you half way if it's a trade. Thanks for looking."

It comes with 396 rounds. 150 soft points and 246 hollow points. It comes with 6 pmags and 1 bakelite. This rifle shoots absolutely incredible. It has a chevron muzzle brake on it that knocks the barrel right back to target. It is 922r complient.  Magpul grip arsenal furniture. The front sight is canted but it honestly does not hurt the accuracy at all. I can hit bullet holes at 100 with irons and consistently hit a 12 inch plate at 250. I am asking 1000 because of the mags, ammo, upgraded furniture and muzzle brake. This rifle chambers smoother than any ak I've felt. My number is REDACTED and my name is coy. I am really just wanting to sell for a project I am working on. Thank you"
