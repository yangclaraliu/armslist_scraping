Caliber: 9 mm
 
HISTORY
Many shooters who prefer a classic pistol for target shooting and home defense. Manufactured by Tanfoglio in Italy and imported by European American Armory Corp. (EAA), the 9 mm Luger Witness is an steel-frame gun based on the classic CZ-75 design suited for such purposes.
Many American shooters are familiar with the Czech-designed CZ-75, either through first-hand experience or by reputation. It was the first double-action/single-action, recoil-operated, semi-automatic pistol to allow for cocked-and-locked carry in the manner of single-actions such the M1911 or Browning Hi Power. The CZ-75, like the Browning, uses a linkless locking system.
Legendary gun authority Jeff Cooper endorsed the CZ-75 design at least partly because of its M1911-like qualities. The gun was made behind the Iron Curtain and was difficult to acquire in the United States during the Cold War. Its lack of availability only added to its mystique.
FEATURES
The gun is all-steel, making desirable for those of you who enjoy traditional designs like the Browning Hi-Power or a 1911 platform. Purists, tired of plastic pistols, will love that!   With a heavy, stainless steel barrel as well, the pistol is indeed no lightweight, especially when loaded with a full magazine of 17 rounds of 9 mm Luger ammunition.   The weight minimizes recoil, even when using heavy and +P loads.
 
Very prominent beaver-tail, allowing users to hold the gun higher without fear of getting bit by the slide.
Like the CZ, the slide rides inside the frame on full-length guides, adding to the gun’s accuracy and longevity while also giving it a much lower profile – just like the CZ.. Full-length rails on the frame mate tightly with the slide rails—a level of tolerance that lends itself to improved accuracy. This also gives the slide a short top-to-bottom profile
Low-profile sights feature a white-dots on the front and rear sight – great for target acquisition!
SAFTIES
The safety locks the hammer from any movement when activated. Rounded hammer can be half-cocked, just like the CZ. The safety was improved over the CZ and can be operated with the hammer in any position, preventing it from moving anywhere. Both the safety and slide stop/release are blackened steel, enlarged and easily activated.
Firing pin block safety that stops any forward movement of the firing pin unless the trigger is completely depressed. This helps prevent an unintended discharge if, for example, the pistol were dropped.
OTHER FEATURES
Grips feature a pebbled texture to provide a secure feel in the hand.
Fit and function on the pistol are excellent. Additional features include an integral Picatinny accessory rail on the dust cover for mounting lights, lasers or other accessories. Disassembly requires no tools. Simply line up the takedown marks on the left rear of the slide and frame, then push out the slide stop pin.
The double/single action follows the famous CZ-75 action for consistency and sure-footedness in combat.
Using the CZ as a platform, it is very ergonomic and streamlined. Anyone who has ever shot a CZ-75 knows how comfortable it feels in the hands.
The Witness pistol from EAA and Tanfoglio not only brings back a proven and reliable classic, but it reminds us of the features sometimes lost on modern compact handguns.
