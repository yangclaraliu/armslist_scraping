The screws for it on the otherhand I may or may not have. But if I don't they are cheap to order. I'm asking for 480 because of the case and aarows that also come with it.

There are no Springfield proof marks meaning that Springfield never assembled it and only the drawing number, date and steel batch code are SA.The Gas Plug is a single slot type which is period correct and is most likely a replacement as the blued finish is almost 100%.The Gas Lock is a Winchester and is surely original to the rifle as it is the beveled type and the finish wear matches the gas cylinder.The Buttplate is a later model and is unlikely to be a Winchester as there is no 2S mark inside the plate. We are fairly sure that the Walnut Wood Stock set is not the original and was replaced after the war as the stock has the Circle P on the wrist and the Ordinance Box with the Eagle on the left side. In excellent condition too good to have been through WWII. Therefore we would say that both the stock and buttplate are post war due to the cartouches and the minimal damage to the wood.

The rifle is in overall great condition with all matching numbers on the bolt, magazine, receiver and inside the stock. There's even a troop tag underneath the buttplate for all you history lovers. You can expect the usual dents and dings associated with these rifles, but there are no cracks or major flaws and most of the bluing remains. The bore is very good, bright and shiny.
Also included is an original leather sling, and a muzzle cap to keep out the snow on your visit to the Alps. I'm selling it because I like money and you like guns. Crazy huh? First come, first served. No trades, I have enough weird stuff as is. Full album: https://imgur.com/a/lETdp"

The quality of fit and finish on these is really above just about anything you'll find in it's price range and frankly it's probably one of the more attractive polymer guns(IMO) due to this and it's teniffer finish that more resembles a deep blueing than what glock used. The gun has a rotating barrel that along with the fit of the gun combine to make a very accurate firearm. This rotating barrel design also reduces perceived recoil for the shooter making this a particularly good choice for those who are recoil sensitive or just want to squeeze a little more speed out of their current shooting skill level. The trigger also does a lot to contribute to functional accuracy, It's the best I've felt on an out of the box handgun(owned CZs, glocks, M&P, sig, etc) making accurate shooting a breeze.My example has some light wear on the gun from range use and occasional carry, but nothing excessive. The gun does not play well with steel case ammo but functions fine with any brass I've run through it. Rear sights have been blacked out with sharpie for quicker sight acquisition but i am of course willing to remove this on buyer request. Comes with 3 mags and a comp tac holster. Pictures on request, will likely update add with them at a later date as well.All in all a great piece for range use or carry, especially if you're on a budget."
