I love this rifle immensely, but unfortunately I am moving to California, and will not be able to bring it with me. This is a package deal.
Background information:
I've owned it for a couple years and am the original owner. I've put about 1,500 rounds through it, and not once has she so much as murmered a complaint about what ammo I was feeding her.
I've owned a lot of guns, but this is hands down the most reliable one I've ever layed my hands on. She's got a couple knicks and scratches on the paint, and she is by no means a safe queen.
I clean her religiously. There are a few things not stock, which I will list below.
 
Modifications:
I had a low profile gas block installed, as well as a UTG free floating quad rail. Installation was done by Allison and Carey Gunworks located here in Portland. I have fired her throroughly since then, and she has not so much as hiccuped.
Aside from the gas block and handguard, everything on the rifle is factory stock. I still have the original A2 handguard and A2 front sight, so you can revert her to her stock configuration if you wish to do so.
I have a number of accessories installed as well, which I will list below:
Accessories:
- UTG Tactical Bipod with thumbscrew
- Streamlight 1000 lumen weapon mounted flashlight with thumbscrew mount. Has 3 modes: Bright, strobe, and dim.
- 6 Magpul rail covers and 1 Magpul XTM Handstop Kit
- Quick Release sling mount
- Condor Speedy 2 Point Sling
- 45 degree aluminum canted iron sights
- Off-brand red dot sight (surprisingly useful and reliable for $20 off Amazon, I have had no issues with it)
* I also have a UTG 30mm SWAT 3-12x44 AO Rifle Scope, which has been barely used, but has been great.
- Removable shoulder pad on stock
- Magpul Rear Flip Up Sight
 
Magazines:
Five 30 round PMAGs
Four 40 round PMAGs
One 30 round Windham Weaponry aluminum magazine
One Lula mag loader
 
Ammo:
300+ rounds of American Eagle 62 grain green tip - One box is unopened, the other box is opened.
150+ rounds of American Eagle 55 grain FMJ - Some unopoened boxes, some loose rounds.
75+ rounds of Hornady TAP 55 grain V-Max - 3 boxes unopened, the rest is loose rounds.
100 rounds of HPR Black Ops 62 grain OTF - 3 boxes unopened, the rest are loose rounds.
 
The retail price on the accessories, magazines and ammunition alone comes out to $700 (not including shipping).
The lowest retail price for an LE6920 I can find locally is $800.
However that's for brand new products, and I don't expect a buyer to pay retail price for used gear, no matter how good the condition is (though you're welcome to--I wont complain).
 
Because of this, for the package deal, I am willing to part with everything for $1,195, or the best offer presented to me.
I however will not be lowballed on this. If you're looking for a $500 AR, this is not the one for you.
If you are looking for an exceptionally well built, reliable home defense weapon, this is the AR package deal of a lifetime. Don't let it pass you by.
I am willing to part out the ammo, magazines and accessories, but I will not offer as steep of a discount.
 
For questions, inquries or bargaining, please call or text Zack at REDACTED
This is a first come, first serve basis. Happy Independence Day!"
