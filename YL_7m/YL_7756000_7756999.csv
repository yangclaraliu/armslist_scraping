The scope base is mounted on there real well, but I actually was planning on changing scope bases, but obviously can't do that with one stripped screw. It's a 50th Anniversary reciever, if that matters to anyone. I'm not sure if there is any interest and my price is negotiable. Online cheapest 10/22 receiver avaliable is $80 plus FFL fee.

A combination of a reduced overall diameter coupled with oversized skid pads create less points of contact and thus less friction inside of your carrier. The heavier weight of the carrier aids in a longer dwell time, allowing barrel pressure to be greatly reduced and promoting easier extraction. Made from tool steel and then Isonite treated, this carrier will be the one you want for all of your direct impingement rifles.

It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

The gun has custom “firewood” grips and comes with 1 magazine. It takes down exactly like a 1911. It was manufactured in 1943 and certain parts of the firearm are stained red from Russian cosmoline such as the extractor, the contact piece between the slide spring and barrel, and the trigger has a very light red tint to it. The finish is around 75% due to some holster wear but is still pretty good for a firearm that is 74 years old and has been possessed by both the Spanish and Russian armies. I field stripped it recently to clean it and it was in great condition. It was blued at the Star factory and when the Russians captured it, it was dunked into cosmolene. After who knows how long, it was turned over to a dealer who then reblued it and sold it on the civilian market to the 1st owner. All stamps are still intact and look great! This is a great collectors item. Stars that can be bought today are generally from the 70-90s era so WW2 models are not nearly as common so that is why the pricing is different. This particular pistol has a story behind it due to a eagle holding a swatztika on the grip. The original dealer who had a crate of stars knew that some stars were sold to the nazis during the war. So he attempted to sell mine as Nazi owned due to the selling price of originals being 3-4 times the price of a normal WW2 Star. It’s a pretty cool conversation piece even if it is a fake!The last picture, the Ñ, is the Spanish proofmark for 1943. Beside it is the verification stamp placed by the proofhouse in Spain. Star has an official website and they show all the dates for every proofmark ever stamped on a Star product. All numbers match. If you are knowledgeable about the Model B you will know that it is not uncommon for the B to stovepipe every now and then, this is not a range master it is a safe queen that will accrue in value. This is a great piece for Spanish collectors or just someone who wants a WW2 1911! I can send additional pictures of the inside, bore, and what not. If you have any questions just ask! I do not ship and I would be more than happy to send pictures of the bore upon request! I reduced the price so price is firm"
