Chambered in the original .41 Swiss. This rifle was built in 1885. It wasn't until around 1887, that the the M.81 mark replaced the M.78 stamp. Even after the updates were made, the Swiss continued to mark these rifles with the M.78 stamp on the left side of the receiver. M.78 marked rifles are referred to as Model 1878/81 Rifles. This model was equipped with an improved rear sight. Also, various steel components replaced iron components, and the 1881 continued to see improvements in metal finishing. Otherwise, it was largely identical to the 1878 Rifle. M78 and M81s, due to centralized production can be converted to centerfire relatively easy. This rifle is all matching except the butt plate. It is correct but a different number. All markings are excellent and clear. The bore and barrel rate about 85-90%. Will make a great shooter. $375.00 plus ACTUAL shipping or state tax if in Vermont. I do NOT charge over my cost to ship!  Email me at REDACTED or call Shawn at REDACTED.  This rifle is antique and does not require an FFL if legal to do so in YOUR state.
