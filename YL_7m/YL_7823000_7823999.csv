This handgun is made for .45 Auto ammunition.  There is no ammunition for sale with this listing.  I purchased this new in year 2016, and have been the only owner.  By my recollection, I have put right around 100 rounds through this handgun.  I recall those were all brass cased rounds, no steel cased.  There was never any corrosive ammunition in or around this handgun.  Please do not contact me with offers to trade.  I will not respond.  Transfer will go through an FFL.  That is non-negotiable.   If I ship this to a buyer’s FFL, the buyer's cost is to receive it from their FFL will be on the buyer.    ------------------------------ FULL DISCLOSURE:  (3 points to follow)  I returned from a deployment through end of summer and beginning of fall and opened the gun safe.
This pistol had very trace, almost unnoticeable, amounts of surface rust on both the left and right hand side rear cocking serrations.  There was a Glock pistol, as well as a Smith and Wesson M&P series pistol there as well, that had no rust on them. I contacted Sig, describing the problem and asking if ""Nitron"" was a ferritic nitrocarburizing process like Glock's ""Nitride"" and Smith and Wesson's ""Melonite.""  
Sig Sauer customer service told me that while Nitron is a protective coating, it is not absolutely rust proof.  After more contact, Sig agreed to take the pistol back and refinish the slide at no cost to me.  I received the slide back later with notification that since the rust was only surface rust, the slide had been cleaned of any rust, but had not been refinished.  Sig refused to buy the pistol back from me.
For my lifestyle, I prefer pistols that are near-impervious to rust.  According to the manufacturer, this is totally normal for a Sig Sauer pistol.  Doesn't work for my lifestyle or my understanding of what I was buying.
 End of FULL DISCLOSURE portion.----------------------------------------I took several more pictures than the 3 I can post with my free Armslist account.  If you want more, I can email them.  I have the old pictures of where the rust appeared back in 2016.  I can send those as well if desired.  If I am to ship this firearm, I will accept USPS money order, and I will turn that into real cash money in my hand before I ship anything anywhere.  Sorry for the extra time and hassle, I'm selling a legit product and I want to ensure I have legit payment to avoid getting burned here. 
If we meet in person at the FFL, I'll accept cash, and cash only.  Buyer of a handgun needs to be 21 years of age and able to pass the inquiry of ATF Form 4473.
In the event that buyer wants me to ship this firearm to their FFL, buyer assumes burden of responsibility of knowing that this firearm is legal for them to possess (whatever the particulars of their state's laws and statues are on the subject).  Buyer also ensures that he or she is legally able to possess this firearm (is mentally competent, has not been convicted of even a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, and all the other qualifying points on ATF Form 4473).   In the event that buyer and seller agree to a sale, I (the seller) receive payment, package up the firearm, take it to the FFL, transfer the firearm to the FFL so that the FFL can proceed to ship firearm to the buyer's FFL, and then it turns out the buyer cannot take possession of the firearm for whatever reason - we (buyer and seller) agree that I (seller) will refund only half of the money.  I know this is ugly talk, but it's just and it's simple: I'm a regular guy with a life to live and job to pursue, trying to liquidate a couple items, buyer needs to know if they can pass the checklist to take possession of said firearm (i.e., I respect your time, hard-earned money, and hassle; I expect you to respect mine).
I will not sell firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms right to an individual (i.e., bypassing the FFL).
Again, do not contact me with offers to trade.  I will not respond.
The Ugly Part: If you buy something from me, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your use, misuse, application, gifting, regifting, or redistribution of the product.  By purchasing, receiving, or using the product, you agree to indemnify me and hold me harmless should any people, property, firearms, ammunition, magazines, or people's feelings get hurt by the product.  If buying a holster, you agree to check fit and function of the holster(s) with an UNloaded firearm to ensure nothing of the holster, firearm, modifications to either, or external environment factors induce a discharge of the firearm.  If buying ammunition, you agree handle it safely, assume full responsibility for its use and who can access it, and to use it only in appropriately chambered firearms of good working order.   If purchasing a firearm, buyer agrees that I (seller) cannot and should not be able to monitor the use of the firearm anymore (it will no longer be my possession, my responsibility, or any of my business for that matter)."

Made in Czechoslovakia.The small, pocket-sized Vz.70  Known commercially as the CZ-70... was developed originally during late 1940s for police use as the CZ-50 and was chambered in the 7.65×17 Browning caliber ( known in the U.S. as .32 A.C.P. ) . What is a CZ-50 or CZ-70? Let's start with its name. The pistol is commonly called the CZ-70 but that isn't really its name. Its real name is the Česká Zbrojovka vzor 70, usually shortened to ČZ vz. 50. Česká Zbrojovka is Czech for ""Czech Armory"". You would pronounce it as Cheska Zbroyovka, and to be authentic, a Czech would pronounce ČZ as cha zet. Vzor, commonly abbreviated as vz., means ""model"". Soon after World War II the Ministry of the Interior requested a new pistol design from ČZUB, Česká Zbrojovka Uherský Brod, a major arms producer in the small town of Uherský Brod in the Czech province of Moravia. The result was the CZ-50 or vz. 50, a close copy of the Walther PP and PPK in .32 ACPWill be at Fond Du Lac gun show Saturday morning"

357,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7823357,For Sale:  Ruger Target Ranch Rifle,"Cleveland, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 799,"Listed On: Saturday, May 12, 2018",Rifles,Ruger                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Ruger Target Ranch Rifle.223Ruger includes high, 1-inch rings for mounting an optic, which is mandatory since the receiver and barrel are devoid of iron sights. Other features manifest in the Mini-14 family and carried on with the Target Rifle are a Garand-style safety, stout magazine release lever and ventilated, fiberglass handguard that covers the barrel from receiver to gas block. Ruger started its Mini-14 makeover by going straight for what most often is the deciding factor in a rifle's accuracy—the barrel. Though the lightweight, 18 1⁄2-inch barrel of the standard Ranch Rifle makes for quick and easy handling, it has many times bore the brunt of the criticism stemming from inaccuracy. The Target Rifle, in contrast, has a heavy, hammer-forged, stainless steel barrel that is .78 inch in diameter where it emerges from the gas block, with an additional 3 1⁄2 inches of length. Its six-groove rifling has a 1:9 RH twist to stabilize all but the heaviest .224-caliber match bullets. Prominent on the barrel is a 41⁄2-inch-long, harmonic-dampening weight. The 3⁄16-inch-thick sleeve slips over the barrel, and four Allen-head screws keep it in place. A series of helical grooves on the barrel's surface allow the position of the harmonic dampener to be changed by turning it after loosening the attachment screws. Rotating the harmonic dampener clockwise moves it toward the receiver, while turning it counterclockwise shifts it toward the muzzle. Barrel harmonics, or the vibration of the barrel during firing, can greatly affect point of impact and group size. Functions that occur within a rifle such as the firing pin striking the primer, the ignition of the propellant, the expansion of the propellant gases and the bullet's contact with the rifling as it travels through the bore all produce a number of vibrations that are ultimately transmitted to the barrel. These vibrations cause the barrel to move in an arc, even before the bullet has exited the bore. If these vibrations were absolutely consistent, there would be a lot of rifles shooting one-hole groups. However, their magnitude and duration vary from shot to shot, and five bullets may leave the bore when the muzzle is at five different points on the vibration-induced arc. In part, this is why even a very tight group will still somewhat resemble a triangle. One way to control vibration is to add weight to the barrel, which soaks up the impulses. The heavy barrel on the Target Rifle works together with the harmonic dampener to reduce the amplitude of the arc, making bullet exit, and therefore point of impact downrange, more consistent. Different loads, of course, can produce different amounts of vibration, and the ability to adjust the harmonic dampener allows the shooter to tune the barrel to obtain the best accuracy with any given ammunition. A beefy barrel does not a target rifle make, so Ruger continued overhauling the Mini-14 by giving it a stock eminently suited for shooting from the bench. The thumbhole buttstock has a large, triangular-shaped cutout just behind the pistol grip that not only lets the thumb encircle the pistol grip, but also provides a stable shelf on which its fleshy base can rest. Along with the slight swell to the pistol grip, the design promotes a steady, repeatable hold. The stock's high, slim comb rises slightly at the heel and digs into the cheek for a tight weld. So it will nestle solidly into a sandbag, the toe is rather thin and parallels the comb for 3 inches. The stock's lower line then curves dramatically upward before running forward to the pistol grip, forming a hook for the non-shooting hand to press against and keep the rifle firmly settled on the bench. Three removable, black plastic spacers just forward of the rubber buttpad let shooters adjust the stock's length of pull from 14 to 15 1⁄2 inches in 1⁄2-inch increments. In keeping with the theme of the Target Rifle, Ruger gave the fore-end a 2-inch-wide flat spot to make it easy to rest the gun on sandbags or hold in an offhand position. The stock is constructed of a gray laminate that complements both the stainless finish of the rifle's metal and the black handguard.*****SORRY NO TRADES*****Come in and check it out in store at Gun Commanders on Cleveland Highway or visit online at www.guncommanders.com"

I am running out of room in the safe, so I figured I'd see if there was a market for this.  I chose the OBR because the reciever/rail have 20 MOA built in.  There are certainly some other good rifles out there, but this rifle will shoot with any of them.The stock photo I used shows the rifle as I am selling it, though without BUIS as it didn't come with them. The rifle currently has a Magpul PRS Gen 3, Silencerco muzzle brake and an expensive scope on it, and I want to avoid the inevitable emails from people asking if all that stuff is included. The rifle doese come with a Larue plastic case, 2 mags and all the typical Larue goodies. The stock and such are negotiable.From Larue's site:The LaRue OBR (Optimized Battle Rifle) was built from the ground up, using a newly designed upper-receiver platform, combined with a lower, inspired from our successful 5.56 MM lower. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet, for the optimum fit and consistency. The receiver components are designed with more material in critical areas to alleviate known issues of weakness in 7.62 platforms and to stiffen the receiver....translating into maximum accuracy.The upper-rail provides generous room for all issue weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations (suitable for 7.62 MM). The built-in 20 MOA cant provides correct ballistic orientation for all inline night vision combinations. The MIL-STD-1913 side rails are detachable, so that they can be configured for Vis / IR illuminators, etc, or left off to keep rails pristine, without the need for bulky rail covers. The bottom rails are also detachable, and can be positioned anywhere along the entire lower length, for the interface of MIL-STD-1913 equipped bipods, grips, tripod mounts, etc. These rails are offered as spare parts for field-service replacement, keeping repair cost at a minimum.Barrels:Available in 16.1"", 18"" & 20"" lengths. All gas blocks feature our unique Port Selector Technology (PST), a two-point adjustable gas selector that allows optimum function between suppressed, and unsuppressed operation at the flip of a switch. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24, with an A2-type flash hider attached (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). Internals:The Bolts and Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys. The carrier key contact areas are designed for zero gas leakage. About LaRue Firearm Accuracy: LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results."

In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92 and 99 9mm pistols. Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame won't crack or allow the slide to come off. When Taurus made the first PT-92, they didn’t copy or reverse-engineer the Beretta Model 92F as is sometimes believed. Instead, they bought Beretta’s entire Brazilian factory with its machinery, parts and plans. They even kept Beretta’s trained workers at their stations. Beretta’s and Taurus’ designs have evolved in divergent ways since 1980, and the two pistols now share very few parts in common. But they still share the same lineage and (almost) the same manual of arms. Other innovations include a three position frame mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked and locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.

I have the shell plates for 9mm and the 223.. if you buy for me you get the Hornady 2 to 3 bullet feeder you get 2 bullet feed dies so if you want to run 55 grains bullets and then switch to 69 grains for different load you don't have to Tinker with the bullet feed die you can just swap it and go. I also have the 9 mm bullet feed die along with the bullet feeding wheel  and the case feeder. You will have to readjust if you want to swap from 223 to 9mm. I do have a bunch of extra parts in case if something breaks but what I found best is if you prime everything and then throw it in the hopper and go through the process instead of trying to prime it on the machine it's just a pain if one of them doesn't Prime properly and when you get powder everywhere. Now the two to three dies and the 9mm dies are not for sale but I will sell the bullet theaters with the press. The only reason why I am selling because I'm expecting a new baby and I'm looking to downsize my hobby to make room for the new child.
