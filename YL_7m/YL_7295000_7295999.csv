AR MAGLOCK solution allows the shooter to re-insert a magazine while the upper and lowers receivers (the action) are closed or open, allowing for faster magazine changes. Allows you to have the ejection port cover open or closed when closing the action, the competition only allows this with the port door closed, causing even slower operation. Does not scratch your upper receiver with an adjustment screw like competition does. Last but certainly not least, AR MAGLOCK also has finger knurling for excellent grip in any and all weather conditions, in addition to coming with the knurled grip tacticool rear take-down pin and accompanying split ring for quick pull operation.  AR MAGLOCK – AR-10 Fixed Magazine Lock and Release Solution. If you purchased this AR-10/.308 kit from us, you do NOT need the Wide Receiver Adapter Kit, the spacer and longer screw are already included. This kit does come with a rear take-down pin but, because .308 lower receivers are so differing in their pin diameter sizing, ours only fits about 50% of the firearms in the market. We can NOT guarantee our pin will fit your lower receiver!"

Front sight is a thin post with small dot at top. Rear sight is a Schuetzen type adjustable post for elevation with diopter and lock down lever on left side. Frame has 90% case colors. Gun has 98% original blue on barrel. Gun has adjustable set triggers and an excellent bore. Stock is very good and in our opinion is probably a good re-stock from the 1950’s whereas we think the rifle to be Pre War (WWII) manufacture. Action, trigger assembly removes by opening the side lever. This is a fine .22LR target Schuetzen. Note: We test fired this rifle and shell extracted perfectly if you open the action with some gusto. If you open it slowly the fired case may stick and you have to help it out. So don’t open it too slowly.Any questions?

A long-serving veteran of the war, owing to the rifle's early production time frame, it also notably feature two Weimar droop-eagle proofs on the barrel and receiver. Lacking an import mark, this K98k is a strong candidate for having been brought back from the war as a GI's trophy. With such examples rapidly becoming scarce on the market, this desirable, pre-war 98k represents a sound investment and would be a superb addition to the advanced or dedicated collection."

A coworker of mine served there and he got an extra voucher from someone who didn't want to buy one, so inam the original owner, taking delivery around 7/96. It has the original wood and etched plastic display case. Gun has never been fired, stored properly and still has the original copper lube on the slide. I added the limited edition Olympic police badge set and three original patches from the LE and security team forces. These add ons were $100+ and really make the pistol stand out. Somwtine around 2002-2004, Glock found the remaining unsold pistols and sold them to a distributor with no buyer restrictions. Originally, it was LEO only. You can check the serial number, this is NOT one of the resale guns. I also believe they did not come with the display case. *It did come with two Clinton-era 10 round mags, which I no longer have. I will include two exc. condition 17 round MAGA unless you live in a prohibited state, in which case we can work something out. (Likely I'll buy two new 10 round mags). I am in DE for legal FFL FTF sales and will ship via FedEx at buyer expense to a FFL. These Glocks are great for those who collect LE, Olympic memorabilia or just love the Gen. 2. I included accurate photos to show the condition and features. Thanks for looking. Will consider trades: Sig P series (German or nickel), G19 & G23 NS pair, Marlin 1895 SBL, M1A Socom, Select 12 ga.

This is my four year old Benelli SuperNova Slug gun. I purchased it brand new to be my deer gun and had to order it from Benelli as they were nowhere to be found. After 7 months of waiting on the gun I never even bothered to use it as intended. It has been sitting in my Liberty ever since.The gun has never been carried in the field or taken on a hunt. I put a total of 5 slugs through it (Hornady) just to test it out when I first got it. It has since been cleaned twice.The gun comes with a ComfortTech Gel cheek riser ($100) as well as the flat one from the factory. My goal was to put a scope on it but never got around to it. If you decided to mount an optic on it you won't have to worry about adding a cheek piece. It also has the three stock shims so you can adjust it to your fit, assembly tool, and original manuals. Sling is also included.My loss truly is your gain on this one. These CryoBarrels are insanely accurate and the gun is like brand new. I just have no need for it.The cheapest I can find this gun anywhere online in stock is $750, and thats only two websites. I am asking $450 for everything or best reasonable offer. I will not respond to low-balls. NO TRADES!!!Deer season is only a few months away!!Thanks for looking!"

This gun has a Vogel competition trigger with the sear and springs and everything replaced buy a qualified gunsmith. The trigger has a very nice crisp pull with a very short reset for follow-up shots. I also have the original trigger that you will get.
