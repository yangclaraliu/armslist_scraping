This thing is very tight and shoots true. All the metal is in great shape as are the wood grips. There are a couple small dings on the wood from carry. This gun has been in my family for 25 years with very few rounds through it. You will be hard pressed to find a nicer Colt. May consider partial trade for full size 9mm or 40 cal. $650.00 cash.

This revolver fire a 0.510/0.511"" diameter bullet. This revolver is in perfect condition and comes with 100 prepped cases, 50 ready for primers and 50 with primers installed. I went through and tried to count all the different bullets I have for it, and it is a bunch. Probably close to 1000 bullets from a few manufacturers. I also have a set of RCBS dies with a custom seating die that my grandfather had built. Considering everything that is coming with the revolver, I am starting at $3000.00. I recently talked to Hamilton about this and he said that this gun runs about $2100 just for the gunsmithing plus the $800 dollar Redhawk. You must also consider that the custom dies are about $200, along with the bullets and the cases. The case is actually made from a 348 Winchester that is trimmed down to length and resized. I will travel to meet someone and prefer a face to face sale. I live in South Arkansas, just as a general geographical location. I am open to offers, but please be respectful with your offer. I am open to trades too, and I am looking for a Ruger precision rifle in 6.5 Creedmoor. That and some money and we may have a deal. Bowen is no longer producing large bore revolvers like this, and this may be your once in a lifetime chance to own something that is beautiful. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to see some additional photos. I have a lot and can e-mail them to you. ThanksSean (Arkss)"

They also pattern tighter than Rem and Fed ""game loads"" because the shot is much harder.  This is a fast load compared to many target loads that are 1 1/8 oz at 1155 fps, and it actually does alright on squirrels because of the high brass velocity. I gave some to friends and am keeping a couple cases for myself but I figured I would pass on the savings.

Although it’s a double-action trigger, I see why everyone gushes about it: extremely smooth and light, so it’s easy to shoot accurately. Excellent carry pistol, but it’s striker-fired, and I just prefer DA/SA hammer-fired pistols.

In 7.65 mm (32 ACP) The Ortgies 7.65 mm pistol was a hammerless semi-automatic pistol produced in Germany in the years immediately after World War I, first by its inventor Heinrich Ortgies and then by Deutsche Werke. Inexpensive, but of good quality, the pistol achieved considerable success at contemporary shooting competitions[1] and, as an export product, was popular throughout the Americas.[2]  Although not expensive, at the time it was of advanced design and high quality construction with relatively few parts, well sealed against dirt. Metal components were forged or machined, and assembly in general made no use of screws, even securing the wooden grips with metal clips, although some examples do incorporate a single screw for that purpose. The hammerless action depended on a spring-loaded striker to fire the cartridge. As in early Colt and Browning pocket pistols, the Ortgies striker also operated as an ejector as the slide traveled backwards after discharge.[1] Unusual design features included the safety and the magazine. The safety was a lever inset into the back of the grip and, with the gun cocked, forced backward out of the grip into the ""safe"" position by spring tension from the firing pin upon depression of a button under the slide. Thus, engaging the safety simultaneously reduced tension on the firing pin spring. To disengage the safety, a shooter simply would squeeze the grip, pressing the lever forward and locking it flush with the back of the frame.[1]"

I bought it for my Saiga .308, but since it has a different style trigger than all the other calibers (of course, ugh!) it won’t work for me. Also selling a few magazines for a 7.62x39 Saiga. These particular magazines started out as regular AK mags, but were modified to work in a Saiga without installing a bullet guide. Metal was welded in over the front locking tab, to recreate a built-in bullet guide, which prevents the rounds from slamming into the side of the chamber—which is what would happen if you used standard AK mags in an out-of-the-box Saiga. The AK/Saiga mags still lock in a regular AK, but unsure if they would still function or not—though it appears they would, I cannot guarantee it. I do however guarantee the mags to function flawlessly in unconverted Saiga’s. As you probably have heard a dozen times, it is very likely (especially with bipartisan support) that these stocks will be banned shortly. These have been banned from sales, or are out of stock everywhere online.....get them while you still can!!asking $550 for the stock and magazines, and will certainly consider trades of equal or better value."

As the title states is a brand new Ruger range bag that is quite nice and pretty cool in my opinion. I just haven't and won't use it,but I'm sure there's someone else out there who will. It's a 2 pistol range bag that also holds up to 8 mags with ammo/storage compartments as well. First even $30 takes it, thanks armslist."
