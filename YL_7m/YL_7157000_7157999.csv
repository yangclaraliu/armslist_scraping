A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame and a polished and engraved stainless steel slide. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters."

Ruger 45 Long Colt New Model Black Hawk Revolver. I just can't find any that are as nice or have the mirror like the blued finish on this gun. I was told it’s called a high polished finish. These pictures do it no justice. It is much nicer in person? I know the jeweled hammer is commonly done after market, as well as the pearl grips. But this finish is absolutely beautiful! This is a show piece. It doesn't even appear if it has been fired but I really dont know. I can say my stepfather owned it for as long as I can remember and I have never seen him or anyone else shoot it.  It does have a slight cylinder turn line probably just from handling. I called Ruger and they said it left their factory 1987 I think, I wrote it down then lost the paper. But it was the 80's. They also confirmed what the side of the gun has engraved, that it is a New Model Ruger 45 Blackhawk. It is a .45 Long Colt, not a .45ACP.Was always stored in dehumidified safe the whole time my step-father had it as well as me.I am including 3 boxes of Long Colt ammo which if you are into these you know it is very expensive. 2 are boxes of 50 rounds and 1 is 20 rounds. 1 of the boxes of 50 is missing 8 rounds. So there is a total of 112 rounds worth a nice chunk of change.Price is $500 FirmBy the way this is from my deceased step-fathers collection.Daniel734threezeronine-9twofour2"

The total extent of the interface is simply the take down pin, and the pivot pin. The new ARAK-21™ upper receiver offers you all its features with no change to your current lower receiver and can be installed in less than one minute with no tools. Your ARAK-21™ upper receiver will be shipped to you with one “Barrel Assembly Unit” (BAU), or two, depending on which package you purchase.The BAU is comprised of the barrel, gas block, muzzle brake, gas piston, gas adjuster, and barrel trunnion. The only removable part of this assembly is the gas adjuster knob. The gas adjuster knob has 4 settings. Three of the settings allow different gas flows for optimum operation, and one setting blocks the gas flow for a single shot operation.The upper receiver includes the charging block, standard charging handle, lower forearm with screws, three aluminum full length picatinny rails, three insulating shims, bolt carrier assembly, lower recoil lug with spring guide rod, and dual recoil spring system. Along with your new ARAK-21™ upper receiver you will receive your owners manual, and two allen wrenches that will fit the screws that attach the lower forearm, and the front picatinny rails.REMOVING THE BOLT CARRIER:To remove the bolt carrier, you must either remove the ARAK-21™ from the lower receiver by removing the take down pin and the pivot pin, or simply remove the take down pin and pivot the upper from the lower.Next, remove the cross pin that retains the recoil lug in position.Press the recoil lug forward and down. It will release and extend to the rear of the receiver.Remove the lower recoil lug and the dual recoil spring assembly to the rear. The bolt carrier will then be free to slide out the rear of the upper receiver.If you choose to remove the “BAU,” you will need to remove the ARAK-21™ from the lower receiver. Turn it over, and loosen the 6 screws from the lower forearm. They will not come out, just become loose. Then remove the lower forearm perpendicular to the upper receiver. There are 4 pins that align the lower forearm, and the upper receiver. Then the barrel can be removed by simply sliding the BAU forward toward the muzzle, and away from the upper receiver.You can install the same, or a different BAU, by following the process in reverse. The entire process should take around three minutes.Due to the unique and innovative features of the ARAK-21™ upper receiver, there are very few parts that are interchangeable with a standard AR-15. The firing pin, extractor spring, and ejector spring are the only parts that are standard and interchangeable with an AR-15 upper receiver.Other features include:The upper receiver is fully machined from an aircraft grade 6061-T6 aluminum billet in a one piece design that incorporates a full length picatinny rail (Mil-STD-1913) on the top and three additional rails on the muzzle end of the receiver, making it a full M4 style quad rail upper. The top picatinny rail is laser engraved for optic placement. There are also half-length picatinny rails available.12 ½” length BAU is available in 5.56, heavy profile. 16” and 20” length BAU’s are available in both the 5.56 and 300 BLK. There are two profiles to choose from, medium and heavy. BAU’s can be interchanged in less than 3 minutes by removing the (6) captive allen screws on the bottom rail using the enclosed allen wrench.Long stroke variable setting gas piston system. There are three options for gas flow, and one for no gas flow. This allows for single shot operation. There is also a clean out port for the gas block between the gas cylinder, and the barrel.Charging handle is ambidextrous, non-reciprocating, foldable, spring returned and is easily relocated from left to right side without tools by the operator.Model “39” Eight (8) lug bolt design with involute profile for both right and left hand versions. The extractor is positioned at 3 o’clock. This allows for a left hand version to use the same bolt by simply removing the cam pin and rotating 180 degrees and reinstalling the cam pin.Self-contained firing pin retention system enclosed in a rectangular bolt carrier that no longer requires a cotter pin.Bolted in hardened steel rail system for the bolt carrier to ride on. This allows a metal on metal wear surface for better wear characteristics and a much smoother operation.The ARAK-21™ system allows for a folding stock to be added, as our recoil system does not extend beyond the upper receiver to fully operate. This eliminates the noise and feel of the buffer tube cycling back and forth.PLEASE NOTE:Images shown may include items not sold with the ARAK-21™ Upper Receiver.Please note this item is only available in black, right hand ejection and 5.56 Caliber 16"" Medium Barrel."

The pistol features a factory-enhanced trigger and due to the porting, is a very soft and easy to shoot pistol.  It comes with all the factory accessories: 3-interchangable textured grips, all the mounting plates and hardware should you decide to mount an optic of your choice, 3-17 round factory magazines, the factory case, manual, and lock. Please email me your name and phone number if you are interested or have any questions about this pistol and I will call you ASAP. Buyer must show PTP or PTC and a MN ID. Thanks, Tim."

It was made by SMI in 1939 and it's still packed in its original boxes. As you can see in the photos the boxes are in great looking condition for their age having been removed from their original wooden crate recently. The printing is still clear and legible and there is little damage. Then the ammo itself looks very good to near excellent as well without any corrosion that I can see. The Italians used some sort of a dry lube on their miltary rifle ammo during this time period because you can actually feel it when you handle this ammo. It's very light but there is definitely a slight greasy/waxy feeling to both the ammo and the clips. I've collected this kind of stuff for 40 years and I've always noticed this dry lube on any Wartime Era Italian Military rifle ammo I've ever had including the 6.5 Carcano caliber. It sure seems to work well because both the ammo and the clips are corrosion free. Bottom line is that this is some rarely seen collectible ammo today. The Carcano clips alone bring $5 to $10 apiece and you can check that out on eBay if you don't believe it.Price is $200 firm with pickup in the Brandon area by some who is at least 18 years old. I could ship this to places in the lower 48 States where legal via UPS if buyer is willing to pay shipping costs.
