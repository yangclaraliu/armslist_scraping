You'll have to copy and paste it in your address bar.https://tulsa.craigslist.org/cto/d/jeep-wrangler-yj-42l-straight/REDACTED.htmlI am selling a 1990 Jeep Wrangler YJ. It has the ""4.2 L AMC 258 I6"" straight 6. It is a manual 5 speed, all mechanical 4x4 (shift lever in the floor). It starts easily, runs strong, and drives great. No issues whatsoever. It starts at the bump of a key, and the engine runs very strong. No miss or smoke. Doesn't drip a drop of anything. It drives very smooth (for an old Jeep), even at highway speeds. It does 80 no problem. The steering is very tight and it drives straight. No wobble, vibration, or play in the steering. The 4x4 engages easily and works great. It has a bimini top, half doors, and leather door tops with zip windows. It also has a full soft top, but in all honesty, the soft top isn't in great condition. It has very comfortable Recaro style bucket seats in the front, and a brand new backseat, all with seat belts. It has an aftermarket Bluetooth sound system with CD, AUX, USB, etc. It has rollbar grab handles. It has all matching BF GoodRich All Terrain TAs with 85% tread (or better) and matching spare. The tires are mounted on American Racing alloy rims, including the spare. All of the lights work, including the LED light bar, which is VERY bright. All in all, it's a great little jeep. It needs nothing to be a reliable daily driver.

I think its about 19' long and weighs around 5000lbs. loaded. When I bought it I repaired a lot of water damage and sealed the roof, fixed the fresh water lines, replaced the water pump, and a lot of other things. Due to our work schedule and family growing we don't have the time and have out grown this. It had sat for the last 4 years until a camping trip last weekend.  The roof started leaking again while it sat not being used and mice got into it. I haven't looked at the roof yet but it wasn't raining in while we were camping so its not too bad.  It has a 110V fridge that was in it when I bought it as well as a microwave. A/C works. Furnace worked last time we used it as well as hot water heater, however the water heater is bypassed right now due to a cracked fitting from not properly winterizing it.  Brand new battery. Tires were replaced before I went to Kentucky 8 yrs ago they have good tread and minimal dry rot, also has a spare. Front table folds into king size bed and rear table makes a small twin size bed. There is also a top bunk above the front table but its not really useable unless your small. Needs some more cleaning up and some TLC. I give it a 5 out of 10 in its current state. Its perfect for a permanent spot at campground or a weekend at the races or deer camp if you have a generator.  I am hoping to use it 1 or 2 more times this year if time allows and will be working on some things as I get to it.  Asking $1000"

It starts, easily, runs strong, and rides great. It has the Kuryakin Hypercharger upgrade. It has aftermarket floorboards, aftermarket heal shifter (true heal shift, not a clip on), and an aftermarket chrome battery box. It also has the Roadburner 2.5 inch Street Pro aftermaket exhaust. It is a VERY smooth and comfortable bike. It shifts perfectly, and neutral is easy to hit (unlike 90% of all bikes). All the lights work, good brakes, and great tires. This bike needs absolutely nothing to be a daily driver. It has only 17k miles, so it still feels like a new bike. It has custom paint with a very subtle and classy flame-job. The tags are good for another 8 months, so they won't have to be updated until July of 2018, and I have a clean, green, lien free, Oklahoma title ready to go!91Eight-40Two-748EightCash is king, but I am willing to consider trades of all types.

This model pistol was the original compact 45 auto and this specimen is in very good condition and would make a great concealed carry weapon. The Star Model PD is a compact and lightweight semi-automatic pistol. The Model PD can be loaded with six .45 ACP pistol cartridges in the detachable internal magazine, plus one in the chamber, and was very popular with police and civilian users in the self-defense and backup gun role, especially in the United States.The Star PD improved on its predecessor (Star Model PKM) by using a low-profile adjustable rear sight and by removing material from the slide and other small changes. These modifications, combined with its aluminum alloy construction, resulted in a slim, compact, lightweight and relatively powerful pistol, revolutionary for the time. As it also bore an external resemblance to the well-known M1911 pistol, the gun sold very well in the U.S. This pistol began the trend towards the production by other manufacturers of compact 1911-style pistols, which continues to the present day. The Star Model PD was generally very well liked, and still has a strong following among some firearms enthusiasts.

I have decided to forego the apocalypse and sell my ammo because I need money for closing costs in the near future.  These are legitimate, I don’t have an X-ray to show you but I can tell you they came from a world class training facility. If you are looking then you already know what these rounds are and how much they go for.  The head is marked LC03 which stands for lake City, a supplier of brass to the military. 10 rounds 65ea25 rounds 60ea50 rounds 55eaover 50 rounds 50ea"

Based on the legendary Edge model and built on the patented modular steel frame with polymer grip, the Executive delivers the traditional features of a 1911 and allows the added benefit of high capacity magazines. The innovative frame design preserves the 17° angle of the grip in relation to the slide, original to the 1911. The essential design element for high capacity, the polymer grip, allows for double stack magazines without over-sizing the circumference of the grip, which remains comparatively the same as the circumference of a 1911. True to 1911 tradition, the Executive has a unique full length slide with front and rear cocking serrations, Dawson fiber optic (.100) front sight for quicker target acquisition, and an STI adjustable rear sight. The Executive comes standard with features such as a stainless steel STI knuckle relief hi-ride grip safety, stainless steel STI ambi-thumb safeties, and an STI stainless steel fully supported ramped bull barrel. The Executive comes hard chromed, so not only is it the most accurate and reliable handgun on the market, it is now one of the most beautiful. The Executive comes with one 126mm magazine.
