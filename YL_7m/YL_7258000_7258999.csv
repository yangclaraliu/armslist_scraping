 This Winchester 94 clone by Mossberg has been modified/customized internally and externally by Snipe Custom Arms in Central Kentucky. Truth be said, this strange firearm makes a perfect brush gun for whitetail.
The entire lever action has been reworked to operate as smooth as butter. The stock has a recoil reducing mechanism, so even the hottest loads feel like shooting a 9mm carbine. To further reduce recoil, a V-Power muzzle brake has been installed.  All metal parts have been coated with Cerakote, which offers superior rust and wear protection. The chosen colors blend in well with the KY woods, and play a big role in giving this firearm its unique look.  
As I am torn whether to sell this firearm or not, the price must be right. It sure is a very unique firearm, that will turn many heads at the range, and start many dialogs at the hunting cabin.The Sig Sauer Rome 5 red dot sight, is included with this firearm. I also have a bunch of 30-30 ammo, and reloading components that we can talk about.The price for this beauty is $850 OBO"

I bought two of these a while ago, but this one's never been used.  It works great, the illuminated reticle is a nice feature.  The red laser isn't super bright on sunny days, but you can see it at about 15 yards (not so much at 50y).  Case has spare battery and allen wrench, excellent protection.

ARMATAC Discription:
The SAW-MAG™ offers for the first time a reliable and efficient AR-15 Drum Magazine. The SAW-Mag 150 round magazine for the AR15 pattern .223/5.56mm rifle and all weapons accepting AR-15 / AR15 / M16 magazines using the STANAG 4179 standard.
Designed to fit NATO standard (STANAG-4179) rifles, the SAW-MAG™ quickly converts a rifleman with a standard M4 into automatic support personnel. The flexibility of such force multiplication makes the SAW-MAG™ the most dominant accessory for the M4/M16/M27/HK416 family of weapons.
The SAW-MAG™ is a hybrid design externally constructed of thick walled long glass polymer and steel. This allows the magazine to have the durability to survive real world conditions. The hardened steel USGI tower allows it to fit into any weapon that accepts the 30 round standard magazine. All parts are from production tooling for precision and economics.
The SAW-MAG™ was designed to have the lowest operating drag due to friction. The ammunition is contained individually inside the drums on sprockets, each cartridge gets its own separate space, the ammunition is picked off the sprockets when they spin, not a typical high friction convergence found on cheaper designs. This is why our system does not require graphite lubrication to work. Instead of funneling the ammunition, the SAW-MAG™ uses a proprietary design that allows the ammunition to always be in a singular stream which results in a very low friction operation.
Caliber-5.56mm/.223 Weight 4.9 lbs empty 8.0 lbs loaded The Molle Carry Bag adds 0.8 lbs (SAW-MAG™ loaded+ HK416 =16lbs (M249 Unloaded 17lbs) Capacity-150 Rounds Color-Black only Body Material- Hi-impact Glass Nylon Tower-Heat Treated Steel to USGI specs Dimensions- 13.5″L x 3.25″W x 6.5″H
The SAW-MAG™ is 100% guaranteed against defects in workmanship or materials, Armatac Industries will replace or repair unit at no cost to owner (exclusive of shipping)."

I bought this gun and the mags two weeks ago on an impulse and didn't realize realize I still have a few things I need to pay off before a new gun so I have to sell it. I took it out once to shoot and it ran the 75 rounds I out through it just with only one malfunction. A a failure to feed. But I think it was because of an incorrect grip that caused it. This gun has not spent any time in a sweat pocket or anything either. It's a brand new gun. It comes with 5 mags with finger extension and flush fitting base plates. I'm asking $340 but I feel firm on the price. I feel like that's a good deal for a gun that really is brand new and comes with 4 extra mags.
