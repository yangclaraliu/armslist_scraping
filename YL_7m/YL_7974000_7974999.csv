There is no bolt carrier group (BCG), charging handle, or sights included with this listing.
All NFA rules apply to this item.  By purchasing, buyer agrees to know the NFA restrictions that apply, and to be responsible for his or her own decisions with this item.
The exact descriptor I got for the title, as I got in my email when I first ordered this is as follows:
PSA 7"" Nitride 5.56 NATO 1/9 Keymod Upper - Without BCG or Charging Handle - 508028
I am not selling any of the ammunition pictured here. Nor is the money in the photos for sale nor rebate purposes.  It is there for size reference only.The 2 Keymod holes on the left and right of the forend rail (3 o'clock and 6 o'clock) furthest to the rear of the forend (closest to the chamber) are QD attachment points for QD swivels, which is pretty cool in the handiness and weight savings departments.I took many more pictures than the 3 I can post with my free Armslist account.  If you want more, I can email them.  (I took a total of 21 pictures of this item).  The grease inside the Bolt Carrier Group operating area of the upper receiver (visible in some of the photos) is ""EWG - Extreme Weapon's Grease"" from the company Slip 2000.   In person (as opposed to shipping this to a buyer), I'll exchange for cash, and cash only.   No personal identification necessary for this item - that'd be weird.  
Please do not contact me with offers to trade.  I will not respond.    I am willing to ship this, and that's not particularly tough with this item as it's not a firearm (just an upper receiver), but don't see where to check to change ""shipping: No"" to a ""yes"" when I create a listing with my free armslist account.  I would receive and cash USPS money order, or Square Cash (the Cash App) before getting the order boxed and shipping it out via USPS. Next paragraph outlines my shipping restrictions (i.e., freedom-states-only)  I will not sell or ship firearms outside of the United States.  I will not ship firearms right to an individual (i.e., bypassing the FFL). I will not ship ammunition to PO Boxes, nor via USPS.  I will not ship ammunition or magazines to California, Connecticut, Alaska, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, or Washington D.C.
The Ugly Part: If you buy something from me, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your use, misuse, application, gifting, regifting, or redistribution of the product.  By purchasing, receiving, or using the product, you agree to indemnify me and hold me harmless should any people, property, firearms, ammunition, magazines, or people's feelings get hurt by the product.  If buying a holster, you agree to check fit and function of the holster(s) with an UNloaded firearm to ensure nothing of the holster, firearm, modifications to either, or external environment factors induce a discharge of the firearm.  If buying ammunition, you agree handle it safely, assume full responsibility for its use and who can access it, and to use it only in appropriately chambered firearms of good working order.   If purchasing a firearm, buyer agrees that I (seller) cannot and should not be able to monitor the use of the firearm anymore (it will no longer be my possession, my responsibility, or any of my business for that matter)."

It is chambered in 5.56 and uses AR/GI magazines. This rifle is quite unique in that it has an adjustable gas regulator, it is built from an RPK trunnion(heavy duty) and runs an 18"", heavy profile barrel for better accuracy. The safety lever has a bolt hold open notch and I have added a magpul grip. I haven't shot it alot and I just bought a house so it unfortunately is on the chopping block. The trigger is little heavy but has a good positive break and case ejection is strong. It's a very well built, very stout rifle. I don't have a picture but it is black and looks like all the other ones out there. FOID is needed as well as DL and 24hr wait. I will have to run your FOID# through the ISP FOID check. 650 obo."
