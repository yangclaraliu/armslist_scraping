If you're a collector, you know what that means. This is the original SKS that came from the factory built to take *modified* AK magazines. It also has a pushbutton hold-open on the bolt. These rifles were imported by Navy Arms. Very few were made (some say only about 500), but they led to the development of the SKS-D and SKS-M models.If you're a collector, you also know that the Type 84 usually comes with a shortened spike bayonet. This one has no provision for a bayonet, and from the look it never has. Instead, it has a threaded, AK-style muzzle brake. I have never seen another Type 84 just like this.These rifles came in paratrooper length with one magazine. The magazine and stock were numbered to match the receiver, and those numbers are all present on this piece. Standard AK magazines can be modifed to work with this rifle. It's not difficult to do, and you can find instructions online. But this is not a rifle you buy for blasting cheap ComBloc ammo. This is a collector.I've seen these go for up to $1,500 on Gunbroker. They don't come up for auction very often, and the last one went for $1,100 using the ""buy it now"" option. I'm only asking $1,000 cash because I would rather avoid the hassle of Gunbroker. You're getting the rifle in excellent condition with no tax, no shipping, no dealer's fees, and no paperwork.If the ad is up, the rifle is still for sale. I will not respond to people who ask.My price is firm. I don't need to sell, so don't bother with lowball offers. I will only sell to a legal, Minnesota buyer. The best way to show that is with a PTP or PTC.Please, SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY."

This gun has always been well taken care of and has had about 300 rounds through it. This is Sigs full sized polymer framed pistol which is modeled after the iconic p226. It is a DA/SA hammered fired gun with decocker. This is a VERY nice gun and one on the best shooting guns that you can ask for. I am only getting rid of this gun to purchase a new carry pistol. If you have never shot a Sig I can tell from experience that any of their guns are way nicer than your typical m&p’s or glocks. It’s like driving a Cadillac compared to a Hyundai. This gun is as accurate as you can be and I have never had a single malfunction with it. Included is the original Sig cardboard box, 1 magazine, and a paddle holster. Feel free to contact me with any questions. All buyers must fill out a bill of sale with a copy of your drivers license, ccw permit holder preferred. Thanks for looking."
