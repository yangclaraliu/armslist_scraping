Based upon the battle-proven SpecterDR design, the SpecterDR 1.5x/6x provides higher magnification to enable greater precision and longer engagement ranges, while at the same time providing exceptional field of view in CQB mode. The SpecterDR 1.5x/6x enjoys ELCAN's famous crystal-clear optics as well as a generous eye relief, making it the ideal instrument for designated marksman rifles and other long range applications. As with all SpecterDR dual field of view combat sights, it switches instantly from a 6x magnified sight to a 1.5x CQB sight with the throw of a lever. Enables greater precision and longer engagement ranges. Optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both modes. User adjustable to illuminate the crosshair or just brilliant red dot in the center. Because the reticles are etched in glass, they are plainly visible even in the case of loss of electrical power due to battery failure or EMP. The SpecterDR family offers the best single solution for Long Range and CQB engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use. Dual-thickness ballistic crosshair reticle with user-selectable red dot and VSOR rangefinder. Battery powered LED illumination with 5 settings (DL 1/3N 3v lithium battery). Integral A.R.M.S. Picatinny mount. 0.5 MOA adjustment. Gray/black hard-anodized aluminum finish. Waterproof and shockproof."
