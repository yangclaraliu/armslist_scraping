Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use. Ultra-SafeUltra-Durable, Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home DefenseDesigned to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.Snag-Free, Modular Design, Loaded with FeaturesLoaded-with-FeaturesThe lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.Easy-to-MaintainReliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to MaintainThis pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.Whether it is for official military and law-enforcement use, for home defense and concealed carry or as an accurate and high-quality pistol for recreational shooting, the PX4 Storm is one piece of gear that will never let you down. It is also available in stainless steel, compact and sub-compact versions--making this line even more versatile for a variety of uses."

This gun comes with all the best parts installed. The machine work was done by Doug at ATEI in Michigan who has been building the baddest work horse pistols for all the top tier instructors for years now. Seriously google him, the work he does is simply the best. He takes the time to machine each RMR specifically to that gun, allowing for the most robust platform on the market today.I am selling everything listed below including a brand new XC1 weapons light as well as 5 mags, holster, mag pouches and all the stock parts (barrel as well). This is a rare chance to buy a truly professionally built RMR Glock in great condition for a deep discount. Gun is about 3 years old has about 400-500 rounds through it tops and only shows the most minor wear on the optic from carry. Comes with the hard cases for both the gun and red dot.I am not looking to part out anything at this time, so please do not ask. Below is a detailed list of what has been added/performed, as well as the approximate prices paid at the time of purchase. The asking price for everything is going to reflect both natural depreciation as well as the fact some of these items such as the WML can now be had for a less.

The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match.  It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Although it’s easy to make and replace. There was a repair to a small crack by the lock at some point before I owned it. Although it’s VERY solid and was never an issue. It’s 160-170 years old. I Wanted to leave in orginal state. History- This gun was HAND made. All the screws, pins, locks, hammer, barrel, and stock. Nipple is original and wide open to the breach. All screws are original and locktite down. It was originally made as a target bench rifle with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes and mount holder on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very very accurate rifle, Bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1850-1860.. The lock is marked R & W.C. Biddle & Co. Philadelphia. This firm was a hardware store and was noted for importing or making hardware, gun locks, and barrels. Barrel is marked with T + F, in German script, believed to be Thomas Fenner, he was a gun maker from Philidephia Penn. 1829-1860 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel (under the rear sight). Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. 500$ cash - I have seen these priced 700-3500$ Hard to price history - Im not wanting to break the bank just a fair trade and hoping to send to a good home. I am open to trades for other firearms. I am looking for a Glock 19 gen 4/5, Browning Hi-power, or a decent 1911. email or text 918-4o2-o854"

The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match.  It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Although it’s easy to make and replace. There was a repair to a small crack by the lock at some point before I owned it. Although it’s VERY solid and was never an issue. It’s 160-170 years old. I Wanted to leave in orginal state. History- This gun was HAND made. All the screws, pins, locks, hammer, barrel, and stock. Nipple is original and wide open to the breach. All screws are original and locktite down. It was originally made as a target bench rifle with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes and mount holder on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very very accurate rifle, Bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1850-1860.. The lock is marked R & W.C. Biddle & Co. Philadelphia. This firm was a hardware store and was noted for importing or making hardware, gun locks, and barrels. Barrel is marked with T + F, in German script, believed to be Thomas Fenner, he was a gun maker from Philidephia Penn. 1829-1860 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel (under the rear sight). Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. 500$ cash - I have seen these priced 700-3500$ Hard to price history - Im not wanting to break the bank just a fair trade and hoping to send to a good home. I am open to trades for other firearms. I am looking for a Glock 19 gen 4/5, Browning Hi-power, or a decent 1911. email or text 918-4o2-o854"

The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match.  It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Although it’s easy to make and replace. There was a repair to a small crack by the lock at some point before I owned it. Although it’s VERY solid and was never an issue. It’s 160-170 years old. I Wanted to leave in orginal state. History- This gun was HAND made. All the screws, pins, locks, hammer, barrel, and stock. Nipple is original and wide open to the breach. All screws are original and locktite down. It was originally made as a target bench rifle with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes and mount holder on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very very accurate rifle, Bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1850-1860.. The lock is marked R & W.C. Biddle & Co. Philadelphia. This firm was a hardware store and was noted for importing or making hardware, gun locks, and barrels. Barrel is marked with T + F, in German script, believed to be Thomas Fenner, he was a gun maker from Philidephia Penn. 1829-1860 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel (under the rear sight). Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. 600$ cash - I have seen these priced 700-3500$ Hard to price history - Im not wanting to break the bank just a fair trade and hoping to send to a good home. I am open to trades for other firearms. I am looking for a Glock 19 gen 4/5, Browning Hi-power, or a decent 1911. email or text 918-4o2-o854"

The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match.  It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Although it’s easy to make and replace. There was a repair to a small crack by the lock at some point before I owned it. Although it’s VERY solid and was never an issue. It’s 160-170 years old. I Wanted to leave in orginal state. -- History- This gun was HAND made. All the screws, pins, locks, hammer, barrel, and stock. Nipple is original and wide open to the breach. All screws are original and locktite down. It was originally made as a target bench rifle with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes and mount holder on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very very accurate rifle, Bore and nipple cleaned for storing. --- Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1850-1860.. The lock is marked R & W.C. Biddle & Co. Philadelphia. This firm was a hardware store and was noted for importing or making hardware, gun locks, and barrels. Barrel is marked with T + F, in German script, believed to be Thomas Fenner, he was a gun maker from Philidephia Penn. 1829-1860 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel (under the rear sight). Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. 600$ cash - I have seen these priced 700-3500$ Hard to price history - Im not wanting to break the bank just a fair trade and hoping to send to a good home. I am open to trades for other firearms. I am looking for a Glock 19 gen 4/5, Browning Hi-power, or a decent 1911. email or text 918-4o2-o854"

The muzzle and front sight post look original to me, but I am not an expert. If it was shortened it looks like a professional job. This has a sporterized stock and non-matching S/N on bolt and other parts, but is in overall good condition. I have shot it and found it reliable and accurate. I will also include the original Lange ""Roller Coaster"" elevating sight. The sight has what appears to be ""battle damage"" (bullet impact) on the right side and seems to be missing one of the push buttons. It still elevates up to the damaged area and appears to be accurate. Very likely this saw WWI service, but can't say for sure. I can meet most weekdays between 9 and 5 at my work.

It was never mounted or used and sat beside the scopes in the safe. I purchased two of them last year and have already sold one. This is in Like New condition and is a great mount. A quick google search will populate tons of solid positive reviews about it. Here are some details about the mount itself: Mounting Surface - 4 Inches Centerline height (top of rail to center of optic) - 30mm - 1.5 Cantiliever - 1.87 Inches Weight : 6.9 ounces The popularity of the mount is paritally due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief. Like all larue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue speed levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. NOTE: The LT 104 will NOT work with any folding rear sight that is over .5"" tall when folded.****PLEASE READThis ad is for ONE mount.

I'm asking $225 for the Model 2202 and $175 for the Model 2212.  REDACTED"

Neither of these is fully functional right now. Both are missing 99% of their finish (originally nickel plated). Various wear to various parts.  One does lock up and appears to function in double-action if you push the trigger forward, but the hammer doesn't cock in single action. At a minimum it seems like the trigger return spring is bad, maybe the hammer spring or internals are out of alignment preventing the hammer from cocking into single-action. This gun is the most complete and would probably take the least work to fix up. The other has more issues including a missing extractor. Not sure what else it needs, but the internals are also having issues. I will throw in an assortment of small parts that might fit these or similar guns, including some extra grips, hammers, triggers, springs, and ""stuff"". I haven't checked to see what parts go with what. Since these are probably over 100 years old, I'm selling them ""as is"" with no guarantees. If you're not a trained gunsmith I would suggest having them inspected by a gunsmith before shooting them. They would also be cool display pieces if you decided not to shoot them and just clean them up. I don't know anything about nickel plating but they'd look pretty cool if you had a way to do that. $100 or best offer (please no super low-ball, I could throw away the frames and get $100 for the rest of the parts on ebay)"
