Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK barrel, giving the Vepr rifles substantially extended service life over AK type rifles. This model of the Vepr AK-47 7.62x39 caliber rifle (FM-AK47-21) is equipped with original Molot factory’s popular left-side folding tubular stock, which comes with a cheek rest and a rubber recoil pad. Its ingenious design provides a reliable and rigid locking mechanism system, which has been deployed on all RPK-based rifles and shotguns by Molot."""

Barrel was heat treated etc. This rifle was used since day one as a wall hanger for decoration in his office.  Only taken down to wipe down every once in a while.  Never seen direct sunlight.  It has never been fired. But I took it to a gunsmith and had him look it over. He said it's ready to fire and should do just fine.  I don't have a use for this. And it deserves someone that will use it, collect it, or hang it on their wall.  Rather than packed away in a case under a bed.  I have more photos available of it.  Just ask.   Also will take any specific photos a serious buyer would want.  Price is firm !Email or TEXT 513-708-428two Thanks"

Unfortunately I bought it this way and do not have the original wood, box magazine, nor the original dust cover, the bayonet has also been removed but still has the lugs for it. I do not have the bayonet. Accepts DUCK bill magazines, not Ak mags.Other than that it's a great rifle. This sks will look great in its original format OR just keep it the way it is. Paratrooper sks's are getting hard to find these days, will make nice addition to a sks collection! 300MUST be local. CowetaThanks"

The gun comes with everything pictured plus the blue factory case.  The Rami magazines are all 8-round capacity; two of them have the pinky extension base plates.  The larger magazine is a Mec-Gar .40 S&W 10-round magazine for the CZ-75, but it will fit the Rami and all other metal-framed .40 S&W CZ models.  If you want to talk about a trade, check below.  My bills are paid here, so lowballing me is not going to get you anywhere.  I work nights and my days off are spread out, but I can usually work something out.  If you reload or are thinking of giving it a try, I'll throw in a set of Hornady 40 S&W/10mm Auto dies with the gun if you'd like.  Buyers must be over the age of 21 with valid Ohio identification and reasonably close to Columbus or Mansfield.  Thanks for checking it out."

The previous owner who never fired the upper bought this SL version midlength handguard not realizing that this only fits a ROUND front handguard retaining cap. This upper, like most mids, has a TRIANGULAR cap. So he modified and made some cuts in the polymer inside the handguard so it would fit the TRIANGULAR cap. When I got the upper I immediately took them off and put the old school handguards back on. SO this will fit either a ROUND or TRIANGULAR cap but is only designed to fit the ROUND one. Take a look at the pics so you can see the modification the guy made. IF mounted on a midlength upper with ROUND cap you will not be able to see his modification. SO cosmetically the cuts would be under the ROUND cap and not seen. Other than that the Handguard is as NEW. I can't find a mark on it, it's look better than some I've pulled new out of the box.
