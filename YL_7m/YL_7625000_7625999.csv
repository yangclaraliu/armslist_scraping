The good: 
It's a 1921 Vintage American made side-by-side shotgun. The only one with the same engraving I can find on Gunbroker is listed for $3250 (for sale), and I found an identical one that sold for $1100 on a different site. Asking price is significantly lower. I just never shoot it because I have a perfectly good Ithaca 37. The bad: 
It has 2 1/2"" chambers. I'll include the chamber gauge I bought for it from Brownells. There IS ammo available from a company called RST which isn't all that expensive, but you're not going to find it in Wal-Mart. ~ $11.00/box. 
It was getting some light surface rust when I picked it up (I bought it from a personal friend it was handed down to...and personal friend is definitely NOT a ""gun guy""). It's basically been bathing in CLP since then and looks fine now.

I can't give an honest opinion because of the limited amount of rounds. Other than I have close to $900 in a Glock! I hear it's snappy and the Stipple job works out really well for this caliber along with the index trigger cut and the second undercut. Feel free to ask any questions.

This is quality Smith & Wesson design through and through. All parts are made by S&W in the U.S., resulting in a .22 pistol truly worthy of the M&P designation.
The M&P 22 Compact is entirely American made at the factory in Springfield, Massachusetts. S&W has placed new emphasis on the M&P line of products, stressing its commitment to engineering and manufacturing this series to higher professional standards. That means that you and I get better-performing, more reliable products. The M&P22 Compact is included in this new directive, and S&W’s efforts were not wasted on this pistol.
 
This M&P 22 Compact weighs 15.3 ounces and is extremely well balanced. It fits like it was tailor-made for your hands. You’d be hard pressed to think of any pistol that feels this good, including Smith & Wesson’s very own Shield. The slide is 7075 T651 aluminum and coated with a black, hard-anodizing finish. The slide is cut on top, near the rear of the barrel hood, making for a loaded-chamber indicator, although I find that it’s tough to see a chambered round through it.
The uniquely designed captured recoil spring and guide rod aid in superb functioning and simplify disassembly and cleaning.
S&W opted for an 18-degree grip angle on their polymer frames. Through its research, this is the angle it deemed ideal for accurate, more natural aiming and shooting. If you’ve had a chance to shoot a standard-size M&P, you know how well this works. The M&P 22 Compact has the same 18-degree grip angle and pointability attributes of its siblings.
Threaded barrel: An adapter will be necessary to bring the barrel’s threading up to 1/2×28 inches for suppressor fitment. The supplied muzzle cap is needed for proper pistol functioning without a suppressor.
Smith & Wesson gave the M&P 22 Compact a 3.56-inch carbon-steel barrel that is fixed within the frame. It is also threaded should you want to attach a suppressor for some quieter shooting. Threads are 3⁄8×24, thus you will need a 1⁄2×28 adapter supplied from the suppressor company of your choice.
Safeties: ambidextrous manual thumb safety, trigger safety and magazine safety, so it can’t be fired without a mag. The manual safety is a great place to rest your strong-hand thumb, and you’ll be less likely to induce a malfunction. There is also an internal lock-out safety.
Sights: The M&P 22 Compact is equipped with three-dot-style sights. The dots are bold, crisp and easily acquired while shooting.
Picatinny-style rail that is molded into its polymer frame, perfect for the fitment of a laser or other accessory.

The Glock 23 is compact version (a shorter then the full-sized Glock 22). 
Identical in size to the Glock model 19/
The trigger on a Glock is very usable right out of the box.  This one has about half an inch of travel before a nice clean break. 
Barrel: Includes Glock’s excellent polygonal rifling.
The 13 round magazines are typical to the Glock -- superb.  The polymer bodies have stainless liners.  They are easy to clean, durable, easy to find, easy to load, slick sided (which makes dropping an empty from the gun as easy as slipping a full mag from a holster).
Accuracy with the .40-caliber Glock 23 is on par with that of the 19.
HUGE number of holster options for the Glock 23.  Everyone makes one.

This gun is in 95/100 condition and only has a few very small indications that it was used.

The barrel had some minor rust starting on it from the previous owner but i did my best to clean it all up. The only thing that I don't like is the previous owner put a aftermarket trigger guard on it that looks like it was too small but it doesnt effect the shooting at all it just doesnt look right but the replacement part is only $10 from the gun shop I spoke to about it. (I WILL HAVE PICTURES OF THIS TO SHOW YOU). It is a bolt action and a top load so no magazine. The scope is a Firefield 10-40x50 in great shape its only 2 years old....Any questions just ask"

The gun is in great condition I have only used it for a few hunts. The gun just doesn’t fit me right. It comes with all the original chokes as well as a pattern master classic long range choke. Also comes with the shims, choke wrench and recoil reducer. Asking 550 obo or trade for a gas operated shotgun. Text at REDACTED."
