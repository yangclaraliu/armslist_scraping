Not concerned whether its a mark 2, 3, or 4. Just need it to be stainless and preferably a 6 7/8"" barrel but 5 1/2"" will do. Will only consider bull barrel(heavy barrel), slab side, or fluted. I do not want a 22/45. I want the traditional style mark. I do not want one with the tapered barrel. I would prefer the standard black polymer grips but they're replaceable so it doesn't really matter. If you have anything that resembles what I have described, dont hesitate. I've called every pawn shop and gun store in the state of TN looking for one. They're all either sold before I get to them, overpriced, or blue steel. So please, contact me if you want to sell your ruger. I'm prompt with responses. If it seems you indeed have what I'm looking for, ill provide my number. Thanks"

Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability, and pairs with the elevation adjustable front sight for a solid, reliable aiming system. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. (Model 8502 features a fixed stock.)   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.     Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug (excludes 8502), for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance.   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.     Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.   Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul® PMAG®."

Chambered in the powerful 10mm cartridge, this stainless steel pistol has a 5"" barrel, factory adjustable sights and factory bead blasted finish. Known for their strength and durability, this is one of S&W's Third Generation pistols that has been out of production for many years. This one left the Smith & Wesson factory sometime between 1990 and 1993. It comes with two factory 9 round magazines and the original box. The box does not contain any original paperwork or the cleaning kit. This gun has been shot. The exact round count is unknown, as I am not the original owner. It does have a few marks from normal use, all of which are minor. I conservatively estimate the condition at 94-96%. It has been well taken care of. I have several pictures that I can e-mail to potentially serious buyers. This gun is for sale for $825.00 (cash only). Buyer must be a SC resident that is at least 21 years old. Valid SC drivers license required. CWP preferred. Buyer must sign a bill of sale. I may consider trades for the firearms listed below, with the ability to add cash for the right trade(s). I am willing to drive a reasonable distance from my home in Florence for the right deal. I will not ship. Face to face transaction in a safe place, only. Low ball offers will be ignored. Thanks for looking.Possibly interested in the following trades:Pre-lock Smith & Wesson revolvers, especially N and L frames (no .32 or .38)Unmolested 9mm Glock 17, 19, 34, not interested in other Glock models / calibersBrowning Superposed O/U shotgunUnmolested heavy barreled Remington 700 in .308 ( 16.5"" or 20"" barrel)"
