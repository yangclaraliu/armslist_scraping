Built by Tula in 1905* and used by the Finnish military (SA) and civil guard (~S~). The rifle was built during the Russo-Japanese war, but I doubt it saw service since the war ended in 1905. Being that there is no Finnish capture mark I believe that this rifle was in Finnland when it broke off from the Soviet Union. From what I can tell the stock was replaced sometime in the interwar period, If you look at the butt of the stock in the right light you can see there was the number ""66"" written in grease pen for some time. Rear sight has been remarked with meters on the right hand side with arshin marked out, as is traditional with Finnish Mosins. The original sling mounts are not shown in the photo but are included. This rifle has the best trigger I’ve ever seen on a stock mosin, and is accurate enough to shoot 1.5 inch groups if you do your part. This rifle is CLEAN of cosmoline and the internals of the bolt have been polished to make the action as smooth as possible you don’t have to hit this one to get the bolt to open and close like with many other mosins. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Included with this rifle will be a front sight adjustment tool."

The SLR is a semi-automatic version of the Colt BAR. The SLR comes in an Italian leather-bound display case. Two 20 rd mags, Leather sling, and a cleaning kit. It is chambered in 30-06, has an overall length of 47?, and weighs 16 pounds. These are EXTREMELY LIMITED PRODUCTION and very hard to get.The consideration put into this rifle's finished quality is fantastic. No other modern self-loading rifle is made to these standards- bar none. The fit, finish, blueing, and overall attention to detail is mind-blowing to find in the 21st century. Sparing no expense whatsoever, Colt & Ohio Ordnance produced what can only be described as a work of art. Even the case is fine Italian leather.Insured flat shipping available on request for extra $40. And note that gun may only be shipped to FFL Holders only within the state."

In the Colt booth at Shot Show 2015, there was a display of the Colt SLR... A preview of things to come. The SLR is made by Ohio Ordnance Works under license by Colt. The SLR is a semi-automatic version of the Colt BAR. The SLR comes in an Italian leather-bound display case. Two 20 rd mags, Leather sling, and a cleaning kit. It is chambered in 30-06, has an overall length of 47?, and weighs 16 pounds. These are EXTREMELY LIMITED PRODUCTION and very hard to get.The consideration put into this rifle's finished quality is fantastic. No other modern self-loading rifle is made to these standards- bar none. The fit, finish, blueing, and overall attention to detail is mind-blowing to find in the 21st century. Sparing no expense whatsoever, Colt & Ohio Ordnance produced what can only be described as a work of art. Even the case is fine Italian leather.Insured flat shipping available on request for extra $40. And note that gun may only be shipped to FFL Holders only within the state."
