No IDs, no sale. http://oldmilitarymarkings.com/japanese_markings.htmlThe Japanese manufactured over 6.4 million rifles and carbines in the 40 years from 1906 to 1945. Most of these rifles were still in use during the Sino-Japanese War of the 1930s and the Pacific War of the 1940s. During the war and subsequent American occupation of Japan, thousands of these rifles found their way to the United States as war souvenirs, making them one of the most common foreign military firearms available in the country.The Arisaka rifles are named for Colonel Nariaki Nariakira Arisaka, who headed a commission during the 1890s which was charged with developing a new rifle to replace the earlier models such as the Murata. The Arisaka rifles were designated with the year of the current emperor's reign. Thus, the Type 38 rifle was designed in the 38th year of the reign of Emperor Meiji (1905), and the Type 44 carbine was adopted in the 44th year of his reign (1911). During the reign of Hirohito, rifles were designated by the last one or two digits of the adoption year according to the standard Japanese calendar. Thus, the Type 99 rifle was adopted in Japanese calendar year 2599 (1939), and the Type 2 paratroop rifle was adopted in calendar year 2602 (1942).A chrysanthemum with 16 petals (the symbol of the Japanese Emperor) was usually stamped on the receiver of rifles manufactured for the Imperial Japanese Army, indicating that the rifle belonged to the Emperor."

You get a better deal by grabbing both.AK-74 by Waffen Werks built on a Bulgarian parts kit. It's 922r compliant and I believe has an American-made chrome-lined barrel w/ muzzle brake. Stock furniture is ""Grade B"", which I happen to think gives the rifle character. This rifle is chambered for 5.45x39mm, and in the picture it's sitting on top of a crate of around 1,830 surplus steel-core 7N6 cartridges. It prefers to feed the Russian surplus stuff; I've tried shooting Red Army Standard and Wolf ammo and I get failures to feed and extract. It was also tight when I first bought it, but I've wore the chamber down by running a few hundred cartridges through it, so maybe it'd feed them more reliably now. You could help it along easily by just polishing the chamber a bit with a lapping compound.Rifle comes with three magazines: 2 Bulgarian Circle 21 polymer mags and 1 Tapco. I replaced the original grip with a Hogue, which is more comfortable and has a storage compartment. Also included is an original Polish AK sling, a UTG Rubber recoil-pad, and the butt-stock cleaning kit. In general it's in good exterior/cosmetic condition and only has some light rust on the muzzle brake due to corrosive ammo. I haven't shot it or cleaned it in a while besides running water down the barrel to wash out corrosive salts, so it may need a bit of TLC.I'd prefer to sell it all as a package, but I can part things out if necessary. The crate the ammo comes in is included. This is a lot of firepower and I'm admittedly a bit uncomfortable just handing it over in a parking lot for cash. I'd kind of prefer to go through an FFL, but could settle for some sort of assurance (showing me your ID to verify you're a FL resident and maybe swapping contact info).You can text me at REDACTED if you like. I take a while to respond to/check emails. Thanks!"

I also have a Firearm Bill of Sale you must sign that will require a driver's license or concealed weapons permit. Also, if I receive any odd or strange vibes from the purchaser then I will cancel abruptly and without notice. This includes randomly changing times on me, insisting on meeting at late hours, being resistant to meeting somewhere public, tattoos that come off as gang-like, etc. I know it seems like I am taking a lot of precaution, but I will do whatever I can to try and make sure that my firearm gets sold to a responsible, honest citizen. Preferred contact method by email."
