The gun came with only one magazine so I purchased 3 more.  One box of ammo through the gun works great very accurate. $250 for 1 magazine as it originally came or $320 for everything. Consider trade for a 22lr semi auto pistol with threaded barrel.

Bought it here to hunt with but it's just too nice to beat up in the truck or 4 wheeler. Plus I've already got a beater for that. So figured I'd offer this one up for sale or a FTF trade here in NC. I currently travel from Burgaw to the Rockingham area regularly. Story goes that it has less than a box of ammo shot thru it and I have no reason to believe otherwise. The blueing is immaculate and the only flaws my untrained eyes see are the safe dings in the wood which I have pictures of. Would just as soon trade for something. Lemme know if you have any further questions or want more pics. My account only allows for 3. I'll be needing to see something that sez you're eligable to purchase a firearm.

829,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7273829,For Sale:  M1 Garand,"West Newbury, Massachusetts, United States","$ 1,900","Listed On: Friday, September 1, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling my Springfield armory M1 Garand. According to the serial number it was manufactured some time in February of 1944. I have no doubt that it was used in the service. It's fully functional, accurate, and is really fun to shoot. There is also a unique feature that this gun has- after WWII ended there were a lot extra of service rifles that military had on their hands. Up until the development of the M14 the garand was still one of the most effective battle rifles in the world. However, the U.S. Was looking to switch to a NATO caliber (7.62x51) to serve in place of the standard 30-06. Because of that, in the early 50s the navy discovered that a Garand could actually shoot 7.62x51 ammunition by simply switching the barrel for one with a 7.62x51 chamber. This worked surprisingly well and probably would have become more popular if it weren't for the introduction of the M14. There are many advantages to having this gun be able to shoot 7.62x51 ammo. First of all, the Ammo is significantly cheaper and more plentiful. Second, 7.62x51 (.308) will perform more historically accurate to an original 30-06 Garand. Why?, because 30-06 and 7.62x51 shoot the same exact bullet (literally, the same exact bullet). The only difference between the two cartridges is the case length. Despite the difference in length, the 7.62x51 bullets travel at the same speed as a 30-06 would have back in WWII (about 2,800 feet per second) because of the use of modern gunpowder. Modern 30-06 is more of a dedicated hunting cartridge now and because of this it's increased power will actually cause damage to an M1 Garand (it will bend the op rod). The 7.62x51 Ammo even fits in the same clips as the 30-06 rounds. This is why its better to have Garand's chambered in 7.62x51. Besides, if for some reason you really want it to be chambered in 30-06, all you have to do is switch barrels which takes about 5-10 minutes tops. I also have a few accessories for this gun. One is a bayonet from the Korean War, the other is a muzzle break which works very, very well. It quite literally brings the recoil and muzzle rise of the gun down into the realm of an Ar15 chambered in 5.56. If you are interested in this gun don't hesitate to send me an email. For the most part I am not interested in trades. The only trades I might consider are for a motorcycle made by triumph or possibly Harley Davidson."
