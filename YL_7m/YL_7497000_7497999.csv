In addition to being widely utilized by federal, state and municipal law enforcement agencies, it is also the handgun that has significance in the history of the company itself. In particular, the P229 was the first pistol SIG manufactured in America, when the company opened its plant in New Hampshire. Until then, the German/Swiss gun maker imported all its firearm to the American market. Now, for a limited time, Lew Horton Distributing is offering a version of the double/single-action pistol as unique as its background. The Massachusetts wholesaler is selling its final order of Special Edition SIG P229 Blue Piranha. The Horton exclusive features a striking slide, finished in a bright blue PVD finish. And while this process gives the P229 a glossy and classic look, the finish does more than just add glitz. PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) is able to deliver a harder and more corrosion-resistant coating than most other processes used today. In addition to the eye-catching finish, the Blue Piranha version of the SIG P229 also features G-10 Piranha Grips. From there, the pistol shares features common to this model of SIG. These include: front and rear cocking serrations, 3.9-inch barrel, SIGLITE night sights and an accessory rail. The Horton exclusive is available only in 9mm, though SIG does offer the P229 in two other calibers — .40S&W and .357SIG. Production of the Blue Piranha was limited to 500 units. The pistols ship with two 15-round magazines and have an MSRP of $1,299.  Sig Sauer P229 Blue Piranha 9mm"

First up is a rare find in todays market place. From 1981 I present to you all a West Hurley produced 1927A1 deluxe semi-automatic sporting carbine, capable of holding anywhere between a 20rd sporting magazine, to a 100rd sporting drum magazine! The example shown here is in VG condition considering the age. After 36 years, I have a few scars too, but this gem is in real nice condition! This rifle appears to have been fired very little, if at all, outside of the factory testing prior to shipping. There are a few rub marks, and handling marks which presents great patina to this historical rifle for which you all have a chance to bid on today! There are no loose parts, everything is fitted properly, and unlike the cheaper lightweight model of the same year, this specimen was milled from solid steel. A rifle for a real man to handle. And with both a rear grip, and a vertical grip, it's fairly easy to sweep your sporting targets with one of the enclosed 50rd drums, reminiscent of a bygone era, of the likes America had never seen before."

The condition is used but not abused, the bore is bright and shiny, the finish on the slide has faded and shows scratches but the wording is Sharpe and deep, the receiver is also faded with a lot of bluing loss on the area near the grips, the replacement magazine looks almost new and is not marked, overall this one is a shooter and all safeties work (slide and grip), it is a type III and will add to any collection, I got this off the internet: MODEL 1903 POCKET (MODEL M .32 ACP) .32 ACP cal., 3 3/4 Type III - 32 ACPs do not have a barrel bushing and were mfg. from 1910-1926.

All were on my rotation so would typically be worn 4-5 times per month at most, all were purchased this year. For full watch functions, details, movements, just google the model numbers. Too much info to list and its already easily available on the internet. More pictures available to interested parties upon request.$300 cash. Seiko automatic SRPA82K1 also know as a Baby Tuna, nothing baby about it though. Comes complete with box, booklets, original rubber strap (some scrapes on the gold keeper) and a nice heavy aftermarket black steel bracelet (some scrapes on the bracelet but nothing major). The bracelet comes with all of the original links included, currently sized for a 7"" wrist. This is a large watch at almost 52mm but since the lugs are built into the case itself it wears very comfortably on the wrist, I like big watches and have no issues whatsoever pulling this off on my medium sized 7"" wrist. The heavy steel bracelet helps to counter balance the watch so it doesn't sit lop sided either. Selling because I also bought the stainless version and decided to keep that one instead. $150 cash. Casio G-Shock GW9400-3CR Rangeman. Very cool digital watch thats built for anything you can possibly throw at it. Has atomic time keeping (sets itself to correct time every night) and is solar powered so you never need to replace the battery. The negative display is neat and easy to read during the day, not as legible at night but thats why it has a light button and is solar powered so you dont have to worry about running your battery dry. Bought another all purpose ""G"" so dont wear this one as much anymore. Comes complete with original boxes and booklets, no scrapes on the crystal. Some scratches on the steel keeper and maybe a ding or two on the case, still looks almost new.$160 cash. Heimdallr, Sharkey v2.0, Sea Shepherd, SBBN015 Homage (copy) watch. This is a basically a very nice copy of the Seiko Tuna, watch is made out of stainless steel, has a domed AR coated sapphire crystal and runs on an automatic NH35 movement which is made by Seiko. The attention to detail is excellent, everything is aligned very well (which I cant say about any of my Seikos :) and it keeps good time. Comes with the box, basic bracelet tool and 1 extra link for the bracelet. The steel band on this runs a bit small and I only had to remove the one link to get a loose fit on my 7"" wrist. Bought it for fun and just to see if I like the original Tuna design."

The custom Magpul Zhukov forward hand guard had to be custom hand fitted to correctly fit the Saiga 308 as the 308 barrel is larger than the AK47/AK74 barrel that the Magpul Zhukov M-Lok hand guard was originally made for.The Midwest Industries railed gas tube, also standard for the AK47/AK74, was also hand fitted to function properly with peak performance on the Saiga 308.The 22"" barrel was threaded 5/8x24 and the crown reprofiled to accept the ""Suppressor Ready"" AAC Blackout 51T muzzle brake and the front sight tower repositioned and re-pinned.The safety lever was knotched out so to also function as a bolt hold open feature.All exterior metal was given a protective 3 color Cerakote finish with color fill engraving.Additional custom modifications and accessories include the Magpul Zhukov Folding & Adjustable stock with (2) snap on modular cheek risers, the Hogue AK47 rubberized pistol grip, the Midwest Industries Gen 2 QD top picatinny rail scope mount,  the adjustable to 1000 yard AK47 3-White Dot rear leaf sight,  the Magpul Zhukov M-Lok forward hand guard with QD sling mount and M-Lok Ergo grip covers, a Tru-Glow pivoting Bi-Pod, and the AAC Blackout 51T ""Suppressor Ready"" stainless steel nitride coated muzzle brake.It comes with (3) 20rnd., (1) 25rnd. and (1) 8rnd., for a total of (5) Magazines and ships in a Hard rifle case.Manufacturer: Izhmash Model: Saiga 308 Caliber: .308 Condition: New"
