It's basically all Aero Precision with the exception of the BCM KMR, 13"" keymod free floating hand guard, barrel, which is a Ballistic Advantage 16"" Mid-Length, gas block, which is a Geissele gas block bought new from the gunsmith, bolt carrier group, bought new from the same gunsmith, and pistol grip, which is a Spike's Tactical, which you guessed it, same smith. All and all it's had about less than 175 and some odd rounds put through it, and has had a good life so far. Overall condition is excellent.   Down to business, though I'm asking $650 or buyer’s best offer, I'm not interested in trades, however, if you have a offer, tell me what you got and I'll let you know if I'm intrested but it would have to be in my benefit. Example, I'm not interested in your grand pappy’s hand me down single shot .22 caliber rifles and $100, and I'm in NO hurry to sell this item, since my girlfriend is not pregnant and the rent is not due. If you’re interested in this item just shoot me a message via contact seller tab and let me know if you’re interested. I will need to see your IN state issue driver's license and your IN gun permit, nothing will be recorded but I'd like to see them. I would like to keep this located on the South-Side of Indianapolis at my discretion and if you get the heebie jeebies going to a police station or federal building, then this item is not for you. For the here and now I WILL NOT ship this rifle to your FFL.
Thanks for looking at my ad and have a good day.Edit- Got some e-mails regarding magazines. It comes with two new in packaging 30rd magpul pmags. Also regarding the price,  you could buy a new AR for this price but consider state taxes and the possibility of a transfer fee and shipping if you order online. You're still not getting hurt by getting this rifle that's already got the upgrades that some people are looking for."

The improvement reduces projectile deformation as it passes through the bore during the firing sequence and the projectile stays uniform instead of squeezing material on opposite side grooves. Hence, the more uniform projectile, the better the accuracy. All Finished Barrels go through a 100% Inspection Process. Inspections Equipment includes CMMs and Air Gauges for the Bores. Our expectations is that our Barrels, 16 inch or longer, will hold a 1.000"" MOA at 100 yards with appropriate ammo and shooting techniques.

The improvement reduces projectile deformation as it passes through the bore during the firing sequence and the projectile stays uniform instead of squeezing material on opposite side grooves. Hence, the more uniform projectile, the better the accuracy. All Finished Barrels go through a 100% Inspection Process. Inspections Equipment includes CMMs and Air Gauges for the Bores.

The improvement reduces projectile deformation as it passes through the bore during the firing sequence and the projectile stays uniform instead of squeezing material on opposite side grooves. Hence, the more uniform projectile, the better the accuracy. All Finished Barrels go through a 100% Inspection Process. Inspections Equipment includes CMMs and Air Gauges for the Bores. Our expectations is that our Barrels, 16 inch or longer, will hold a 1.000"" MOA at 100 yards with appropriate ammo and shooting techniques.

Beautiful walnut wood stock. You determine the condition.
This is essentially the Mossberg Model 346K, but made for Western Field (now defunct Montgomery Ward’s store brand of firearms).
Rifle has a 24.5” barrel, shoots very nice, and is inherently accurate, as is typical for these Mossbergs.
When you see the wood, you might agree that it’s uncommon for a Department Store rifle to have such nice walnut. Frankly, even the walnut on newer long guns rarely come close to this.
It is tube fed, and will handle .22 Short, .22 Long, and .22 Long Rifle, mix and match!
It would be a fun plinking gun for the whole family or a teenager’s first firearm. Bolt actions and single shots teach a youngster patience.
$160 or first reasonable sounding offer. Will consider ammo and cash.
No waiting. No sales tax. No shipping charges. No FFL transfer fees.
__________
Buyer will need to quickly show me a valid TX Driver’s License or TX CHL, and sign a simple Bill of Sale indicating only that you showed me your current DL and or CHL. -> Nothing besides your name and the gun info will be on it. I’d be more than happy to send you a copy so you can see what mine looks like.
Gun was transferred through an FFL, meaning I cleared the NICS, making both me and the gun clean.
Bill of Sale will prove you legally own it and protects you henceforth.
