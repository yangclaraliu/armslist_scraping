It comes with (2) 13 round magazines. The slide and barrel are new. Bul Firearms are made in Israel. They are the makers of the Magnum Research Desert Eagle 1911 and Baby Eagle III.The M5 pistol was developed in 1991-92 timeframe by a private Israeli company called Bul Ltd. Manufacturing of this gun commenced in 1994 and ever since it became quite popular as sporting (IPSC and IDPA), self-defense and service weapon, used by numerous police and special military forces around the world, to include Latin America, Asia and Europe. Produced in a wide spectrum of modifications, Bul M5 pistols combine time-proven design and ergonomics of legendary US M1911A1 pistol with most modern materials and production techniques.  Bul M5 is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses Browning-type tilting barrel locking with single swinging link that connects breech of the barrel with the frame. Wide-body frame is produced from impact-resistant polymer and can accommodate any caliber available in M5 product line without any changes (obviously, caliber change requires swapping barrels, magazines, springs and possibly slides). The single-action trigger system is same as in M1911A1 pistol, providing high accuracy potential and efficient safety measures, combining manual frame-mounted safety and automated grip safety. Pistols utilize double-stack high capacity magazines.   Sales tax will be 6.75%Credit Card pruchases add 3%Face to Face pick up is available.

Two toned and well cared for and it is the later model with an F serial number.  This gun is patterned after the P226 and is only 10% smaller than the P226 so in your hand this gun feels like a compact 9mm not a little toy like so many 22 guns. The breakdown is just rotating one lever making cleaning a breeze.  I polished machining marks on the internals and polished the feed ramp, changed the recoil spring to the supplied lighter one and the trigger is now smooth and I have had no failure to feeds or jams of any kind.  I usually shoot Mini Mags but ran a box of Remington Golden Bullets through it just to try a different brand before listing the gun. It is now far superior to a new one in my opinion. The sale includes the gun, one magazine, two additional front sights of different heights to customize the gun to you and your ammo, the paperwork, the heavy recoil spring, the safety lockout key, and of course the all important cable lock. Internet reviews are mixed but with the work done to it this is an excellent gun with the big gun feel but in 22 so it’s affordable to shoot and enjoy. Any questions or to see it let me know. The small print: Cash only and I must see photo ID showing IN residence. Also you must be legally able to purchase and own a handgun in Indiana. We must meet face to face and no shipping."

Selling my brand new NEVER FIRED (except for when the manufacturer test fire which all manufacturers do.) FDE FN SCAR 16. Firearms I really like I buy multiples of so one can remain in perfect condition which this FDE FN SCAR 16s is. The only reason I am selling is simply because like I said, I have multiples and I have a lot of 5.56 rifles so I'm making room for my new projects. All FN SCAR 16s (5.56) are hard to find because of how popular they are and because FN only ships a small amount every so often and so the FDE SCARS are even harder to find. If you haven't ever fired a FN SCAR then you don't know what your missing. The FN SCAR has extremely light recoil, is smooth, and fast shooting.The SCAR truly is amazingly fun and easy rifle to shoot, plus everybody Can't help but wanna look and touch. I am strictly selling because I have multiples and need to make room for new project, therefore I am pretty firm on price. But POSSIBLY willing to have a LITTLE bit of wiggle room. It comes with everything that comes w it from factory when purchased (ex: mag, manual, etc.)I am in Santa Fe and so you must meet me in Santa Fe.

Trigger Bar, Minus Connector, and Ejector are properly deburred, polished, and plated with NP3.The Overwatch Precision TAC Trigger is a flat-faced, direct drop-in replacement for your OEM trigger. Each trigger shoe and trigger safety tab is machined in the USA out of 7075-T6 aluminum alloy, and affixed to an NP3 plated, Gen 3 OEM trigger bar by 316 Stainless Steel coiled spring pins. The trigger shoe and safety tab are both Type III hard coat anodized to MIL-A-8625 standard.The small indexing hook ensures consistent trigger finger placement, and the broad, flat face of the trigger allows a uniquely self-correcting, straight rearward press. The flat face reduces trigger reach by 0.24″, making this an ideal option for smaller statured shooters. Pre-travel has been reduced as much as possible without compromising firearm safety features, resulting in a clean, crisp break, and reduced overtravel. Robar’s NP3 plating provides virtually impermeable corrosion resistance and smooth, grit-free operation. Note that trigger pull weight does not change from factory weight with the use of this trigger alone.End Result: This trigger is a tank. A sexy tank. Just in case you were wondering, the only difference between the Tac trigger and the DAT trigger is the small lip on the bottom of the Tac. Otherwise they are identical both form and function wise."

It is very accurate. I am also including a 30 round magpul magazine and an Archangel assault gun case. The gun has NO scratches on it and you can't tell it from new. I have not modified it in any way (except for optics). It functions perfectly, you won't have any problems with it. It comes with the factory box, owners manual and gun locks. Call Derek at REDACTED if you are interested. My asking price is $750.00, cash only and you must have a valid Utah Drivers License to buy."
