The Mark 4 High Accuracy Multi-Range scope from Leupold is a fixed power scope that is ideal for military and law enforcement operators and features an illuminated CM-R2 reticle. Though it is a fixed power rifle scope, the High Accuracy Multi-Range (HAMR) scope is highly versatile, with the high light transmission rates of the Xtended Twilight Lens System and the scratch-resistant power of DiamondCoat 2 lens coatings on all exterior lens surfaces. The Leupold Mark 4 High Accuracy Multi-Range 4x24 Rifle Scope is designed for any rifle to add speed and accuracy with ease of use. The Mark 4 Rifle Scopes is guaranteed to be waterproof and is immune to interior fogging, giving you a constantly clear optic for precision accuracy is the most low-visibility conditions. Due to its medium-range magnification, the HAMR excels at mid-to-close range tactical situations.  The top-mounted Delta Point red-dot sight is made with a lightweight aluminum housing, while the aspheric lens generates a wide field-of-view with some of the best image quality ever seen in a reflex sight. Patented Motion Sensor Technology inside of the Leupold DeltaPoint Reflex Sight discerns any movement of the sight and automatically activates the illumination, which is inset into a light tunnel to reduce the light signature in tactical situations. This scope comes complete with everything that came from the manufacturer (including warranty card and Leupold window decal) and is in near-perfect condition.  And here's a little secret: The protective hood that covers the Delta Point sight is only available from someone who bought the HAMR/Delta Point combo.  The HAMR's that are still available don't come with it, and Leupold won't sell it separately. Oh, and the HAMR isn't available directly from Leupold anymore unless you are a large-scale military/law enforcement contract.If you have any questions or would like any more pictures, just let me know.I will ship this sight to a serious buyer.  Contact me to make arrangements."

While there are many listings now on Gunbroker, they will go super fast as soon as there is ban talk and who knows these days. Put aside 50 or 100 for future use. I did not tumble or clean these as they are very smooth and the sealant marks and black tip are part of what they are. No pull marks as they were collet pulled (I have 50 150gr ones with pull marks and its obvious). I set the price lower than the average of the last several ones sold. These have a steel penetrator core and are magnetic. Thats why the weight is a bit lower as steel weighs less than lead. You never know when you may want to load some rounds to take out engine blocks or punch through some steel plate. Cant hurt to have 100 set aside for the future. There are no more being made for civilian use so when these relics dry up that is it.SHIPPING $7.25 PriorityI have a second bag that can ship at no additional shipping!!"

The early El Monte guns are referred to as the best as quality control was at its peak before AMT had financial issues. This is the original single action design and the magazine is the original design with the metal finger groove and single witness hole. Again, the best as the ones with plastic finger extensions are iffy. This is a low cost pistol though and not a true collector gun, but some folks just love their pocket pistols. I have owned many of these and the predecessor OMC pistols and I love the all-stainless heavy metal gun feel. It weighs over double the weight of a Ruger LCP but there is NOTHING exciting or cool about those. These look like a shrunken Hardballer (their 45) or a baby Browning scaled up. It has a grip safety and a thumb safety and this one has zero ledge or roughness from feed-ramp to chamber. It has the original brown wood grips and like most (look at the others) the lettering on the slide is faded but still clear and complete.This pistol was disassembled down to every pin, spring and part. Only the bolt was left complete, and every part was cleaned, checked and oiled. I replaced the disconnector spring as it was no good and every other spring and part checks out fine. The bore is perfect as it should be and it is ready to go.Buying this older pistol has no worries as every part is good to go and free of corrosion. You would be surprised what the inner parts of many of these look like as many were pocket carried or tossed around in a drawer or glove box. Thats why the slides show wear but these are all stainless! Priced right at the average of recent sales.SHIPPING--Ships Priority from my FFL as it is a lot less than shipping handguns next day air or whatever they require.

The rifle has a lower serial numberand functions flawlessly with steel cased, brass cased andanything you throw at it can be adjusted via the adjustable gas system.Gun has seen a couple hundred rounds but is in overall great functional shape.Guns.com did a great write up on these.Id like to get $900 for the rifle. I have looked on armslist nationwide and see the few out there are pulling $800-1100 without any upgrades in most cases. Buds guns sold this bone stock for $799 when they were originaly imported.The specs are from the manufacturer as follows: From Century Arms comes the latest in the PAP line ofAK-47s; the M90NP. The M90 is a Semi-automatic version ofthe Yugoslavian AK-74 in .223 Remington (5.56x45mm). Itfeatures an 18.25"" threaded barrel with a traditionalslant brake, a thicker 1.5mm receiver and the cool bulged RPK-typetrunion everyone wants. The Serbians are building the M90NPwith an adjustable gas system, a scope base, a hammer forgedbarrel and a trick adaptor that lets this Kalashnikov useAR15 magazines of any capacity. This combination makes it a target for any shooter who get one of the limited quantity imported."

The gun has a few scratches on the stock and the barrels have about 90% blueing left with nice shiny bores. The Blue Book puts the shotgun's value at around $550 if it is the Model 213, if it is aother model they're all more expensive than the 213. With the case, ammo, and complete set of barrels the complete set is worth around $700-750 if not more. I'll take cash or equal trade value, see trade for what I'm in search of.

I purchased this last year and decided to SBR (short barrel rifle) it, so I filled out the Form 1. Got it approved (8 months later) and all is good. I have never fired this gun, ever. It has sat in my safe its entire sad life... I've done some research and selling an SBR, due to NFA laws, is a complete PITA. I have contacted the ATF to get this SBR removed from the NFA registry to make it a normal handgun again. Update: It has been removed from the registry. All questions have been answered. Still available at the moment.Selling this as a package deal. I am not going to split anything up. It has sat so long I am not in a hurry to sell so no offers or lowballs. You won't be disappointed with this setup. I will separate the Sig Romeo Reflex site & risers from the package. Subtract $300. Everything else remains together. No trades and price is non-negotiable - please don't ask for either. I've researched the prices and am being fair. Again, I am not in a hurry.There was a question about the Troy grip and Form 1. On whether it would make it an AOW (Any Other Weapon). Honestly, I am not positive. I put it on after I had my Form 1 completed and am removing it now to be on the safe side. Reducing the price $50.Included:Sig MPXP9 MPX P 9mm 8"" - unfired. It does have the Trust name (NFA required) and Celtic emblem etched into the lower. It can be removed via touch up or if you wanted to cerakote the firearm (something I never got around to doing but had planned to). Other than that, it is in excellent condition.OEM Sig MPX Hard Carrying Case - configured for non-brace and vertical grip - if sold separately they run $504 - Sig MPX 9mm Polymer Translucent Magazines - List for $30 eachSig Sauer Romeo 3 Miniature Reflex Sight - this thing alone lists for $400 and it is a phenomenal little reflex!Sig Sauer Folding SBX Stabilizing Arm Brace Kit - this lists for over $200 as well.2 - Yankee Hill Machine Co 1/2 inch risers - planned on getting a solid one but I had these laying around. - Lists for $15 each*** Removed VG due to questions about a Form 1 requirement **** Troy Modular Combat Grip - lists for $70 *** NOT INCLUDED *** And, I'll toss in a couple hundred rounds of FMJ 9mm ammo for a local sale.
