Please click link below. http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/spyderco-silverax-folder-carbon-fiberg-10-plainedge-c228cf/ Description C228CFP Sliverax™  Designed by automotive engineer and knife enthusiast Paul Alexander, the Sliverax is the first factory-made folding knife to combine Spyderco’s Compression Lock™ mechanism with a flipper-style opener. Its sleek drop-point blade is crafted from CPM® S30V® stainless steel and proudly includes both a fully accessible Trademark Round Hole™ and an index-finger flipper to support a full spectrum of one-handed opening options with either hand. A full-flat grind gives it outstanding edge geometry and its slightly negative blade-to-handle angle enhances its cutting leverage and shortens its opening arc for swift, positive deployment. The Sliverax’s blade is supported by Spyderco’s patented Compression Lock mechanism—a high-strength lock located in the spine of the handle to greatly reduce the risk of unintentional release during use. Its lightweight, open-backed handle design features stunning carbon fiber/G-10 laminate scales and nested stainless steel liners. This advanced construction style provides impressive structural strength, keeps the knife slim and pocket friendly, and offers a solid foundation for the knife’s lock mechanism. To allow convenient carry and keep the Sliverax instantly accessible, its handle includes a reversible deep-pocket wire clip that can be configured for right or left-side tip-up carry.

This gun shoots very well and has a solid weight that makes shooting a 9mm feel like a breeze! This CCU has had only a few hundred rounds through it and is very clean.
It features a stainless steel barrel, a quad rail with free rail covers included, and also includes a free 1/2” rail riser, Magpul AFG, and rifle bag. The adjustable stock allows a wide range of length preferences, and it feels great in hand with a Glock 19/23 frame attached.
The MSRP for the CCU and quad rail is $499.90 + $169.95 = $669.85. I have chosen to price this complete setup for a whole $250 less, at $420 (plus S&H if necessary).
This item is considered a firearm accessory because it attaches to the frame of a separate firearm trigger assembly. It is not considered an SBR, nor does it convert the classification of your Glock frame to an SBR because the stock is attached to the firearm accessory, which boasts a full-length barrel that exceeds the length of an SBR classification."

Please click link below. http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/spyderco-tasman-salt-2-lockback-folder-lightweight-black-frn-c106pbk2/ Description Spyderco’s second-generation Tasman™ Salt 2 is a powerful fusion of a hawkbill blade profile, 100% rustproof H-1® blade steel, and an enhanced, injection-molded handle design. The result is an incredibly capable pocket-sized cutting tool that is ideal for anyone who works in or around the water. Available with either a PlainEdge™ or fully serrated SpyderEdge™ cutting edge, the radically curved hawkbill blade of the Tasman 2 literally “collects” the material it cuts, drawing it into the concave edge like an animal’s claw. This dynamic generates extreme cutting power, especially on fibrous, hard-to-cut materials like netting, line, webbing, and rope. The Tasman Salt 2’s high-performance blade is housed in an improved handle design based on Spyderco’s best-selling Delica® 4. Injection molded from tough, ultra-lightweight yellow or black fiberglass-reinforced nylon (FRN), it features improved ergonomics, a non-slip Bi-Directional Texturing™ pattern, and a series of threaded stainless steel anchors for a versatile four-position titanium pocket clip. The handle is also home to a stout back lock mechanism that locks the blade securely open during use. A true pocket powerhouse, the Tasman Salt 2 sets a new standard in mariner’s cutting tools.

This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine Mil-Spec M1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M5 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle's barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical accessories.Rifle Requirements: The M5 RAS is a drop-in replacement part for standard, 2-piece polymer, A2-type handguards. The rifle must have a rifle length gas system, delta ring assembly, fixed front sight/gas block, and either a round or triangular handguard end cap. Lighter barrel profiles work best (Government contours). Heavier barrel contours may require modification to the inside of the rail.

The modernized Galil ACE is based upon the reliable mechanism of the original Galil assault rifle first developed by IMI in the late 1960’s. Drawing inspiration from the legendary Russian AK-47 and the Finnish Valmet RK 62, the IWI Galil ACE has been continuously improved over the last 40+ years, resulting in today’s extremely reliable and highly accurate Galil ACE."

With that said, I seem to shoot the compact size better than the subcompacts. It is also in a universal Mikes Holster that will come with it. Also I do have a clip that can be installed on a magazine that also enables it to be carried like a pocket knife, and it is still in the box, never installed. Can get picks if needed."

This grip locks right up in your hand and has a low bore axis The only thing I can think to compare it to is the CZP 10 C as far as that.  Very high-end pistol with some of the best US-made materials available on the market today this pistol unlike the cheaper series comes with a hard case three magazines a trigger lock  and sealed paperwork that has not been opened the pistol has never been fired and is brand new in the box .  These pistols almost always sell for retail and I are very hard to come by. $450 cash or trade depending on what you have some of what I am looking for is below REDACTED please text before calling"

Our holsters are specifically molded to each gun model for that perfect, custom fit. They are designed to be worn inside the waistband with a belt and with an un-tucked shirt to properly conceal the weapon. The material is .08"" KYDEX, which is thick enough to maintain its rigid structural integrity for a lifetime, while adding only 3 oz. in weight and adding next to nothing to the overall size of the weapon. Each holster has a Full Sweat-Shield that helps keep your weapon dry and which also helps guide the weapon when you are re-holstering. The trigger area on each holster is fully covered for your safety. The Posi-Click Audible Retention Lock system lets you know when your weapon is properly holstered and the retention pressure is easily adjustable. The carry angle (or cant) is easily adjustable from 0-15 degrees to your liking as well. This allows the holster to be used to virtually any carry position including Appendix, Hip, Side & Back carry positions."

The aluminum frame is in excellent shape, but the slide has some holster wear which in my opinion gives the gun some character but, you could have the slide refinished and the gun would look almost new.  Interested in other Sig pistols mostly, but feel free to offer whatever you have, the worst youll get is a friendly no thank you.  Thanks for looking!"
