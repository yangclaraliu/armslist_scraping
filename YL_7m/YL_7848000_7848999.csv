With ambidextrous controls, easily-replaceable barrel and virtually endless possibilities for customization and accessorization, the ARX100 is adaptable to any firing scenario and is perfect for today’s most demanding tactical shooter. This rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction. The possibilities for accessorization on the ARX100 are limited only by the user’s imagination.

110,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7848110,For Sale:  Vintage Browning SA-22 grade II,"Tennessee, Nashville, Tennessee","$ 1,000","Listed On: Thursday, January 18, 2018",Rifles,Browning                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a Browning SA-22. Not just any SA-22, this one is quite special. You will never find another one like this. 1970’s UNFIRED, NIB, never even assembled outside of the factory. This piece even includes the original outer shipping box!The SA-22 is the first majorly successful takedown semi automatic .22 that has ever been produced. It is such a successful design that to this day it is still being produced, a claim that not many other guns can share. Starting in 1974, the production of all Browning SA-22’s were moved from Belgium to Japan. Specifically Miroku, Japan. Both Browning and Winchester firearms produced in Miroku are renowned for their incredible quality with fit, finish, accuracy, workmanship, and materials used.This Browning is a Grade II and is absolutely mint, new in the box. The gun has never even been put together after it was shipped. Since the box has been opened, I have to say it is 99% for the wood and 99% for the metal. The components were only removed for the pictures and returned right to their box after being wiped down with a gun cloth to ensure there would be no oils/acids from finger prints or any other potential impurity left behind.The gun comes with its outer shipping box which is of course a perfect fit for the inner box. The outer box states that this rifle was shipped to a gun shop in Frankfort, Michigan, on September 28th, 1979. What is particularly odd with this is the serial number. According to the Browning website, it appears this rifle was produced in 1980 due to the PM after the serial number. There is a intriguing overlap on dates with this one which makes it all the more interesting.With any Browning firearm, this has fantastic wood and the high luster sheen. I did my best to take pictures, but we all know how bright pictures of the wood can get. The checkering is the classic pointed variety, and appears hand done. It is deep and sharp as new checkering should be. The grain pattern on this stock is simply stunning. Wood to metal fit is outstanding with no cracks, chips, or scrapes. Again, it was not ever even assembled. The butt plate is un messed with, and the magazine tube was not removed.The bluing is flawless as can be expected, and is the typical Browning high luster polish. The barrel is 19.25”. Unlike many of these, the takedown mechanism and threading is perfect as you can see.The receiver is in the white, and has intricate engraving on both the left(ground hogs and scroll) and right side(squirrels and scroll), in addition to the top of the receiver(a duck and scroll) and on the trigger guard itself(floral). There are no signs of bolt wear aside from the factory test fire, the bolt face is as a new gun should be. The trigger is gold. For sights this rifle has the typical folding rear sight and a post front sight.Overall, this is an amazing time capsule that literally cannot be improved upon. You don’t often run into NIB examples of the SA22 in any grade. Finding a grade II with the original outer shipping box is next to impossible. You can track where and when it went. This would make an excellent investment, or an heirloom piece to be proud of for generations to come. Take advantage of this while you can, you are not going to find another one."

Go ahead and look elsewhere, but I am the only seller of this pistol, with these custom grips. While the grips are nice and add much to the look of the pistol, be aware that as they are not automated production, they are not as uniform finish as the factory grips. However, the pics are of the actual firearm and are taken with high megapixel camera. Very hard to find pistol. The factory makes them once and a while. Basically the same gun as the extremely popular 9mm J.A.9 full size pistol, but chambered in .380acp. 380acp is better for home defense as the .380acp round is less likely to over-penertrate. The bullet (part that comes out the front of the barrel) in a 380acp round is the same size as a 9mm bullet. American made with manufacter's lifetime warranty. Includes two 12 round magazines. Unless you weigh 400lbs, this model is probably to big and heavy for conceal carry, but it's great for home defense, and as a truck gun. Has great sights, with the rear being adjustable.Model: J.A. LC380 Height: 4.75 inches Thickness: 1.25 inches Weight: 30 Ounces Length: 6.625 inches Barrel Length: 3.75 inchesThe flagship feature of the Jimenez Arms LC380 is its easy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern. These features coupled with a last round slide hold open makes this pistol uncommonly accurate and a delight at the range."
