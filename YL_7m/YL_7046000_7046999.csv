The barrel is 30"" with full choke, and has pitting throughout the bore, no doubt from the blackpowder and primers in use at the time. The pits are very shallow, and dead, and the bore has been polished throughout. There is no issue for normal use-- this shotgun is still an active shooter! The action is is extremely smooth, and locks tightly. Serial numbers are matching on receiver and barrel/magazine assembly. This has been a fine hunting companion for waterfowl and migratory birds, but could easily serve as a project for a CAS shooter or riotgun conversion.Cash only transaction.

This pistol was purchased by me brand new. I took it to the range for functionality testing and thought the controls were a little stiff so I had it shipped to the Smith & Wesson Performance Center factory. There they upgraded the trigger, slide catch and magazine release along with an overall performance tuning job. Now the controls function incredibly smoothly. The slide holds firm and drops smoothly, magazines fly out when ejected and the trigger is extremely smooth and crisp for a stock trigger. It shoots like a dream but my hands do not fit it as I would prefer. Please, contact me with any questions you may have if you are serious about buying or trading for this pistol. I am limited on photos here but I do have more available upon request. I am asking $575.00 firm for everything included with this and will sell/trade the pistol as a bundle only.

Comes also with a variety of 12 gauge shells, as pictured. This one won't last long, if I don't change my mind about keeping it. The Mossberg® 500® Combo offers hunters a versatile Pump-Action Shotgun, suited for hunting a wide range of game, including deer, waterfowl, upland birds, and turkey. The Combo pump shotgun comes with 1 vent-ribbed, smoothbore, ported barrel that accepts Accu-Set choke tubes and 1 fully rifled and ported barrel with rifle sights. Twin beads on the ribbed barrel provide quick sight acquisition. The 3"" chamber functions with both 3"" and 2-3/4"" shells to enhance the 500's versatility for shooting a variety of loads. Dual action bars prevent binding and twisting while cycling the action, and a single, large locking lug locks the bolt into the barrel extension, ensuring a solid steel bolt-to-barrel connection. Dual extractors take a solid hold on the shell's rim for reliable extraction. The aluminum alloy receiver keeps weight down and resists corrosion. Hunters can reach the tang quickly with the thumb of either hand, making it naturally ambidextrous. The Mossberg 500 disassembles into sub-components for cleaning and maintenance by unscrewing the magazine cap (which stays on the barrel); the trigger assembly drops out easily with the removal of only 1 pin. For years, military, law enforcement, and hardcore hunters have chosen Mossberg pump shotguns for their simplistic design and reliability. The 500 Pump-Action Shotgun Combo has a synthetic buttstock and forearm and blued barrels. Comes with 2 Accu-Set screw-in choke tubes, a durable recoil pad, and sling swivel studs."

The TT-33 was widely used in World War II primarily by Russian officers well into the 1950s. The Fedor Tokarev designed sidearm uses a short recoil design, external hammer, integrated feed lips and fires the 7.62x25mm Tokarev cartridge. This Yugoslavian M57 was built by Zastava and utilized by the Yugoslavian Military and Police forces. The M57 version differs from the TT-33 by holding one more 7.62 Tok cartridge in the longer magazine and corresponding grip. These pistols are military surplus and come with 1 magazine."

The “Super” resembles the 1911 in appearance yet incorporates the locking mechanism of the FN Hi Power. It was used as a stand-in for 1911s in many movies.In 1946 Star introduced the Pistola Modelo B Super in 9mm Parabellum. This design replaced the barrel link with a cam similar to that used on the FN Hi-Power pistol and had a quick takedown system that allowed the slide unit to be removed en bloc. The extractor was modified to act as a loaded-chamber indicator, and a magazine disconnect safety was also included in the design. The Modelo B Super was the first 9mm Parabellum pistol to be taken into service with the Spanish armed forces. It was the “standard” issue pistol of the Spanish Army and Guardia Civil. From the 1950s through 1975, the Spanish Army and La Legion Extranjera (the Spanish Foreign Legion) engaged in a series of campaigns against nationalist guerillas in her African colonies. The Modelo B Super saw wide service during the fighting in Spanish Morocco, Ifni and the Spanish Sahara.Pistol is in great shape and includes one 8-round magazine.  Check my other listings for a pair of NEW Galco COmbat Master holsters that fit the Star B Super perfectly.Buyer must have a CWP or be willing to transfer the firearm via a FFL."

It has never been fired, it's just sat in the safe, so it's as close to NIB as you can get. This rifle was won at a raffle, so it did not come with Merkel's carrying case. Instead it came in a cardboard box. Because of this, and the fact that it IS preowned, I've priced it where I believe it is fair. My price is firm.
I would prefer to make a face to face transaction, I realize that is not likely based on the market so I am OK with shipping to an FFL. That said, I want to be able to contact your FFL before I ship to verify your information. I will also need a copy of your driver's license and your FFL. I will ship the rifle packaged appropriately at my cost (for the actual cost of shipping). It will be insured, include a tracking number, and shipped to your FFL via UPS or USPS per ATF guidelines. 
Also, if you contact me, please give me more than just a sentence. I am very reluctant to reply to emails that I think are bots fishing for email addresses, or emails that are scams. More photos are available upon request. 
Thanks for looking."
