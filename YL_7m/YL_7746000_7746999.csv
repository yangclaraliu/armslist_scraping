Also CZ made this certain model for the Israeli police. There's very little information out there about these but please feel free to research. The gun has truglo tfx night sights on it has had a trigger job and a lighter recoil spring in it. Gun has about 200 RDS thru it. This gun comes with two 14 rnd and box. The gun has some finish wear on it that I'll try to show it pics but nothing to bad. I'd like to trade for a CZ sp01 phantom or tactical model.

But, while training for competition, I found my times with a pump were not going to cut it! I've since moved on to a semi-auto. This shotgun has never fired live shells, only snap-caps. Since I removed the magazine spring limiter cap and drilled out the mag-dimples that restrict shells from going too far (in order to install a magazine extension) this shotgun is now a 6 + 1 = 7-shot pump and is 100% prepped for magazine extension installation. I've also installed a Nordic Components low-drag follower and a stock Remington 870 magazine spring (which is stronger than the Norinco original).

 This pistol is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."
