I've got an OD green Glock 19 Blue Label that I traded for about 6 months ago. The gun was new and never fired, I have since taken it to the range twice and put maybe 150 rounds through it. Its in perfect condition and never carried. So heres the deal. I hated the trigger, so I installed a gen 3 G17 smooth trigger shoe and bar, a Ghost Ranger 4.5 disconnect and put Wolf springs in it. Now its got a super tactile, smooth but still carry safe trigger. If you know Glock triggers they feel very different live firing than dry. Its honestly almost as good as my Canik, yeah I said it. What else, sights were factory terrible. New Ameirglo yellow night sights! Killer for sure. Talon grips, Vickers Tactical ""oversized"" slide stop, or to non glock guys, a regular usable slide stop. 4 factory mags, original box and all paperwork, and an unused Kydex holster. I love this gun honestly, thought I'd carry it but I have a PPS that is just too easy to carry. The Glock is not my favorite range gun, and since I don't plan on being in any continual combat situations, its a beautiful and ultra reliable dust collector. I know there are some really dedicated Glock fans so I offer this one up at what I feel is a very fair price for the condition, upgrades and extra mag. Please, no trades unless its S&W E Series 3.5"" or a Kimber Pro Carry or an as new Walther P99 gen 3 or 4 9mm with some cash. Cash and Carry only, Ma LTC holder only.

Comes with everything shown in picture and is brand new, as you can see greesed up from factory. This has BCM trigger, raptor LT charging handle, BCM furniture, adjustable long stroke piston, PWS muzzle break, ratchet buffer tube with QD end plate, etc..  There are only a handful of these in the US and are currently on backorder from Shot Show.  I put  down a deposit months ago so received one of first 25 made.  I decided to go a different route and am looking for preban AK’s. This is just to much money to keep in collection. Check out the Primary Weapon Systems website for details on this gun.  They don’t even have them listed. You will see the new mLok version is coming soon. The cost for $2,200 for keymod version which is also sold out. Check out the reviews on thus gun.  Sub MOA guarantee. Lighter and more accurate than POF, blows LWRC and  LMT AR10’s away!  Lifetime warranty and guarantee with amazing customer support from PWS.  Trade value higher $1,875OBO"

The porting really helps to keep this from severe muzzle flip and is surprisingly easy to control. It includes everything you would get if you bought it brand new, original case, all manuals and paperwork, decal, lock and external identifier decals, and even the original plastic blue bag. I've put less than 100 rounds through it and you will get it cleaned and lubricated. Paid $344 plus FFL, you own it at $275.00 cash. Prefer buyer with CCP, but FL/DL and bill of sale at minimum.
