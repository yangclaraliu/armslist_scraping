The revolver is a good example of a factory arsenel update for WWII, all original parts, Parkerized finish 75% (Original Finish Was Blued, but the standard update prior to World War II was a parkerized finish), sharp legible markings, and very minor wear to the metal and wood. The bore is immaculate, very strong rifling, and a near mirror finish. This one was probably not fired after it saw an update prior to World War II. It has the Colt inspection stamp of an eagle eagle head over S20, which is indictive of Colt Model 1917's later inspection techniques, prior to this they were stamped with inspection letters. Normally the Arsenal markings would appear in the bottom corner of the frame. This one bares an unusual stamp of ""J"" in the corner of the frame instead of the standard stamping of two or three letters indicating an Arsenal, which would normally appear on the reverse side.VERY GOOD: All original parts; none to 30% original finish; original metal surfaces smooth with all edges sharp; clear lettering, numerals and design on metal; wood slightly scratched or bruised; bore disregarded for collectors firearms."

The P229 in DA/SA include a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The pistol is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG and also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc., P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most."

I have meticulously cared for and lubricated this rifle even when not firing and it has been oiled and stored in a hard sided container. There is some slight scuffing on the lever where it was lightly filed down and polished to make the action out of the box smoother.

Columbus/Harris co., Columbus, GA, Georgia",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, October 5, 2017",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Got me a wild hair and just thinkingout loud here, but I'm considering trading for something cool, not even sure what (but trades plus cash are particularly desirable,like maybe an un-bubba'd SKS, a VP9, gen3 tenifer'd G19, and most of all, Ruger or S&W revolvers.) I'm putting the trade value at $650. This rifle was very well built, no canted sights or sloppy rivets, is in near-new condition, runs 100% reliably, and the sights are dialed in at 100 yds. Included is the Russian Izzy bakelite mag seen in the pic, plus 3 more east-bloc mil-surp steel mags, and a Polish or Romy 3-mag pouch (these type pouches are my favorite AK mag toters, they're functional, comfortable, low-profile pouches, that keep the mags  secure even if the flap isn't closed. They work great with pretty much any belt or strap, on the waist or on a pack.) Also included is the original box and manual. It does have the slant brake, bayonet lug, the cleaning rod, and cleaning kit is in the butt. The easily-cracked balsa wood stocks these newer WASR's have been coming with in recent years, have been replaced with laminated stocks, which have been VERY nicely refinished (these are the stocks everybody used to criticise and practically give away, till they found out the new wood is complete crap that dents and splits, , and these older laminated stocks are damn near bullet proof, and all we had to do to make them look good was to stain and refinish them. And they ain't cheap anymore!) Anyway, they look MUCH nicer in person, than they do in the pics. It also comes with the (highly ergonomic) Hogue grip seen in the pics, as well as the original black plastic grip. Other than the furniture upgrades, it's all-original. I think that covers it! Unfortunately, due to the proliferation of scammers and idiots here, I have add:   If the ad is still up, I still have the rifle, so don't ask. Not interested in shipping or accepting checks, so don't ask.Not interested in any big road trips, which is why I posted locally in Columbus. And finally, I am a legitimate seller and legal Ga resident, in SW Harris county, with my Ga carry permit, so everything is 100% above board. I'm fine with a bill of sale, or not. I'm fine with a test fire, assuming someplace safe and convenient to shoot (and your ammo!!)Thanks for loooking...."
