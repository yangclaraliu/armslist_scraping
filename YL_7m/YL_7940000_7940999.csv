Equipped with two CREE XP-G3 LEDs the H16 Wave produces a maximum output of 500 lumens and 98 yards of throw. The combined output from the two LEDs emits a beam that is both flood and focused, making it perfect for a variety of close range tasks like reading and working. Using the HS2 Wave is simple with Olight’s hand wave activation, this motion sensing setting allows users to power on the headlamp in the dark without having to fumble with buttons and keeping the unit free from dirty hands. If you prefer a button, that’s okay too! Users can power on/off the headlamp using a power switch located on the front of the unit. A built-in four-level blue LED battery indicator and low power audio beep alerts users when battery power is low. Recharging the built-in battery pack is easy using the supplied micro-USB charging cable and connecting to any USB power source. A reflective headband provides additional safety for the user making this a great headlamp for night time biking, running, and other outdoor activities.

Once received I noticed a buldge in the barrel approx 2-3 inches from the muzzle below the choke threads. It is minimal and I have continued to shoot and hunt with it. I have not noticed any effect on performance and the size and shape has never changed. I'm not willing to try and sneak this past someone like someone did to me. I feel at the price listed this is still a fantastic buy. Thank you. Must be 18+ and an Ohio resident.

Definately a war used piece of history.  Early serial number indicates most likely was a 1898 production that was updated to 1901 standards by US armory.  Gun is complete. However, the barrel is bad at the forcing cone and would need replaced if you wanted to fire this gun.If correctly repaired this gun would auction between $800 and $1100. I have seen internal parts kits with trigger and hammer for these sell on eBay for $250-300 and cylinders with crane fetch another $200+.  Grips get another $75+.  If you are someone who can take apart a piece of history for profit this would easily part out over $500.   Cool wall hanger as is. Can include a nice shadow box for the right offer.Also, I have a 4"" barrel that would fit this for another $150. It would not be historically correct, but would likely make it functional.  I will NOT include it for $250. They sell on eBay (barrel) for $200-300 alone. Also, I have a colt DA army 38 with no grips that has bad nickel plating and free wheels but has a good barrel/cylinder/many other parts.  I will sell or trade it for $200.These prices are firm and great low risk prices for those who like to tinker or part out on auction sites. I wouldn't be surprised to hear that the two guns and the extra barrel could part out for $1500-2000 total. $250 for the one pictured. $650 for everything. Cash or trade makes no difference to me.These are 38 long colt"
