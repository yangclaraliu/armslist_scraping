A colt revolver is an excellent example of quality and Americana that unlike all the mass produced guns of the last 5 years is as good as money in the bank. Values on colt revolvers continues to climb 15-20% annually.  Here is your chance to have one in the safe at a very reasonable price. Upper tier shooter grade gun. Some faint speckling as you can see on the right hand of the receiver, still very good. Dressed in Hogue Lamo Camo furniture. One hell of a smooth shooter."

Basically, it is a further development of the famous Walther P-38 pistol, but with significantly improved safety system.
The P5 is a recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistol. The barrel to slide locking/unlocking is achieved by wertically tilting underballer locking piece, after the barrel moves straight back for short time. The trigger is Double Action, with frame mounted decocker at the left side of the frame. P5 also featured addtional internal safeties, such as firing pin safety, which removes the rear part of the firing pin from under the hammer, unless trigger is pressed, and also a firing pin block which disablet the forward movement of the firing pin unless the triger is pressed. The trigger bar disconnector disables the firing unless the slide in fully closed. This allows the gun to be carried in ""condition two"", with round chambered and hammer lowered, safely, and ready for action in DA mode. For improved accuracy the SA firing is also available. The P5 Compact is an even more compact firearm, similar in design but with shorter barrel and slide. The sporting version of P5 had been manufactured for some time, and it had longer barrel and fixed or ajustable sights. P5 and P5 Compact both featured fixed sights.
The P5 had been adopted by German Police, as well as by Portuguese Army, Neteherland Police and other security and police forces, and also sold on European civil market. The P5 are still in production by its originator, Carl Walther Sportwaffen GMBh, Uhlm, Germany.

This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol. The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger. Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems. Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip. The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands. The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American."

This would have started out life as a model 56s-1 before the silly ban where is was caught on the way to the USA and had the bayonet lug milled off and a fixed stock added. They also had to grind off the orginal model number marking on the left side of the front trunion. The previous owner bought it new, in that state, and as soon as the AWB expired he added a Chinese underfolder stock, returning it to it's former glory (except for the bayonet lug). Obviously, these are no longer being imported and as a result they are going up in value.I was told that he had shot it very little and judging by the limited amount of wear on the rails etc., I would believe that to be the case. Since buying the rifle, about 10 years ago, I have only put (500) - (600) rounds, tops, through it. I have never experienced a failure of any kind.The rifle is in very good condition overall and all of the stamped parts have matching numbers.The rifle will come with the extremely handy sling and one steel 30-round magazine. It will also include the fancy paracord wrap on the left leg of the stock. The paracord is simply wrapped and tied in place, so can be easily removed if you like.Price........$875 OBO - FTF in the Fort Wayne area. I am willing to travel about 30 minutes to meet. I will want to see a valid Indiana drivers license prior to the sale.I may be open to certain trades, but please don't be offended if I say no thank you. I do not need any more shotguns (unless you're willing to trade a Benneli M2 Tactical fairly close to even) cash could go either way for the right trade."
