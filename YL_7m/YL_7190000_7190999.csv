Typically, red dot, reflex and holographic sights are designed for fast target acquisition usually within a 100-yard range, which is suitable for both hunting and tactical situations. Many shooting experts recommend that you shoot with both eyes open especially in a tactical situation. Red dot sights allow shooters to keep both eyes open because of the dedicated focusing of the sight. The shooting eye is not strained when using the sight."

The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location.   Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel.   Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms:  Manual thumb safety Grip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firing Firing pin block  Each UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round. A 32 round magazine is also available where permitted. Fully adjustable front and rear sights are standard."

I am the second owner and the first owner (a friend of mine) never shot it. This rifle was purchased around the late 90's early 2000's and has literally 3 rounds down the barrel. If you know anything about Cetmes, they are the father of the H&K G3. They are not easy to obtain, especially an older one like this is in the condition its in.The barrel looks like a mirror and the rifling is very strong. Finish is around 99%. This is an older version so it does not have a pictinny rail on it. It is missing the bird cage flash hider. As i stated before the previous owner never shot it so when i took it out to fire the loose barrel device flew off and i could never find it hahaha. With that said the threads look great! She just needs a muzzle device. The original brakes are pretty cheap and can be bought on clear view investments for $7. The reason for me parting ways with this amazing firearms is due to me focusing more on kalishnikov platforms instead of the G3 style. I need the safe space and this rifle (while very collectible and reliable) doesnt fit my current interests. It comes with a mag holder and 2 mags. Mags for the cetme run around $4 and this cetme will take HK mags but they are a little higher in price. Not in a hurry to sell, price is firm."

From Savage Arms:10/110 FCP HS Precision 338 Lapua   MSRP: $1726The Savage 110 FCP Bolt-Action Rifle in .338 Lapua is the ultimate firearm for hitting targets at extreme range, and with authority. The .338 Lapua Magnum is a hard-hitting, heavy recoiling round, though with a 26"" barrel and muzzle brake on a gun weighing in excess of 10 pounds, the Savage 110 FCP manages the recoil well allowing shooters to concentrate on placing shots with precision. The 110 FCP features Savage's AccuTrigger® that is fully adjustable to provide a light, clean, crisp break at the shooter's desired pull weight. A HS Precision synthetic stock beds the barrel action solidly for consistent accuracy in changing environments. The 5-round detachable magazine facilitates loading and unloading, and the 3-position safety allows chamber to be loaded and unloaded with the safety engaged. Fluting on the barrel enhances rigidity, and speeds in cooling. The Savage 110 FCP Bolt-Action Rifle comes with a Picatinny rail for mounting the optical sight of one's choice.
 
From NightForce:8-32X56MM NXS  MSRP: $2125Nightforce dominated benchrest competition for twenty plus years and now uses the knowledge gained during this success to create what may be the ultimate long range field target scope. This experience combined with the durability and ruggedness of the NXS line developed for the US military gives shooters in the field the same level of precision that benchrest shooters have had all along. The NXS 8-32x56 evolution incorporates fast, precise adjustments that guarantee repeatable shot placement. The high magnification range means that there is virtually no target outside of the shooters reach.A favorite of F Class shooters the world over, this scope was by the USA F-Class team that won the 2009 F-T/R World Championships, beating out the home team in Britain. So whether you’re shooting in the Canadian Cup, Wimbledon or in the field out back, think long and hard before you settle for less. From Pelican:1750 Travel Case MSRP: $240Protect your firearm with this watertight, crushproof and dust proof Pelican 1750 Scoped Rifle Gun Case with Solid Foam Insert and Wheels. This lockable case (lock not included) has easy open double throw latches and strong polyurethane wheels with stainless steel bearings.

Normal wear from the relatively light use is present, but aside from this and some very slight scarring in the polymer around the magazine release button, this PPQ is in excellent condition.  The PPQ has one of the best factory triggers on a striker fired 9mm and is extremely accurate on the range, as well as a very comfortable and filling (customizable) grip with easy-to-aquire sights.
