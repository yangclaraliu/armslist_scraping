In the B-14 rifle, you will find a level of craftsmanship that surpasses all of the other production hunting rifles on the market.The B-14 HMR rifle features our integrated mini-chassis molded into the stock to give the rifle repeatable bedding and accuracy. It also supports a fully free-floated barrel to achieve optimal precision.

The stock features an adjustable cheekpiece and length of pull spacers. Built in Spain at our highly automated and efficient barrel factory, this rifle delivers a level of quality and performance that is unmatched in its price range.The world-renowned Bergara barrel on this long range precision rifle is complemented by our own super-smooth B-14 Action, which is a two-lug system with a sliding plate extractor and a coned bolt nose and breech to ensure a smooth feeding and extraction of the cartridge. Itâ€™s also outfitted with a Bergara curved trigger we designed to guarantee a crisp, clean pull every time you fire the rifle. The trigger comes set at about three pounds.

The Sage Blades version is a sturdy, 1/4? thick, all steel knife. It measures about 7 inches with a full length handle and ring to give excellent control and grip retention. Although the blade is short, it will retain it’s super sharp edge very well and performs great over a wide range of cutting tasks from delicate, scalpel type cutting to batoning through wood. When held far back by the ring, it can even hack quite effectively. It is well suited to urban use, as well as wilderness bushcraft. In an emergency situation, the thick steel can come in handy for prying, and, with no handle material to get in the way, it can be quite easily lashed to a pole to create a spear. The sheath is also simple, yet very effective. It involves a basic system of using an attached deer skin lace to lash the sheath to the belt. There is a long list of benefits to this simple method: the lace can be replaced with any other cord if necessary; it can be mounted horizontal or vertical, left or right, up or down; it will work with any belt size; and it keeps the sheath tightly secured in place on the belt and close against the body with a low profile. (photos and instructions on how to do this can be provided) The cord can also be used to carry the kiridashi as a “neck knife”. Also, the design of this sheath, with only the ring showing, means that it can only be drawn by putting a finger through the ring which makes it unlikely to be drawn by someone other than yourself. Last, but certainly not least, the sheathed knife can be carried in the pocket of most types of pants with the ring at or slightly below the top of the pocket. Because of the shaping of the sheath (the point above the ring), the knife can be drawn from the pocket with the sheath catching and remaining in the pocket. This is done with only the forefinger through the ring and preferably drawn into a reverse grip. This means that the kiridashi is kept secure and hidden in the pocket, yet can be drawn – into a good self-defense grip – in a split second, without actually reaching into the pocket"

Rifle is a mixmaster with primary components coming from Springfield and a few minor parts from Winchester. This rifle definitely has the ""been there done that look"" and shows its over 75 years of age. That being said it still functions well and is an honest example of a fine military rifle.Some bad news, the barrel is fairly shot out and swallows M2 ball to the neck. Despite this, there is no pitting or rust present in the barrel and it still shoots fairly well considering. I have a 1944 Springfield barrel with CMP field grade numbers that can be included for $75. Additionally, the stock lockup on the rifle is not perfect and there is some minor movement. I've fixed this with some small magnetic shims placed between the stock and the trigger group, but I also have a DoD marked stock with good lockup that can be included for $75.Over all decent rifle, fairly priced, with the option to purchase the parts needed to get her back to fighting shape.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- or right hand shooters.I will not ship anywhere, and you must have a valid Montana driver's license or concealed carry permit.

One of the very first Smith and Wesson .38 Special Caliber Revolvers, dagnabbit, only precceded by Smith's introductory 'M and P' (Military and Police) Model of 1899. This old timer is still in perfect time, mechanically excellent, and is safe to shoot any modern, off the shelf, STANDARD PRESSURE .38 Special ammo...(as it was made before Cylinder Hardening became popular around WW1).  As you can plainly see, this is a very elegantly designed, Classic version of an Ess n Dubya; featuring a 6"" long tapered 'pencil' barrel, 'half moon' front sight, 'fishhook' hammer, and a sexy curved 'round butt' frame...a guy just can't go wrong with this pistol.  She is whatcha call, I believe, a 'First Change Model of 1892', but was ackshlly made 'round about 1894 (give 'r take a few months). About the only 'issues' she has (after soon to be 116 years old) is that she has been nicely reblued at some point...which is less than surprising if ya think about it. There's little honest holster wear on the reblue, but no rust or pittiing. Also; she is currently sporting a pair of ill-fitting, (yet serviceable) improper 1940-50s era Diamond Magna Round Butt grips. You can wrangle her up an old set of original walnut grips, or some original/replacement hard rubber grips (either would be correct for this Model)....Or, if yer the 'Crafty' type; you could carve up a beautiful pair of wood, bone, or (?) whatever suits your style! I'm asking $350 for this little beauty; and if you act soon, I may throw in a Free 'Barn' Cat who thinks she's a dog....(as long as you promise not to shoot her ;-[ Serously tho: I do have a very beatifully marked, short haired, 'Caliby' (Calico w/ striped spots) who suddenly adopted me (not necessarilly the other way around). She can sometimes be more of a 'Pushy Cat' than a Pussy Cat, however, and at other times, she really does act a lot like a dog. She likes to roll in the dirt, go for long walks (with me and my 'other' dog), and really likes her belly scratched. ....Go figure.She's all too loyal, quite affectionate, and like many cats- she likes 'getting into' stuff -which can be either funny or annoying- mostly depending on 'the stuff'. She'd probably make a great Farm Cat though, if you have plenty of food and a warm place for her to sleep. I'm really not set up to be a 'Cat Daddy' at the moment- but she's pretty darned entertainining and deserves a good long-term home. Not sure if she's been spayed or not, but she looks fairly young and very healthy. She also might make a pretty good 'Indoor/Outdoor' pet for a Family. Right now, she's 'doing business' outside, 'cuz, 'Litter boxes jus' ain't my bag, man'.I don't know if anyone reading this needs a 'Special Kitty'; but just thought I might 'Throw that in' (so to speak;-) if they do. 'Penny' (the Dog/Cat) is currently residing in Greater Okarche Area, if anyone's interested. .....We now return you to our Regularly Scheduled Program-  This Early Smith and Wesson Miltary and Police .38'd make a fine Late Western/Gangster Era Renactor gun, or just a nice ol' shooter like Great Grampa maybe had. Thanks for your time.                                                       Regards-/\/\"

I purchased this set up specifically for firearms training. I actually kinda love this pistol. you'd better treat it right!  LOLThe trigger is really nice. Heavy enough to not be a liability, and smooth enough on the initial break. follow up shots are liquid. Like a glock, there is no external safety.These are discontinued, or actually with a new manufacturer.. the new version retails for $2100, and that's what I plan to be buying this summer if they ever catch up with demand..In addition to being in a short run, the grey color also appears to be rare... and really nice looking. I would call this collectable. I wish I had the original box.My pricing is going to be fairly firm. I own an FFL (this is a personal firearm) and this is priced below market value determined by examining completed Gunbroker auctions of sold strike one pistols (all colors) This is a great pistol at a great price.
