I bought it from Bass Pro in Kodak.  It has had less than 80 rounds through it as I am still in the process of breaking it in.  Shoots sub MOA with Factory Match ammo.  Love the rifle but have to install a sewer pump.  I shot a 1000 yard clinic at ORSA with it and it was very accurate at that distance.  I was consistantly in the 10 ring on a 20 shot string, with quite a few X's.  The trigger is outstanding. 
It comes along with the box and everything that came in it.  One 5 Round Magazine, 20MOA Scope Base, thread protector, etc.  Below is the description from BassPro'w website.  I am including a set of 30MM rings with it (worth $100), but the pictured scope is NOT included.
 www.basspro.com/shop/en/bergara-b-14-hmr-bolt-action-rifle
The Bergara® B-14 HMR Bolt-Action Rifle uses a world-renowned Bergara barrel with a state-of-the-art action and stock to produce a long range precision bolt-action rifle, capable of engaging targets at maximum range. The Bergara action utilizes a 2-lug system with a Sako-style extractor and a coned bolt nose and breech to ensure smooth feeding and flawless extraction. A Bergara curved trigger, set at 3 pounds, delivers a crisp, clean break. The receiver is drilled and tapped to fit Remington 700 style rings and bases. The barreled-action is solidly bedded in a Bergara HMR molded stock with a full-length, integrated mini-chassis that supports a fully free-floated barrel. The butt-stock has an adjustable cheek piece and length-of-pull; a near vertical pistol grip accommodates shooting from the prone position. The stock comes equipped with integrated QD flush cup sling mounts. The #5-contoured barrel is made of 4140 CrMo steel and finished in matte blue. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24"" and includes a thread protector. The Bergara B-14 HMR Bolt-Action Rifle uses a standard AICS detachable magazine (comes with one 5-round mag).

I purchased it in the summer of 2016 from Firing Line in Westland, MI. Originally, it came with the standard ""rifle"" buttstock, however I purchased a pistol-grip buttstock (currently on the gun) and a telescoping pistol-grip buttstock as well; both are factory Benelli parts and both extra stocks are included. Also replaced were the bolt-release and charging handle- it's now equipped with a GG & G Oversized Bolt-Release and GGG Oversized Charging Handle. The shotgun also has a ""DG Parkerized"" Carrier Comp Full Length Extended Magazine tube on it (so you don't have to wait 2-3 months for them to make ya one!). Instead of the factory picatinny rail that came on the gun (also included), there is a Scalarworks SYNC mount & Trijicon RMR RM06 Type 2 Combo (a very hard-to-obtain item on the scalarworks website). It's also got a Streamlight Protac 2 weapon light (with pressrue switch), and heavy duty cobra-buckled sling from Blue Force Gear that are already attached and included as well. On the flat side of the reciever there is a strip of velcro used to attach cordura/nylon ""side saddles"" for extra ammo; the few I have, I will include also.  All in all I have just over $3000.00 into the gun, as described above.I will also included the remaining premium-grade ammo I have, valued at about $500: appx 225 shells of Winchester Ranger Low Recoil 2 3/4 00 buckshot, 250 shells of Winchester Law Enforcement 2 3/4 12-pellet 00 buck, and 200 shells of Federal Premium Law Enforcement 2 3/4 9-pellet buckshot. I also have around 150 shells of miscellaneous other premium grade shells laying around that I'll put into a plastic ammo can and give you as well. The shotgun has around 300 rounds through it, is clean as a whistle, and is in great shape. The Trijcion RMR has a chip on the housing from where a training course I took last summer; the sight is in perfect working order but if the chip is an issue, I will keep the Trijicon (not the SYNC mount) and knock $250 off the package price. The Trijicon/SYNC Mount is a combo offered from the Scalarworks website and is sometimes very hard to obtain due to limited batches. Personally, I wouldn't seperate the two, but it's your call.My total value invested, as described, sits in the neighborhood of $3600. I'm not looking to trade, however if someone came out of the woodworks with a knock-my-socks-off offer (eg new Wilson Combat in 9mm) I would entertain that, but I'm primarily looking to get $2800, cash, with everything included, or $2550 without the Trijicon RMR.

Everything about the Colt M203’s being offered is correct for the weapon system, they are built on the same line as the military M203s and are marked “LAUNCHER, GRENADE M203 40MM”, the important difference is they have never had 40mm barrels installed and left the Colt factory as Title 1 firearms. Instead of traditional 40mm barrel they come with 37mm barrels installed avoiding the NFA registry all together. As is the case with every firearm that leaves the Colt factory the 37mm M203s are serialized and must transfer through an FFL as a “firearm.” The same way a Mossberg “Shockwave,” for example, is classified.

It has never been fired, never was able to take it to the range to test it out. Sadly I was never able to get an optic for this rifle, so it will not come with one. Everything is in great working condition from what I can still tell. Head spacing, barrel errosion, barrel straitness and firing pin errosion have all been checked (For those of you that don't know what that means, fancy way of saying the gun is still in optimal condition.) No rust, errosion or anything like that. And once again, this rifle has never been shot. I am wanting cash for this rifle. Please no trades.

Using this same method, the Spyderco Nirvana faithfully translates the breathtaking attention to detail of one of Rassenti’s most popular custom designs into a truly exceptional production folding knife—so exceptional it won Blade Magazine’s prestigious “Imported Knife of the Year” award. The Nirvana’s most distinctive feature is its one-piece handle, which is meticulously machined from a solid block of titanium to produce every detail—including the knife’s high-strength Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L.) mechanism. The beautifully contoured, exceptionally ergonomic handle is then matte finished and embellished with a spectacular CNC-machined geometric design that wraps around its entire outer surface. Crafted from 4mm (.158-inch) thick CPM® S90V particle metallurgy stainless steel, the Nirvana’s blade is equally impressive. The PlainEdge™ blade features a saber grind and clip-point profile for a superior balance of strength and edge geometry and boasts a stonewashed finish to match the knife’s subdued handle. Spyderco’s Trademark Round Hole™ provides leverage for swift, positive one-handed opening, while an hourglass clip on the handle offers convenient right-side, tip-up carry to keep this remarkable knife poised and instantly accessible.
