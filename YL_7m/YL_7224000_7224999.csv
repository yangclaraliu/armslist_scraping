The receiver has a nice uncleansed and unpolished patina and shows typical handling marks of a rifle of this vintage. The bluing on the barrel and magazine tube has nice coverage with a lot of very nice aged bluing remaining. The wood is in above average condition and shows some minor wear and use typical of a rifle that is 147 years old. There is a small brass presentation plaque on the right side of the buttstock. There are no extra holes drilled in this Winchester anywhere. The bore is in good condition with strong rifling showing some minor scattered pitting but is overall well above average and could probably clean up a lot better if someone so desired. This rare and excellent Winchester is clean, complete and spectacular. This Model 1866 Rifle is in well above average condition for the vintage. This is a very rare opportunity to own a spectacular and rare NIMSCHKE ENGRAVED & SIGNED Winchester Model 1866 44 caliber Rifle. This is an antique firearm which doesnt require FFL. Money order, cash deposit, direct deposit and bank transfer is accepted. We ship nationwide after payment has been confirmed. Text 650-300-7690 for more pictures and inquiry. Thank youCapt Polston"

The barrel through the ejection port is marked “HK 9mmx19 / 27-172812”. The grips frame on the right side is marked “HK Sidearms BmbH / Made in Germany / USP”. The underside of the trigger guard reminds you toi read the instructions, and a metal tag with the importer and serial number. Barrel Length: 3.58” Sights / Optics: The front sight is the factory white dot dovetailed into the slide and the rear is a square notch dovetailed into the rear of the slide. Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are Black polymer. There is normal handling wear and some smoothing to the textured areas. There are no notable flaws to the stock that cause alarm. The grips rate in about Excellent overall condition. Type of Finish: Blue Finish Originality: Original Bore Condition: The bore is dark in the grooves and the rifling is dulled. There is possible erosion in the bore, it maybe fouling, but we could not get it to lift with our mild cleaner and may need to be de-lead to properly clean. Overall Condition: This handgun retains about 95% of its metal finish. There is light wear from normal operational use. The exterior of the gun exhibits very light sign of use. With the \condition of the bore we would expect more wear to be visible on the exterior. There is light finish loss to the leading edges of the barrel. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear. Overall, this handgun rates in about Fine condition, excellent if not for the bore. Mechanics: The action functions correctly. The decocker works as intended, the manual safety works. The gun does not have a magazine disconnect. We did not fire this handgun. As with all used firearms, a thorough cleaning may be necessary to meet your maintenance requirements. Box, Paperwork & Accessories: Factory box with serialized end label. There is an HK sticker, instructions, firearm lock key, and two 10 round magazines. One is currently installed in the pistol. All accessories exhibit little use and in excellent condition. The magazines have slightly more wear from normal operation. Our Assessment: The entire description of this gun could have been summed up in the title. This is a German Manufactured HK 9mm Pistol. If you have ever owned a HK product you know that they don’t put their name on junk, nor are they cheap by any means. The guns manufactured here in the states are great, but the German manufactured guns tend to demand a slightly higher premium because of the assumed higher quality of the finial product. This pistol packs so many safety features we don’t know where to start. They tend to be a little intimidating to the average user, and if you have never owned an HK product this one is great to get your feet wet. CA Legal or CA Private Party Transferable: This handgun CAN be transferred as a dealer sale in California. This handgun CAN be sold as a Private Party Transfer (PPT) at our Simi Valley shop."
