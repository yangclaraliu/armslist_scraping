And this time it’s a fierce one. We all know what happened in Las Vegas by now, but many do not know there has been legislative action brought forth in a bill by a REPUBLICAN named Carlos Curbelo. This bill goes beyond AR rifles or AK’s. This is going to involve everyone, even deer hunters. The bill that has been introduced does not just ban “bump-stocks” it will ultimately ban all semi-auto rifles and pistols. The bill is very loosely written and does not even mention the term “bump-stock”. It states it will ban “parts that is designed and functions to increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle”, which will mean triggers, disconnects etc.I am asking you to please be involved with this process because we cannot solely rely on president Trump or the NRA. Representatives need to hear the voice of WE THE PEOPLE. They work for us. Please call these representatives and leave them a voice mail (be courteous) and state “I am a registered voter and DO NOT approve of the Curbelo Bill. Thank You.” I have compiled the list of representatives that have backed this bill and their office phone numbers, I am aware that they are not here in Michigan, but they still need to know that lawful gun owners will not stand by and forfeit our second amendment rights. Even if you just call one, that’s better than doing nothing. So please, take 2 minutes out of your day and leave a message. Don’t count on others to do it.Carlos Curbelo (R-FL): (202) 225-2778Peter King (NY): (202) 225-7896Leonard Lance (NJ): (202) 225-5361Patrick MeeHan (PA): (202) 225-2011Ed Royce (CA): (202) 225-4111Chris Smith (NJ): (202) 225-3796Erik Paulsen (MN): (202) 225-2871Ryan Costello (PA): (202) 225-4315Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (FL): (202) 225-3931Charlie Dent (PA): (202) 225-6411The Bill: https://curbelo.house.gov/uploadedfiles/finalbumpstockban.pdfPlease watch this video Military Arms Channel video: https://youtu.be/sCLoIorYguU"

Most notably it went back to all CNC machined and milled construction with introduction of solid pins. This rifle belonged to my grandpa and I remember him shooting it exactly once, it spent the rest of the time sitting in his safe. He was more of a marlin guy. Anyway, finish is almost perfect with very little to no flaws as a result, and action and barel look new.

* 24"" Length Barrel, instead of the 22""
* Barrel is ported by the manufacturer, instead of the 22"" non-ported barrel.* Multi-Layered, Real Wood Grained Stock* Is able to be interchanged with any caliber of the H&R SB2 Model Barrels!

This rifle, based on ‘Crown Jewels - The Mauser in Sweden: A Century of Accuracy & Precision’ which is probably the best book ever written about Swedish Mausers, states that the rifle with these markings indicates a handful of complete rebuilds by Carl Gustafs in the 1960s and only receiver was retained. It has brand new barrel, stock. Factory installed GF diopter and less important but really neat, it comes with that cool leather magazine pouch.

Bring a special piece of the pump-action shotgun legacy to your collection with this commemorative Model 870™ Wingmaster®. The highly polished and richly blued receiver is milled from a solid billet of steel for the ultimate in rugged dependability, and two twin-action bars provide the utmost in positive chambering and ejection. Custom-quality finish and handsome American walnut woodwork already make the Wingmaster® the most aesthetically refined member of the Remington pump-action family, and the custom engraving and 24k gold plating done by Baron Technology, Inc., on this limited edition commemorating Remington’s 200th anniversary add even more classic appeal. On the right side of the 870’s blued receiver is an oval portrait-frame of Eliphalet Remington, who, in 1840, founded the original E. Remington and Sons. Surrounding Remington’s portrait is open-vine scroll work that feathers forward to the ejection port and back to the rear pin. A duck in flight and a banner that reads: “Remington 200 Years 1816-2016” are above and below the forward scroll, respectively. The NRA’s seal is neatly tucked under the scroll work. On the receiver’s left side is more open-vine scroll in a landscape setting with two ducks in the center in various flying configurations. On the left and right sides of this scroll work are two banners, with the left’s containing the words: “Remington Arms” and the right’s: “200th Anniversary.” Features custom NRA serialization, limited to 1,145 units and exclusive to Friends of NRA."

I put about 100 rounds down the pipe; it was a blast, and pricey. the gun runs well, especially with full power loads. it especially likes FMJ rounds- cast/unjacketed bullets are a no go. This gun has a gas system you can foul up with lead, and they don't feed well. Im open for just about any trade offer, with a preference to handguns. Otherwise ill do just about anything else. Multi-gun trade, milsurp, glock, sig, AR, AK, whatever! just shoot me an offer.or you can outright purchase it for 925.
