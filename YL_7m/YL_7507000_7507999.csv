Concepts training classes. A custom firearm of the highest quality, and cutting edge tactical training,... the Beowulf is unmatched in both value and ruggedness. FRAMEOur frames incorporate several unique features, all designed to make your Glock more functional and user friendly. 1911 enthusiasts will appreciate many of these features as we have ""borrowed"" heavily from some of the more traditional frame designs. The end result is a sure grip that provides several distinct advantages...Frontstrap- As everyone's hand is different, and we have yet to see an individual whose hand interfaces correctly with the finger grooves on the stock frontstrap. In fact, original Glocks did not feature these 'cosmetic' bumps, which were actually added as an afterthought. With a straight vertical front strap reminiscent of John Browning's designs, we achieve strength through unified high fingers. Better fit, better control, better results.Backstrap- Rounds striking the target high are the result of two combined factors… first, the shooter is pressing the trigger using the entirety of the dominant hand… second, the backstrap often contains a pseudo-ergonomic whale hump at the bottom which actually exacerbates this problem. Hump gone – problem gone.Trigger Undercut- If you've run the Glock combatively, you are aware of the stock geometry where the bottom of the trigger guard meets the frontstrap. This has been radiused and deburred to prevent the raw middle finger (AKA “Glock Finger”) notorious to Glock shooter's and get the operator's hand higher on the weapon. By increasing this round cut under the trigger guard, shooters are able to get longitudinally closer to the trigger axis. This allows for a more ergonomic trigger press, facilitating accuracy and independent movement of the trigger finger.Rounded Trigger Guard- This is the one feature we originally added for mainly aesthetic reasons, to further differentiate our weapons from the rest of the herd. However, after T&E, we discovered that the stock design of the trigger guard seems to encourage shooters to practice bad grip habits. Specifically, the curved and textured area on the front of the guard invites novice shooters to place their support-hand index finger in this area, leading to an unstable grip. Safety can also be an issue, as having your index finger in this position puts it dangerously close to being able to activate the trigger. With the trigger guard rounded, we immediately noticed a reduction in this occurrence.Magwell Crescent- Some malfunctions (i.e. double feed) require that the magazine be stripped from the magwell. This cut facilitates this process by providing more access to the mag baseplate, giving the operator more leverage for remedial action.Mag Release Cutout- (Gen 3 ONLY) Many shooters have a problem easily activating the mag release; as a result they frequently will add an extended release button. Instead of raising the bridge, we've lowered the river. The Mag Release Cutout provides a lowered section around the mag release that funnels your thumb directly into the button. Unlike using an extended release, it has the added benefit of not changing the dimensions of the grip profile, which can be problematic for left-handed/support/ambidextrous operations. (ONLY applied to GEN 1-3 Glocks)Grip Stippling- Our unique Kraken stipple pattern provides traction in all the right places. Stability and weapon retention are improved as a result."

The Adams Arms Lightweight Gas Piston brings a standard AR-15 rifle into the 21st century by replacing its dirty direct gas impingement operating system with a cooler, cleaner, short-stroke gas piston design. With the piston, hot combustion gases are kept out of the upper receiver and vented forward, resulting in a gun that remains cleaner and cooler during operation for increased reliability and decreased maintenance. The low profile design of the gas block reduces weight and streamlines the look. 
 
With the 3 position adjustable gas block you are ready for anything, Full gas for normal shooting, reduced gas when running a suppressor, and no gas for non-cycling stealth mode.

Two recently sold on GB, one for $730 and another for $900. I took it in trade and may trade for another rifle or handgun. Really looking for another pistol. I especially like revolvers.

This Grip module replaces your 2-piece Grips with screws, being a 1-piece wrap-around Grip that significantly reduces the size and width of normal 2-piece Sig Grips, as well as reducing the length from your palm-to-trigger finger, making for a much shorter reach to the trigger! Not to mention, no longer having to worry about all those darn screws anymore, from falling out, or getting stripped, or having to buy replacements, etc.. The slim profile and ergonomic E2 design makes concealed carry MUCH easier and more comfortable, with a more ergonomic grip that allows you to grip higher and faster on quick-draws from your holster, as well as reducing the possibility for any ""snagging"" on clothing, etc.. during your draw! I ordered this straight from the Sig Sauer Online Store for $68 plus S&H which cost me just north of $85 after tax, shipping, and all other expenses factored in. However, I never got the Sig P-229 I was hoping for, so no longer need this. Also, the 1-piece E2 polymer Installation & Removal tool is included of course, which makes installation or removal an EASY job to be done WITHOUT help or any ""Professional"" gunsmithing or work needed! Either part takes less than 60seconds to install or remove! I will sell for just $40even!Thanks for looking!!"

With even more consistent loads I'd imagine she'd shoot half MOA all day.  Gun has been rattle-canned with Montana Black spray paint in color Syrian which is a nice FDE, with Brown accents.  The Montana Black is a high quality paint with better durability than Rustoleum etc, but still super easy to deal with.  As rattlecan paint jobs are intended, the paint isn't perfect.  Its coming off in spots, especially on plastic and rubber which never holds paint well but overall gun looks great and will only get better the more you shoot it.  Comes with one 20 round milspec mag painted to match rifle. I'm easy to deal with and respond quickly.  Price is rather firm unless you wanna make the transaction SUPER easy in which case I'd see value in that.  Scams, four word emails or other shenanigans will be ignored and/or reported as necessary.  FTF preferred 'cause she's a bigger gun and kinda heavy to ship.Build is as follows:Upper: Ballistic Advantage 18"" .223 Wylde Hanson profile barrel with pinned gas block: The heart of this rifle and an A+ component.  Check them out if you aren't already up on them.PSA No-Logo Mil-spec BCGALG Muzzle BrakeALG EMR v3 Mlok 15"" Rail (with installation wrench)American Defense Group Offset IronsBravo Gunfighter Charging HandleQD Bipod with adjustable legs and swivel capabilityDaniel Defense BroomstickOptic: Primary Arms 4-14 HUD ACSS DMR Scope, with illuminated reticle.Aero Lightweight mountBeaver Scope capsLower: Anderson Mil-spec lowerPSA A2 Lower Parks KitBravo Gunfighter gripMagpul trigger guardMil-spec Trigger group (uprades available for additional $$$)"

The Bul factory in Iseral makes super high quality military firearms and this is no exception. These pistols were imported in the 90's and 2000's and are considered to be extremely well made. This particular example is the double stack .45acp nicknamed the ""Hebrew Hammer."" It is the two tone stainless model which was the top of the line model. It has a 10 +1 capacity in a compact frame. I got this pistol in a trade and the cash is more important to me right now I'm not sure if it's history but it looks like it's in mint condition. If it has been fired it was very minimal. There are absolutely no wear marks on the slide or frame. I have one mag and no box. I have seen this model sell for 550+ on internet auctions. And they were in worse condition. I am asking 350 obo. I will also add a box of Winchester Ranger T-series self defense ammo(50 rounds) if the price is right.I will only consider face to face transactions in the Dublin/Worthington area. And I will only accept cash offers. NO TRADES OF ANY KIND WILL BE CONSIDERED. Buyer must have a valid Ohio identification.

I just purchased this pistol from a gun store one week ago. It's had 3 mags run through the gun to make sure it functions correctly which it does I had no malfunctions. It will come with original box, paperwork, gun lock, 3 mags. 2 12 round mags and 1 17 round mag. Gun comes standard with a big dot front sight which is very nice, easy to get gun back on target for follow up shots. The absolute only reason I am wanting to trade or sell this pistol is because I'm such a glocktard I can't get used to shooting other pistols and I've got glock mags running out of my ears so I'm wanting to trade this FN for a glock 19 or will take 500 cash. For the right deal I can throw in a nice OWB leather holster for the gun.

The Tasco may not be a high end scope, but it's clear as a bell. The iron sights still are on the rifle as well. The rifle has a bit of light pitting on the barrel, but its much cleaner than what I saw on the used guns on Gunbroker.
