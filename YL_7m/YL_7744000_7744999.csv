Light, crisp, makes for a perfect target or defense gun. It has less than 150 rounds through it, as I've only taken it to the range a few times. Comes with the revolver, the case, and one rubber speed strip that came with it.I'm asking $750 for this. Cash only, not interested in trades right now.Best way to contact me is by texting 248-255-9307 or sending me a message on here at any time. I'm in Canada right now for Christmas, so I'm posting the one picture I have saved of the firearm plus one from the Cabelas website. I can take a few more and post them/send them to you tomorrow night/tuesday when I get back to Michigan if need be.Located in Northville, willing to travel a bit but nothing crazy.

I spent over a year looking for a 1911 that checked all the boxes on my list, and this gun has every detail. Jeremy S from TTAG has an excellent video on YouTube and this gun is exactly that. Watch it! First, the fit and finish is exceptional. It is blacker than night to the point that it's almost hard to see in normal light. No idiot scratch! It has never had a single hiccup after just under 1,000 rounds (no light strikes, FTF, FTE, etc.) and racks like it's on ball bearings. Bonus: I did the break in period per manufacturers instructions! Top to bottom: suppressor height trijicon night sights, rib cut on top of slide for glare, flared and cut ejection port, slide cuts (makes it shoot like BUTTER), threaded barrel and protector, GI guide rod (!!!), match grade barrel, unique no snag hammer, single side safety (!!!), true picatinny rail, the most comfortable and responsive grip safety I've held, positive grips, front and back grip serrations, trigger serrations and cuts, mag well. I'm probably missing things, and just describing it has reminded me how much I find this gun attractive. It always turns heads at the range, but don't think you have to baby it. This gun RUNS. It's so gentle you would think you're shooting a .22! More accurate than I am. I suggest a particular cleaning product that I will include that should last the life of the gun. I'm also throwing in some hollow points and a TLR-3! Original case and two DW factory mags included. This ones gonna break my heart and go fast."

It has the 32"" barrel (swings and points like a dream) threaded for screw-in chokes, and currently has the steel full choke tube in place. That is the only choke I have for it, but others can be found. I've only used tungsten shot in this gun and on ducks and geese it's an absolute monster! Nothing else in the marsh sounds like a 10 gauge or hits with the authority of one. One of my duck hunting buds nicknamed this one ""The Hammer of God"" after it dropped at wounded goose at an absolutely absurd distance. While some may be hesitant to buy into a 10 gauge due to recoil, this one produces only a mighty shove. It's nowhere near as violent as any of the 3-1/2"" 12 gauge guns I've fired. Price is $800 FIRM and I'll leave this ad up for a week or two, then it's off to gunbroker.com where it will fetch substantially more."

Wichita PPC right bolt/left port action, heavy stainless 6mm PPC barrel (I have no idea who built this rifle or who the barrel maker is) in what appears to be immaculate condition both inside and out. Rifle has what is clearly a 2 oz. BR-grade trigger and if I had to guess, I'd say it's a Jewell. One of the cleanest, lightest, and most crisp triggers I've ever felt. Flawless custom-machined 1"" scope rings and bases. Stock is finished in what i'd describe as a midnight blue/black motor oil metal flake paint of automotive grade. Additional photos available on request. Wichita 1375 stripped actions commonly sell in the $650-700 range, so this package deal is a steal! $800 firm. The only trade I'd be really interested in would be a Savage 112 Target Magnum (.338 Lapua), although other especially interesting long-range rifles may be considered.Update: This rifle's chamber neck diameter is .262"" as I suspected. This is the most common neck diameter used by benchrest shooters to obtain the near-legendary accuracy the 6PPC is noted for. If you're looking at this ad, you probably already know this necessitates a set of semi-custom dies and neck turning of the brass to match this chamber dimension. As the chamber dimensions match what most competitors are shooting, getting set up to load for this rifle should be a relatively straightforward and reasonably economical affair. Pair that with a decent scope and you should be ready for the range."

It's a simple-to-use pistol that's rugged and affordable, which makes it a great value for any sporting purpose... target shooting, plinking or small game hunting. Simply stated, the Mark III handgun offers the most versatility and value of any rimfire pistol on the market today.

The closed end plate prevents dirt and debris from entering the Striker channel, a fatal flaw of the stock VP9. These parts were installed by a local gunsmith. The cocked-Striker indicator at the rear of the gun is a meaningless feature added by HK to satisfy a senseless German government requirement. Also, the cocking wars at the rear of the slide have been replaced with HK factory low-profile fillers.

Barrel.  Right now a new one will cost you $2,194.62 plus taxes.   This rifle has had less than 6 boxes of ammo shot thru it and is in excellent shape.  If interested you will give you the number of the FFL bussness and you can verify the condition.  I added a Malcom scope to it to make the longer shots easier since my eyes aren't what they use to me.  The scope and installation cost was over $300 dollars. Open to Trades of equal valueI think the price I'm asking is a fair price for the condition and with the scope.  Remember, its the 45-90."
