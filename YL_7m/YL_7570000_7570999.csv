Williams folding leaf rear sight and fine brass bead on ramp front sight. Magnum 3-inch chamber and 1:36 twist.I bought this barrel new, sighted it in, and used it for one season before going to a dedicated rifled slug gun. This barrel has very few rounds through it--essentially, just what I put through it to find the ammo it liked best. That ammo is Brenneke standard 2.75"" sabots, which it will throw consistently in 3-inch groups at 75 yards. With the 1:36 twist rate, I found it is best suited to heavier, moderate-velocity ammo--like the Brennekes. If you've ever shot slugs out of a relatively light gun like an 870, you'll probably agree that you'll want to forego the magnum or high-velocity loads if you want to be able to get any kind of followup shot. But if you're not bothered by recoil, that 3-inch magnum capability is there for you.This barrel is in like-new shape: mirror bore, no rust inside or out, bluing easily 98%. It's time for this barrel to get out of my safe and onto your gun; it's all set to mount up on your Wingmaster or 870 and go to work. It's zeroed for 50 yards with Brennekes.$150 cash, firm. Please reply to this post with your name and phone number and the best time for us to meet at my house, in Hamburg.Thanks for looking."

Please click link below.http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/cold-steel-tomahawk-norse-hawk-90n/ Description The influence of the Viking’s famous weaponry far out-lasted the reign of the Vikings themselves. Their axes in particular, have influenced many designs that can be seen to this very day. Our Norse Hawk has a curved cutting edge to facilitate deep, slashing cuts and terminates in two sharp points. Traditionally, the bottom point would be used to capture an opponent’s shield, leg, arm, shoulder or neck, momentarily immobilizing or bringing him closer and easier to dispatch. The top point was used to execute direct chops or, with a thrusting motion, to pierce or gouge. The Norse Hawk remains one of our most popular Tomahawks. Both with reenactors and with sport throwers, who admire its balance, effectiveness and effortless sticking power!   Additional Information    Part # 90N   Weight 25.3 oz.

Its vertical configuration makes it easy to point the handgun to where one would normally point the index finger of the dominant hand. This instinctive pointing is highly prized by tactical shooters and makes for consistent--and consistently-accurate--target acquisition. Also, the grips are thin in spite of being able to accommodate a double-stack, high-capacity magazine. This makes trigger-reach simple even for those with smaller hands, besides offering a more compact profile for those carrying the M9A3 concealed. All this, plus the crisp checkering on the front- and backstrap as well as removable wraparound grip, make any combat hold simple and consistent.

It was 100 bucks just for that bag.  It has a very good CA compliant Mag Release. Requires a small Allen to loosen the Magazin release botton. If you take it out of CA, you can simple just loosen the screw without having to change the button. Than the button functions as a regular button. And when you are back in CA, give it a few turns, and you are CA legal. The bullet buttons are in the Gray area. This is really the smartest rout as far as CA compliance goes.  Legit stuff here....  All the magz are 10/30 CA legal   Deals will be done at the local Gun dealer in Burbank. or dealer of your choise within 50 miles of 91343"

Mfg P/N: PI9137LP
FAMILY: 1911 Style Pistol Series
MODEL: 1911 RO Champion LW
TYPE: Semi-Auto Pistol
ACTION: Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide Rod
FINISH: Stainless
FRAME: Forged Lightweight Alloy
STOCK/GRIPS: Thinline Cocobolo Hardwood
CALIBER/GAUGE: 9mm
CAPACITY: 2 - 9+1
# OF MAGS: 2
MAGAZINE DESC: 2 - 9 rd.
BARREL: 4""
OVERALL LENGTH: 7.5""
SIGHTS: Fiber Optic Front & Low-Profile Combat Rear
SLIDE: Forged Carbon Steel
The Range Officer Champion is a perfect fit for those looking for a concealable 1911 that won't weigh them down. While a normal, all steel 1911 can weigh over two and a half pounds empty, the 9mm Champion tips the scales at just 31.5 ounces. The .45ACP model weighs in even less at just 30 ounces, thanks to the bigger hole in the barrel. That's quite a difference when it's on the hip all day.
While the overall height is the same as that of the Range Officer Operator, the Championâ„¢ includes a four inch stainless steel match grade barrel as opposed to the Government size five inch barrel. In the Champion, we use a bull barrel fitted to the slide that houses a supported ramp to save wear and tear on the frame over time. As a result, we can use lighter weight forged aluminum for the frame. That helps us shave weight for its intended carry mission.
The sights are all business, with a fiber optic up front and a low profile combat sight in the rear that won't snag during the draw. For recoil control and function, we use a dual-spring assembly that allows us to control precisely the recoil impulse in this smaller package, thereby ensuring reliable function with a minimum of fuss to the shooter.
The Range Officer Champion is available in 9mm and .45ACP. Both models ship with two magazines, seven rounds each for the .45ACP and nine rounds for the 9MM. Even though the Range Officer® Champion is smaller and lighter, you won' t have to sacrifice capacity for carry convenience."
