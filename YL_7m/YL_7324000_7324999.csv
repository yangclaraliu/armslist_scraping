Internals are in perfect condition, and the gun is extremely accurate. Trigger is unbelievably good and has been fired enough that it's as buttery smooth as it's going to get.

Here's a list of the things I have for sale, pictures will be posted sometime soon, but if you'd want to look before I can get them up, feel free to text me at REDACTED. Thanks for looking!Mosin Nagant - Has 1943 on the reciever, custom downturned bolt (original bolt, not the sniper variant, local gunsmith turned the bolt down and created a space for it in the stock). The dingus before me drilled into the stock to mount an AK-style rail for optics. The top of the reciever has been properly drilled for a rail on top, which is included, I'm pretty sure it's a weaver mount. Has a little rust on the gun, but not enough to hinder function whatsoever. Comes with a gun bag, a bunch of ammo, will get an exact count on boxes and type. Initial price is $240.AK 7.64 Mags - One MAGPUL with metal feed lips and 4 Polish surplus magazines. Asking $20 for the Magpul and $9 for each Polish mag. Buy all 5 for $45. AK 7.62 Ammo - Will check on brand and how much ammunition, price TBD based on those two things.Haley Strategic D3CR Chest rig - Bought online, have no use for it. Holds 4 rifle magazines, 2 pistol magazines, has two general purpose pockets, and one bungee pocket. Has the ability to mount to an armor carrier via 4 clips and a wide patch of velcro on the backside of the rig. Downside - doesn't have the strap that goes behind your mid section. Unable to find a replacement, but I'm sure you could fine someone in town to create one, or source one online. My loss is your gain however, Haley Strategic sells this for $180, I'm asking $120 because of the missing piece."

This is a large, heavy synthetic case with a hard foam lining that is fitted for this rifle. There are also separate, removable sections of the foam in the lid and the bottom of the case for storage of accessories. Please see our pictures for more detail. The lid of the case has a label marked “PELICAN / 1750 CASE” and the front face of the bottom section has a white label marked with the make, model and serial number of this rifle. The case has a large synthetic handle with four clasps securing the lid. There are multiple light handling marks on the outside of the case. The foam on the inside of the case appears undamaged. The case is in about Fine condition. Our Assessment: There is a great line in the Crocodile Dundee movie where Dundee pulls out his large knife saying “That’s Not a Knife – This is a Knife”. Well, this is certainly a rifle. From Barrett’s website: “Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again. Available in both .50 BMG and .416 Barrett, the Model 99 brings new levels of long-range precision shooting. Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on.”. This is a Barrett Model 99 rifle with a 32” barrel chambered in .416 Barrett. It has a 3 port fan shaped muzzle brake, M1913 steel Picatinny optics rail, a detachable bipod with adjustable legs, a match grade trigger and a bolt with enough threads on it to lock-up Fort Knox. It comes with a 10X Bushnell Elite 3200 scope and its Pelican hard case. This rifle has all the goodies you need for the ultimate in long range precision shooting, built on a solid action that should provide decades of use. For those who live in California, its .416 Barrett chambering is the only allowed."

This one is no different with the only numbers seen are a ""2"" on the hammer. It also discusses the only know examples are dated 1902 or 1903. This particular revolver is dated 1913.
