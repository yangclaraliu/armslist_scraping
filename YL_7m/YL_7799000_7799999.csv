Unlike most ""copies"", many experts believe this version was in-fact a better gun then the one that inspired it. Very well built and durable design. Excellent grips. Feels good in the hand, with smooth trigger.One of the worlds best enduring conceal carry firearms. Until the 1980s most European law enforcement used the .32acp round as the standard cartridge.  Very good mechanics and bore. Looks decent with blemishes.  I have a few other ones too that are also in great working condition with very good bores but somewhat more cosmetically challenged.  The others are priced somewhat less.  More pleasent to shoot, and much less recoil than 9mm or .380acp, yet readily available. Small enough for most purses/bags. The Vz.50 (commercially sold as Cz-50) is an all steel semi-automatic pistol made in Czechoslovakia. It is chambered in the plentiful 7.65mm ( .32 A.C.P. ) caliber. It has a simple blowback action with a fixed barrel. The trigger is traditional double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted decocking safety lever. The sights are fixed and the magazine is single stacked with a capacity of 8 rounds. The magazine release button is located relatively high on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger."

Pistols are a great candidate for your NFA Short barreled rifle project or install a Stabilizing brace for shooting comfort and increased accuracy. Barrel is threaded in the popular 5/8 x 24 pattern thus allowing usage with a wide variety of flash hiders , muzzle brakes and silencers. The pistol has an optic rail on the receiver for ease of adding your favorite optic. Another nice exclusive feature is the 51P Arm Brace Ready butt-cap, designed to easily take a pistol stabilizing brace if so desired. This newest version of the 51P now has the desirable paddle magazine release for easy magazine removal. They are amazingly easy to control even firing the .308 and with a stock or arm brace can be quite useful. The pistols will accept readily available 20 round Surplus magazines or the very popular X 91 50 round drum mags. This firearm comes with (9) 20-round surplus magazines and (1) ""X-Product 91 model"" 50-round drum magazine.

The new mags will either be Pro Mag or S&W  brands.  Not offering a choice, as no one has had a issue with any of the mags to date, and Pro Mag gives a lifetime warranty.   Pistols are pretty much identical to the service model, except this model has an aluminum alloy frame, while the service model is stainless steel. All metal firearm. Totally reliable pistol. If you could figure out how to load their mags with beer cans, I bet  they would feed them with no problems. Double and single action.  Super smooth and light trigger.  Double strike ability.   Very managable recoil.  While polymer frame pistols have their place  there is something to be said for a classic American made fully metal quality pistol.  This baby eats Glocks for lunch.  This is the type of gun that you could pass on to your great grand kids after 5g rounds and it still will look and function great. Great home defense/truck gun.
