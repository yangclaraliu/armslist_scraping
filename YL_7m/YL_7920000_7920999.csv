488,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7920488,For Sale/Trade:  Colt R0603 603 M16a1 PreBan Upper w/ barrel XM16e1,"SW Springfield, Springfield, Missouri",$ 850,"Listed On: Friday, February 9, 2018",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am parting out a real deal vintage Colt's R0603 M16a1 upper. There were multiple versions of the 603 and this is a later version. This was a firing and functioning firearm prior to disassembly for parts. By parting this, I hope to help several buyers get their retro builds up and running! This is an original Colt Upper Assembly in good and original condition and has the standard size pivot pin hole unlike many of the other Preban Colt's. This means you can put it on any modern lower without having to buy the proprietary Colt lower with the large hole and pin. This one does not contain any markings in the carry handle, making it correct to this time period. This appears to be the original finish. The bore in the barrel look nice! This is a list of what is included on this upper assembly: - COLT OEM Carry handle upper with forward assist but no case deflector. Correct to the real 603. It is important to note this IS a real M16a1 603 upper so it is the STANDARD pivot pin, and not he large pin found on the civilian AR15 / SP1 etc.- COLT OEM 20"" M16a1 barrel stamped ""C MP Chrome Bore"". Many of these real M16a1 barrels were shot out so I believe this is a replacement barrel, especially giving how good the bore looks.- COLT OEM Adjustable front sight / Gas Block with the correct ""C"" marking at the top and the correct ""Bell"" towards the bottom. It also has the bayonet lug and sling swivel- COLT OEM adjustable rear sight with the correct directional marking on the upper.- COLT OEM gas tube- COLT OEM Delta rings that are flat and not tapered like the newer production. This is correct to the 603- COLT OEM dust cover- Birdcage style flash hider, however I don't have any way to determine if it is Colt or not. If this is important to you, please let me know how to verify it and I am happy to send you more photos or information.I also accept Cryptocurrency such as:  GunCoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Electroneum, etc."

Designed as a low-cost version of their popular PM9, Kahr's CM9 pistol is a top-of-the-line performer when it comes to accuracy and reliability. The CM9 differs from its predecessor by having traditional rifling rather than the PM9's polygonal rifling, a change that greatly reduces cost without sacrificing accuracy. The CM9 weighs in at only about 14 ounces, but its built to be extremely durable. Its black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a safe-cam action and an unbelievably smooth double-action-only trigger stroke, making the CM9 fast to fire in critical defensive situations. The CM9 also features drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights. Each pistol ships with one 6-round magazine.
