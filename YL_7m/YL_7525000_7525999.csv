The Intensity embodies the feel of smaller gauge guns which is possible because the recoil spring encircles the magazine tube located forward of the receiver. The Intensity's slim attractive profile is accomplished by slimming down the dimensions of the durable polymer stock. The Intensity comes with a 28-inch barrel and sports a stepped ventilated-rib red fiber optic front sight and a set of three extended choke tubes. Shoulder the Intensity to feel how it becomes a natural extension of your arm—you instantly know what right feels like.keywords: beretta Benelli browning ruger Winchester bird hunting skeet shooting trap smith and Wesson glock sig hk"
