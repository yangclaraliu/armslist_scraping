I don't want to deal with the hassle of salvage and reconstructed title. I do have the original clean title, but the insurance informed me they notified the DMV the car was totaled. It was rear ended, and insurance felt it was cheaper to total than fix.With that said, as you can see the body is rusty and some rot on the quarter panels and rockers. To my understanding the Skelton and structure of the frame is still good. It has a d15b7 automatic engine and transmission. I only owned the car for a month before the accident, only issues I had was battery and had it replaced and an oil change. I drove it from Dorchester to Dedham for work everyday up until the accident. You can either strip it and use it for parts or use the shell for a build. It's still drivable in case you want to see the engine and transmission run. Will come with the title and bill of sale, I value it at $500, looking to trade for a firearm, shotgun or nice carrying piece, just try me worst I can do is say no. I have a valid LTC in case you are wondering, any questions let me know. I have more photos upon request, just having issues posting them."

Built for the every day carry responsible armed citizen, Law enforcement, and Military. The HSP TH1RTE3N Glock Handgun sights were designed based on the science of how the human eye acquires sight alignment and sight picture under precision or stress sight picture situations.  Handgun sights are installed on a handgun to add more precision; this is what the HSP13 were designed around.  Under “critical stress” shooting, we know that the Body Alarm Response (BAR) instantly takes control and increases the blood flow to the center field of vision.  This in return increases your visual efficiency on the threat.  During this immediate process, it is very difficult to focus on anything other than the threat.  Your eyes observe, your brain orients, and you then decide on an action to take.  During this immediate BAR response process, you will look through your sights with your focal plane fixed on the target due to it being a positive and natural human defense mechanism.  With this theory in mind, the widths of the front sight or rear sight notch are irrelevant.  The idea that your front sight and or rear notch need to be large for faster target acquisition is misguided, according to current research by visual experts.   However, precision sight picture does matter when the information continues to the higher cognitive portion of the brain during situations where a decision has consciously been made to use a higher level of precision for hostage taker or long-range shots for example.  In this case, the HSP 13 sights are designed with a .125 front width sight and a .125 rear sight notch. This will refine the sight picture during the trigger press, decreasing human error and increasing hit probability on a precision target. -TH1RTE3N sights are precision CNC machined from heat treated1 416 stainless and finished in Black Oxide. -TH1RTE3N sights are hard duty / carry sights with a distinctive rear sight charging cuts for single hand applications. -TH1RTE3N front sight diameters are .160 height by .125 wide and come with a .070 tritium front sight insert. -TH1RTE3N rear sight diameters are .160 height with .125 bottom tapered notch, optional in black out or dual .070 Tritium inserts. -Please use a .050 Allen Head Tool for Rear Sight installation 100% made and manufactured in  the USA"

Just the only two pins have been coming out lately and I'm not very AK savy and it's just been sitting in the safe. Numbers all match, receiver bolt, etc. I think built date was 1965. Owner before me put her away warm in rifle case so there is some material transfer on the barrel. Selling as is, would like to give her a good home or find someone interested in using her for parts towards a new build. Price is firm. Cash only, permit to purchase or permit to carry only. Will ask to sign bill of sale and record license number. Fake permits will be turned away. Will update with pictures later. Inbox for more info. Won't find cheaper Funtional AK47 in the state."

It is in good to very good condition given the production of the 915 was from 1992 to 1994 prior to it being replaced my the 910. Please see the provided photos to gauge the condition yourselves. Whereas the 915 was on the less expensive end of the 3rd generation guns the 910 took it a step further as far as reducing production costs with plastic parts. This Smith and Wesson 915 is from my uncle’s estate and does not have plastic where metal should be unlike the 910. It includes the original box as well as much if not all the original paper work (please reference photos). The guns I believe came with a single 14rd magazine which is included. Also included are two Mec-Gar 15rd magazines (pictured) one of which is NIB. Please let me know if you have any questions whatsoever and I will do my best to answer them. *I can only sell to Tennessee residence face to face. Residence to other states must have the firearm transferred via FFL. I require the buyer to have a valid carry permit. Though I will take other forms of identification depending* Thank you for looking

Has the gen3 trigger pack these are not the gen 4 triggers with after market parts to make a gen 3 as seen online this is the real deal all genuine fn parts. This makes this firearm rarer than rare very hard to find gen3, you won't find them in this configuration not your usual ps90.
