This tracer ammunition is loaded to military specification and is perfect for providing the shooter with immediate feedback through trajectory visualization by allowing the bullet path to be seen. Tracer ammunition is a great choice for banging away at steel targets, casual plinking and high-volume blasting sessions. The military uses tracer ammunition as an efficient tool for signaling.  They are effective for use as pre-arranged signals between units and individuals; they also can be used to designate targets. As tracers burn very bright and very hot they may catch surrounding vegetation on fire, so they should only be used where there is a limited chance of the shooter starting a fire. This ammunition is loaded with a delayed ignition tracer meaning it will not ignite for 50-100 yards. This means the tracer is not burning up barrels prematurely causing damage to expensive firearms. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer-primed, reloadable Lake City brass cases. Local pickup at 37th N & Woodlawn"

The Parkerization would indicate that it is a Polytech, as the Norinco's usually had black receivers. But, I am unaware if Polytech made ""Sneak"" marked rifles for the US market. Parkerization is strong, with no corrosion, and as noted before the stock is in great shape. Top plastic handguard has some paint flecking off, also with no visible cracks. Unknown if any parts are USGI as no visible markings show without disassembly. Would make an excellent Chinese pre-ban collectible or shooter for the range"

For sale is a 1910 Beretta Glisenti. Looking at the serial numbers It was within the first 3000 made. This is the first year Beretta made a semi automatic handgun I believe as well.It is missing 2 small parts, the disconnector, and sear pin.The mag is also not included.The barrel is very slightly buldged and looks as if it had a jam but the bore seems to be smooth within. One grip has a chip missing and cracked so I'll show that side. Other sides fine.I have never fired it as long as I've owned it. It's only been a display piece.Will listen to offers but I already know this price is insanely low.."

In short, its appearance perfectly matches what it is.Wood quality is critical to a shotgun’s appearance and value. Walnut with good color and figuring is scarce and expensive. The Lightning has decent wood. The stock has some figure. The wood has good color. The fore-end has straight-grained wood. The glossy finish is flawless.

I went a little overboard when I built it a year ago. It features a mid length 16 inch hammer forged, chrome lined barrel made by FN for spikes tactical, a pinned gas block (more durable than those secured by set screws only), 13 inch bcm kmr rail, forged Anderson upper, PSA premium bolt carrier group that's chrome lined and mpi/hpt tested, forged mil spec charging handle, and a Griffin armament compensator/brake. It's got about 1,700 rounds through it with not a single malfunction. It's seen just about every type of .223/5.56, steel and brass, and ate everything I fed it. I've cleaned and serviced the upper regularly. The rail has a few blemishes from being handled and shot over the last 12 months. The barrel underneath has some very slight rust in one area from some rain I wasn't able to wipe off.This is not a safe queen. This upper is meant to be used and abused, and if you take care of it like I have it will last a long time. These FN barrels last about 20,000-30,000 rounds. Like I said earlier, this upper is built like a tank. I'm only selling it because I need to fund some military clones.I've got about $750 invested in the parts, probably closer to $800 factoring in shipping. I'd be willing to part with it for $650 considering the round count and cosmetic blemishes. The round count will probably continue to climb as I will keep shooting this upper until I sell it.Im firm on the price. I'm not in a rush to sell it, so please don't lowball or ask what's the lowest I'll go. No trades either, I'm strictly looking for cash so I can fund other projects. Thanks for looking!"

This is a 1988 Taurus model 66, 4 inch barrel, 6 shot, 357 magnum revolver. This isn’t one of the crappy new ones they are producing. It is a hand cannon. The gun is chambered for 357, so it also shoots 38 special and 38 special +p without any problems. The gun is tight and operationally perfect. I literally picked it up on Friday, September 8th 2017 from the gunsmith where he applied a hot satin blue finish. And before he got it, it had just returned from Taurus were I had them replace all the internals that showed signs of wear, which was the firing pin. So the gun is good to go. It is missing the rear sight however as i just haven’t taken the time to get one for it. This particular gun is very well known as one of Taurus best revolvers. I highly encourage you to look it up. I would prefer to sell it. But I will trade for another handgun. I would prefer to trade it for a revolver that is smaller and is rated for continuous 38+p. But I will consider other trades as well.

The simple to use design makes it easy to have fresh, clean, filtered water at home, at the office, in the gym, or for all kinds of outdoor activities. When you drink from a WaterBasics GRN Line Filtered Water Bottle, you are assured of a thoroughly tested and proven level of biological protection that includes protection from bacteria, protozoans and chemical and biological toxins. The high flow properties of the GRN Line filter make the WaterBasics GRN Line Filtered Water bottle as easy to drink from as sipping soda through a straw. With a price point closer to a to a basic taste and odor filter than a powerful biological grade filter, it’s not only possible, but prudent to carry a GRN Line filtered water bottle everywhere you go. For the cost of 20 liters of bottled water, you can enjoy over 300 liters of filtered water with the assurance of GRN Line protection. The WaterBasics GRN Line Filtered Water Bottle is BPA Free, fits into standard cup holders, backpack pockets, and bike cages. The patented Bite-Me valve is soft, friendly, flows like crazy, and stays clean thanks the unbreakable protective cap. It is leak free and will even stay sealed in an airplane overhead bin. The Series II filter design, contoured shape, soft squeezable design make the GRN Line Filtered Water Bottle a natural choice for drinking water protection. WaterBasics GRN Line Protection is achieved using Electro-Positive Absorption Technology. Charged micro-glass fibers “pull” organisms as small as bacteria, out of the water stream while still maintaining high flow rates and low pressure drops. GRN Line filters have been thoroughly tested by independent laboratories, and proven to consistently remove protozoan cysts, and bacteria to ANSI/NSF – 53, and US EPA standards, without the use of disinfecting chemicals such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine. The addition of sub-micron carbon particles into the filter media increases the absorptive capability required to reduce chlorine and harmful chemicals, bad tastes and odors to ANSI/NSF – 42 standards. WaterBasics GRN Line filters provide superior biological protection, high flows and long service life in a compact, lightweight, and easy to use cartridge. WaterBasics Series II is all about connectivity. Developed by our engineers to provide maximum ease of use and protection from cross-contamination, the familiar “plug-and-play” design works with all WaterBasics bottle and cap styles, and assures a positive “leak free” fit. Simply fill the bottle, replace the cap, and drink clean, fresh, filtered water wherever you are. Series II Filters are designed to assure a positive seal without the use of screw-in treads, o-rings or gaskets that can be misaligned, damaged, or lost. A positive seal means positive protection and peace of mind. You can depend on WaterBasics. Made in USA Features: – GRN Line Bacteria Filter with up to 800 ml/minute flow rate– Miraguard Antimicrobial Technology suppresses the growth of bacteria, algae, fungus, mold and mildew within the filter media– Finger ring allows for easy transport and connection to packs– Filters 80 Gallons (Over 500 Refills)– 22 oz.

So that makes it a great alternative to an AR 15. It is so new it still has the factory grease on the inside of the gun so I don't think my asking price is unreasonable especially when I see these rifles going for $1650 and up. I would prefer to just ship the rifle out and not have to deal with a private party transfer, but if I need to I will. Free shipping to any FFL.  I will not do anything illegal so if you don't want to do the transaction legitimately don't bother messaging me.
