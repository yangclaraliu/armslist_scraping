It is the largest one we have had yet. We want to wish you a Merry Christmas with a Christmas Sale from us and to also thank you for your support and business in the short time we have been open. Around 90% of the firearms are on sale along with all our holsters and many other accessories. These are our Rock Bottom Prices with No Room for negotiating at all on these. Many of these prices are too low to advertise, but give us a call or come by and we will be happy to let you know what we can sell it to you for. These prices are good from 12/18/17-12/23/17. This is the last week of the sale, and as a reminder after we close on 12/23/17, we wonâ€™t be open again until 1/3/17. Many of the new pistols and a few of the used ones we will be able to offer Rain checks and take an order with 15% down if we have sold out of them, but many of them we cant replace or cant replace for the price, so they will be while supplies last. Please take your time to look at the list or come by as it is a very large sale. If a gun says massive sale and doesnt have a price, it is too low to advertise. However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season. Again, thank you so much for your friendship, your business, and Merry Christmas. Remember, Jesus is the reason for the season and dont forget to give praise to our Lord and Savior. God Bless.

Standard configuration 24"" round barrel with full magazine and crescent butt. Original blade front sight with full buckhorn rear. Overall the gun retains approximately 40%+ original bluing with vivid traces around the frame and within protected areas of the barrel & magazine. It appears as though someone lightly scrubbed the gun, maybe with emery cloth or steel wool, and subsequently there are numerous fine surface scratches throughout. They are not deep and the gun still has a pleasing appearance with sharp edges and much original finish remaining. Bright fire blue on the loading gate with marbled traces of case color on the hammer. The stock retains a very pleasing untouched original finish with no cracks, chips, or repairs whatsoever. Perfect 'wood to metal' fit with minimal marring. Original buttplate, lever, lever locking nut, hammer, trigger, dust cover, forend cap, and magazine band. Original screws throughout. Clear original serial number, tang marking, and barrel address. The action is crisp and functions flawlessly. Outstanding bore with sharp, bright, and shiny rifling front to back. Mechanically this gun is just excellent, especially considering it's a 137 year old blackpowder rifle!

The K frame holds six rounds, and is larger. The extra size and weight makes it more accurate. In fact, back in the day --- The Police carried this! It was known for shooting .38 special at the range; and carrying .357 for business. S&W came out with the next model. The ""L"" frame. It is heavier and thicker, as it was designed for a steady diet of .357 Magnum The 686 model is an L frame, designed to be stronger for Heavy Bone Crushing Magnum Loads for hunting. Although it is a bit heavier and wider than a K frame - in the Snubby round butt version; it can be carried concealed with .38 special hollow points. What makes a 1988 revolver better than a newer version? 1) The firing pin is on the trigger 2) Case hardened - Flash chromed Forged trigger and Target hammer 3) No modern Mim (weak) parts 4) No Internal Lock. 5) Easy to use. Hold tight, aim, pull trigger. No 500 round break in is required to trust it. Yes, this was built when Quality still mattered. Today's guns are about mass production short cuts, no hand fitting and keeping the price cheap. That is why you can't give away a new revolver, and the older guns fetch a premium price. This super shiny personal bodyguard sports a beautiful pair of S&W Walnut grips. Put it next to your Glock and see which one your eyes keep darting towards! Plastic Tupperware does not have the Romance of the Old Cowboy days. They belong in an Easy Bake Oven. This 686-3 belongs on your Open Carry BBQ Holster! Compare the single action pull to a 1911. Just as sweet. The double action is better to survive the Legal aftermath of a warranted shooting, with a pull much smoother than a Plastic double safe trigger Brick. I am not a dealer. My guns listed for sale took me decades to collect. They are my babies, my toys, my safe queens. My carry gun is a Glock 23, with a grip chewed on by my Bulldog Puppy. Safe Queens sit in my safe, and get rotated to my living room display case with polishing and oiling. I keep them like new. Who cares if a Glock gets dirty or becomes an English Bully chew toy? They are not attractive, but they do go bang…. The reason I am selling part of my Safe Queen collection is due to Hurricane Irma damaging my roof, blowing down my fence; frying my well pump; etc. at my N. FL farm home, and S. FL townhome. Insurance will not cover the cost of a fence on 20 acres… They will not apply the cost to the deductible. FEMA is no help if you have a job and own stuff. So….. (sniff) I have to cull the collection. Here is your chance to own a gorgeous piece of history that will Double in value. Good Luck with your bid. Gun comes with the original Rubber Grip and a black soft range carry bag. Wood grips are the Rare Hogue Combat Walnut that came on the old model 66 F Comp. Sorry, the box and paperwork got ruined in the attic when the roof blew off in the hurricane."

It is the largest one we have had yet. We want to wish you a Merry Christmas with a Christmas Sale from us and to also thank you for your support and business in the short time we have been open. Around 90% of the firearms are on sale along with all our holsters and many other accessories. These are our Rock Bottom Prices with No Room for negotiating at all on these. Many of these prices are too low to advertise, but give us a call or come by and we will be happy to let you know what we can sell it to you for. These prices are good from 12/18/17-12/23/17. This is the last week of the sale, and as a reminder after we close on 12/23/17, we wont be open again until 1/3/17. Many of the new pistols and a few of the used ones we will be able to offer Rain checks and take an order with 15% down if we have sold out of them, but many of them we cant replace or cant replace for the price, so they will be while supplies last. Please take your time to look at the list or come by as it is a very large sale. If a gun says massive sale and doesnt have a price, it is too low to advertise. However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season. Again, thank you so much for your friendship, your business, and Merry Christmas. Remember, Jesus is the reason for the season and dont forget to give praise to our Lord and Savior.
