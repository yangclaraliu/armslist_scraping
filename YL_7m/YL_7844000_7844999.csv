It is a 270 caliber. It has a Leupold VX3-L 4.5x10x56mm scope mounted. This is an amazing rifle and the only reason I am selling is because it’s too heavy for my tiny 110lb fiancé. She can’t hold it up to take a standing shot for deer hunting because it’s too heavy for her to steady free handed. I have bought her a youth model rifle so I no longer need this. I am asking $1600.00 obo for both the rifle and scope. The rifle is $1400.00 and the scope is $1150.00 new. It is in like new condition with only having 20-25 rounds fired thru it.

I was going to use it to get into longer distance shooting, but I decided to go the bolt action route instead.I have NEVER fired it. Just added a few things to it, and put it in the safe. I was planning on buying a bipod and optic for it before I shot it, but never really got around to it. The MPR (Multi-Purpose Rifle) is a seriously nice rifle, that's equipped from the factory with:-18"" cold hammer forged 4140 chrome-moly steel, 1:8"" twist barrel-Rifle-length gas system for smoother operation and less recoil-Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter, with a matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier for corrosion resistance.-15"" free floating rail with M-LOK attachment slots-Ruger Elite 452 two-stage 4.5lb trigger with a lightweight hammer that enables 30% faster lock time over standard triggers-Ruger Elite radial port muzzle brake-Magpul MOE grip and MOE SL collapsible buttstockThings I've added and what it cost me:-Magpul BAD Lever ($30)-Custom Dust Cover (Deus Vult/Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum) ($30)-Magpul MBUS front & rear flip up sights ($75)-Magpul Bipod Adapter ($30)-Magpul Rail Section ($14)-Radian Raptor-LT charging handle ($40)-3 20 round magazines ($12 ea so $36)-1 10 round magazine ($12)-1 30 round mag that came wth it.-AR Customs Mythosaur Mag SOC (Rubberized grip assist for comfort and protection) ($20)-I also have the factory box with the lock and all paperwork that came with the rifle.That's $250 in extras, not including tax and shipping.The rifle usually sells for (On Buds & Gunbroker for example) $650 + transfer fees. Overall in this rifle I have well over $900 invested, (With FFL fees, tax, and shipping for everything, I'm actually in it at $973) and like I said, the rifle and ALL of the extras have never been used. The most I did to the rifle was strip it, clean the factory grease off, lube it up and put it back together.I'm asking $600 FIRM for this. It's a ridiculously good deal on a ridiculously high quality rifle. My loss for deciding to go in another direction when it was almost finished, and your huge gain.Not interested in trades right now. Already bought a Ruger American bolt action for my long range shooting so I need the cash to replace the hole in my wallet.Must be 18+ and a Michigan resident. Face to face only, no shipping.Located in Northville, willing to travel a bit but nothing too far.Best way to contact me is by texting me at REDACTED or sending me a PM at any time.Thanks for looking!~ Mike**It only lets me put two pictures but I have a lot more. Feel free to text me and I'll send them over!"

The GP100 is two years old and has seen minor holster use (for a few days with camping), but mostly it's been stored at home and used at the range.  It has the standard Hogue rubber grips.  I've had no problems with the gun and I keep it meticulously clean.  It's probably seen about 1000 rounds through it.

The revolver has a full trigger job including upgraded Wolff springs and polished trigger sear surfaces.  The double action is much lighter than stock and the single action has a crisp, very light pull.  I also upgraded the front sight to a Hi-Viz fiber optic sight.  The original sight and springs are included, and I'll re-install them if you prefer.

I'll also throw in a soft case, a Galco black leather ""high-ride"" holster, a SafariLand speed loader, a leather speed loader holder, and some ammo.  Ammo includes 50 rounds of .357 Monarch SJHP and about 30 rounds of assorted Buffalo Bore .357 heavy stuff."

I have won competitions with it and hit targets out to 300 yards.  If you are looking for an overkill piece of glass for your rimfire, this fits the bill. This scope would be a great fit for a PRS style rifle, a long range hunting rifle, or anything else that needs to be accurate at long range.The scope is in perfect cosmetic and functional condition.  If something goes wrong with it, or if you drop it, all Vortex products have an unconditional lifetime warranty.  This warranty is transferable. Simply send it to Vortex and they will send a new one back.  You don't even have to fill out a warranty card."
