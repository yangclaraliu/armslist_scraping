A very early example of the PPK/S, the gun features its original retailer packaging along with manual, test target, and one extended-grip magazine. Among the many variations of the timeless PP from several post-war makers, the French production pistols are regarded by many as the finest, and examples are now highly prized by collectors. Appearing to have seen no use, this excellent example of one of history's most iconic firearms would be an outstanding choice for concealed or duty carry, as well as a fine addition to any dedicated Walther or French handgun collection.Condition:NOS, the pistol has little to no sign of use and very little evidence of handling. There is the occasional fine scratch on the finish, but the stainless surface rates at 98% or better. Markings are legible and unbuffed, with correct St Etienne proof marks present and import mark on the slide. Grips are excellent with no sign of wear apart from denting to two diamonds on the right grip. Mechanically flawless, the bore is as-new with only light lint build-up present."

There is the occasional fine scratch on the finish, but the stainless surface rates at 98% or better.

The Belgium Brownings were made from 1956 to 1967.  Thereafter, the guns are made in Japan by Miroku.  The 7 in the serial number stands for 1967, and the T means it shoots long-rifle ammo.  This info can be found on the internet if you google Date Your Firearm-Browning.  It shoots .22 long rifle ammo only.   It is pictured with a Leupold FX-2, 4x33 fixed-power scope on a Redfield mount, with Leupold magnetic, flip-open scope covers.    The scope remains attached to the barrel when the gun is broken down for storage or cleaning, and the point of impact remains the same.  This was a special-order gun. The barrel was drilled and tapped at the factory to accept the base and rings.  I am the original owner, and the gun has been very well maintained.  It shows some handling wear, which is to be expected.  There is no visible rust, and the bluing is immaculate.  It is a pleasure to shoot, and is very accurate.  I will sell the gun as a package for $700, with the scope and ring mount, or just the gun with mount, for $500, if you would like to add your own scope.  It uses 1 inch rings. This is a lifetime gun that would be a wonderful starter firearm for a new shooter, young person, or collector. $500"

TALO Had FAIL ZERO coat the slide and barrel with nickel boron coating. Nickel boron provides a hard, durable surface (40% harder than chrome) and permanent lubricity to metal substrates, allowing firearms to operate without oil or grease. EXO coated components last longer, clean up easier, and require minimal maintenance, while increasing relaibility in harsh environments (sand/dust, hot/cold, suppressed fire, frangible ammunition). TALO tested one of these to evaluate their failure rate. They ran 5,000 rounds through it with no malfunctions or lubrication.This Glock 19 TALO EXO is in lightly used to near perfect/mint condition. I put about 100 rounds through it, cleaned it, and it's been sitting in the safe for years. I recently put brand new Wilson Combat Vickers Elite Battle Night Sites on it - $112.00. It comes with two new Glock OEM magazines, a new Ghost Inc. 3.5 Connector, a Ghost Inc. Grip Plug - installed, but new, a Glock OEM extended slide stop lever, and a Glock OEM extended magazine release - both installed, but new.Price is $500.00 cash firm - looking to fund another project.

I have hand picked it from several to get the best quality wise as it greatly varies and as I was buying it directly from Belomo factory store I've a chance to inspect at least five and pick the best one. It's absolutely top quality red dot sight, never git a chance to use it though so you'll be getting a brand new sight guaranteed to be in flawless condition. All controls are smooth, no scratches on the lens or body, never installed, comes with everything as provided from the Belomo factory. Below is the manufacturer's specs for the sight. Shipping is free. Don't hesitate to ask any questions.More specs can be found On the official Belomo website:http://belomo.by/en/catalog/optical-and-optoelectronic-products/priceli_kollimatornie_dlya_strelkovogo_orujiya/pk-01viPK-01VI COLLIMATOR SIGHT is designated for targeting of automatic small arms during shooting under any illumination conditions at day time, in the twilight, at night with application in combination with night vision devices (Night Vision Goggles of the type NV/G-14, Night Vision Monoculars of the type NV/M-19). The sight is being produced with two types of the aiming mark in form of «?». It is being mounted on Kalashnikov submachine guns of all modifications by means of brackets (p. 41), as well as on G36 submachine guns, FN machine guns, M-16 rifles of all modifications, G3 and other automatic small arms which have seat – guide strip of the type «Picatinny rail MIL-STD 1913».A very nice and a very reliable Russian take on Aimpoint concept. This scope is your best solution for those beloved Saiga-12 and Vepr-12 marvels that are conquering US right now. Not many red dots can sustain the abuse of 12Ga. Only the true military grade scopes can take on that task reliably. ALL of that sub $200 mass produced bottle glass will fall apart after 50 to 100 slugs fired. A rattling noise inside of your ""scope"" will tell you your ""zero"" is gone, and its never coming back. Not unless you put this scope. Body is made from aluminium alloy, powered by CR1/3 battery. 30mm tube makes it compatible with commercially available rings and bases. The reticule is nothing fancy, just a red dot, but it is bright. Overall, this scope is the cheapest military grade scope you can find. It comes in a cammo pouch, user manual (in Russian) cleaning brush (you can double it as a fine paint brush), light filter, ballistic cheat sheet for 5.45x39 and 7.62x39 calibres. Sorry, no battery. Shipping is free nationwide. Paypal 3.5% more (due to the fee that they charge)."

Im looking to part with it simply because im looking to get into a new firearm and these just sit in my safe.____________________Specs list:.22 AR Upper and Lower: Approx. 3 bricks of .22 fired (NOT PICTURED ON RIFLE BUT INCLUDED: Safe mod for NYS compliance. No need for registration on this rifle) The VK-22 has a multicaliber mil-spec lower receiver paired with a Chiappa Firearms .22LR dedicated upper receiver.

(Also shoots out a pretty awesome fireball if that matters)____________________Parts:On the Lower receiver is a milspec size buffer tube with upgraded buffer spring to accomodate the larger cal. I didnt notice a difference but i didnt want to wear out the stock spring with 5.56 ammo. The stock spring and buffer tube is commercial size and has less than 300 rounds of .22 in it. With either buffer setup i noticed no issues with cycling on either size caliber. Along with that is a magpul butstock and the m4 clone butstock (you can have both or i can swap them out and only send you what you want)2: 10 round mags for 5.561: 10 round mag for .222: Pickitiny rail rear sights1: Pickitiny rail front sightAnd again im really sorry but the Scope is not included however I'd be willing to include it for additional cost.For the scope:Nikon P-223 Riflescope for AR 3x32 BDC with scope rings : $250_____________________Regulary cleaned using Seal-1 Cleaning supplies (CLP, lube, etc). No rust. Stored in humidity controled safe. No problems. I updated some of the internal trigger springs (sear springs) just for the better preformance on the 5.56 upper.

The rifle is in new un-fired condition and has been in a collection since it was purchased back near 35 years ago. These early imports are of much higher quality than the examples made a few years later and the fit and finish is much nicer. These early examples had blued bolts and all parts are matching numbered as well. Of course these underfolders are the most attractive and sought after variants, they are much more desirable than the wooden stocked versions. These pre-ban rifles are extremely sought after and avidly collected and they certainly remind me of the crazy 1980’s."

The new NIGHT HAWK can be built on either a stainless or a blue Redhawk*, whichever you happen to have. Our new NIGHT HAWK boasts a shortened barrel of 4 inches, although the barrel length is up to you. When we install the barrel back into the frame we make sure the barrel/cylinder gap is perfect for the most reliable functioning and to give you the extra power of the smaller gap. We then crown the barrel with our own Deep Dish crown and do our Maxi Throat on the other end, giving you considerably more accuracy potential. We then add our own interchangeable blade sight system with your choice of the gold bead front sight blade or the standard ramp sight.  Then we dehorn everything. That means we round all the sharp edges for easier holstering and quicker getting it out of the holster. We do our Gunfighter Grip to the beast and perfectly fit a pair of classy rosewood grips. This gives it the perfect fit in the hand that our Gunfighter Grip is known for.  After the grip work, we do a small amount of engraving on the barrel and frame. We then give the new NIGHT HAWK a soft satin Vapor Honed finish with no shine or glare. The blued NIGHT HAWK gets our satin Black Chromex finish. Also on the blued NIGHT HAWK we add a few stainless small parts for contrast with the deep black finish.  We then give the new NIGHT HAWK a full action job with a smooth double action roll off. The gun is fully sighted in and ready for the fields when you get it. Plenty of power but in a compact easily carried package. Whether you use the new NIGHT HAWK for concealed carry or for packing in the wilderness, it will always be a revolver that is totally dependable and accurate. A hard gun to beat, is our new NIGHT HAWK. And as always one third down gets us started on your new NIGHT HAWK."
