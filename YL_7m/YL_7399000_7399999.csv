After WWII this rifle was sent to US Depot, Anniston, Alabama, and was then issued to the Danish Navy during the Korean War (see the Navy Anchor on the Rear Sight). After the War it was returned to Anniston and eventually it went into the Civilian Marksmanship Program, this is when the present owner hand picked it. The rifle was such a great example of what a Historic M1 should be the owner went one step more, he sent the rifle to Dean Dillabaugh of Dean's Gun Restoration, where the rifle was completely restored, a new barrel was added, and all parts were hand polished by Dean using Genuine Mil-Spec Parkerizing, following the government Armory process that meets Mil-Spec Stnd-171. The stock was custom made and hand fitted, and the gas system being stainless steel will not Parkerize so it was finished with a baked on enamel coating. I will say one thing, this rifle is tight, the bore is bright and shiny, the fitting is flawless and the lock up is positive and it is one of the best looking M1's that I have had in my hands, and it is for all practical purposes is a brand NEW M1 and it also qualifies as a C&R Rifle. I can have this ship to your state local dealer if needed"

Let's play ""Who is the moron"".  Here are your options:1. the idiot that lists on Armslist a used version of this firearm for $$$$ more than what I am asking for BNIB;2. the guy that pays that for the used one; or3. me for selling brand new fireams at such incredibly low prices.My wife picks #3 (but for totally unrelated reasons). This model is in stock.  Very hard to find.  The factory makes them once and a while, and when they do I get as many as I can.  Basically the same gun as the extremely popular 9mm J.A.9 full size pistol, but chambered in .380acp.  380acp is better for home defense as the .380acp round is less likely to over-penertrate.  The bullet (part that comes out the front of the barrel) in a 380acp round is the same size as a 9mm bullet.  American made with manufacter's lifetime warranty.  Includes two 13 round magazines.  Unless you weigh 400lbs, this model is probably to big and heavy for conceal carry, but it's great for home defense, and as a truck gun.  Has great sights, with the rear being adjustable.Model: J.A. LC380 Height: 4.75 inches Thickness: 1.25 inches Weight: 30 Ounces Length: 6.625 inches Barrel Length: 3.75 inchesThe flagship feature of the Jimenez Arms LC380 is its easy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern. These features coupled with a last round slide hold open makes this pistol uncommonly accurate and a delight at the range."

I actually own this exact model pistol. Next to my vintage Star, Super B, the JA32 is my favorite pistol to shoot. The sights are extremely simple and basic, but they work well. Very easy to keep on targe. recoil is more controled than a .380acp. Still a big enough round for self defense. Until the late 1980's, most European law enforcement used the .32acp round for their primary hand guns. Time tested design, which is basically the same as the old Jennings, Lorcin, and Bryco guns, but finished better. Comes with two 6 round mags.  Very hard to find, as the factory seldom makes this model."

I've put less than eight hundred rounds through it in the time I've owned it, so the internals are near factory new. It has primarily been a pampered safe queen, showing minimal signs of use and no corrosion. Note, this isn't the NATO version and will not accept AR-15 magazines. This AUG uses the proprietary Steyr brand ""waffle"" magazines, and thus features a last round bolt hold open and a bolt release (unlike the NATO version).   This rifle comes with numerous accessories, two of which are already installed. I've mounted a Bushnell TRS-25 red dot sight and zeroed it at fifty yards. The sight is in excellent condition, includes box and manual. Shortly after purchasing the rifle, I came to dislike the weight of the trigger, so I installed the Trigger Tamer in the trigger group. The Trigger Tamer replaced the factory part and reduces the AUG's somewhat heavy trigger pull by about three pounds. The Trigger Tamer paperwork and original part are included. A Manticore Arms brass deflector and paperwork are also included. Last but not least, are the magazines. Eight standard capacity (30 round) magazines, and two extended (42 round) magazines are included.  The price is non-negotiable and I am not interested in any trades. Feel free to contact me for any additional details or photos."

Building on the lauded submachinegun platform that first hit the US civilian market in pistol form in 2015, the Carbine has a 16.2"" barrel fitted with either a compensating muzzle brake or a faux suppressor built specifically for CZ-USA by SilencerCo. Fit with the factory's folding adjustable stock, the Carbine features a number of US-made parts to make it fully 922(r) compliant. One of the nicest features of the firearm is the newly-designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor. Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics, Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.

There's no guarantee a deer standing on a hillside will hand around for your to cut the distance in half. With the GPR-HC rifle, you can take that shot with confidence. The GPR-HC has a billet upper and lower receiver with a newly designed War Sport muzzle brake whick tames recoil and virtually eliminates all muzzle rise. That means you can stay on target to make quick follow-up shots. Crafted for Performance. They start with in-house production of their own barrels, using only the highest quality, American-made gun barrel bar stock. The barrel, gas tube and bolt carrier group on the GPR-HC is treated wtih Nitride--a chemical process that makes the surfaces slicker and more durable--to increase the rifle's accuracy and lifespan. The upper and lower receivers, puls the rail, are Type 3 hard-anodized and are then finished with a Cerakote composite that resists abrasion, wear, and corrosion. The GPR-HC rifle can stand up to rain, snow, sleet and blistering heat. Made in America. Every War Sport rifle is hand-built at their state-of-the-art North Carolina facility using only American-made parts. A master builder oversees the assembly and fine-tuning of each firearm from start to finish. When you shoulder your GPR-HC rifle for the first time, you can make the shot knowing it will perform flawlessly and precisely.

There are a number of scrapes, and scratches, as well as some staining, and discoloration of the wood stock. However, there are no serious chips, or cracks, and the stock features a beautiful engraving on both sides. This rifle's receiver is also in good condition, with no scratches, scrapes, staining, rusting, or discoloration on the outside, and only minor signs of rusting on the inside. This rifle comes equipped with a Tasco 3-9x40 Rifle Scope, set off to the side, which allows the shells to be ejected from the side of the receiver. This is a fantastic firearm, that would make a great addition to anybody's collection.

This rifle comes in Good, Mostly Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It does have a moderate amount of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, and saw regular, normal usage. There are a number of shallow nicks, cuts, scratches, and scrapes, all throughout the wood stock, as well as the rifle's forearm. None of these are severe, but they are numerous. There are no severe chips, or cracks, or staining and discoloration. The receiver also has some minor, shallow scratches, and discoloration, though it is free of staining, and rusting on the outside. There is a minor amount of rusting inside the chamber, but not a large amount. This rifle features a Gold Trigger, and a Timber King 3-9x32 Rifle Scope. This is a great rifle that would make a great addition to anybody's collection. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this rifle, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."
