It is the smoothest semi-auto 308 I've shot, sub MOA all day, so i hate to sell it. If you know anything about Larue, you know theyake arguably the best precision gas guns out there. The fit and finish is impeccable. Unfortunately. I am running out of room in the safe, so I figured I'd see if there was a market for this. I chose the OBR because the reciever/rail have 20 MOA built in. There are certainly some other good rifles out there, but this rifle will shoot with any of them.Note - I used the Larue photo because the rifle currently has a Magpul PRS Gen 3, Silencerco muzzle brake and an expensive scope on it, and I want to avoid the inevitable emails from people asking if all that stuff is included. The rifle doese come with a Larue plastic case, 2 mags and all the typical Larue goodies. The stock and such are negotiable.From Larue's site:The LaRue OBR (Optimized Battle Rifle) was built from the ground up, using a newly designed upper-receiver platform, combined with a lower, inspired from our successful 5.56 MM lower. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet, for the optimum fit and consistency. The receiver components are designed with more material in critical areas to alleviate known issues of weakness in 7.62 platforms and to stiffen the receiver....translating into maximum accuracy.The upper-rail provides generous room for all issue weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations (suitable for 7.62 MM). The built-in 20 MOA cant provides correct ballistic orientation for all inline night vision combinations. The MIL-STD-1913 side rails are detachable, so that they can be configured for Vis / IR illuminators, etc, or left off to keep rails pristine, without the need for bulky rail covers. The bottom rails are also detachable, and can be positioned anywhere along the entire lower length, for the interface of MIL-STD-1913 equipped bipods, grips, tripod mounts, etc. These rails are offered as spare parts for field-service replacement, keeping repair cost at a minimum.Barrels:Available in 16.1"", 18"" & 20"" lengths. All gas blocks feature our unique Port Selector Technology (PST), a two-point adjustable gas selector that allows optimum function between suppressed, and unsuppressed operation at the flip of a switch. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24, with an A2-type flash hider attached (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). Internals:The Bolts and Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys. The carrier key contact areas are designed for zero gas leakage. About LaRue Firearm Accuracy: LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results."

Outstanding, non-import marked 1923 Lithgow SMLE...this Enfield was manufactured by the Lithgow Arsenal and subsequently issued into service with the Australian Army. A favorite of collectors, Australian Enfields are prized for their reliability, accuracy and quality of finish. This weapon has standard features, with all correct markings and numbered matching components. In remarkably clean, original condition, it rates as excellent and, while not near mint, is undoubtedly one of the finest wartime-vintage Lithgows that the collector is likely to encounter. Having seen no refinish, the gun is in top mechanical condition with a perfect bore and is set in its original furniture. Possibly in service through the Korean War and WWII, the lack of an import mark strongly suggests that the rifle was imported prior to 1968. In ideal condition for the shooter or dedicated collector, this weapon represents a superb find for the Enfield enthusiast and should not only retain its value, but will likely appreciate.
Condition:
Excellent. All surfaces are free of rust or pitting and most markings are nicely preserved, correct and legible. Trace amounts of the original ""tropical"" green paint there rifles were sometimes issued with are still visible on the receiver barrel, indicating that this rifle may have seen combat in the Pacific theater. As stated above, all numbered parts are matching, to include the receiver, barrel, bayonet boss/nose cap, bolt, rear sight and furniture. The magazine is unmarked but is of Orange Arsenal (a Lithgow feeder factory) manufacture and thus likely original. Furniture is in good condition with some minor defects as pictured. Bore is excellent with strong lands and grooves."

What makes this particular rifle so interesting are 6 letter ""J's"" carved into the stock. Look up the letter in the Cyrillic language. I've only shot this on one occasion and learned quickly why, given how accurate it is with it's range graduated rear sight, it may have been a markan's weapon.I also have a wooden crate of wrapped Russian ammunition, plus an ammunition can of mixed target and hollow point ammo available, along with numerous magazines and a modern folding tactical stock with gas block I never mounted.  Additional pictures upon request.I will require a testimony of eligibility to own and possess firearms as well as an official State ID despite this being a vintage C&R eligible firearm.I'm not interested in any trades at this time.

This optic is very clear in like new condition. The M145 Telescope is a fixed 3.4 power, 28mm optical sight that has been designed to engage targets accurately out to 1200m range. The optical sight weighs 24 oz. (681 gr) and is extremely rugged for rough field conditions. The sight has an 8.2mm diameter exit pupil, which provides excellent vision in low light levels, i.e. dawn and dusk, and also for rapid target acquisition. The zeroing adjustment increments in both windage and elevation are 2.5 mm at 10 meters range for each detent (click of movement) and 5 inches at 500 meter range. The mount is designed to fit to the Picatinny rail MIL.Std. 1913. The optical sight has an eye relief of approximately 3 inches (70mm). The reticle pattern has built-in trajectory compensation from 300m to 1200m range. The reticle is illuminated, by a battery. It has been used in conflicts around the world and is rated for the heaviest of machineguns, such as the M249, 240G, and MINIMI and of course M16 type rifles. This optic compares favorably against anything Leupold, Aimpoint, ACOG, or EO Tech puts out!

This optic is very clear in like new condition. The M145 Telescope is a fixed 3.4 power, 28mm optical sight that has been designed to engage targets accurately out to 1200m range. The optical sight weighs 24 oz. (681 gr) and is extremely rugged for rough field conditions. The sight has an 8.2mm diameter exit pupil, which provides excellent vision in low light levels, i.e. dawn and dusk, and also for rapid target acquisition. The zeroing adjustment increments in both windage and elevation are 2.5 mm at 10 meters range for each detent (click of movement) and 5 inches at 500 meter range. The mount is designed to fit to the Picatinny rail MIL.Std. 1913. The optical sight has an eye relief of approximately 3 inches (70mm). The reticle pattern has built-in trajectory compensation from 300m to 1200m range. The reticle is illuminated, by a battery. It has been used in conflicts around the world and is rated for the heaviest of machineguns, such as the M249, 240G, and MINIMI and of course M16 type rifles. This optic compares favorably against anything Leupold, Aimpoint, ACOG, or EO Tech puts out!

I may put new batteries in it at my cost (I get batteries at a dealer rate) but only if necessary. Has 2 new rear tires and could be great for multiple uses. Cash is king, you have to pick it up or pay to ship it. I'm asking $2500 but the price is negotiable, will depend if I have to put new batteries in. I believe the batteries it currently has were new in 2015 but I would need to double check. If you're interested or you would like to come see it, please call or text me at REDACTED. Thank you and have a great day, ask for David. I believe that for the right person, they could clean this up and re-sell for a profit or get a lot of use out of it.

You might be surprised.For more pictures check out the listing on Gunbroker: http://www.gunbroker.com/item/721822901Here is an extremely rare opportunity to own a documented piece of Montana State history! Despite being a documented and cataloged part of the Samuel E. Johns rare firearms collection housed at the Montana Historical Society Museum in Helena; this historic gun which belonged to pioneer Thomas E. McGovern Sr. and was later acquired by historian Samuel E. Johns, has remained in private hands since 1957.The gun: A model 1853/67 French military 'Tabatiere' breach-loading rifle converted by the Belgians in the 1870s to a 10 gauge shotgun and exported to the US, marketed to budget conscious homesteaders and pioneers under the ""hunter"" model designation which is stamped on the barrel forward of the breech. These firearms are sometimes referred to as ""Zulu"" shotguns but not every “Zulu” is the same.The history:Humble BeginningsThis firearm belonged to Irish immigrant Thomas E. McGovern Sr. (1829-1898) who came to America from Ireland in the 1870's seeking the American Dream. McGovern began as a placer miner and by 1880 had become a pioneer stockman, settling a 500 acre cattle ranch at the head of Flathead lake along with his son Thomas McGovern Jr. 11 years before Kalispell was plotted as a townsite. McGovern was one of the very first settlers in the Flathead valley and his ""Zulu"" shotgun is a clear reflection of his humble beginnings. McGovern’s homestead would later serve as one of the first taverns in the area where weary travelers could find room and board.Towns and RailroadsIn the late 1890s, John O'Brien of the O'Brien Lumber Company was sent by railroad tycoon James H. Hill of the Great Northern Railroad to build a lumber mill at the head of Flathead lake in order to supply ties for the westward expansion of the railway. At this point in his life, an aging McGovern sold 350 acres of his homestead ranch to O'Brien for the sum of $10,000 and O'Brien proceeded to build the lumber mill along the North shore of McGovern Bay off of Flathead Lake, which was later renamed for the company town of Somers O'Brien would establish there. By 1900, a spur line from the mill to the newly plotted town of Kalispell was completed. As families began to settle the area and education became a necessity, what would come to be known as the ""McGovern School District"" was formed.The American DreamUpon his father's death in 1898, McGovern's son Tom Jr. relocated to Kalispell where he became Director of the Conrad National Bank and built several rental properties as well as a Queen-Anne style home for his family on 2nd Ave. which is on the National Historic Registry as the McGovern/Karcher house.The HistorianEnter Samuel Enoch Johns (1866-1945); Irish immigrant, amateur historian, entrepreneur, gun collector and founder of Johns Hardware in Kalispell which was open from 1931-1959. At some point, Johns acquired Thomas McGovern Sr.'s shotgun which he cataloged into his collection (No. 569) and displayed in his hardware store along with hundreds of other firearms of interest or belonging to noteworthy individuals. At the urging of his brother in law, writer and politician Frank Bird Linderman, Johns chronicled the history of the area for posterity in what are known as the ""Johns Journals"", an invaluable historical resource archived by the Montana Historical Society. After Johns passed away in 1945, his journals and the firearms in his collection were donated to the Montana Historical Society Museum in Helena and became the Sam E. Johns Collection. Provenance:McGovern's shotgun has Samuel John's characteristic catalog tag affixed to the trigger guard with the same handwriting and catalog numbering system which in addition to identifying it as belonging to McGovern, states that it was loaned out from the Johns collection in 1957, two full years before MHS received the balance of the collection. While Johns passed away in 1945, the hardware store remained open and the firearms displayed until the store closed in 1959. To whom the McGovern shotgun was loaned out in 1957 is unknown, but it found its way into another private collection and was later given away in lieu of payment for contracted work that had gone unpaid. The individual who received the McGovern shotgun as compensation kept the gun as a family heirloom and passed it down to his son from whom I purchased it. Thorough historical research with citations and references has been done on the gun and it will include all the relevant provenance paperwork attesting to its lineage including a sworn affidavit, photos, copies of historical documents and my correspondence with the Montana Historical Society.Legal Status of The Gun:Since MHS didn't receive the collection until 1959 and the gun was absent from the collection two years before that time, MHS does not make any claim to it. If you have any questions please ask. I would be happy to e-mail you scanned copies of any of the provenance paperwork or documents.Sources/References:(You'll need to copy and paste the links into your browser if you want to view them).www.mtmemory.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16013coll24/id/373www.whitefishpilot.com/westshorenews/news/article_e826d01f-2cec-5ff6-b2ca-b07077075b7c.html www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMKWM8_The_Somers_Kalispell_Spur_Line_Somers_MT www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMKWMJ_Somers_A_Company_Town_Somers_MTwww.flatheadbeacon.com/2014/01/21/mcgovernkarcher-house/ www.conradmansion.com/About-Collections.htmlbeta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/collection/data/70966114archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv04107"
