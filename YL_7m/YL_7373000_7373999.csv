TulAmmo 308 Winchester 150 Grain FMJ Steel Case review offers the following information; Made in Russia, Tul Ammo manufacturers steel cased ammunition in various small arms ammunition. Tul Ammo is new production non re-loadable, berdan primed ammunition. Tul Ammo 308 Winchester is packaged 20 rounds per box and 500 rounds per case. Tul Ammo 308 Winchester review shows that the Tul 308 Ammo is perfect for those high volume shooters who spend lots of time at the range practice shooting and do not reload their 308 Winchester ammo, and have no need for reloadable brass. Tul Ammo is priced low and a ideal choice for those who require quality 308 Winchester ammunition that is reliable and accurate. When looking closer at the Tul Ammo 308 Winchester ammunition, we can see that if offers a bi-metal bullet jacket with lead core, it is not reloadable since its steel cased and not brass, it is also berdan primed and non-corrosive. The steel case if polymer coated, therefore ensuring that each round feeds smooth and consistent even when the barrel gets hot."

They will be priced individually as follows:1. Springfield Model 87A .22 Short, Long & Long Rifle Semi-Auto. This particular rifle was manufactured in the late 1940's and has a light colored stock which I believe to be either Birch or Maple. There is some light rust but overall it looks clean. This rifle is fully functional after I put about $125 dollars of new parts into it. The 87A was unique and is often times known as the ""Gill Rifle"" or ""Clickety Clack"" due to the sound of the bolt during firing. I need to make room in my safe so I'm asking $140 OBO for it.2. I have a Sears JC Higgins Series 30 .22 Long Rifle. This is a unique rifle in its own right and was manufactured in the late 1950's and has it's own retractable sling. The rifle comes with the original 4x scope and mount sold with the rifle. This rifle in currently non-functional having problems with extraction. I have replaced many of the internal parts and will sell with a replacement new extractor with spring> The Extractor needs the recessed area for the spring to be fitted for the extractor to work..maybe a smith could do it, or maybe you can try yourself. Asking $75 OBO for this rifle.I'll sell both for $150 for anyone interested. These come from my family over the years and need a new home. Wisconsin sales only, Cash only."

236,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7373236,For Sale/Trade:  2004 Honda Sabre 1100,"Rockville, St. Cloud, Minnesota","$ 1,750","Listed On: Thursday, October 12, 2017",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Wife gave me the OK to get the Victory Kingpin I want, so I'm throwing out this feeler to see what I can get for my 04 Shadow Sabre 1100.The bike has full windscreen, passenger backrest, leather saddle bags, and semi-custom exhaust with jet kit.
The exhaust is based on a Cobra megaphone system, using the headers and mounts from the Cobra, but I replaced the megaphones with 1-7/8"" straight pipes. All the Cobra brackets and stuff are un-modified, so the megaphones can be put back on if you want. Just unbolt the straight pipes and bolt on the megaphones. Also have the factory exhaust pipes and jets.
Bike has higher miles at 42k, but runs and drives like a dream. If you live and drive in town, the Sabre is the perfect street rod. Honda lowered the gearing from the Shadow Spirit engine to make this thing the ultimate stop-light drag style bike. The downside to that is that the bike does run higher rev's at highway speeds, but it will run 80-85mph all day and get 45+mpg doing it."

First designed primarily for tactical undercover work, the Cougar is now carried by a growing number of police officers as their official duty sidearm thanks to its ergonomics, low recoil and inherent accuracy. The original Beretta Cougar was NATO qualified and boasted a long service-life of more than 30,000 9mm rounds. In its new incarnation, Beretta has developed an ergonomically-advanced pistol that is compact but capable of handling high-power cartridges, offering high magazine capacity and giving a long service life. This has been possible also thanks to the innovative adaptation of a locked-breech system with a rotating barrel. Today, the new Stoeger 8000 Cougar pistol is manufactured by the Stoeger Silah Sanayi A.S., strictly in line with the most traditional Beretta quality control and attention to detail. Low Recoil Upon firing this pistol, shooters are amazed by the low felt recoil. This is due to two factors working together. The first is the rotating barrel system, which dissipates recoil radially rather than directing it into the shooter’s hand. The second is the central block, which absorbs the mechanical recoil from the barrel and the slide before this is transferred to the frame. When the Cougar is in battery, the positive lock-up of barrel to slide assures perfect alignment of barrel and sights. Upon firing, the barrel travels and rotates with axial movement. Besides low recoil, the result is superior accuracy and quicker recovery for follow-up shots. Advanced Ergonomics for Easy Handling, Control, Concealment The Cougar is one of the most ergonomically advanced pistols in its class. The user-friendly, contoured frame and grips make the Cougar exceptionally easy to control during firing. By taking hand anatomy and instinctive hold into account, the Cougar accommodates smaller hands and also protects larger hands from being bitten by the slide. All edges are rounded or beveled, and are carefully finished to make the Cougar virtually snag-proof and exceptionally easy to draw and conceal. Different Configurations to Suit Most Tactical Needs The Cougar L Type P is conceived to deliver high firepower in F or D (Double Action Only) operating systems. F models have the same safety features of the famous Beretta 92 FS pistol: external ambidextrous manual safety with decocking lever, trigger bar disconnect, rotating firing pin striker, firing pin block device and loaded-chamber indicator. The double-action-only D versions have the firing pin block device and the loaded-chamber indicator but no manual safety, thereby offering a super-smooth, exceptionally snag-free side. Both versions are manufactured in 9 mm or .40 caliber to satisfy the different needs of police officers and concealed-carry permit holders.The 8000 Cougar L 9mm pistol, available in F or D configurations, features the same rotating barrel system of the full-size Cougar L Type P; the difference is in the shortened grip frame that houses a 13-round, high-capacity double-stack magazine. The beveled slide and the reduced dimensions and weight also make this model ideal for undercover work.

Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.

Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.
