These rifle are gorgeous, and of surprisingly high quality, and this one is in pristine condition, and runs great. (I got this from one of my brothers, who got it in a trade, but had no real interest in it, and asked me to see if I could sell it, and split the proceeds with him....so here we are.)These sell consistently for $400-500, and get fantastic reviews on every site I could find them. Included is a tin of ammo, the pliers used to insert and remove the CO2 units, and a couple ammo cylinders.Obviously I'm ok with a test fire, but suggest meeting at the Chevron at exit 19, partly because I live close by there and it's been a great place for Armslist/Craigslist deals, but also because it should be fine for a quick test fire with a pellet rifle, unlike some parking lot inside Columbus city limits.But, I'll only waste a CO2 on someone that's committed to buying once proper function is established, not interested in getting hustled by last-second lowballs, or, ""well, lemme think about it, ask my wife,etc."" after we've cracked the seal on a CO2 cyclinder. (you know how people can be.)Asking $100 cash, or an equitable amount of decent 9mm ammo.If the ad is still up, then I still have the rifle, and no, I'm not texting you at some distant area code.  These and other scammer ruses will be ignored (those idiots have been breaking my balls lately !!)Thanks for looking......."

I took it out to the gun range the first weekend I owned it and put 150 total rounds of factory 115 grain FMJ regular and hollow point ammo through it with absolutely no issues.   It was bought to serve as my home protection gun with its compact size and high capacity, so I haven't shot it much other than to take it out periodically to ensure it is working well and that I can shoot it with accuracy. Last weekend I put the 500th round through it and it shoots and works as well as the first 150 rounds did.   I hadn't planned on selling this gun (I always have good intentions...) but this is my only 9mm semi-automatic pistol and have decided to get down to just my revolvers for now. I may buy another 9mm next year, but for now I will be a .38 caliber shooter.   This Springfield XD9 Mod. 2 Sub Compact 9mm is a great shooting and feeling gun with a nice trigger. The gun has been house kept, protectively stored, and cleaned after every shooting. It is in excellent condition and comes with a total of three (two 13 round and one 16 round capacity) magazines plus all the stuff that was included when I bought it such as a hard plastic case, extra green and red fiber optic rods, owner's manual, lock, and bore brush.   The features of this gun include:
Striker Status Indicator gives a visual and tactile feedback of the condition of the pistol
Loaded Chamber Indicator gives a visual and tactile feedback of the condition of the pistol
Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System which prevents rearward movement of the trigger without it being intentional
Accessory Rail
Ambidextrous Magazine Release
Grip Zone contours and texturing
High Polish Stainless Steel Magazine which assists in being drop free
No Snag Trigger Guard
High-Hand grip relief and High-Hand beavertail that enables the shooter to get a grip as high as possible toward the barrel bore
Stock: Polymer Frame, Melonite protected slide
Capacity: 13+1, 16+1

This rifle has double circle marking that shows it was built at the Nagoya Arsenal sometime between 1923-1945. The rifle works well and is in nice shape considering it's age. The original finish has thinned down to about 70% and has a nice patina to it. The wood stock shows battle scars but is overall in sound condition.

JEFF    I HAVE MORE PICTURES TO EMAIL OR TEXT TO YOU, as they only let me post 3 here.Cabela's Instinct Layout Blind.  Used maybe 4 days. This is the blind that has a lot of back support and you don't have to come up as high out of it to shoot. It has a framed hammock at a higher more comfortable angle to support your back and you don't have to raise up as much to come up and shoot. Plus, this gives you much more comfort and visibility, increasing both your field of view and hours in the blind if you have a back problem or just want a truly comfortable blind to hunt from. It's a taller blind, yet very concealable. It really is the Cadillac of layout blinds and there is a zipper behind where you lie in the blind that you can unzip and get your dog in there behind you. That keeps the dog warm, makes him less visible to the ducks and geese, and saves you the trip of bringing out a dog kennel blind, and simplifies your hunting and decreases your set up time, cause now you dont have to brush up the dog blind. Come take a look at this blind and sit in it / lie down in it, see how comfortable it is. You'll love it. I am trying to sell it quick because I am moving, so I am offering it at  less than half price , $150. New it is $339 new from Cabelas. Mine is just one season old and used only 4 days in the field, maybe 3. Save money and get this one with all the life left in it. I figure you'll be glad you did. I am moving to Idaho, and would rather not have to transport it since I am getting out of waterfowling. NOTE: IT GIVES MORE BACK SUPPORT THAN ANY OTHER LAYOUT BLIND. IT CRADLES YOU IN VERY COMFORTABLY.  COME TAKE A LOOK AND YOU WILL SEE. OR STOP OFF BY CABELAS AND GET IN ONE, THEN COME GET MINE AT HALF PRICE."

I took it out to the gun range the first weekend I owned it and put 150 total rounds of factory 115 grain FMJ regular and hollow point ammo through it with absolutely no issues. It was bought to serve as my home protection gun with its compact size and high capacity, so I haven't shot it much other than to take it out periodically to ensure it is working well and that I can shoot it with accuracy. Last weekend I put the 500th round through it and it shoots and works as well as the first 150 rounds did. I hadn't planned on selling this gun (I always have good intentions...) but this is my only 9mm semi-automatic pistol and have decided to get down to just my revolvers for now. I may buy another 9mm next year, but for now I will be a .38 caliber shooter. This Springfield XD9 Mod. 2 Sub Compact 9mm is a great shooting and feeling gun with a nice trigger. The gun has been house kept, protectively stored, and cleaned after every shooting. It is in excellent condition and comes with a total of three (two 13 round and one 16 round capacity) magazines plus all the stuff that was included when I bought it such as a hard plastic case, extra green and red fiber optic rods, owner's manual, lock, and bore brush. The features of this gun include:
Striker Status Indicator gives a visual and tactile feedback of the condition of the pistol
Loaded Chamber Indicator gives a visual and tactile feedback of the condition of the pistol
Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System which prevents rearward movement of the trigger without it being intentional
Accessory Rail
Ambidextrous Magazine Release
Grip Zone contours and texturing
High Polish Stainless Steel Magazine which assists in being drop free
No Snag Trigger Guard

The ATN PS22 System mounts in front of a Daytime Scope. Re-zeroing of the scope is not required. The ATN PS22 comes standard with 7/8"" weaver mount. The IR Illuminator can be mounted onto the optional Picatinny Rail. This ingenious setup allows the shooter to go from day to night in less than 30 seconds without tools, without changes in eye relief and remain zeroed all around the clock. The ATN PS22 is a complex optical-electronic system. The device contains an image intensifier tube assembly with an integrated high-voltage power source and three volt battery housing.    A night vision device works by taking existing light, whether infra-red, moonlight or starlight, and changing it into visible light. This visible light is amplified to the point where it may be viewed in the device's eyepiece. The process, where the existing light (made up of photons) moves through a photocathode tube, changes to electrons that are electro-chemically amplified and then driven against a phosphorus screen to return them to visible light, gives the final image a green hue.Technical Information Total Darkness IR System: Yes Generation: 3Resolution: 64-72 lp/mm Magnification: 1xProshield Lens Coating: Yes Range of Focus: 10m to infinity Controls: Direct Automatic Brightness Control: Yes Bright Light Cut-off: Yes Infrared Illuminator: Detachable IR450 IR Indicator: Yes Low Battery Indicator: No Power Supply: 1 CR123A Battery Life: 60 hrs Environmental Rating: Waterproof Operating Temperature: -40 to +50 °C Dimensions: 5.9""x3.2""x2.8""Weight: 1.4 lbs      ATN PS22-3 Weapon Site IR450 IR Illuminator Lens Caps Light Suppressor Adjustment Wrench (2) Adapters (Scope Mounting System)  Remote Control Switch User's Manual Carrying Case.

Generation isn’t a big deal as long as they are in good shape and come with everything like the factory case and magazines. Feel free to do your research on pricing as I’ve done mine and I know this is a more than fair deal especially for the Ak47. The Hellhound MSRP is $971.93 and the cheapest I’ve seen them was $760.00 at a store if you can find this much sought after model in stock! It has a lifetime transferrable warranty as well as a upgraded trigger and a chrome lined barrel. I can meet in Lubbock, TX or Midland/Odessa. As well as surrounding towns. If its within reasonable distance to Denver City, TX I will be more than happy to meet.
