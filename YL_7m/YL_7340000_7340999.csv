The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition.
The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M)®, which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XD(M)® features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place."

It is an AK-47 type Saiga in caliber 7.62x39mm and was built by the one and only Izhmash factory in Russia, the very factory where real AK’s are made. It is stamped, ""Made in Russia by Izhmash."" Considering all Russian rifles have been banned from importation since 2014, the opportunity is running out to own an authentic high-quality AK-47 from the motherland. I am the original owner and I purchased it brand new. The rifle has an authentic Russian receiver, barrel and trunnion. The furniture is US made by Timberland. The muzzle brake and fire control group are Tapco so the rifle is as Russian as possible, while meeting 922r compliance. This rifle is in great condition; I have put 200 rounds through it. The barrel itself is also Russian made, and thus has a strong chrome lining, thicker and more robust than anything you are going to get that is US made due to environmental regulations when chrome plating. You will note in the pictures that the muzzle brake has small spots showing wear of the finish as well as some wear of the finish on the magazine release. Aside this, the finish is great!Included with the rifle is one Tapco slab side magazine dyed to look like Russian Bakelite, a surplus rifle sling, cleaning kit with oil bottle, and cleaning rod. All original Izhmash documentation is included. Also included is the original Kalashnikov USA packaging. Buyer must make local pickup only please. I am pretty laid-back and easy to communicate with if you have any questions. Thank you."

The famous Borchardt design and the Mauser C96 pistol are both examples of this interest at the turn of the century. The German Army ultimately settled on the Borchardt-based Luger design for its armed forces.Initial military production of the Luger pistol, in 9mm Parabellum caliber, was limited to the Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken (DWM). The first German military organization to adopt the new Luger design was the German Navy, which approved the Model of 1906 pistol on May 12, 1905. Although the German Army tested the Luger design as early as 1901, it did not officially adopt the Luger as the standard Army sidearm until August 1908, which gave the weapon the designation Model of 1908. Initial Model of 1908 Lugers did not have chamber markings but the year of manufacture began to be marked on the chamber in 1910.This particular DWM Luger was manufactured by Deutsche Waffen-und Munitionsfabriken (DWM) in 1918 and is serial numbered 7932b, indicating this pistol was manufactured in February 1918. The Barrel on this Model 1941 Luger is its original 4-inch long barrel and it retains 95% blued finish. There is only slight wear near the muzzle and on the high points with a few spots along the barrel itself. The bore still has a mirror finish with strong rifling. The bottom rear of the barrel has the full matching serial number ""7932/b"" and the muzzle diameter of the barrel in millimeters, ""8,83.""The Receiver has the matching serial number ""7932"" on the left side and it retains 95% plus of its beautiful blued finish. The Sear Bar retains the majority of its original blued finish and is matching with the partial serial number “32.” The Sear Bar Spring retains 98% of its beautiful and vibrant fire blued finish. The Chamber Date is crisply marked ""1918,"" and the face of the chamber is very clean. The Ejector retains a faded straw finish and the spring, which is still very strong, retains 95% of the original, but faded, straw finish. The right side of the Frame has all of the correct proof marks crisply stamped, including the large crown over eagle German Army Proof Test mark and three crown over gothic letter German Army Inspection Stamps. Just forward of these receiver stamps, in the right side of the barrel, is the standard German Army Test Eagle proof stamp. The bottom lug of the Receiver, and adjacent to it, have numerous inspection and assembly stamps including several serif ""N"" stamps, a circle sans serif “N” stamp as well as sans serif ""G,” “0” and “Z” stamps.The Breech Block has the matching serial number ""32"" on the left side below the German Army Test Eagle proof stamp and it retains 95% of its blued finish with wear noted on the side rails. The face of the Breech Block is clean. The Breech Block Pin still retains considerable original fire blued finish. The Center Toggle Link has the script ""DWM"" stamp and matching serial number ""32,"" and it retains 95% of its blued finish. The Rear Toggle Link has the matching serial number ""32"" stamped on the rear slope and retains 95% of its blued finish. The bottom of the Rear Toggle Link has a serif “N” assembly stamp. The Coupling Link moves freely and is still in the white.The Extractor is serial number matching with ""32"" stamped on top with 98% of its blued finish remaining on top with the sides of the Extractor still correctly in the white with the left side marked ""GELADEN"" or loaded on the side. The Firing Pin Spring Retainer is very clean and remains in the white as does the Firing Pin Spring. The Firing Pin itself remains in the white and is serial number matching with ""32"" stamped on the side. The Rear Toggle Pin exhibits remnants of the original fire blued finish and fits flush on both sides.The Front Sight retains the vast majority of its original blued finish and has 13 serrations on the rear face. The base also retains the vast majority of its original blued finish and has 8 serrations on the rear face. The base and stud have the correct stake mark on the right side.The Side Plate is serial number matching with “32” stamped on the outside and it retains 90% of its blued finish with wear noted on the sharp edges, on the hump and on the bottom, rear side. The Trigger/Sear Lever Arm is correctly in the white and the Lever Arm pin is still correctly blued.The Frame itself has the full matching serial number ""7932/b"" on the nose and retains 95% of its blued finish. The Lanyard Ring is fully secured at the rear. The internal surfaces of the Frame are correctly polished in the white. The Front Grip Strap retains 95% of its blued finish with the beginning of browning on the edge where the Grip Panels meet the Frame. The front grip strap is marked “1.G.R. 1.M.G. K.86.” indicating it was issued to the 1st Grenadier Regiment, 1st Machine Gun Company and was weapon number 86. The Back Strap retains 90% of its bluing with edge browning and wear exhibited on the shoulder stock milled portion. The Magazine Well is polished on both front and rear.The Magazine Catch retains considerable original straw finish and operates smoothly. The Mag Catch's external band spring retains most of its original fire blued finish. The Trigger is serial number matching with ""32"" stamped on the top left side and it retains the majority of its original straw finish with browning in the back, milled out section. The Trigger Spring remains in the white. The Hold Open Latch and integrated spring is serial number matching with ""32"" stamped on the top and it shows considerable original fire tempered finish. The Mainspring remains in the white. The Safety Bar is serial number matching with ""32"" stamped on the front and it remains in the white. The Safety Lever is serial number matched with ""32"" stamped on the top flat and it retains the majority of its original straw finish. The ""GESICHERT"" or SAFE marking still retains the majority of the original white background paint present.Both Grip Panels are in excellent condition and are serial number matching. Both Panels have their original finish and have only minor flattening in small sections towards the bottom but there are no cracks or chips noted and both Panels fit securely to the Frame. The left grip panel has a serif “P” stamp on the back as well as the matching serial number “32.” The right grip panel has a serif “N” stamp on the back as well as the matching serial number “32.” Both original grip screws are present and both retain virtually all of their original blued finish with no marring to the single slots.This pistol comes with its original WWI Magazine. The Magazine is the correct WWI wrap-around, tin-plated magazine with the correct wood base. The base is stamped with the serial number “996/b” indicating this magazine was originally issued with another Luger pistol in the “b” suffix range. The Follower and Follower Spring are still strong and it fits securely in the magazine well of the Luger and releases smoothly.This Luger also comes with its original WWI brown leather holster, which is in very fine condition. The original front closure strap and loop are present and both retain all of their original stitching. The original brass stud on the flap is also present and is still solidly attached. The closure strap was originally attached at an angle to the top flap but this holster was modified at some point so that the strap was affixed perpendicular to the top flap. It is possible this was done during WWI but it may also have been done during WWII. The Loading Tool flap is present and is in fine condition. The underside of the top flap has the serif stamping “S. P.O”/3. 53.” This stamp indicates this pistol was later used during WWII as a Schutz Polizei weapon. The Schutz Polizei were uniformed police in the large cities in Germany during WWII and were formally part of the SS. All Schutz Polizei officers had to be both members of the Nazi Party and members of the SS. This particular Schutz Polizei unit was from a large city beginning with “O,” and was outside of Prussia as Prussian police units more thoroughly marked both their holsters and pistols, but also modified Lugers with the addition of sear and magazine safeties, neither of which are on this weapon.The unit stamp on the front grip strap, from the Luger’s WWI period of service, is, as noted from the 1st Grenadier Regiment, 1st Machine Gun Company. The 1st Grenadier Regiment is a very famous Imperial German regiment that was established as the 1st East Prussian Grenadiers in December 1655 by Boleslaw Von Schwerin. The regiment first fought at the Battle of Warsaw in July 1656, which was part of the Second Northern War between Poland and Sweden. The 1st Grenadier Regiment also fought during the First and Second Silesian Wars between Prussia and Austria over control of Silesia, from 1740-1742 and 1744-1745 (also known as the War of Austrian Succession). During the Napoleonic Wars, the regiment was renamed the East Prussian Grenadier Regiment Number 1 “Crown Prince.” The regiment was moved from Danzig to Konigsberg in 1855 and later took part in the Franco-Prussian War and the Austro-Prussian War. The regiment was assigned to the 1st Infantry Division as part of the Prussian reorganization of 1870. At that time, it was assigned to the 1st Infantry Brigade along with the 5th East Prussian Infantry Regiment No. 41. The regiment received the name “Grenadier Regiment King Frederick III (1st East Prussian) No. 1, on June 21, 1888.At the beginning of WWI in August 1914, the 1st Grenadier Regiment was still part of the 1st Infantry Brigade, 1st Division, along with the 41st Infantry Regiment “von Boyen” (5th East Prussian). On February 19, 1918, right around the time this pistol was issued, the 1st Division order of battle included the 1st Brigade with the 1st Grenadier Regiment, the 3rd Grenadier Regiment “King Friedrich Wilhelm I” (2nd East Prussian), the 43rd Infantry Regiment “Duke Karl of Mecklenburg” (6th East Prussian), the 31st Machine Gun Sharpshooter Detachment and the 3rd Squadron, 8th Uhlan Regiment “Count zu Dohna.”The 1st Grenadier Regiment remained in the line in the Verdun sector early in 1918 until it was relieved by a regiment of the 11th Bavarian Division on February 15, 1918. The regiment then moved with the rest of the 1st Division to the Conflans area where it went through training in open warfare to enable it to become an assault division in preparation for the 1918 Spring Offensive on the Western Front, also known as the Ludendorff Offensive. This offensive began on March 21, 1918 and marked the deepest advance by either since 1914. At this time, the 1st Grenadier Regiment was assigned to the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, which was part of the VII Reserve Corps, 1st Army under General der Infanterie Fritz von Below, which was part of Army Group German Crown Prince under General der Infanterie Wilhelm, Crown Prince of Germany.The 1st Grenadier Regiment and the rest of the 1st Division reinforced the front at Bray, north of the Somme, on March 27, 1918. The regiment then fought until March 30th, during which time it sustained so many casualties that its companies were reduced to an average strength of only 40 men. The regiment and division were withdrawn on March 30th and rested immediately in the rear of the position it had held in the line up until April 19, 1918. On April 20th, the regiment went back into the line with the rest of the division just south of the Somme and immediately suffered heavy casualties. The regiment and the rest of the division were then relieved on May 2, 1918, by the 24th Reserve Division. The regiment and division then went to rest in the Peruwelz area. On July 16, 1918, the regiment and the 1st Division entered the front line near St. Hilaire and was then withdrawn on July 20th. The regiment and division were then immediately thrown into the line at Rheims in the Bois de Vrigny, where it fought in an attempt to prevent the Allies from annihilating the German troops in the Sois-sons-Chateau Thierry- Rheims picket.On August 10, 1918, the regiment and the rest of the division was withdrawn from the front and went to rest in the Laon region. On September 3, 1918, the regiment and division relieved the 27th Division near Laffaux and was shortly thereafter surprised by a French attack and lost 2,300 prisoners. On September 16th, the regiment and division were relieved by the 29th Division.The 1st Grenadier Regiment and the 1st Division were sent back into the front line near Betheny, northeast of Rheims on October 2nd and was withdrawn, after considerable fighting, on October 8th. The regiment and division then rentered the front line at St. Fergeux on October 14th and remained there until October 29th. The 1st Grenadier Regiment, and this pistol, was last identified in the Imperial German order of battle in the front line near Liart, south of Rocroi, and it remained in this part of the front line until the Armistice on November 11, 1918. Interestingly, the 1st Grenadier Regiment was opposite the French 59th Infantry Division when the Armistice was signed. One of the regiments of the French 59th Infantry Division was the U.S. 370th Infantry Regiment, which was the only unit entirely commanded by black officers.This pistol was later captured and brought back at the end of WWII. My view is that the soldier to which this weapon was assigned in the 1st Grenadier Regiment, 1st Machine Gun Company, took this weapon home with him at the end of WWI and he possibly later served as a police officer during WWII, after which it was recovered by an American soldier and brought back.This is a fine condition WWI DWM Model of 1914 Luger from 1918, assigned to the famous 1st Grenadier Regiment in one of its desirable Machine Gun companies that later went on to service during the Third Reich. This pistol that functions perfectly.This Pistol is C&R eligible. It will come shipped in a new Plano pistol hard case and will also come with a historical writeup and a CD of all photos in the listing.

Google “Randy Wakeman Burris Veracity.” He’s a notoriously hard-to-please gun-writer, if he doesn’t like it he’ll say so. He wrote “I have $3000 European optics, $200 Chinese made optics, and most increments in-between. At a street price of about $580 dollars, the Burris Veracity compares very, very well with some $1600 units that I have here. In fact, it is better than most $1500 level scopes that I have, and have had, in terms of overall optic performance.” and then later ""Right now, it gets my vote as the Optic of the Year for 2017. It is one of the most impressive hunting scopes I've seen in many, many years.""  If you want a bad-*ss scope for your AR or beefier hunting rifle, this one is tough to beat.  - $475(I also have some rings that would go great with it if interested, and depending on your application).I purchased this new over the summer.
