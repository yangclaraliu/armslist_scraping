The trigger pull is very short but positive and crisp, not mushy, and has a very short reset.)Warren Tactical Sevigny competition series sights with fiber optic front and serrated rearLWD stainless steel takedown pinsExtended slide stop leverExtended magazine releaseFrame work: finger grooves removed (no stippling under the A-grip wrap-I prefer the wrap), double undercut, stippled, and flared trigger guard, relieft cut around magazine release, very slight palm swell reduction (this serves more to make the grip feel more vertical without reducing the size of the grip-I have large hands and it fits great), wedge cut stippling on the index points, custom mixed storm grey duracoat, A-grip synthetic suede grip wrap (most people don't know what this is, but I love it and have it on all my guns. It is soft but very high traction. It works great when wet or dry, doesn't grab on clothing and feels soft when carried concealed. It also lasts literally years, but I just replaced it.)I obviously have a lot of time and money into this gun. It is a formidable competition/race setup, but it's not finicky or unreliable. It still feeds any ammo, has all stock functionality, and it's a fun pistol to shoot. It's had plenty pf rounds through it, but was always maintained well and is 100% reliabe. There a few minor cosmetic issues: Ships/scuffs in the duracoat on the bottom of the trigger guard-this happened while the coating was fresh and still soft. There is also a blemish in the coating on the left side of the slide-it's slightly discolored in a spot. Please contact me with any questions."

For sale is a Savage 111 Bolt action rifle chambered in 3006. Was purchased used from an FFL, and have been shooting it for a few months now. I've decided to sell it to try and put more money into building a true precision rifle (possibly a Remington 700) in 308.  I don't have any information regarding its previous level of use, however the rifle IS in functioning condition. The only issue with the rifle is what appears to be- and i could be wrong, but i dont want any disappointments- a bit of surface rust forming on the barrel. Its a slight discolored/rough patchy spot, and i am assuming it is rust. Otherwise it appears to function nicely and all. I put about 30 rounds through it with zero issues; not much, but the thing is fairly expensive to shoot so i tried not to waste ammo. May need to be zero'd in as i removed and put back on the sight. The Busnell scope is a 3-9 and is included, but appears to be your typical cheapo scope that comes with rifle packages. I can't say it gave me any problems, though. Rifle has an Accutrigger according to the sticker on the stock.Also available, either as a package with the rifle or AFTER the rifle is sold, is 180 rounds of Wolf Military classic 145gr FMJ steel case as well as 10 rounds of Federal Power-Shok 180gr soft point ammo. 65 cents a round for them all (Paid over 1$/rd for the Federal, and about .75+ for the wolf with shipping).450$ OBO"

Featuring a large 28mm aperture, the Trijicon SRS provides a massive field of view for quicker target engagements. The 1.75 MOA dot is small enough for precision and with 10 brightness settings it can be bright enough for any speed. Finally, the Trijicon SRS features dual power sources — an innovative solar cell assisted by a single AA battery.Distance From Top of Mounting Rail to Optical Axis: 1.570 in.

Put a smooth barrel in it and you're in business for shot. Rifle has been painted with rustolium camo and 4 layers of clear coat, but is chipping off in a few places. Does NOT include vortex razor scope for this price. Lol. The barrel is cantilever so you can leave a sighted in scope attacthed and switch between it and a smooth bore barrel with chokes. I've put approx 50 slugs down it, and don't know history. I've broken it down to absolute bones and cleaned and lubricated every part. Function is flawless.Love this beast, but long story short, WWII vet grandfather leaves me just enough money to buy a brand new 500 combo, and I want to do that and pass it down the lineage. Gotta go.Trade considerations are slug scopes or possibly some mossberg 500 barrels as partial trade. I am however, open to ANY trade offers AT ALL, including blades, ammo, food, MREs etc. My interests are wide.Price is $250 cash, or $300 trade value, totally open on trades."

It's a custom rifle that was purchased new from another individual. It was pre-built, I just bought it. It's a complete Anderson lower. The upper is a forging made of 7075 T6, hard coat anodized. The BCG was identified by my FFL as a Daniel Defense full auto. Barrel is 16"" 4150 Chrome MolyVanadium with a 1 in 9 twist rate. Feed ramp is M4, and the rifle has a flat top upper. 10"" free-floating keymod handguard. Also included is a generic grip-pod, 2 polymer magazines, a set of FieldSport flip-up iron sights and a Vortex Strikefire II red/green dot with 4 MOA dot. The case is a pluck and pull Plano all-weather case. Has 5 latches to keep it secured closed, it's waterproof and is said to float (I'm not sure how much weight can be in the case before it loses buoyancy). This case is TSA approved.  I usually use one-piece cleaning rods, but I have an extra unopened Hoppes cleaning set for 22 caliber firearms. These rifles usually sell for around $650. Case was $70, grip-pod was $25 the mags are $25 for the pair, BUIS were about $30, and the Strikefire II is $180.  That brings the total to about $980 here. Id like to see $800 for the lot, price is a bit negotiable, but I won't dip too low on it. It's a good rifle with a good setup. I've put about 550 rounds though it with zero failures of any sort. As far as accuracy goes, it's a red dot, so accuracy will suffer over range. 100 yards, it can shoot about 7"", 50 yards, about 2.5-3"".  I'm by no means an expert with an AR with a red dot, I'm more into bolt guns. I'm sure someone more experienced with the platform can get better results."

Extremely low production run and mint condition. A verifiable 1 of 250-350 run of one of a kind Colt. If not sold in a week or so i will list her on Gunbroker. Here is the lowdown as far as I know it: Colt 1911 model- Special Edition (1989) -COLT TANK OFFICERS ACP (Special Edition) Caliber: .45acp Barrel Length: 3.5"" Finish: Matte BluePrice:  $2,000 It was apparently a special run of pistols from Colt. These are limited run, Special Edition, Colt 1911s. Without a doubt one of 350 and arguably 250 ever built. If you do some research you will see the exact number of examples produced is not really known.  This one is absolutey in perfect condtion. It boasts the following special features; An officers ACP slide assembly, a Combat Commander receiver assembly, a flat mainspring housing with lanyard loop, a beveled magazine well, a serrated front strap, and a 3-Dot sighting system. Each pistol also features the special rollmark ""TANK OFFICERS"" on the left side of the slide. If you happen to be a Colt colletor you will be very hard pressed to find a more rare example of a 1911. To most collectors this would undoubtedly be a Grail gun. This one displays in perfect condtition, no flaws and original. Gun only, no original box or paperwork. This one should speak for itself. All completely original and as advertiesed. This is a hard gun to part with."

This gun is a real shooter, and very accurate with the fully rifled barrel.The stock & foregrip are in nice shape with some scuffs/scratches, but nothing deep or large.  I no longer live/hunt in a slug area, so it sits.  It's a great gun, and deserves to be used.Email with any questions.  Local pick up. Cash only. No trades. Would be willing to ship, if buyer pays for it.If you are reading this, then the gun is available.  The listing will be removed once the gun is sold.  Thanks for looking."

This ammo is loaded on 5 round Mauser style stripper clips that look to be either chrome or nickel plated. It's very clean stuff that's sure to fire. The ammo is brass case loaded with 196 grain FMJ bullets to full power military specifications so there's nothing watered down with it at all like there is with most commercial ammo in this caliber. These bullets do have a strong attraction to a magnet so they are either steel jacketed, steel cored or both. That said they may not be appropriate for all shooting ranges. This ammo isn't nearly as easy to find as it once was so here's a chance to grab some while you still can. The Mauser stripper clips alone bring $1.50 to 2.00 apiece and there are 30 of them in the 10 boxes of ammo. You can check that out on eBay if you don't believe it.Price is $100 firm with pick up in the Brandon area by someone at least 18 years old. I could ship this to places where legal but shipping ammunition is not inexpensive at all these days."
