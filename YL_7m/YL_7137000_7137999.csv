The P220 Combat with threaded barrel is designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards. The P220 Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the threaded barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Outfitted with a true M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights.
Pistol is in great condition and has had a custom SRT trigger installed. Comes with the Pistol, original 8-round and 10-round mags, (2) extra Sig 8-round mags, Sig's .22LR Conversion Kit w/ Threaded Barrel and an extra 10-round .22LR mag, a custom Bladetech holster, original trigger parts, box, and manual.
Please ask any questions.  Thanks
The price is firm. $900 for the package or $750 without the conversion kit.

These rounds are normally only made available to L.E.O.s/personnel for purchase. I acquired these rounds from a reputable dealer on the secondary market. The dealer that I acquired them from bought them at a police/government auction. Unlike many of the other Defense Tech. 37mm teargas rounds that you will find on the secondary market, these were recently manufactured (i.e. 2003). THESE ARE LIVE, FUNCTIONING TEARGAS ROUNDS. These rounds are in excellent condition. I believe that the seller that I purchased these from randomly selected and tested one out of the lot that he purchased without issue. The Spede-Heat™ 37mm CN Short Range Round is designed to travel down range 75 yards. The Spede-Heat™ round is designed specifically for outdoor use in crowd control situations with a high volume continuous burn. Regardless, the volume of smoke and agent is vast and obtrusive. This 37mm shell casing is 4.75 in. by 1.5 in. and delivers approximately .94 oz. of active agent during its 30-40 second of burn time. The Spede-Heat™ chemical and smoke projectiles are designed for outdoor use and have fire-producing capability. As these are USCG approved 37mm teargas rounds, they are completely legal to use in your 37mm signaling devices (e.g. Spikes HAVOC 37mm launcher, etc.). These rounds are available for local pickup only. They are $100.00 each. Cash only, no trades wanted or considered. There is no limit to the number of rounds that may be purchased by a single buyer. First come, first serve. Once they are gone, they are gone. ALL SALES ARE FINAL. No refunds, returns, warranties, or guarantees implied. You may email me any questions that you have. I will not sell to anyone under the age of 18, nor will I sell to any individual who is unable to provide me with proof of their age (i.e. via a current, valid photo I.D.). It is the buyer's responsibility to research and understand all Federal, State, and local laws concerning civilian ownership and use of teargas and teargas devices. I will not be held liable, in any way, shape, or form, should any buyer handle or use these rounds in an unlawful manner.If you own a 37mm Launcher/signaling device, don't let this opportunity pass!

Only been shot a handful of times. Have the box and all with it. The extras include a paddle/owb holster, 2 backstraps, speedloader, and 2 18 round mags. Second is a Remington 770 chambered in .243. Shot maybe 10 times. Just not as big as what I am wanting. Comes with factory equipped scope. I also have 120 rounds of Hornady 95 Grain hunting ammo. Both of these are in near perfect shape, like I said, I just want a bigger caliber rifle, and hopefully I find something with extras.

The rifle is equipped with a Buffington rear sight and is marked on the top of the breechblock with number ""39"". The breechblock is marked ""U.S./MODEL/1884"" and the lock plate is marked with the eagle/shield motif along with ""U.S./SPRINGFIELD"" ahead of the hammer. The left rear side of the barrel is stamped with ""V/P/eaglehead/P"" proofs. The letter ""A"" is stamped on the top of the barrel at the breech. The oiled finished stock has a faint ""SWP/1890"" cartouche on the left side of the wrist. The stock has two barrel bands. The rifle has a button head cleaning rod, one piece trigger guard, and falls within the correct serial number range, all of which are indicative of the scarcer Type I U.S. Springfield Model 1884 Trapdoor Cadet. The Trapdoor Cadet Rifle offered for your consideration is in fine condition according to the antique firearms condition standards. The bore is in excellent condition and shows strong rifling, having been well preserved through the years. There is a light patina on the top of the reciever, and some finish missing from the lock, pictures can be provided of these minor cosmetic issues. Overall it is in fine condition with a good amount of finish remaining on the metal parts, and only minor dents in the stock. The ""SWP/1890"" cartouche is faint, but can still be seen. It has the original ramrod, and is marked on top of the reciever with the number ""39"". The number ""39"" was probably the rifle number, or rack number of the rifle, for when it was being used as a Cadet Rifle. This Type I U.S. Springfield Model 1884 Trapdoor Cadet Rifle offered for your consideration is scarce and would make an excellent addition to your collection because of exceptional condition, specifically the bore.

Cash. No trades.  I would prefer face to face in NC. If driving, I will meet half way. Please email with any questions.This is from the Larue website:The PredatAR 7.62 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 7.62 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR takes the highly-accurate OBR 7.62 “Heavy” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 7.62 rifle.The barrels are lightweight-profiled and feature rifling in a 1/10 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). The handguards on the PredatAR extend out 14”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.Both models come with a 6-position LaRue RAT Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies. (Iron Sights, Optics and QD mounts not included in price) Base model includes LaRue RAT Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip, A2 Flash Hider, plus one LaRue (M110-compatible) 20-round magazine. About LaRue Firearm Accuracy:LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results. XTRAXN™ is a proprietary chamber feature added to reduce frictional forces caused by pressure-expanded cartridge cases bearing against chamber walls. Facilitates reliable extraction through a wide range of temperature / chamber pressure extremes. XTRAXN™ extends extractor life, while having no effect on the firearm's accuracy. All this, and it dovetails well with the OBR's world-famous accuracy.  Caliber: 7.62 x 51 mm NATO Rifle Weight: 7.75 lb. (based on 16.1” barrel version, unloaded without optics and accessories) Barrel Length: 18“ Rifling Twist Rate: 1/10 Muzzle Thread Configuration: 5/8x24 * Barrel Life: 10,000 (approx) Gas System: Direct Impingement Rate of Fire: Semi automatic Trigger: LaRue MBT Magazine Capacity: 20 rounds"
