It has a Damascus barrel. Most likely made at the turn of the last century (around 1900). I can't say for sure if it is black powder/antique or not, so this must got to an 03 C&R FFL at least (or you must go through the NICS background check to own it). I am selling it as a wallhanger. The claim to fame on this shotgun was that it hung up at the Shelburne, Vermont Country Store for over 80 years. This came from a local collection. Very cool old local piece of Vermont history!$60.00 plus actual shipping or VT state tax. I do NOT charge over my cost to ship! The first ""I'll take it"" posted here and followed up with an IMMEDIATE email to me at REDACTED gets it.

Kimber Micro 9, a 9mm automatic pistol in the much sought after two tone finish.
I bought this pistol in January, and I shortly afterwards found a GLOCK 19X that I just had to have, and am over budget on ordnance at the moment, just trying to recoup some of my money.
 I am including, a genuine Kimber spare magazine, ($29.99), they only come with one, two El Paso Saddlery Combat Express holsters, one brown, one black (they retail for $55.49 each), 14 rounds of Hornady 9mm 115 grain FTX XD rounds, enough to fill both mags), 11 rounds of 9mm Blazer ball ammo for practice ($20-), the original factory Kimber carry case, a genuine Kimber zipper case w/spare magazine compartment, along with the owners manual, lock, and all printed material, etc., that came with the pistol.
 This pistol is in immaculate condition, not a scratch, it is completely broken in, (250 rounds) and has been disassembled and thoroughly cleaned with Strike-Hold CLP, by a professional gunsmith.
 The weight of this pistol is a scant 50 Kilograms, you can hardly tell that you have it on!
 I have 875 bucks tied up in this rig after holsters and the spare magazine.
 ASKING $775- NON-NEGOTIABLE!
 CASH ONLY! BILLS WILL BE CHECKED FOR AUTHENTICITY!
