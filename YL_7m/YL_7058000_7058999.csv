Included is all accessories that came with it when new. It's a fantastic shotgun and features the Kryptek Banshee camouflage pattern with soft touch finish on buttstock and forearm that is very grippy and aids a sure grip when cold and or wet.  The buttstock is adjustable with included shims.  It has removable sling swivels that are a nice feature and a choke wrench.  Additionally it comes with 4 factory Hyperbolic Inner HP choke tubes: Medium 5/10, Long 7/10, Xtreme 9/10 and an extended Inner HP Xtreme 9/10 with Banshee camo finish.  It breaks clay birds with authority.  The barrel is a Tribore HP with an extra long forcing cone, a long overbored section and finally a conical section that creates a venturi effect before entering the Hypbolic choke tube increasing velocity somewhat. I shot my Remington Versa Max side by side with this gun utilizing similar chokes and same shells, the Fabarm read 75-100 fps higher than the Remington Versa Max all shells fired, maybe this is more than just marketing propaganda.  It is in excellent condition other than a small horizontal mar in the camo finish on the left side of the receiver and a few tiny mars in the same vicinity visible in one of the photographs."

The ventilated rib barrel allows you to spend long days at the range or in the field without the worry of overheating the barrel.More than 40 years ago, the Model 1100 forever changed the way American shooters viewed autoloading shotguns. It was the first autoloader to combine the repeat-shot versatility of early-century models with the sleek, modern lines and handling qualities of revered double barrels.
The Remington Model 1100 has been a field-proved favorite ever since. Its superb balance, handling, durability and soft recoil from the gas-operated action are the foundation of the Remington autoloading legacy."
