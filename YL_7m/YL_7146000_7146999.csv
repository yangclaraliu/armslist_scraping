Installed are traction grips, a set of JP spring cups and a custom recoil spring.  The gun doesn't have a lot of rounds through it but it is an accurate pistol. The gun features a crisp trigger with a short reset  It also has a very low bore axis which makes you think your shooting a 9mm. Muzzle flip is minimal for a 40. It was the follow-up design to the Glock. Same designer.  AGAIN NJ buyers must have a valid permit to purchase or please don't inquire. If you live in NJ you know the drill. WILL SHIP THROUGH FFL"

Stock has been finished beautifully to show grain. All numbers are matching other than bolt. Bore is decent with deep sharp rifling intact. Bluing has typical surplus wear. Neat old military rifle with powerful ammo that won't break the bank!More information on the M53:The Chinese Type 53 Carbine is one of the more interesting of the Model 1944 Carbine clones; however, the Type 53 has never been sought out on a wide scale by Mosin Nagant collectors. The main reason for this folly is the false notion that the Type 53 is of inferior quality when compared to its counterparts. Nothing could be further from the truth, but this very common opinion still seems to dominate collectors circles. The quality in manufacture of the Type 53 is quite high and the Type 53's place in history rivals any of the Model 1944's. In fact the combat use of the Type 53 may well be greater than any of the M44's. The overall accuracy of the Type 53 is in line with the other M44's on the market. Some are excellent shooters while some are truly horrible. This is not just the case with the Type 53 but all the M44 carbines ( really all surplus firearms in general ). Because of this it is impossible to make blanket statements on accuracy. Maybe the buyer will get lucky and get a ""tack-driver"" and maybe the buyer won't. The Type 53, like all the M44's, are fun to shoot IF one can tolerate a rather heavy amount of recoil.  The Type 53 may well be the best bargain of the M44 Carbine types on the collector's market.  It is indeed a lot of carbine for the money and really belongs in any Mosin Nagant collection. The black-eye that it has received in many circles is undeserved and this can work to the collector's advantage. Ignore the bogus information and the collector can make out like a bandit.The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432www.LincolnPawnShop.com"

If you stop shooting before the magazine is empty, the gun will have a cocked hammer and light trigger. The decocking lever safely lowers the hammer and returns the gun to double-action mode. You’ll see this on the left side of the frame, just above the magazine release button.
The capacity of the P225 is eight rounds plus the one you can load in the chamber. The pistol comes with two identical magazines. The magazine release button is on the left side just behind the trigger; it’s easy to reach and releases the steel magazines freely – you won’t have to tug it out.
Because the P225 is a single-stack design (the cartridges are stacked directly on top of each other, rather than staggered to the sides), the grip is noticeably smaller in circumference than the higher capacity double-stack models like the P226 and P229. That means that the distance to the trigger is shorter, so those without huge hands will have no problem reaching the trigger while holding the gun normally."

Impulse buy and didnt really need it so looking for something else. Never fired a single round through it, but listed as LNIB because of light handling marks, and to be honest, the factory finish isn't great. Very weak finish (not blued, but parkerized-ish) and spotty around the muzzle crown. Never-the-less, gun functions fine and trigger is suprisingly good. Front ramp has been painted (properly) with bright orange modelers paint, (3 white base coats and 4 coats of orange). Comes with everything from the factory which is, well, the gun, little velvet bag it's in, key lock, and the box. Also 5 rounds, thats right, 5 rounds, not boxes, but rounds of Winchester PDX1 +p 38 special.Would make a good glove box, or stash gun.Prefer to sale or trade for weight set, just depends. Shoot me an offer, interested in all firearms, just no shotguns or hunting rifles. Looking for a weight set with bench, bar, rack and weight's up to 250 lbs."

This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm.Also included is Stealthgear holster and 2 mag carrier, 6 magazines (2x15, 2x13, 2x10)."

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN.

Made in Solingen, Germany. Real Stag handles with no cracks, chips, or looseness. Blade has no chips or broken tip. Blade on left side has a very small amount of pitting near handle (not really bad or extensive).  Here is the Story: I used to collect hunting knives, but have shifted my interest to mid-priced folding pocket knives. I value this knife in the $50.00/$60.00 range, but would trade for pocket knife/knives in that price range. I would prefer usable knives ($10.00 to $25.00 range) rather than mint collectors pieces, but I will listen to any and all offers. I can give or take a few dollars to make a deal work. I dont want anything with broken tips, loose handles, etc. Used is fine, abused is unacceptable. I can meet in Plainfield, Avon, Mooresville, or anywhere close to there. Thank you for your time and interest."
