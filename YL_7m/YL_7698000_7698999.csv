During filming, the Seattle Police Department officer assigned to the Department's Industrial Relations Division responsible for coordination between the Department and Batjac Productions became acquainted with the Duke. They met socially on several occasions and had many interactions during the shoot. At the end of the shoot, the Duke presented this gun to that police officer, Vince. It was eventually handed down to another family member who is the owner of this consignment. Shown in the photo is the Duke with members of the Seattle PD used as extras in the movie and Officer Vince (in civilian clothes). The photo is also stamped on the back by the official photographer. Also included is the Colt factory letter showing the gun shipped to the Salton Sea Armament Company in 1968. The Salton Sea Armament Company is the Dealer that provided real firearm props to the production company. Included in the photos of this item is a screen shot of John Wayne retrieving the Colt from his trunk, the Colt is seen a few other times as well in the movie ""McQ.""  As far as the firearm goes, it is in excellent shape with only a few very minor marks from handling. The photos show a good depiction of overall condition and only a very small mark is seen on the cylinder. It can be fired and is about 99%. No box included as the movie actors usually threw them away."

The eagerly anticipated subcompact model of the acclaimed Heckler & Koch VP Series handgun, VP9SK (in 9 mm) has all of the sought-after characteristics of larger frame VP pistols but in a more concealable design.
The highly-rated HK VP precision strike trigger is also found on the VPSK. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The net result is trigger quality unmatched in production striker fired pistols.
A small-scale interpretation of the completely adjustable VP grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the compact grip frame of the VP9SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit any individual user and is a feature found only on Heckler & Koch handguns. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting.
The VPSK has the features of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.
HK’s patented charging supports, found on full size VP pistols, are also present on the VPSK. The charging supports are simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength.
VPSK pistols can use a variety of proven HK magazines, including compact double stack 10-round and 13-round with either flat or extended floorplates for a more ergonomic grip. The VPSK can also use the same high capacity 15-round magazine used by the full size VP and P30 handguns. Magazine sleeves that replicate the grip profile of the VP handgun are also available.
VPSK pistols have an abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.
VPSK pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that helps reduce the recoil forces affecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component life span.
HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures a long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VPSK’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.
Despite their small size, VPSK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. VPSK models are currently available in 9 mm.
VPSK pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.
A high quality and well-engineered design, the VP9SK possesses all the features and long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. And like full size VP pistols, the VP9SK is value priced at $719 (MSRP).Sorry, no trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax."

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. New for 2016 are Flat Dark Earth (FDE) models, VPs with special colorants added to the frame during the molding process creating the tan/brown color scheme increasing used by military and security units. The frame’s color is indestructible, permanent and completely resistant to fading or chemical change."

All other brass is chosen to ensure it meets the unusually high standards for reliable feeding, corrosion resistance, proper hardness and the ability to withstand maximum chamber pressures. Each cartridge is loaded to ensure optimal pressure, velocity and consistency from lot to lot. Like the powder, each primer is carefully matched to individual loads, and specifically selected for their ability to quickly, completely, and reliably ignite the powder charge. The XTP bullet delivers controlled expansion to 1.5x its original diameter over a wide range of velocities. The heavier jacket stands up to the high pressures and velocities of the highest performance handgun cartridges. Built to the tightest tolerances for peak performance rivaling and sometimes surpassing handloads in many guns.

Most of the models this year feature a gray stock with black rubber inlays (like featured on the Browning web page), but this one for auction is the rare Shot Show version with opposite colors (black synthetic stock with gray rubber inlays). The stock is just black synthetic and does not have the Dura-Touch tacky coating (which rubs off anyway). The gray rubber inserts are very grippy. The receiver is alloy. (twice at the range and once while pheasant hunting). Excellent condition. Browning Cynergy Composite Feather 12ga 28"" barrel shotgun. Black stock with gray rubber inlays. LOP is 15"" as pictured, but comes with a spacer, when removed, makes LOP 14.75. Other recoil pads may be purchased to make the LOP even shorter. Includes choke wrench, locks, paperwork and manual, improved cylinder, modified, and full chokes, and original box. Only about 6.5 lbs! Nice balance. The only imperfections I can find that would deviate from factory new condition are a few very light, superficial marks on the stock. I'm only selling to fund another shotgun purchase. Here is a good buy for you gauranteed.Insured flat shipping via FedEx Ground Service available on request for extra $40, Money Order and Certified Check would be shipped immediately with USPS delivery."
