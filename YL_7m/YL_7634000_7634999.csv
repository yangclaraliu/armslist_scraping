That is the real advantage, this pistol is forged steel all the way, frame, slide and barrel. It famously fired 75,000 rounds without a failure during testing and then went to 150,000 with a new barrel. There are none available for sale anywhere in the U.S. new in the box. This is a lifetime gun and can be passed down, unlike the plastic wonders sold now. It is 15+1 capacity and even has three factory Interarms mags, two are stainless. These magazines alone are worth $100 each."

So if anyone is somehow willing to sell a wasr 10 or NPAP for 450-500$ (again  if you look hard enough some do sell them for that low ) and are willing to use my SKS (I can provide pictures of the said SKS just send me a message if you want to see ) to knock $300 off the cost of it please send me a message.
