One is for a double stack and the other is for single stack. They are made to be used as owb or iwb. I am asking $25 a piece or $45 with both. If you buy with I will also include a paddle attachment. More information on these mag holsters below. Magazine holsters are essential for for concealed carry, besides a quality gun holster and gun belt. Not carrying a spare magazine leaves so much to chance and limits the amount of ammunition you can carry at any one time. A mag carrier also makes reloads at the range an absolute breeze. Alien Gear is proud to bring you the next phase of evolution in mag holsters. Making just another magazine holster is just not good enough for us, as we believe in doing things better than other holster companies. You will see the difference in the design. In keeping with Alien Gear's commitment to modular and customization driven designs, our magazine holders are designed to be the most versatile mag carrier on the market. Each carrier comes with a neoprene backer, just like our Cloak Tuck 3.0 iwb holster, and two holster clips - including our standard polymer belt clip. This allows the wearer to carry their spare magazine in virtually any manner they wish. To use as an IWB magazine holster, attach the neoprene backpad and the smaller belt clip. Wear inside the waistband as you desire. If you prefer an OWB magazine holster, remove the backer and install the larger OWB belt clip. This allows for carry outside of the waistband. Just like our holster retention shells, the magazine bucket is adjustable for retention. Included with purchase is an Allen key, which you can use to set the retention level of your choice. Our mag holders are also fully adjustable for cant, as the clip can be rotated in 22.5-degree increments. Wear vertically, tilted forward or the rear, or fully horizontal if desired for easy concealment. You aren't likely to find any mag carriers on the market that are as versatile as Alien Gear's. They are equally at home at the range as they are carrying a spare magazine for open or concealed carry."

This particular gun has only had around 1000 rounds shot. It's obviously been modified. It has:Vickers Tactical extended magazine release, Punisher back plate, mirror polished trigger with Glock 17 trigger bar with smooth trigger, Glock - connector, ZEV frame pins, fully stippled grip with finger grooves removed and double undercut trigger guard, and lightly polished feed ramp. The gun was my edc and is built to be a shooter. I've built probably a dozen of these under this set up and ran them to 10,000+ rounds. I just don't carry it anymore so I want a full size. It will come with a CompTac hybrid holster, BladeTech Eclipse OWB holster, Safariland retention paddle holster, and some generic high cant / small of back holster. All things said it is a Glock but there's a lot in this package. I'm sure I have more buried around here too. Now I'm wanting a Glock 17 Gen 3 that's stock +a few bucks to compensate for the extras. So for a Glock 17 I'll include 4 15 round Glock mags, 3 of these with Vickers base plates, and a 15 round with a +2 Glock extension, and all the spare parts shown. I'm also interested in other pistols such as S&W M&P, Beretta M9/92, Sig P320. No Springfield please. No Taurus.

Says 1942 on it. Someone cut the barrel down to 17 inches so it has no front sight and needs the muzzle re-crowned. It has a black plastic ATI stock but someone really screwed it up by removing part of the handguard so now it looks ugly. The rear sight post is intact but the adjustable rear sight fixture itself is missing. it would cost about $60 to have a gunsmith recrown the muzzle to make it look pretty again. A brand new polymer ATI stock can be found elsewhere for $70. I'm not sure how much it would cost or how easy it would be to attach some iron sights or a scope. I can still explode a watermelon with it from 40 feet away just aiming down the barrel. It's still functional and safe to fire. Project rifle with a low price for someone who wants to fix it up and make good use of it. Comes with about 20 rounds of ammo and i can even deliver it personally. No felons. Cash only. Due to spam i had to remove my number so use the armslist email thing to contact if interested.  post will be removed when sold."

The Eagle Carbine was developed and manufactured in small numbers from 1964-68. A man by the name of Bill Ordner developed the .45 ACP Eagle Carbine, patterned around the M3 Grease Gun and used genuine Thompson 1928 Wood Stocks in their construction. Bill owned the Eagle Gun Company, which he operated out of his house in Stratford,Connecticut. The factory where the Eagle Carbine was actually manufactured, was located in Northeast Pennsylvania. Bill would travel to the factory to Proof Fire New Stock and pick up shipments of Eagle Carbines for resale to dealers until his factory was controversially burnt down in 1968. The Eagle Mark 1, followed later by the Mark 11 version, were the first of several Open Bolt Carbines to be manufactured and sold in the 1960's. These were followed by the Spitfire, the Apache, and the Commando Carbine which appeared in the early 1970's. All were Semi-Auto Carbines that fired either .45 ACP or 9mm Pistol Cartridges using surplus Thompson, M3, or Sten magazines. The Spitfire's and Apache's were later Banned by the ATF and reclassified a ""Machine Guns"", in effect making the already Rare Eagle Carbine one of the ONLY LEGAL versions of this type of Firearm. This particular Eagle is in Good Condition."

Shiney bore and all surfaces clean. No issues with anything.. The only “problem” is original latch for rear housing has been replaced with a straight pin as opposed to a “L” shaped latch.
Deburred the trigger assembly, so runs as smooth as any SKS I have ever shot.
I am including a Tapco Sythetic stock that I got for it but never used.
VOMZ P8x56 is nice I feel. A bit big for an SKS but what the hell. I am also including the original rear housing, if buyer decides they don’t want it scoped. Somewhat unique to this SKS is that the Spike bayonet is removable, it can be unclipped from the bayonet lug without tools.
 
The ""D"" is not really a model, just what dealer's started calling them due to the detachable magazine. You won't see a ""D"" stamp or anything like that.
A true ""D"" model will have a 20"" barrel, with the bayonet lug and spike bayonet attached. The stock would be in the standard configuration, usually with a unsealed finish.
The “D” is one of the hardest to find SKS’s there are. Built for AK Mags not reworked for fit. Spike bayonet (detachable), 20” barrel and wood stock. Not many nicer than this one.

Functionally a clone of the K98k's predecessor, the 1933 Standard Modell. Rough, like most of them. In the interests of full disclosure, it's got a missing top handguard, the stock has a couple of cracks, and though the rifling looks serviceable the bore mics out way too worn to stabilize an 8mm. That said, the stock's not a lost cause and the action is good. It would make an excellent base for a project or restoration, or you could just get a handguard and hang it on the wall as a sample of a rather uncommon military Mauser.Don't strictly need to get rid of it but my interest in the project is waning so I wanted to see what else might be out there. Would love to trade for another surplus bolt gun, even as a project gun. Specifically a Steyr straight pull in 8x56, a Carcano in 6.5x52, possibly a different mauser in any of the traditional military chamberings (7x57, 8x57, 7.65x53, .308, 6.5x55, asf). I'm also always looking for early .32ACP handguns and older Mossberg .22lr rifles. Will sell for $350.Would also consider any of the following for a partial trade (or multiples):German K98k stock.K98k bayonet, original or reproduction.Other K98k parts.Finnish Mosin-Nagant m27 or m39 bayonet, original or reproduction.Colt 1903 mags.Mossberg M44US mags.CZ-75 9mm mags.Glock 9mm factory or magpul mags.Diamondback DB9 mags.Streamlight weapon lights.AKM 7.62x39 mags/accessories/parts.Factory loaded ammo in .32ACP, 9x19, 8x57, 7.62x39.If you have something else in mind, lay it on me."
