If you don't get a reply make sure you sent your email address.Highly customized original series Colt Mustang .380 Pocketlite. These were the only great concealed carry pistols in production for more than a decade. To this day they are in the top 5 and easily #1 for quality and reliability. There are many small pistols being made but they are either way too heavy or they're a much smaller caliber. This smooth little riverstone of a pistol went through an extreme weight loss for daily carry. I call it the Diet Colt. The frame and the slide were aggresively skeletonized and relieved. Note the less obvious work that was done to it including removing all material above the firing pin, all edges softened and rounded, bobbed hammer, lower profile slide stop and safety lever, reduced beavertail, thinned frame, and reduced mag finger rests on the magazines. I call it the Diet Colt. Any shadow on the frame is just from exposure to denim. It all turns into bright metal.When lasers became available this got a factory branded laser direct from Colt. The alignment of the laser to the sights is spot on.The empty weight is now at 10 ounces. With the laser it's 11.7 oz. Fully loaded weight including a round in the chamber is 15 oz. You CANNOT get this combination of both extreme quality and extremely low weight in any compact pistol out there. .380 is a 9mm short(kurtz). Load this hot with some CorBon +P and you've got 9mm ballistics in a featherweight pocket gun. This listing includes the laser, 2 factory Colt magazines and a molded black leather Talon IWB holster that a Colt rep actually recommended. It fits it like a glove and adds the option of drawing from the hip. This also goes great in a front pocket and you forget it's there.If you're local you have a cost advantage of no shipping fees, no FFL fees, no FFL transaction process, and you can see the gun during purchase instead of after.No trades or exchange of services. Just cash.NOTE THAT WHEN YOU CONTACT A SELLER ON ARMSLIST THE SITE SENDS YOU AN INITIAL EMAIL REQUIRING YOU TO CONFIRM YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS. IF YOU USE A RANDOM EMAIL ADDRESS YOUR MESSAGES WILL NEVER GO THROUGH."

The pistol is an amazing shooter and is in fantastic condition, inside and out. The glossy blued finish is factory original, as are the walnut magna grips.  The serial number puts it's manufacture date at '79-'80. Going by the pristine bore and (lack of) flame cutting under the top strap, it obviously hasn't been fired very much (and I've only put maybe 3-4 boxes through it in the 5+ years I've had it).Asking $450.....firm, and no trades (unless it's something real cool, and way in my favor). Buyer must be legal to own firearms, be a legal Georgia resident with valid ID. As always, I'll show my Georgia DL and carry permit. I'm ok with a bill of sale....or not.If the ad is still up, I still have the pistol. Low ball offers, and scammers asking if I still have it, or asking me to text you at a distant area code (or ANY area code) will be ignored.Thanks for looking....."

643,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7690643,For Sale:  M1 Garand,"Essex County, Massachusetts, United States","$ 1,450","Listed On: Tuesday, February 20, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling my Springfield armory M1 Garand. According to the serial number it was manufactured some time in February of 1944. I have no doubt that it was used in the service. It's fully functional, accurate, and is really fun to shoot. There is also a unique feature that this gun has- after WWII ended there were a lot extra of service rifles that military had on their hands. Up until the development of the M14 the garand was still one of the most effective battle rifles in the world. However, the U.S. Was looking to switch to a NATO caliber (7.62x51) to serve in place of the standard 30-06. Because of that, in the early 50s the navy discovered that a Garand could actually shoot 7.62x51 ammunition by simply switching the barrel for one with a 7.62x51 chamber. This worked surprisingly well and probably would have become more popular if it weren't for the introduction of the M14. There are many advantages to having this gun be able to shoot 7.62x51 ammo. First of all, the Ammo is significantly cheaper and more plentiful. Second, 7.62x51 (.308) will perform more historically accurate to an original 30-06 Garand. Why?, because 30-06 and 7.62x51 shoot the same exact bullet (literally, the same exact bullet). The only difference between the two cartridges is the case length. Despite the difference in length, the 7.62x51 bullets travel at the same speed as a 30-06 would have back in WWII (about 2,800 feet per second) because of the use of modern gunpowder. Modern 30-06 is more of a dedicated hunting cartridge now and because of this it's increased power will actually cause damage to an M1 Garand (it will bend the op rod). The 7.62x51 Ammo even fits in the same clips as the 30-06 rounds. This is why its better to have Garand's chambered in 7.62x51. Besides, if for some reason you really want it to be chambered in 30-06, all you have to do is switch barrels which takes about 5-10 minutes tops. I also have a few accessories for this gun. One is a bayonet from the Korean War, the other is a muzzle break which works very, very well. It quite literally brings the recoil and muzzle rise of the gun down into the realm of an Ar15 chambered in 5.56. If you are interested in this gun don't hesitate to send me an email. For the most part I am not interested in trades since I'm selling this because I want to put the money towards something else."
