There are a handful of shallow nicks and cuts, as well as some very minor fraying on the bow string, and someone did wrap electrical tape around the grip, in what appears to be an attempt to add some padding. This bow features a Whisker Biscuit arrow rest, as well as a fiber optic sight, and this bundle comes with a finger release, as well as 2 quivers, 5 arrows, all of which fits in the hard plastic case. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this bow, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions you have."

Much more rare than their larger counterparts, the M44 is a carbine model with a swivel-attached bayonet. This one is Soviet in origin, and originates from the Tula factory. Manufacture year is 1944, placing it in the first full year of production of the rifle and one of the oldest specimens. (The only older models were manufactured in the Izhevsk plant in 1943.) (Source: 7.62x54r.net) Serial numbers are matching on the receiver, bolt, and buttplate, but the magazine was restamped during refurbishment following WWII. The stock appears to be original to the gun and was left untouched. It’s got a little wear in the finish, which is to be expected of a rifle that went through war-time – but it wasn’t used as a club like some Nagants seem to have been.
A Tula manufacture M44 is fairly rare. Of the roughly 7.5 million M44’s produced in Russia from 1943 to 1948 only around 100,000 were manufactured in the Tula plant, and only in 1944. (Source: davidhedrick.com)
The gun is an absolute blast to shoot. I'm selling it to fund a couple of other projects that I’ve had laying around unfinished, and I just don't shoot this one often enough for me to justify keeping. The only thing I’ve done to the gun (aside from the cleaning of cosmoline) is added a trigger spring, which keeps the trigger from flopping around when the gun is cocked and the brown recoil pad. Else, she’s original (And yes, I have the original metal buttplate, you get that too!).
I’ve seen these rifles as high as $500 on Armslist and GunBroker, but I think that’s a bit high. I would, however, like to get around $400 for the gun, as I think it’s well worth it. I’m not really looking for trades right now, sorry. The best way to reach me is the tools in the listing - it'll send an email to my cell phone.  From there, we can work out the specifics!I'm willing to ship to your FFL for an additional $50 to cover packing materials and freight."

I'd rather have a .308 for the range!Ideally speaking I would like to trade this for the same gun in .308 and I'm seeing that the 6.5 Creedmoor is DAMN popular amgonest long range shooters, more so than the .308 even. I see people selling their .308's at a loss and picking up the 6.5 CM.Well maybe we can work out a trade, gun for gun that way neither of us loose out.My rifle is in damn near new condition.

This 51T Blackout flash hider works in conjunction with AAC’s improved ratchet mount sound suppressors.  The 51-T mount is an intuitive, lightning fast silencer attachment/detachment system that allows for secure installation of a suppressor in less than 3 seconds with no tools or moving parts.  Not compatible with the older spring mount (18-Tooth) or newer ratchet taper mount (90-Tooth) sound suppressors.
