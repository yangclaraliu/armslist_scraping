Comes with the original wooden handguards, as well as the quad rail I put on it myself. I have also mounted a picatinny rail on top of the dust cover closer to your eyes if you prefer an optic up closer. (Could be taken off as well.) Also included are 3 magazines, the custom muzzle break I ordered, as well as the dual color red dot sight you see in the picture. This is a reliable weapon, have only had maybe one jam - due to rapid firing. Be advised this is classified as a pistol due to the length being under 16"", if you place a vertical foregrip or a regular rifle brace on this - it will classify it as a NFA short barreled rifle. You can however buy a pistol brace stock for this (can legally shoulder that) and also one of those angled grips which are both legally still approved by the ATF. All in all, this is a very fun gun to shoot! Shoots some awesome fireballs due to its short barrel length, also the fact that this is chambered in 5.56/.223 makes this a cheap gun to go shoot as well! I will need to see ID and PTP/PTC in order to sell this firearm."

At less than an inch thick, it can be adapted to practically every platform on the market. To activate the brace functionality, depress the release button and pull the arm down. This creates the shelf that will counterbalance the muzzle weight of your large frame handgun. The ability of your forearm to hold the weight allows you to relax your shooting wrist and concentrate on trigger control. True one handed operation is achieved since you do not need a second hand to attach the brace to your arm. MOD 1 can be set up for right or left handed operation. We start with a solid piece of billet aluminum and meticulously machine every aspect for a part that is as nice to look at as it is to use. This version clamps to pistol buffer tubes or adapter spuds ranging from 1.17"" to 1.2"" in diameter. It features a limited rotation sling swivel QD socket as well. Weighing in at a scant 4.5 ounces, you will never feel it there. That is, until you want to use it. It is finished with a hard anodizing to withstand years of serious use. Remember that when this is installed on a pistol, it does not change the classification of the pistol with correct intended use. Included in the package is the Mod 1 brace and hex wrench for installation only. It does NOT come with any adapters or buffer tube for mounting to your pistol.   ATF Approval Letter: www.socalstar.com/tailhook_MOD1.pdf"

Also included are 3 magazines, the custom muzzle break I ordered, as well as the dual color red/green dot sight you see in the picture. This is a reliable weapon, have only had maybe one jam - due to rapid firing. Be advised this is classified as a pistol due to the length being under 16"", if you place a vertical foregrip or a regular rifle brace on this - it will classify it as a NFA short barreled rifle. You can however buy a pistol brace stock for this (can legally shoulder that) and also one of those angled grips which are both legally still approved by the ATF. All in all, this is a very fun gun to shoot! Shoots some awesome fireballs due to its short barrel length, also the fact that this is chambered in 5.56/.223 makes this a cheap gun to go shoot as well! I will need to see ID and PTP/PTC in order to sell this firearm."
