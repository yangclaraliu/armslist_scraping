The digital optic system effectively bundles numerous devices and technologies together in a state-of-the-art package that brings confidence and improved accuracy to the shooter at distances of up to 500 yards. Integrated capabilities include:  3-21X Digital Scope   Laser Rangefinder (750 Yard Range) The Most Advanced Ballistic Computer Available Video /Audio Recorder Still Camera (frame capture) Wi-Fi Server  Looking through the Remington 2020 Digital Optic System, the shooter is presented with a Heads-Up Display (HUD) that overlays the information about the ammunition, environment and shot orientation that effect accuracy to the field of view before them. Through a sequence referred to as Tag, Track and React (TTR™), the Remington 2020 Digital Optic System allows the shooter to designate the desired location of a shot (""Tag""). The advanced internal ballistic computer immediately generates a firing solution based on a far greater number of inputs and factors that affect the bullet's flight than other ballistic calculators or tables. The shooter then simply adjusts their point of aim to bring the ballistically corrected reticle on target (""Track"") and take the shot (""React""). Even on targets moving up to 10 mph. Recording and Streaming The system can also broadcast a Wi-Fi signal allowing others to see a streaming live video feed from the HUD via a smartphone (Apple iOS or Andriod) app. For the first time, another person can share what the shooter is seeing and doing wirelessly for more effective coaching, mentoring or guiding. From the time a Tag is placed until a preset time after the shot is taken, this stream can also be recorded, with audio, to internal memory for later downloading and sharing.  The benefits of the Remington 2020 go beyond improved shot placement and the consolidation of gear currently required to perform ballistic calculations. The true benefit lies in the confidence, and enhanced capabilities that this technology provides to the user. All of which encourages a more ethical hunt.Comes with the 2020 Digital Optic System. $2500! Come on down to West Mountain Pawn if you'd like to take a closer look!"

Since then I've only ran about 1000 rounds through it, leaving it in fairly pristine condition. What makes this AK special is the upgraded furniture ($150), the flash hider/comp ($30), the bolt carrier polishing, and the matte black duracoat that I added to the gun. While most AK's have that rugged black/iron colored coating, this AK has a beautiful matte black coating on it.  While this is indeed a WASR-10, if you want to make it look half this good you're going to need to spend quite a bit more than this for the furniture upgrade alone. The AK comes with two 30-round P-Mags and a Steel Korean mag that I duracoated the same color as the gun. The combination looks great.  If you want to see more pics or are interested in purchasing it, shoot me a text at REDACTED."

Correct, this is the CZ Scorpion, but in a carbine format with a built-in faux supressor (flash can). I bought it about three months ago and since then I have put about 300 rounds through it. It shoots flawlessly, it's a CZ, what can I expect. I have taken great care of the rifle after ever time I've shot it, I've properly cleaned and lubed it. The rifle comes with TWO 30-round CZ mags as well as TWO 10-round mags. I've also installed a safety delete which, in my opinion, is an essential upgrade if you are a right-handed shooter. It's not super easy to find these online, and when you do, they're pretty expensive. I'm selling one that is in GREAT condition for a great price. If you are interested in it, shoot me a text at REDACTEDBy the way, you'll see a Burris Fastfire 3 reflex sight on the rifle. If you're interested in that I'll let it go for a great price. Thanks!"

The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters distance. The front sight is a fixed blade. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded closed position. his pistol is manufactured at the famed Radom Plant in Poland by Pioneer Arms. All parts and components are Polish made. The PPS43-C pistol comes with a curved box magazine which holds up to 35 rounds.Buyer pays the FFL fee. Prefer an FFL near Federal Way but can work it out.

Markings on the metal are correct, original, and easy to see. This Rifle is much better than most any Springfield you will ever see.The Springfield Model 1884 was one of several models of ""Trapdoor Springfield"" rifles produced in the late 19th century. It was the final design in a long line of Springfield Trapdoor rifles, built since the 1860s, and the last single-shot rifle to see American military service.Springfields were manufactured until 1893. The Model 1884, despite its aged technology, was built in large numbers and was also the most advanced and efficient of all the Springfield Trapdoor rifles, and is still popular for this reason among military enthusiasts today.The model 1884 traces its roots back to the design of the Springfield 1873. Most of the changes that identify the model 1884 as a distinct model occurred either before or after 1884. The model 1884 incorporated a significant number of improvements that had been made between 1878 and 1879. It also featured a serrated trigger that had been incorporated into the Springfield rifle design in 1883.The most dramatic change to the rifle design, which is often considered to be the identifying feature of the model 1884, was a new rear sight which had been designed by Lieutenant Colonel Adelbert R. Buffington of the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. This sight however was not perfected until 1885.The principal feature of this new sight was a rack and pinion style windage adjustment. Unlike previous sights, the base was not used for any position other than point blank. The raised leaf had graduations from 200 to 1400 yards. A new barrel band was also designed to accommodate this new sight so that it could lie flat in the point blank position*I purchased the rifle at an estate sell in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2014. My intent was to shoot it, but this rifle is just too nice. It deserves to be in a collection.Priced very fairly at $1,850.00Please send e-mail for pictures. REDACTED"
