The actual brand is American Western Arms which is now Uberti. This is the Peacekeeper version.  American Western Arms was sued by Colt for making their revolvers just like theirs and obviously for using the same name for their Peacekeeper, which Colt had'nt made yet but were in the process of making it. Colt made a Peacemaker which generally were chambered in .45 LC. The Colt Peacekeeper was made to be chambered in .357 magnum. This pistol is used but is well taken care of. The finish on it could be better, which came from age and I do planning on having it re-blued, but if It sells before then I wont worry about it. If I do have it re-blued the price will increae. The value on this gun at 100% condition is $725.00. This has been rated at 95% condition so the value is $550.00. Im willing to part with this pistol for $500.00. This is a great gun, the action is incedibly smooth and the accurracy ism perfect. The only reason I am selling this gun is because I am wanting to buy the same gun, of course now made by Uberti, but in .45LC."

The frame was painted and is not so pretty as theres lines and swirls and whatever else, but the frame is very small pieces on these. The barrel is nicely blued and a heavy one. The cylinder is also blued with just some wear on the edge and a drag line. It shoots with ZERO muzzle movement. It feels like shooting an airgun as all that weight up front just holds it steady. It weighs just under 2 pounds so more than most poly pistols as its all steel. Plastic grips in white and loads through a side gate so you dont have to remove the cylinder like the old H&R and Iver Johnson 22s that were sold as camp/truck/tacklebox guns. The barrel is pinned in like the better ones and the cylinder has recessed chambers so the rounds fit flush. Theres some proof marks all over and on the receiver is a shield with 67 inside which MAY be the year. I find 7 marks without taking the grips off. I fired it one time only as I got it in a group deal and did not target test it. Just had fun testing it out to be sure it works. Locks up real tight when you pull the trigger and there are 3 hammer positions. Half-cock lets the cylinder turn for loading/unloading. Says GERMANY on the barrel, but strangely, not West Germany. Something different and cool, as you will not run into any other JANA revolvers. Not a collector for sure, but if you are going to have a camp/boat/fishing gun whether to finish a gator, snag dinner while camping or just-in-case...might as well have something interesting. Im pretty sure it is 1967 as it predates the GCA of 1968 which required import stamps. Also a great beginner gun to teach the basics of sights, safety and shooting. You wont mind a ding or scratch and if it does get some, the value stays the same. MANY PHOTOS AVAILABLE"

is practically brand new.  I just got it back from Agency Arms.  The only reason i am selling it is because shortly after i sent it to them, Glock released the Gen 5 19 and i am planning on sending one to them to get the same exact work done.  I dont really have a need for two Glock 19s so i figured i would put this one up for trade and see whats out there.  This gun started as a brand new, unfired Glock 19 Gen 4, purchased earlier this year.  It was sent off to Agency Arms immediately for a Complete Build.  All work was done by them.  After a pretty long wait (i believe around 4 months) i finally got it back.  The work is absolutely amazing.  This is definitely not some ""at home garage"" build like many of the ""custom"" glocks you see.  Agency Arms makes, in my opinion, the best Glocks on the market!  They are truly professionals at what they do, and they clearly take pride in their work.  Work done by Agency Arms includes:-  Agency Arms Urban Combat cut slide.  This slide features windows on both sides as well as the top of the gun.  This is their most weight reducing option.  Aggressive serations are on both the rear and front of the slide.  I also had them put serations on the 45 degree chamfer of the slide as well, forward of the ejection port.  Slide has Agency Arms signature logo milled into the side, and the top is cut for an RMR optic.  Agencys ""American Flag"" Battle Plate is currently on the gun, but can be removed if you wish to put a red dot on it.  Slide is cerakoted by Agency Arms in Onxy Black.-  Agency Arms Premium grade barrel.  This is their top of the line (and most expensive) barrel option.  The barrel is MATCH GRADE, fluted to reduce weight and increase strength, and threaded for muzzle devices or a suppressor.  The barrel is coated in Titanium Nitride (TiN) for better strength and lubrication, hence the ""gold"" coloration to it.  Agency Arms mills their logo into the top of the barrel hood to make the presentation that much nicer!  -  Agency Arms custom flat faced trigger.  One of my personal favorite triggers for Glock pistols.  This trigger offers an amazing brake and clean reset with practically no over travel, while still keeping the pistol as reliable as a Glock should be (unlike some other after market triggers out there that are plagued with light primer strikes).-  Agency Arms Magwell cerakoted to match the slide.  Agency designs their magwells to enhance reload speed, while also remaining concealable.  -  Agency Arms custom framework featuring their ""aggressive"" pattern stippling and patented ""accelerator cuts"".  These cuts, forward of the trigger mechanism, give you a place to rest your weak hands thumb, allowing you to put downward pressure on the front of the gun.  They act almost like little shelves, and are by far my favorite part of the frame.  The stippling is absolutely amazing as well.  Very ""grippy"" without being so rough that it hurts your hand.  The area around the mag release button is open up, making finding the button that much easier.  Those awful finger grooves are removed completely.  The trigger gaurd is undercut allowing you to get a higher purchase on the weapon, bringing your hands closer to the center bore axis of the pistol.  -  Agency Arms titanium guide rod and recoil spring, which along with the accelerator cuts, ensures that this pistol has pretty much no recoil!  The gun is simply as smooth as a 9mm can be.-  Im sure there is plenty of other stuff im forgetting that they did.  Just email me or check their website for more in depth details.  The gun comes with all the original parts removed during the build as well, so factory trigger, factory barrel, and so on.  Included also are the original 3 15 round magazines as well as a clear ETS magazines and the original box and paperwork for the pistol.  Feel free to go on to Agency Arms website and ""build"" this gun yourself using their online ""complete build"" feature.  You will see that this gun has every option Agency Arms offers!  Also, you will see that the build cost is $2010.00!!!  Include the fact that you have to pay $550 for the pistol itself, and about $100 in shipping and taxes to send the gun to Agency Arms in California, and you can see that Agency Arms pistols are NOT cheap.  Overall this build costs about $2700 give or take!!  And they are worth every penny.  (Hence why i keep sending my guns to them.  lol)I will sell the gun outright for $2200 if someone wants to buy it (cash).  Thats $500 off.  I have worked in the gun industry for many years while in college and i know how it works, obviously im not gonna expect to get the full $2700 back.  But i am more interested in trading it since im not to hard up for cash.  Feel free to email or text me anytime at REDACTED.  (I work as a Paramedic so chances are i will probably be awake).  My name is Derek.  Thank you for your time."
