I have for sale a Stack-On gun safe that can fit up to 8 rifles/shotguns (and then some). Its nothing fancy, just all steel construction and has a top shelf to place other items you want. Also comes with magnetic pouches if you need to place pistols and/or knives, mace, tasers, etc. whatever your heart desires to place in them. Also comes with 2 keys, manual, paperwork, and extra miscellaneous items as well. Specs are H=15, W=21, D=10Reason for selling this is I don’t own any rifles and shotguns anymore, and is just wasting too much space in my closet. I’m more inclined in owning pistols now and would much rather invest in a much smaller electronic safe for my pistols, extra ammo, and valuables. Thats all there is to it! So if you just want a cheaper alternative to throw your long guns in then look no further as you’ll be doing me a favor. My loss is simply your gain. Thanks for reading and if you’re interested then I hope to hear from you soon!Ps- this is sucker is big so we will have to compromise and workout a plan for delivery or pick-up when ready to purchase"

Vest, hard case, Mags by magpul, single sling. and much more. flat top with iron rear flip up adjustable and 6 point front sights. laser, light, 90 down the tube. still tight as hell. OK, This comes with a brand new tactiacle vest with full belt, about 400 round of 223 a brand new clening tool for the bolt and pin. three 30's 3 10's the light is bright and a thumb away, the laser covers the block and is green and easy to adjust. extra battery's yea you can buy this for about 1,000 plus tax and hell...All I need is your FID and DL. The sling is made by Tactical Link, The tool is a Kley Zion, The rifle itself has been proven over the years and is a out of the box nail pusher. Was bought in FLA. so it's a nice piece and you can do anything you want to it as all AR's. But in honesty why? It'll rull all day without a jam or stoppage. I have other cleaning tools I can toss in for those first time rifle owners. Rod's brushes, so on. So before you go to that local store around the corner and pay for just a rifle think about all the extras she comes with. The case alone is worth over 100.00 all added up your looking at 1,500 or more. WHAT TOO MUCH? THE AMMO IS WORTH 200.00 ALONE! THE LASER WAS 80, THE LIGHT WAS 60. THE STRAP WAS 75.00 THE CASE 100.00 THE MAGTECK MAGAZINES WERE 25 WITH COVERS FOR THE 30'S ABOUT 15 FOR THE 10'S W/COVERS. THE ZEION TOOL WAS 37.00 AND MORE TOOLS AVALIBLE. THE RIFLE WAS 1,200.00 AND ONE OF THE FIRST YEARS PRODUCED AFTER THEY LEFT BUSHMASTER. IT'S ONE OF THEIR BEST BEFORE HIGH PRODUCTION. SO I CANNOT SEE WHY NO OFFERS. YOU WILL NOT FIND A NEW RIFLE BETTER THEN THIS ONE. I DON'T CARE WHAT'S ON IT..LIGHT COVERS BLA BLA BLA..THIS IS A HEAVEY BARREL CHROMED LINED UNLIKE MOST GARBAGE OUT THERE. LOOK AT IT AND LOOK AT OTHERS. FLASH SUPRRESOR AND KNIVE LUG COVERED BY LASER. EASY OFF AND ON. THE VEST IS A MAG HOLDER AND PISTOL HOLSTER, IT HAS A FULL BEST ON IT FOR ALL YOUR COP TYPE ACCSEORIES IF YOU WANT OF JUST TAKE IT OFF. IT HAS ALL THE SPOTS IN THE BACK FOR BREAKING IN TOOLS, THE FRONT IS LOADED WITH MAG HOLDERS AND OTHER POCKETS. IT HAS A RUBBER STRAP OVER THE SHOULDER BOLDER HOLDER. THISIS FOR WHEN IT'S FULLY LOADED WITH GEAR IT HELPS CARRY THE WEIGHT. IT'S NOTHING EXPENSIVE BUT WORKS FINE FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO CARRY THEIR MAGS FOR A FIGHT. THE BELT CAN ACCOMODATE EVERYTHING FROM CUFFS TO MORE TACTICAL PISTOLS HOLSTERS. RIFLE/SHOTGUN CARRY WITH EASE. IT WAS NEVER USED DUE TO WAITING FOR THE STHTF. YA KNOW? AS YOU CAN SEE IT HOLDS SHOTGUN SHELLS OR OTHER LARGE ITEMS LIKE MORE LIGHTS OR EXTRA EQUIPMENT. POCKETS FOR MED KIT/MAPS AND SO ON. COMPASS OR WHAT EVER YOU NEED CAN FIT IN THE VEST, IT'S A GREAT BUG OUT ITEM. OR JUST FOR HUNTING YOUR LOCAL STREETS....I MEAN WOODS. WILL TRADE FOR A MINI 14 PLUS CASH UNLESS IT'S AN OLDER ALL WOOD .223/5.56 WITH A TRIPOD OR EXTRAS BUT IF IT WILL FIT I WILL WANT TO KEEP MY CASE EVERYTHING ELSE I WILL STILL GO WITH DEAL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME."

There are over 20 design changes which differentiate the G17 Gen5 pistol from the Gen4 predecessor, including a flared mag-well, a new nDLC finish, the GLOCK Marksman Barrel, ambidextrous slide stop levers, and a grip which has no finger grooves. Firearm Features  Glock Gen5 Magazine The new GLOCK Gen5 magazine comes with an orange follower and a floor plate which is extended at the front for faster magazine change. Modular Backstrap Every GLOCK Gen4 and Gen5 model comes with backstraps in two sizes each one with or without beaver tail. The multiple backstrap frame allows the users to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. Enlarged Reversible Mag Catch The magazine catch of the Gen4 and Gen5 frames is reversible and enlarged towards the rear of the pistol. The reversible magazine catch is more user friendly to the shooter's reach and allows them to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol. RTF (Rough Textured Frame) The Gen4 and Gen5 have a rough frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction, without being too aggressive. It is present on the frame as well as on the interchangeable backstraps. nDLC Coating GLOCK's nDLC provides tougher, more durable protection than previously used finish. The nDLC finish is exclusive to the GLOCK manufacturing pro-cess. The nDLC finish increases protection against corrosion and scratching and improves the ability of the pistol to function in degreased or adverse conditions. The nDLC finish will be exclusive to Gen5 pistols at this time. Ambidextrous Slide Stop Lever The ambidextrous slide stop lever makes it easier for gun owners to quickly, safely and comfortably manipulate the slide whether they are left-handed or right-handed. Glock Marksman Barrel The GLOCK Marksman Barrel (GMB) features new barrel rifling which delivers improved accuracy.

We also have a taller rail that can be installed that sits about 1/2"" higher but the one currently on the gun looks sleeker.We then added an SGM butt pad to the rear.The gun is a blast to shoot and runs most low brass as well as high brass ammo without a hiccup. We test these guns with Federal bulk pack birdshot and Spartan Low Recoil ammo."

This rifle comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It does have some minor signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to both the age of the firearm, as well as the fact that it was previously owned, and saw irregular usage. There are no major flaws/defects to be found, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, rusting, staining, or discoloration. There are a couple of minor scratches, as well as a couple of minor chips in the wood stock, but that is it! The receiver and bolt are also in great shape, with some minor staining, but no rusting, or pitting. This rifle features a safety switch set directly behind the bolt, as well as a hinged magplate set in front of the trigger assembly, and a leather carry strap. This rifle would make a great addition to anybody's collection.

The wood-buttoned post WW1 magazine is non-matching, though of correct configuration. The pistol bears a full compliment of correct DWM and military proof marks, along with a small post war British nitro-proof ""BNP"" stamp beneath a British crown stamp, indicating the pistol was probably among those confiscated by the allied command during Germany's forced disarmament after the War. Of uncertain provenance is the gun's high luster blue finish and bright ""straw"" bluing which may be the result of post-manufacture professional refinishing done at some point in the gun's 102-year history. The bore is pristine with clear, crisp rifling and toggle parts show no sign of recoil lug wear as found on frequently fired P-08s. The pistol comes with a 1915 stamped Berlin-made commercial holster in very good condition with full stitching and well oiled, uncracked leather. Comes in addition to its orginal wood button mag with a spare late 1930's alu button magazine. Payment by USPS money order or money gramm money transfer.
