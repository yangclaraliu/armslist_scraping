I tried to reach out to as many folks as I could through the email responses that hadn’t been deleted.  If you didn’t hear back, my sincere apologies.Selling my Smith and Wesson 469.  The pistol is in great condition for its age - the slide bluing is nearly 100% with some holster wear on the alloy frame (have detailed photos - wear is minor).  Bore is excellent, pristine original grips and 1 original 12 round magazine with a strong spring and in perfect working order.  Pistol comes with an aftermarket hard plastic pistol case. I purchased this pistol used several years ago from a retired police officer who carried it often and shot it little. After purchased I ran 75 rounds of assorted 9mm hollowpoints without any malfunctions - it even fed empty casings. By all accounts it’s an unfailingly reliable design.  This would be a great and reliable pistol for concealed carry, home defense, the range or even to add to a Smith collection (this is a 2nd gen pistol).I love the pistol but it’s been sitting in my gun safe so I’m selling it.  For a quick sale, I’ve priced it well below what they’re going for on Gunbroker (not including shipping and transfer fees they would charge). Please don’t hesitate to ask any questions and I’ll answer as best I can. I will show valid proof of WV residency upon sale of pistol.  If you’re out of state, buyer assumes transfer fees, arrangements, etc. I will only sell responsibly and will verify as necessary.  I have quite a few detailed photos, just ask and I’ll be happy to send them. $350 or best offer. Thanks!"

This pistol has been used but has been flawless. There are a couple scratches and nicks on the DPP and the slide but they don’t affect function in any way. This also has the Magpul Gen 4 magwell installed. This gun has been completely problem free even with the softest shooting factory ammo. Slide and frame serial numbers match, obviously the barrel does not as it is aftermarket. It does not come with any iron sights as the DPP sits too high on the MOS plate to even see them, so they were removed. The Silencerco threaded barrel and TBRCI comp have about 200 rounds through them and will not be separated from the package. The DPP was installed with loctite (not by me), so if you’re going to want to remove that at any point you’re going to have to heat it up to do so.text me at 509-433-7043 for quickest response.  Please don't waste my time with offers of tv's or xd's."

This also has the Magpul Gen 4 magwell installed. This gun has been completely problem free even with the softest shooting factory ammo. Slide and frame serial numbers match, obviously the barrel does not as it is aftermarket. It does not come with any iron sights as the DPP sits too high on the MOS plate to even see them, so they were removed. The Silencerco threaded barrel and TBRCI comp have about 200 rounds through them and will not be separated from the package. The DPP was installed with loctite (not by me), so if you’re going to want to remove that at any point you’re going to have to heat it up to do so.Please text me at REDACTED for quickest response.  Don't waste my time with trade offers for tv's, xd's, or quads.  Transfer at Brad's"

I just don't have the space needed to use it (I live in town). It's  a ""Big Game/Hunter grade"" crossbow, with the best of everything. Including an amazing $200 ""tact zone"" illuminated crossbow scope.The Guardian anti-dry fire system makes it impossible to dry-fire. This ""compact"" recurve crossbow is used to hunt deer/elk, moose/grizzy bear and even Cape buffalo. Where laws permit crossbow hunting, this bow meets levels required to hunt any big game in the Americas. The power of this weapon is scary."" http://www.bestcrossbowsource.com/?s=matrix+380 "" does a thorough review of this crossbow. You'll need to hit the ""read full post"" button. I have the ""Real tree Xtra"" version, not the all black. I've never seen a negative review on this weapon.Specs:380 fps260 lbs draw weightpower stroke: 13.13""mass weight: 5.9 lbsarrow length: 18 inchesarrow weight: 350 grain minimumtrigger pull: appx. 3 lbsComes with everything it had new (minus 1 arrow). quiver, arrows, manual, instructional DvD, etc.Another cool thing about this crossbow is that it can be ""uncocked"". That eliminates the need to fire your arrow to ""unload"" it. You can't do that with a compound crossbow.I paid $1150 for it. I'm asking $875. Price is for everything. I may consider firearms trade/part trade. Maybe one of these +/- cash:gen3 (or newer) G19MVP (threaded)Mossberg ""shockwave"" Or ?Less likely, but a possibility is an extremely nice rifle scope w/rings or mount (of same or higher value).... maybe other rifle/carbine targeting system, etc.. Possibly high-end binoculars/range finder.... or maybe even high-end body armor.        *********** price $750 cash ******* price is now ******* $650 *******In Vancouver, prefer local FTF. I do have my ""good guy"" card if FFL is needed, it will be a smooth transaction. Please message for more pics, questions or to inspect the crossbow.
