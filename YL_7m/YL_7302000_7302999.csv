It was created by Turkish company Akdal Arms. The MKA 1919 uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be quickly removed from upper receiver. To charge the rifle, the charging handle on the receiver must be pulled. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic rifle has a 5-round detachable box magazine. It has a bolt release identical in location and function to the one on the M16. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip.[1] Standard sights include a front post installed on the M16-style removable base and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. On the upper receiver, an integral Picatinny rail exists which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments."

One gun shoots both calibers. This is a striker fired locked breech pistol with second strike capability (can drop the striker again by simply pulling the trigger again should the first strike fail to ignite a hard primer). Anyone can operate it but it's a great choice for anyone with low hand strength or recoil shyness.  The locked breech doesnt require a heavy recoil spring so operating the slide is very easy, and the slide velocity is lower than a blowback gun so it also tames the already low recoil of the .32 and .380 calibers. People that have shot this gun comment that it feels like shooting a .22 pistol, but of course it makes much bigger holes. In it's niche it stands out the only high capacity locked breech compact .380 available, ideal for carry or plinking and much easier to grasp and control than a subcompact Glock 42 or S&W Bodyguard. The ample grip, low recoil and light weight make this an easy gun for novices to shoot quickly and accurately without flinching.I purchased the extra slide with the original intention of converting it to .32 NAA but a surprise baby has canned that experiment. Pistol includes both .380 and .32 ACP upper assemblies, 2x 12 round .380 magazines and 3x 10 round .32acp magazines. The .380 upper extractor and barrel have been carefully polished to enhance feeding. Prior to polishing these parts FMJ ammunition fed fairly reliably, but HP or FP ammunition would hang up every now and then. After the polishing it's a completely different gun though, it's impossible for me to induce a feed failure with FMJ, FP, or HP ammunition. Feeding is so smooth now that .380 will even feed reliably feed from the .32 acp magazines, and while I wouldnt use the .32 magazines while carrying .380 it does gives you a few more magazines to practice with at the range.Also of note is the Taurus security lock integrated into the gun. Should you wish to disable the pistol while storing it, use the included Taurus security keys to twist the locking cam 180 degrees and the firing mechanism is disabled.I value this gun at $250 for the pistol w/2 .380 mags mags, and $175 for the .32 upper with 3 .32 mags. Additional pictures available on request. Prefer a face to face transaction in North Platte but will ship at buyer's expense. Shipment outside of Nebraska must go to an FFL."

Mauser stamping is clear on top of the upper receiver and on the sides of the lower receiver, all parts (except stock) are original and matching. Mechanically the gun is in good shape and functional, I have fired ~300 rounds through the gun without problems. Rifling in the bore is poor but this is typical for c96s. Included are stripper clips and a reproduction stock. The stock is legal to use with the gun and is detachable (the c96 is specifically exempt from the NFA rules regarding detachable stocks)I also will give you the reloading dies, bullets (~200) and brass (~50) I have (unless you do not need / want them). You can reload for 30 mauser using tokarev brass BUT DO NOT FIRE TOKAREV from the c96. Text at REDACTED or email."

If you want a $600 AK this ins't it so please look elsewhere. Rifle was custom built by local gun smith, the gun is heavy because it's all steel and billet aluminum, it's not a plastic trim package you snap on - gun has quad rails on the front to attach any accessories you want, hinged rail over the bolt to attach an optic without losing zero (because of the hinge point) - hogue grip, upgraded mag release, charging handle, trigger, flip up rear sight, custom built muzzle break to maintain level muzzle while firing, sling points, adjustable stock, upgraded safety with bolt catch, whole thing has duracoat. Probably have less than 500 rounds through this, I invested over $3000 in the gun then lost my place to shoot and found other interests. I know I won't get my money back but need money for a new toy - asking $1600, I WANT IT GONE. Cash, must have proof of legal ownership.

Hunters would slam the gun on the ground when old paper shells would swell in the barrel when the hit in the ground gun would fire and hit the hunter.

If you're looking for the legendary reliability/durability of an AK with the build quality of a top tier AR, then this is it.  The bayonet lug was removed so it's NJ legal.Aside from some very minor handling/safe marks, it's in perfect condition.
