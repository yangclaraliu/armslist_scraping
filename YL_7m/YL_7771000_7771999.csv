I just used it Friday night around the whole neighborhood for a couple hours. It has a new belt that needs to be installed. I took the old one off and then the weather turned and I didn't get the new one on. I just put a new battery in it today and it has been serviced at Rathdrum Motorsports last week. I got it to get rid of the burms that the city leaves but found that it doesn't have the power I need for that. This is perfect for long driveways and sidewalks. I don't have the mower deck but there are plenty of them on CL in the summer. Let me know what you have and maybe we can do a trade or if you want it cash will always work!

It's a black powder shotgun in .410. The gun was distubted by Firearms INT'L CORP in Washington DC. The shotgun was made in Brazil. The gun is in fair to good condition. The wood does have a few nics and one long scratch in it but other wise is very good looking. Barrel does have some rust but nothing too bad. The hammer of the gun does have some marks and cuts out of it but it seem to be funtioning just fine. I have shot the gun a few times and it is an awesome gun. Comes with original metal ramrod. Would be perfect for the black powder enthusiast or someone who wants a little challenge in their next squirrel hunt. I have done a lot of research on this gun and can not find much about it. I only found two guns for sale so I don't really know what the value of this gun is. If you have any questions please text me at REDACTED. I don't use email very much so text is better.
