This shotgun is in excellent condition, just a few very light handling marks on the wood and appears to have seen very careful use. It is completely original, unaltered, and has not been refinished. Receiver and barrel have 100% of the original deep blue with no wear on the high points and edges; no rust anywhere. The walnut stocks have a deep gloss finish with high quality hand checkering. Shotgun is in beautiful condition despite being 50 years old. High quality over under that will be a great skeet or field gun. I will ship via UPS Ground, insured, for $45."

Old gun. Not sure of age. Shows it age for sure tho. I'm not a collector of old colts so if anyone is interested in this shoot me an offer or let me know if there is something you might want to trade out. I'm always interested in good knives, ammo for a 5.56 or 9mm. Contact me if you have any other questions about the gun and I'll be happy to answer them. Thanks for looking."

I've put 500 rounds through it and I clean and maintain the rifle regularly. It’s only been to the range twice. Although you see the rifle with tan accessories, I also still have the original black handgrip, original black buttstock as well as a black Blackhawk vertical grip (see picture). You get everything To do both an all black rifle or a Black and Tan rifle.I'm including everything that you see in the picture, which includes 2 Magpul PMAG mazines, Magpul bipod mount, Magpul rail, bipod, Blackhawk vertical grip (tan and black), black sling, and a Magpul STR butt stock. It also has a Bushnell Dropzone 223 4.5 -18x/40mm with BDC reticles, target turrets and side parallax along with the dust covers and mounted with a Vortex cantilever scope mount. I am including the original hard case that it came with, the original box it shipped in and all manuals and the gun lock. I'm also including the original butt stock. As a sweetener, I'm throwing in 180 rounds of American Eagle 223 ammo, a Gander Mountain tactical bag and the Plano All Weather Tactical case that you see in the picture. That case comes with built in locks and I do have the keys for it.Here’s the deal. I’ve received 2 offers; $850 and $875 for the rifle on $975 listing price. So, i will sell to the first person that can can match or beat the $875 offer and hand over cash first. Essentially, you would need to schedule a time to meet up before them. Also, starting the 11th, I won’t be available Monday through Fridays every week, so if no one schedules this weekend and I get multiple offers during the week, it will come down to the highest bidder and to the first person that can meet me on a weekend.You would need to pay in cash or money transfer via Zelle (it's free if your bank offers it). As a last resort, I can accept credit cards, but you need to pay the $30 in processing fees. I will consider shipping the rifle to a licensed FFL of your choice, but you will need to pay for all of the shipping costs and pay for the rifle in advance and it would need to be paid through Zelle or USPS money order.To complete the sale, you will need to complete a firearms bill of sale that I will provide. There's no background check, but the bill of sale is non negotiable. We must meet in a safe, public place.More information can be found on the Saint by visiting http://www.springfield-armory.com/saint-series/"

Has a Warne steel base bedded to barrel. Also included is a pepper laminate Boyds forend. I want something with more knockdown than this delivered. I have worked up a load and can share what I have shot. I sent the barrel back to MGM to have the chamber deepened because my Remington cases were proud of the barrel and would have head space issues. MGM placed a note on the barrel about needing breech shims with the adjusted chamber. According to the gauges I bought from BellM I did not need to shim. Just want the buyer to be aware of the history. I will take $50 off if you do not want the forend."

It's been my trusted home defense gun for about 6-7 months now, and I'm only selling it because I recently aquired a Scorpion Evo which has taken it's place in the home defense roll. The previous owner barely shot it, and I've put abut 200 rounds through it. The 34 functions flawlessly, and is especially easy to use with the Venom on there. There isn't a scratch on the gun, the Dawson Sights are 3 months old, the Venom works perfectly and just has some wear on the front, and the +5 Baseplate is about a month old and also barely used.

The prices listed above are absolutel CHEAPEST prices I could find everything online, I actually have more money into it than is listed.I'm only asking $800 FIRM for everything, which is a great deal. Not looking for trades right now, would rather use the cash money for Christmas gifts.I'm located in Northville, willing to travel a bit but nothing too crazy.

I bought it as an attempt to get back with my ex husband because our first date was at a shooting range but unfortunately, he is now muslim and does not believe in guns and being 9 months pregnant I really have no use for it. The gun is brand new in case. I put a scope on it, it’s the Leupold mark 8, 3.5-25x56mm illuminated Mil dot long range scope model number M5B2. This is the same exact setup that was used by tactical life magazine in testing this product, you can read more about their review here http://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/sig50-gun-test/#sig50-spread-2 and the video of them shooting it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm0tiFzwhJY Just that scope alone is $5K, the rifle itself IS in fact discontinued, I called Sig Sauer to find out why and it was because making it in Germany cost so much that they discontinued the product due to minimal profits from its production. It is indeed a very high quality product. The bolt feeds nice and cycles effortlessly. It is essentially a modified McMillon TAC 50 A1 with a sig P226 pistol grip for the handle, and while the TAC50 is still being made today, its retail price is over $12K, so asking $12.5K with scope and rings for a brand new one is reasonable, especially because of the fact that it is no longer being produced so the limited number out there will only assure that the value on this rifle will rise. Fun fact: the TAC50 holds the current record for world’s longest sniper killshot at 3871 Yards away, so if precision is what you’re after, this sub-MOA rifle is what you need. I will only show it to people with cash in hand because as I mentioned, I live alone and am very pregnant, so I need to see right away that you are serious about this rifle. With that being said, here is the manufacturer’s specifications sheet:
 
Bolt-action, five-round .50 BMG tactical rifle
Engineered with input from former military snipers
Recoil-mitigating recoil pad and muzzle brake
Removable stock for convenient transport
Match-grade, adjustable trigger can be set to 3.5 lbs.
Sig Sauer has produced quality firearms for military and law-enforcement personnel around the world. This tactical rifle chambared for the powerful .50 BMG cartridge is optimized for superior long-range performance. It was engineered based on input from former military snipers to ensure reliable performance in harsh conditions and repeatable accuracy. A bolt-action design with a five-round metal box magazine, it’s outfitted with a 29"" barrel that features heavy fluting and six-groove 1:15 rifling with a right-hand twist. A side-ported, thread-on muzzle brake helps mitigate this potent gun’s recoil. The bolt is also fluted and equipped with a long bolt handle to ensure proper clearance for mounted optics. Sig50 includes a number of user-customizable features to enhance ergonomics. The cheek rest adjusts vertically, the buttplate is adjustable for length of pull and an ergonomic pistol grip aids shooter control and comfort. Machined M1913 rails allow for solid and repeatable mounting of optics, sighting aids and a bipod (a heavy-duty steel bipod is included). The single-stage adjustable trigger can be set to break cleanly as low as 3.5 lbs. Weather-resistant, anti-glare tan Duracoat coating adds protection from the elements. At just 23.5 lbs. empty, the Sig50 is comparatively light for a .50 BMG gun with magazine capability. The rifle’s overall length is 57"". The stock can be removed to result in an overall length of 46.13"" for enhanced portability."
