It will also come with 5 extra mags and about 170+ rounds of ammo. I paid a little over $1000 for it earlier this year and ive seen that the prices on them have came down some, so if i sell im looking to just recouperate some of my money invested. Im mostly looking to trade for some milsurps. Im really intersted in Mosins, particually non-russian variants such as finn capture guns, polish and chezk M44's but i would not be opposed to nice Russian M44's, M38's, 91/59's, or Mosin Snipers. Its gonna take a couple of rifles to equal in trade value though. Im not opposed to other milsurps I just have a Obsession lol. Trade value is at $1000Feel free to Txt me with offers REDACTED.

The package comes with two windowed P-Mags (have seen some wear) and 90 rounds of ZQI 62 grain 5.56 NATO ammunition. The rifle can easily shoot 2-3 inch groupings at 100 yards with the surplus ammo(I've done it), and definitely less than 2 inch groups possibly even sub moa groups with match grade ammo. I've put about 400 rounds through it with only 1 malfunction and it was because my friend didn't seat the mag properly since the bolt was closed lol. I'm mainly looking for cash, but if you wanna trade something let me know worst I can say is no. Can be a little flexible on price but this is really a killer deal for the price. I can throw in more ammunition for cheap, but it will cost more. I can meet anywhere in the Atlanta area and in Augusta too!Thanks for looking at my post and have a great day!!"

This is a one of a kind KRISS. I have a modified Kriss Folding Arm with a Gear Head Worx Tail Hook Brace professionally pinned and modified to fold just like the KRISS folding stock, but still classified as a Pistol Brace. You won’t find another one like this and to source the parts may be a little hard now since KRISS isn’t selling this stock arm right now. Also have an Inforce 400 lumen Strobe weapon light in FDE attached. It has the side picatinny rail kit, thread protector and I also have a Trijicon MRO with an American Defense mount. It will cone with two 33-round clear mags and one OEM glock 17-round mag and the KRISS hard case. This is a really awesome weapon and at this point, the only reason to even SBR would be to add a vertical grip. I have about $2200 in it with accessories and gunsmithing as is before tax, and the fact that it’s hard to find or create holds a little value as well. Im mainly looking for another sub gun such as a 9mm Sig MPX gen 2, or a Sig MCX .300blk pistol or Sig Rattler. Maybe a modified CZ scorpion pistol with some major upgrades and cash. I am in no rush to sell this or trade. Im not taking a major loss on a cash deal either, so no lowballing. You will be ignored and blocked. I am looking for a $2200 trade and $2,000 cash as is. I may work something out without the MRO. Let me know what you have. You see my value, and I can’t value your guns so please don’t ask me “how much cash to add with your trade.” You do the math. Be serious and fair and I’ll do the same. Serious inquiries only. REDACTED"
