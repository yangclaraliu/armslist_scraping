However, it has what looks like a U.S eagle ( like on a Springfield) on the side of the receiver.Frankly, I do not know what to call it. But it is HUGE, and I mean HUGE. It has a very primitive flintlock type mechanism from what I see. I have never fired nor attempted to. It was a gift from an acquaintance while I was stationed down at Ft Bliss, TX, just outside El Paso. I was told it belonged to the grandfather.The wood is really nice, and I would assume it has been refinished at some point. It also has its cleaning rod. Firing mechanism cocks and dry fires.

My only stipulations are 1) must have a rail, be DA/SA and be in either .40 or .357 sig... (no 9mm. Unless your going to give it to me stupid cheap).  Besides that I don’t care if it is a legacy model, scorpion, enhance delete etc.  I have owned numerous 229‘s.  I currently have one in .357 Sig. The purpose of this gun would be so I could use it on duty so I don’t destroy my other one.  Due to my experience with arms list I must say PLEASE do not waste my time with ridiculous offers. I have attempted this before, and I received Messages from people asking 800 for a used ok condition 226. If I’m going to pay that I would just buy a new one. You can buy a brand new 229R E2 right now for $750. I just looked.... I have my reservations about posting here simply because last time I was flooded with people trying to rip me off. Telling me that they had a higher end model that brand new is $1100. When they clearly had a 226R e2 that brand new is 800$.  If there is handgun I know anything about, it’s SIg P series. I also know where to look to see if the gun is damaged, I will check it, I will pop off the grips, so again please don’t waste my time. I am mainly looking for a 229. However if there is a P226 out there, for the right price I will consider it."

Break free from the wall with our portable, rechargeable battery packs. The Tour 5200 is perfect for keeping your smartphone, tablets, speakers and other USB devices charged. It’s packed with lots of power – enough to give up to 3 extra charges to most smartphones and 1 extra charge to small tablets. Don’t bother with the cheap, no-name battery packs that work for a month and then suddenly die off. The Samsung SDI cells used in Weego Rechargeable Battery Packs ensure you have a charge that’s going to last. The quality lithium-ion battery cells provide 500+ full charge and discharge cycles which means your Weego can last for years. If you’re in the market for a Weego, then safety and performance matter to you. Beware of other products that make unverifiable claims or offer products at steep discounts. Weego’s pocket sized rechargeable battery pack is made with durable, high quality components and built-in circuitry protections to ensure your safety. Weego uses independent labs to verify the quality and performance of the battery packs so you can count on them to work. Each Tour 5200 Rechargeable Battery Pack is pre-charged and comes with a 2′ long micro USB charging cord (Apple users will need to use your own USB cord). To power up, simply connect Weego to your device and press the ‘on’ button. When your Weego needs recharging, power it back up with your wall adapter, car charger or laptop’s USB port. Get a quick charge from any 2.1A charger and save about 30% of the charging time. It’s that simple!

My only stipulations are 1) must have a rail, be DA/SA and be in either .40 or .357 sig... (no 9mm. Unless your going to give it to me stupid cheap). Besides that I don’t care if it is a legacy model, scorpion, enhanced elite etc.  I have owned numerous 229‘s. I currently have one in .357 Sig, along with other p series pistols. Therefore the purpose of this gun would be so I could use it on duty so I don’t destroy my other one......  If You aren’t looking to sell it out right, and you are looking for a little money and a trade.... I have a Sig P320 with Trijicon HD night sites, X Five flat face trigger, five magazines, and two holsters that I have been getting ready to sell.  Due to my experience with arms list I must say PLEASE do not waste my time with ridiculous offers. I have attempted this before, and I received Messages from people asking 800 for a used OK condition 226. If I’m going to pay that I would just buy a new one. You can buy a brand new 229R E2 .40 right now for $685 including my FFL transfer fee. I just looked...if you ask I’ll even tell you the sites I have found it on For anyone trying to pull one over.  I have my reservations about posting here simply because last time I was flooded with people trying to rip me off. Telling me that they had a higher end model that brand new is $1100. When they clearly had a 226R e2 that brand new is 800$. Or they were trying to show me links to cabelas where they are stupidly overpriced. If there is handgun I know anything about, it’s Sig P series. I also know where to look to see if the gun is damaged, I will check it, I will even pop off the grips, so again please don’t waste my time. I am mainly looking for a 229. However if there is a P226 out there, for the right price I will consider it."
