""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Highly praised double action trigger.
Match Grade rifling for increased velocity and accuracy.
Extremely high quality. 100% American Made #MAGA.
Up for sale is a Kahr PM45 with less than 1000 rounds fired through it for only $500! It comes with the original case and two 5-round magazines, plus, I will throw in an extended 7-round magazine and a box of Hornady hollow points for free! That is a $65 value. This firearm is in near mint condition, it has no hidden issues, no rust and the rifling is mint.
This is the “P” series, not the economical “C” series. The P series is extremely underrated and outclasses all other pocket .45’s in terms of size, quality, performance and value.The Barrel: The most important feature on the P series is the Match Grade polygonal rifling, which increases velocity and makes this tiny powerhouse extremely accurate at longer distances. It is machined from a 30” long by 3” diameter proprietary steel billet, and can easily handle +P ammo.The trigger cocking system is unique to Kahr. Pulling the slide back cocks the firing pin half way, and then pulling the trigger brings it back the rest of the way, which gives this gun the smoothest double action trigger you have ever fired. Guaranteed! And the brushed stainless steel trigger is a dream compared to the plastic triggers on lower quality competitors.The Slide: An astounding 1.01 inches wide is machined from a 416 stainless steel bar stock, and laser engraved in beautiful detail.The Slide Stop: is machined from proprietary steel instead of metal-injection molded making it stronger and more durable.
Other Specs:
Caliber: .45 ACP
Capacity: 5+1
Operation: Double Action Only Striker fire
Barrel length: 3.24 inches
Height: 4.49 inches
Weight: 17.3oz
This is a private sale, and I’m willing to meet at a shooting range if you want to test the gun. Please include your phone number when replying to this ad and I will get back to you same day. I can text you extra pictures upon request; Armslist only allows 1. Thanks for looking."

Double/Single action.
2.5 inch barrel..357 Magnum.
Up for sale is a classic Smith and Wesson Model 19-5 six-shot revolver chambered in .357 Magnum. This is a K frame with a 2.5 inch barrel and adjustable rear sight. This firearm was manufactured in the 1980’s. The bore is still nice and shiny and the rifling looks pristine. There is a little bit of holster wear especially on the cylinder, and the trigger and hammer have some coloring. The back of the frame is speckled with some light rust, but it’s not out of control. Overall, I would say that this firearm is in good – excellent condition.
This is a private sale, and I’m willing to meet at a shooting range if you want to inspect and test the gun. Please include your phone number when replying to this ad and I will get back to you same day. I can text extra pictures upon request since Armslist only allows one pic to be uploaded. Thanks for looking."

These barrels cost around $215 and have a pretty long wait time.  It is the TiN coated version, it is very accurate and is not even close to being broken in.  I really would like to sell this local FTF.  If I had to, am willing to ship if it's out of state. In that case you will be responsible for paying whatever the shipping will be and all payments will be done via PayPal if that's the case.  P.S If you are not going to offer me the listed price don't bother messaging me.  I'm not going to take less than what I have this listed for, thanks for taking the time to read this."

The specific model is the H009. I also have a scope mount for it in case you would like to mount a scope on it. It is in like new condition, there is not a mark or scratch on it. I have only used it as a range gun, never taken it in the field and it has been shot around 60 times. I am only selling because we have been seeing hogs on the property I hunt and I would like an AR to hunt them. I have cleaned the firearm after every time it has been shot, ran a lightly covered patch with gun oil on it before storage, then ran a dry patch before I fired it again. I have also used a plastic jag every time I cleaned it to make sure there was never a chance of chipping the rifling. This gun has been meticulously cleaned and taken care of. MSRP is $850 and they are $740 at cabelas. I am asking $640. Email is REDACTED"
