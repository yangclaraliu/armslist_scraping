If you're not familiar with this shotgun, it is essentially the mechanics of an AK47 in a 12ga. It was made in the same Russian factory as the famous Kalashnikov AK47, Izhmash. The Saiga range of firearms is now banned from import, making them increasingly rare and collector items. This isn't ""stock"" for good reasons, including prior regulations that required a certain number of US made parts in order to sell it, home defense upgrades, and improvements to the overall operation. The most striking modification is the Kushnapup stock for home defense; taking the Saiga 12 into a bullpup configuration making it more compact than some SBS (short barrel shotgun) configurations while remaining legal in total length and barrel. An Ultimak Tube Rail from Carolina Shooters Supply was added for accessory/sight options; I have MagPul flip ups on/with it currently. To round out the look and improve performance I added the Tromix Monster Break, which has worked wonderfully for keeping the barrel down during rapid fire. What you don't immediately notice is the TAC47 Auto Plug - this allows you to run any factory 2 3/4in to 3in 12ga shells (""low brass"" to magnum slugs) without any adjustment to the gas system - A known issue to stock Saiga 12s. To round out the gas system performance, a CSS G2 puc was added, smoothing out the action. The thing runs like a dream and I have never once, had a single failure, of any type, with this. Very Good, USED condition, with what many would concider break in wear. - x300 Slugs and x25 00 Buck have been through it.The price includes (2) Promag 10 round Magazines, the original Izhmash 5 round, and (2) MD Arms 20 round drums with both clear and black covers (now discontinued). If sold local I'll also include 100rnds of RIO Royal Buck 00 ""high brass"" rounds, and a Boyt single rifle/shotgun hard case. I don't want to sell it, but with 3 kids now, priorities in life have changed drastically. I'm asking for what I have into it even though I know its ""rare"", banned, and worth much more. I am willing to entertain trades but I'm very picky. The only things different between this and the $3800 setups you see, is they have polished the bcg and welded on a charging handle, both of which are VERY time consuming and not needed at all.Price firm - not willing to part out."

The Premier Series delivers just that. Think of their Premier Series Rifles as an extension to their custom series rifles, but with standardized features for greater efficiencies in parts production and assembly - providing near custom-quality rifles at prices that are affordable to serious shooters. The Premier Series LRP rifle features a Bergara Branded aluminum chassis made in partnership XLR Industries. This Chassis is CNC machined from solid 6061-T6 aluminum and features an AR15 style grip, adjustable length of pull, adjustable comb height, and the butt plate can be canted to give a precise fit to the shooter in virtually any shooting position. What makes this rifle so special you may ask? Well, Bergara uses Premium 416 stainless steel barrels, which receive a proprietary honing process at their barrel-making facility, at which point they continue through another four stages of production to produce the most accurate production barrel they could possibly make. Upon completion, the barrel receives a Cerakote finish and is coupled with the Bergara Premier action. This process is completed at their facility in Lawrenceville, GA USA. The Bergara LRP weighs around 10 pounds, comes with an AICS detachable five-round magazine, a Timney 517 flat trigger, as well as a Talley 20 MOA rail. The LRP rifle also come standard with threaded muzzles (5/8x24). Barrel lengths range from a 20"" barrel on the .308, 24"" on the 6.5 Creedmoor, and 26"" on the 6mm Creedmoor. It has a guaranteed capability of producing sub-1.0 MOA  or better groups at 100 yards with factor match grade ammunition. Every Premier Series Rifle is qualified for accuracy prior to leaving their facility. Each rifle must shoot three consecutive 3-shot groups, all sub-1.0 MOA to qualify. Once completed, they included a copy of the target itself, as well as the information on the factory load used, the date, and the shooter who qualified this rifle.
