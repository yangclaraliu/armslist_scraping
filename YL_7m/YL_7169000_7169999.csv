The story I got when purchased was these were West German Olympic Games guns, seemed to make sense as who would have 3. I had not tried to do the research , didn't care at the time. I believe the gun was produced in the 50's. I'm not an Olympic class shooter, but believe with this gun I could be. Early front & rear sights, low serial#s on gun & conversion & all matching. The 22LR Conversion Unit has its own serial number range, considering it's age. Barrel and Slide numbered together.The 9mm gun, frame, barrel, slide, and trigger pack are numbered the same. I believe the 22LR Conversion Unit and the gun are selected for their inherent accuracy."

Don't email me asking if its still available, if the ads up it is.DESCRIPTION BELOW IS FROM SIG'S WEBSITE:The P938 SAS Micro-Compact has undergone a radical dehorning process resulting in an ultra smooth, snag free profile that's ideal for concealed carry. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame and a polished and engraved stainless steel slide. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters."

Stick to the 10 round mags because they are pretty reliable and the follower, fit, and spring are all better suited to work with the rifle platform and the rimfire ammo it shoots. If you stick to the 10 round magazines you will have no issues with the rifle, no guarentees with the 15 round mags however because I have never tried them.

From what i can tell elcan only released maybe 5 to 10 of the 230a 7.62 compared to the 230 5,56 which is around 250 to 500. Elcan had to halt release of the su230a bc socom request for more scopes on scar17. At the momment mines the only one for sale in the world. Two just sold on gb for 2600 and 2800 which were first ones sold in years. The su-230a is WAY different and better than civilian model. First its way tougher, nextn reticle is the chrismas tree instead of big circles, each scope is specially colored earth. It can submerge longer etc......civilian is junk compared to the su230s. These are becoming impossible to find, i found a pistol i really want thus why i dropped.the price for quicket sale. Scope is used and shows wear but works fine its a tank. All parts function. Is missing rain sights which can be bought for 65. Text me at eight three 2 nine 40 8277. Price is pretty firm at $2000 which is a steel"
