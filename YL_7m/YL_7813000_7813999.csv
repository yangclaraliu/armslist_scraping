The Friction Loc Baton is constructed of 4140 seamless steel tubing is not commercially available in the United States. As a result, ASP must have a special chemistry or heat of steel poured in Germany and then pierced into rounds. This raw stock is then drawn by an American company into tubing that is fabricated to ASP specifications. As a result, ASP is the sole source of 4140 steel tubing for expandable batons. ASP 4140 is 25% stronger than more commonly available 4130 tubing. The Friction lock also features a Black Chrome finish which is a state of the art black finish for steel surfaces. It is a true black plating, not a paint. As a result, it is extremely hard and will not scratch. Black Chrome will not rust as do other surface treatments. It is exceptionally durable and does not flake or peel. Black Chrome offers deep, rich, black corrosion protection.""Minor wear to paint. Minor putting in head from use. Fully functional."

The Friction Loc Baton is constructed of 4140 seamless steel tubing is not commercially available in the United States.

This raw stock is then drawn by an American company into tubing that is fabricated to ASP specifications. As a result, ASP is the sole source of 4140 steel tubing for expandable batons. ASP 4140 is 25% stronger than more commonly available 4130 tubing. The Friction lock also features a Black Chrome finish which is a state of the art black finish for steel surfaces. It is a true black plating, not a paint. As a result, it is extremely hard and will not scratch. Black Chrome will not rust as do other surface treatments.
