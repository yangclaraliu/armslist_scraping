Hated it right out of the box, but kept shooting it and after 100 or so rounds it's a reliable and accurate little all-metal pistol. It's by far the best pistol I've ever purchased at this price point.Can you find one for less on Gunbroker? Absolutely. But you'll pay $30 to ship it to a FFL, who will charge you $25 or more to transfer it. So it will really cost you at least $55 more than the listed price. And if the seller's in-state, add another 6%-7% for sales tax, depending your county of residence.The R51 has a unique design. Unlike the 100 or more functionally identical polymer ""tilting-barrel"" semi-auto pistols on the market, the R51 incorporates a ""Pederson block"" to  create a ""delayed-blowback"" action.If you collect firearms with unique technologies, this is the pistol for you.THE PERFECTED REMINGTON R51.POINT INSTINCTIVELY. RECOVER INSTANTLY.Re-engineered from the ground up and thoroughly tested to deliver ultimate reliability, the R51 gets you on target faster and more intuitively than any other subcompact on the market. Add 25% less muzzle flip and a sleek, ergonomic design, and it’s exactly what you need to shoot your best in worse-case scenarios. Chambered for 9mm Luger with a 7-round magazine capacity.A proud reintroduction of a truly groundbreaking design, the perfected Remington R51 has been re-engineered from the ground up and thoroughly tested to deliver utmost reliability, and the highest level of shootability of any subcompact handgun on the market today. Because it has the lowest bore axis in its class, its intuitive accuracy is unrivaled. The low bore axis also reduces muzzle rise by 25% for faster recovery between shots. Its Pederson block design and optimized grip angle work together to dramatically diminish felt recoil. With a 3.4” barrel and smooth, rounded edges, it conceals easily and deploys like lightning. And it all comes with a confidence-boosting 7+1 rounds of 9mm Luger. Updated features include a precision-built fast-reset polymer trigger, a more aggressive and durable extractor design, enhanced recoil spring and a host of other features that make it the model of dependability.KEY FEATURES* Less muzzle rise and reduced felt recoil* Light slide racking force* Optimized grip angle and slim aluminum frame* 9MM +P match-grade 3.4” barrel* Light, smooth and crisp trigger* Two semi-flush 7+1 magazines"

I have put a few hundred rounds through them and they are just broken in. This is an awesome little combo. They share mags (which I have 6 of total with a LULU speed loader) that hold 30 rnds each. The pistol is one of the lightest pistols made. What other self defense pistol holds 30 rnds and weighs a few ounces. It has been one of my favorite carry guns because you hardly know its on you and has more rounds than anything else. I have the threaded parrel for it and the plate for the top to use a red dot or some kind of optic. I had a a Trijicon RMR on it (which due to the expense didn't make any sense to sell with it.) The CMR-30 Carbine weighs hardly anything and is a bullpup design so even though it is technically a 16"" barrel it feels much shorter. And unlike an AR style rifle this has a sweet sliding stock to make it super light and packable. I have added a Magpul foregrip and Magpul folding sights. I am also including a brand new simmons .22 matched scope. The scope is pretty key... it is pretty matched in balistics to the round and has tactical turrets. It is super light to keep this doing what it does best, move fast and light. It would be pretty sick with a QR mount. I have one that I can include for $100. I have original boxes and papers for both and the scope which is brand new. Ther eis also a very high end super nice GOULD custom leather holster for the pistol. I have a bunch of ammo for this. Several hundred rounds that I will include, mostly Critical Defense Ammo. If you are not familiar with this wicked little .22 WMR round you are missing out. It chambers a 30-50 grain bullet flying at 1500-2400 FPS with over 300 footpounds. In other words that is almost the performance of a 5.56 in a much lighter smaller package and a handgun! It is twice as fast as a 9mm. Not to mention this round has virtually no recoil. I can get off 6 shots to my 9mm's three. In other words, twice as many rounds down range and both the carbine and pistol are crazy accurate. I have won many competitions with this handgun right out of the box. The other selling point is that you could carry 1000 rounds in just a few pounds if you ever needed to. Add a suppressor to them and they are movie quiet for CHEAP!I would like to sell everything for $1000Trades considered for an HK 9mm, S&W Custom Center firearms, Nightforce optics, or towards a Barrett .50RYAN 2629zero31887"

Rifle is MOA or better with I think everything I’ve shot.   6.8 is a very versatile hunting round from prairie dogs, to coyote, to deer, to bear, and even elk.   I’ve put about 100 rounds down range with this, mostly 90 gr bullets for deer hunting, which was half MOA.  Scope and mount are NOT included.   The only reason I am selling is this is my 3rd 6.8 SPC, and I am looking to scale back.   I’ve got quite a bit invested, and know I won’t make it all out, but not looking to lose a fortune, so now lowballs.   The piston upper is awesome for the simple fact you can easily adjust for full gas, suppressed gas, or completely off.  Reasonable offers will be considered.  Must have a Nebraska CCW or handgun purchase permit, and be willing to sign a bill of sale.   No shipping, and prefer face to face meting in Kearney.  I do sometimes travel to Omaha and Lincoln, but I will not hold it unless you send funds and confirm you’re a real buyer.   Any questions, or if you want to see additional pictures, please let me know.   If you inquire about shipping to your FFL, I will not respond and simply delete the email.
