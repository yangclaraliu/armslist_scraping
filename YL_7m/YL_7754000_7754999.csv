There have been 0 issues with feeding/firing since the conversions were done. For those that may not know, this is the rifle that can be converted into the very popular G36, UMP, and Xm8 prototype.Modifications: ($750 worth, all professionally installed. These are the most important modifications for this rifle. The stock rifle can only feed from single stack magazines that are very costly and unpractical)- AR-15 Magwell (professionally installed to allow the rifle to accept AR-15 magazines)- Real German G36 complete Bolt Group (allows the rifle to flawlessly feed from double stack AR-15 magazines)- Lower receiver dyed black (I was planning on converting this into a G36)This is a fantastic rifle to add to any collection.

The slide was professionally done at FailZero in Florida. The slide has had ZERO rounds through it since it was recoated last month. There was a very small discrepancy with the slide the first time it had been done that FailZero honored with their warrenty program so it was sent back and redone and it looks perfect. It will require a 100 round break in period before I would suggest carrying it for an EDC as it may jam until those 100 round are through. This is from FailZero's website - I did the 100 round break in period with the last coating and had 3 total failures. All in all this glock has less than 500 rounds through it. The barrel is OEM but has been polished and accents the slide very nicely. The Glock comes with everything pictured MINUS the RYG Phantom Trigger. The trigger has been sold.  - Please do not contact me to ask questions if you aren't interested in buying or if you are going to offer something other than the asking price, if your budget is 200 bucks go buy a brick or a high point, if you want a cheap Glock go buy a beat up one and it's still gonna go for more.

The Belgium Brownings were made from 1956 to 1967.  Thereafter, the guns are made in Japan by Miroku.  The 7 in the serial number stands for 1967, and the T means it shoots long-rifle ammo.  This info can be found on the internet if you google Date Your Firearm-Browning.  It shoots .22 long rifle ammo only.   It is pictured with a Leupold FX-2, 4x33 fixed-power scope on a Redfield mount, with Leupold magnetic, flip-open scope covers.    The scope remains attached to the barrel when the gun is broken down for storage or cleaning, and the point of impact remains the same.  This was a special-order gun. The barrel was drilled and tapped at the factory to accept the base and rings.  I am the original owner, and the gun has been very well maintained.  It shows some handling wear, which is to be expected.  There is no visible rust, and the bluing is immaculate.  It is a pleasure to shoot, and is very accurate.  I will sell the gun as a package for $700, with the scope and ring mount, or just the gun with mount, for $500, if you would like to add your own scope.  It uses 1 inch rings. This is a lifetime gun that would be a wonderful starter firearm for a new shooter, young person, or collector. $500"

Firearm is in very nice shape as you can see from the pictures. If you have any questions please email or text. Prefer no trades but may accept firearms and cash.
The Colt Bisley was introduced in 1894 as a target pistol. The name Bisley came from the famous firing range in Bisley, England. The Colt Bisley can be distinguished by the longer grip, the wider hammer spur, and the wider trigger. The distinguishing feature of the Bisley Target Model is the topstrap, which is flat and fitted with a sliding rear sight, adjustable for windage only. The front sight is a removable blade, which fits into the slotted base attached to the barrel. The revolvers were supplied with different blades for elevation.
The Bisley mainspring is longer than the SAA mainspring, and the two are not interchangeable; it is attached to the hammer with a stirrup via a forked upper end. The serial numbers are stamped on the frame, the backstrap and the trigger-guard at the end of production, with tiny dies. 
Bisleys were serial-numbered in the range of 156300–331916, in the same sequence as the Single Action Army. All Bisleys after No. 161,376 had ""BISLEY MODEL"" with the caliber stamped on the left side of the barrel, which is rare for older Colt revolvers. The most common calibers were .32-20, .38-40, .45 Colt, .44-40, .41 Colt, and the British calibers .450 Eley and .455 Eley. A total number of 44,350 were manufactured. Production of the Bisley was terminated in 1912, but serial No. 331916 was shipped after the First World War. Most Bisley Standard Model Revolvers shipped to a United States address were not used for target shooting, but for self-defense, because the grip and hammer were ideal for fast shooting."

Firearm is in very nice shape as you can see from the pictures. If you have any questions please email or text.  Prefer no trades but may accept firearms and cash.
 
The Colt Bisley was introduced in 1894 as a target pistol. The name Bisley came from the famous firing range in Bisley, England. The Colt Bisley can be distinguished by the longer grip, the wider hammer spur, and the wider trigger. The distinguishing feature of the Bisley Target Model is the topstrap, which is flat and fitted with a sliding rear sight, adjustable for windage only. The front sight is a removable blade, which fits into the slotted base attached to the barrel. The revolvers were supplied with different blades for elevation.
The Bisley mainspring is longer than the SAA mainspring, and the two are not interchangeable; it is attached to the hammer with a stirrup via a forked upper end. The serial numbers are stamped on the frame, the backstrap and the trigger-guard at the end of production, with tiny dies. 
Bisleys were serial-numbered in the range of 156300–331916, in the same sequence as the Single Action Army. All Bisleys after No. 161,376 had ""BISLEY MODEL"" with the caliber stamped on the left side of the barrel, which is rare for older Colt revolvers. The most common calibers were .32-20, .38-40, .45 Colt, .44-40, .41 Colt, and the British calibers .450 Eley and .455 Eley. A total number of 44,350 were manufactured. Production of the Bisley was terminated in 1912, but serial No. 331916 was shipped after the First World War. Most Bisley Standard Model Revolvers shipped to a United States address were not used for target shooting, but for self-defense, because the grip and hammer were ideal for fast shooting."
