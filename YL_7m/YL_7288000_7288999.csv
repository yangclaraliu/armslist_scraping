These have the barrel mounted low. Zero recoil, even less than a standard .22 pistol due to low bore axis. Extremely accurate. Barrel has a threaded plug that holds it in. For those with suppressors, you can buy a $30 adaptor and use a suppressor with it without needing higher sights due to the position of the barrel. Barrel length is 6"". Gun is in overall good condition with a few small blemishes here and there but no major damage. Really an excellent gun for the range. Discontinued by Smith because it was more accurate than the ""target model"" gun they were selling at the time that cost twice as much. I'm asking $300 cash obro. Located in Red Bank. No box but includes one 10 round magazine. 12 rounders can be had for not a lot of money. Will meet within reason."

Press the tailcap switch for momentary-on low, press further to click constant-on low, return to off and press or click on again within two seconds for high. The tough Nitrolon polymer body is smoothly sculpted for a comfortable, secure grip and resists scratches, abrasion, and corrosion. A polycarbonate micro-textured reflector delivers a comparatively wider beam with generous peripheral light. We also make an aerospace aluminum-body version of this light, the 6PX Pro, and a single-output version with a tactical tailcap switch, the G2X Tactical. Features: – Virtually indestructible LED emitter regulated to maximize light output and runtime– Two output levelshigh for maximum light, low for extended runtime– Precision micro-textured reflector creates smooth, optimized beam– Tough polycarbonate window resists impact– Tough Nitrolon body, anodized aluminum bezel– Dual-output tailcap click switchpress for momentary-on low, click for constant-on low, return to off then press or click again for high– Weatherproof O-ring and gasket sealed Specifications: – Output / Runtime, White Light– High: 320 Lumens / 2 Hours– Low: 15 Lumens / 45 Hours– Tactical Runtime: 2.5 Hours– Length: 5.20″– Bezel Diameter: 1.25″– Weight with Batteries: 4.4 oz– Batteries: 2 – 123A (Included) 0 Color: Black"

This firing pin is much better than the stock firing pin and it eliminates the potential problem of the slam Fire or the firing pin sticking in the strike position which can make the rifle fire uncontrollably automatic emptying your entire magazine. That had cost me $70. Also bought a flash hider to replace the launcher nozzle. Included will be the extra flash hider and the original firing pin.
