I'm sorry to sound harsh in this listing, but there are too many scammers and fake buyers. I've learned the hard way.The P320 is a modular polymer-framed service pistol designed from the ground up with the input of law enforcement officers. Featuring a serialized stainless steel frame with a polymer grip module and a removable fire control assembly pioneered by Sig Sauer the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement using interchangeable components (sold separately). The P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to disassemble the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. With a partially pretensioned striker it has a crisp trigger pull with a quick pronounced reset. The P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. It has an ambidextrous slide catch lever and a reversible magazine release for full ambidextrous operation. The P320 Compact comes with the medium size black grip module with a Mil-Std M1913 Picatinny rail. It is available with contrast sights or SigLite night sights.

In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92 and 99 9mm pistols. Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame won't crack or allow the slide to come off. When Taurus made the first PT-92, they didn’t copy or reverse-engineer the Beretta Model 92F as is sometimes believed. Instead, they bought Beretta’s entire Brazilian factory with its machinery, parts and plans. They even kept Beretta’s trained workers at their stations. Beretta’s and Taurus’ designs have evolved in divergent ways since 1980, and the two pistols now share very few parts in common. But they still share the same lineage and (almost) the same manual of arms. Other innovations include a three position frame mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked and locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.

I have two guns that never get used so I'm looking to fund/find other projects. First is a Winchester 94 30-30 made in the 70s. It is in good condition, with some minimal dents/scratches on the wood but no splitting or cracks. It has a great bore and is very accurate. Unsure of the round count as I got it used. It comes with 92 factory loaded rounds (58 Hornady LeverEvolution, 20 Herters, and 14 Remington Core-lokt), a B-square side-mounted scope mount with rings, a cheap 4x scope, and case. I had previously posted this Winchester, but the deal fell through.Second is a lightly used Ruger LCPII. I bought this new 1 year ago and shot 100 rounds before putting it away. It is much easier to shoot than the original LCP, in my opinion. It comes with the box, 1 6-round mag with both flat and pinky rest baseplates, pocket holster, factory papers/etc. I am located in the Greensboro area towards High Point, but I also frequent the Raleigh area.

I have replaced five things on this rifle: I removed the Midwest Industries gas block and gas tube and installed a Geissele Super Gas block and melonited gas tube. I also removed the Midwest Industries brake and installed an A2 flash hider. Last thing I did was removed the mil-spec trigger and installed a Geissele SSA. Also I repaced the regular charging handle with a BCM Gunfighter Mod5. Comes with factory box and all paperwork including 10rd pmag. I'm only selling to fund another project.

Local sale only. Buyer must provide valid ID/ CCW. Thanks!With its 14"" barrel and compact 26.4"" overall length, the Remington 870 TAC-14 is extremely maneuverable and delivers plenty of 12 gauge stopping power. Built on the proven, all-steel 870 receiver, the little TAC-14 is handy in tight places, especially where there isn’t enough room to effectively use a full-sized shotgun. It’s even compact enough to make a dandy truck gun.The 870 TAC-14 sports a ""bird’s head"" Shockwave Raptor pistol grip that helps take the bounce out of recoil, ensuring you have excellent control of the gun, shot after shot. Rounding out the TAC-14 is a Magpul® MOE® forend with M-LOK accessory-mounting points, plus extended front and rear handstops that further enhance your control of the TAC-14.NO NFA registration or tax stamp required!Chambered for 2-3/4"" and 3"" shotshells and slugsFixed chokeDurable reinforced polymer stockBead front sightThe Remington 870 TAC-14 is not classified as a “shotgun,” “short barrel shotgun,” or “any other weapon” under the NFA, so it is not subject to federal Class 3/NFA firearms restrictions and is simply classified as a “pump-action firearm.” This is because its overall length is greater than 26"", and it is not capable of being shouldered, meaning the TAC-14 can be purchased without an ATF NFA registration or tax stamp. State and local restrictions may still apply."
