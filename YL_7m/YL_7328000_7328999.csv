I will sell the ammo separately, but sell the rifle only with the ammo as a package deal. I don't have anything else in 30.06 so if I sell the rifle the ammo does me no good.  Sorry for any confusion. Thanks,Tadfor sale is a 1944 Springfield Armory M1 Garand. It was rebuilt in 1966 by the Marine Corps and put into storage. These USMC rebuilds are highly sought after. This was a CMP service grade rifle and comes with the hard case and all the paperwork. All major components are Springfield Armory- the barrel,bolt,op rod and trigger group. The smaller internals etc. Im not knowledgeable enough to tell. It comes with approximately 1381 rounds of 30.06 ammo- I counted it but may be off a couple of rounds plus or minus. There are 443 rounds of HXP Greek surplus loose in an ammo can, 40 enbloc clips loaded with HXP, 7 bandoliers with 6 clips each loaded with HXP and 210 rounds of new production PPU. I also have 72 rounds of Winchester 150 grain XP deer ammo and 2 clips of old blank ammo- the blanks are probably NOT safe to fire they would be for display only. It also comes with a bayonet. I know that's a lot of ammo but I used to have 4 M1's- this is my last,and best one. I'm getting out of the mil-surp rifle thing. I paid an average of .68 a round and am selling it for .60. You're getting all the ammo cans, enblocs and bandoliers with the cardboard inserts free.   I will sell the ammo separately if you're interested but won't sell the rifle without the ammo. This is a once in a lifetime chance to buy a classic collectible m1 with everything you need to have a great collection and enough ammo to shoot the snot out of it! For sale face to face only at my office in Dixie Manor. ID and signature on a sales receipt required.  Ky. Resident only. My only trade interest would be a Smith and Wesson AR10sorry for the long post but there's a lot here."

The barrels on these blowback uppers are simply threaded in with loctite. They do not require the specialized tools of a standard AR upper to be rebarrelled. Exactly 50 rounds have been put through this upper. It includes two 50 round magazines, one of them fully loaded. I will also include a 30 round 5.56 magazine that has had the feed lips removed. Since the upper ejects through the magwell, this makes an excellent brass catcher and can hold a full 50 round magzine's worth of brass before dumping. The Aimpoint PRO in the photos is not included with the upper. I left it on to show how well it fits this upper. Will trade for: Quality revolvers Sig Sauer handguns"

The barrels on these blowback uppers are simply threaded in with loctite. They do not require the specialized tools of a standard AR upper to be rebarrelled. Exactly 50 rounds have been put through this upper. It includes two 50 round magazines, one of them fully loaded. I will also include a 30 round 5.56 magazine that has had the feed lips removed. Since the upper ejects through the magwell, this makes an excellent brass catcher and can hold a full 50 round magzine's worth of brass before dumping. The Aimpoint PRO in the photos is not included with the upper. I left it on to show how well it fits this upper. Will trade for: Quality revolvers Sig Sauer handguns"

THANKS!)FOR SALE: (List of everything included)> A very Nice 9mm (double action) Taurus PT-709 Slim handgun.> Three, 7 round magazines (One has an added grip extender).> Hard shell holster (for OWB belt & molded to precisely fit the 709 slim).> Mini tool with 2 functions: to adjust the sightes and the other to enable/disable the safety feature that locks the slide completely.> Around 50+ rounds of ammo.> A ""Hopp's cleaning kit (with tools, cleaning attachments, clothes and lubricants.> Eye protection/safety glasses.> Ear protection headset.> A zip up handgun tote (with dual compartments, it is NOT A Taurus brand bag).> The original Taurus box.DETAILS: *It is equipped with 3 safety features, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind, (One of the best selling points for me): The locking slide mechanism -(on/off using the mini tool) on the ride side, a built in trigger/finger safety, and lastly the more commonly found (flip up/down) switch on the left side. *I purchased the grip extender added to one of the magazine's. I actually prefer it better than the stock mag alone. It can be take off if you dont prefer it. The mags are single stack.*The hard shell molded case is very nice- fits like a glove. Made of very sturdy material, and has a belt loop attachment, (for wearing on your right and out of waistband).PERFORMANCE: (IMHO)*All-in-all I have fired about 2000 rounds through it, and it has never once locked up, jammed or malfunctioned. Its a consistant and accurate peice. An every day carry gun in my opinion. I have absolutely no doubts about its performance, or its reliability. I have taken the time to clean the gun after every use. So it has been well cared for.THE TAURUS BRAND AND SIMILARITIES:*If you are at all familiar with Glock, the PT-709 Slim would be VERY much like a close cousin to the Glock 43. Nearly identical in size and almost the same weight. They do have a similar, yet slightly different ""feel"" when firing, as I have owned both the 709 slim, and the G43 at the same time. The only difference being that the Glock is only equipped with one safety (trigger), as opposed to the 709 having the 3 mentioned above.MY INFO:*My name is Natalie. *I am located in Gastonia. Which is where I am willing to meet the interested party. I am about 20 minutes outside of Charlotte. *My #: REDACTED *Feel free to TEXT or CALL me if you are interested! $$$$$$$$ PRICE $$$$$$$$*Asking $325 firm- (everything mentioned is included)Thank you & God Bless!-Natalie"
