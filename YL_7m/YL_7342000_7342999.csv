There has been much speculation as to why this rifle was built and which company built it., The SSG 82 actually has been specifically designed for use in the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) to stop the import of police sniper rifles from non-socialist countries and military sniper rifles from socialist countries., ""Design details.,"" The Scharfschützengewehr 82 was technically based on the Suhler Kleinkalibergewehr Modell 150 Standard .22 Long Rifle (5.6 mm) caliber small bore competition rifle.[2] This makes the SSG 82 design reminiscent of a European-style small bore competition rifle. The heart of the SSG 82 is a cold-hammer forged receiver and free-floating barrel with a semi-bull profile and features a target crown. The bolt has four locking lugs and requires a 60-degree bolt rotation to cycle the gun.[1] The safety consist of a sliding safety actuated by rotating a small disk positioned at the right side just above the trigger.[1] The two-stage trigger mechanism displays an adjustable trigger pull of 3 to 4 N (0.7 to 0.9 lbf).[1] The detachable 5-round box magazine is based upon center feeding for maximum reliability as well as precise positioning of the cartridge into the chamber.[1] The magazine release is located on the bottom right behind the magazine well. The SSG 82 wooden stock resembles that of the Small bore Standard rifle 150 with a raised comb and a stippled pistol grip and forearm. The butt plate is adjustable for length of pull by adding or removing spacers and height. The rifle has no iron sights but is equipped with a 4×32 telescopic sight (""Ziel4/S"" 4×32 scope, reticle 1) with mounting rails made by VEB Zeiss Jena (in the original Zeiss plant that was captured by the Soviets at the end of WWII) which is numbered to the rifle and mounted using a quick detachable Suhler claw mountbase.[3] This was a basic model of the VEB Zeiss Jena telescopic sight line as 6×36, 6×42M, 8×56M and variable 1.5–6×39, 1.5–6×42M and 3–12×56M magnification variants were also available. The Zeiss Jena non-M telescopic sight models had elevation correction and focusing turrets and were due to the lack of a windage correction turret corrected for windage by a gunsmith during mounting, hence these sights were dedicated to a particular rifle. Internet sources report differing information regarding the attainable accuracy of fire, though the quality of the ammunition used is often mentioned as a very important factor in obtaining good accuracy. Reports on the accuracy of the rifle is one hole 5-shot groups at 100 mm,."" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------., For Sale is a New Scharfschützengewehr 82 (SSG 82) or ""Sharpshooter's Rifle, 82"" is a rifle chambered in the 5.45×39mm Soviet cartridge built in East Germany., Wood stock and ""Ziel4/S"" 4×32 scope and serial number to the gun S#0541., and Two 5-Round Magazines., Action is nice and tight Locks up solid., The bore is nice & bright., Excellent condition as NEW, The SSG 82 Is in PERFECT working condition., See pics for condition., Please email me with any questions If you are a Collector this beauty will make a fine addition., I Must ship to an FFL license holder., I am require to have a copy of FFL license to ship., NO FAX, I do Not have A FAX #., A Email Copy of FFL License is OK., If your FFL holder will not provide a copy of his license please do not bid.

The inside of the right grip is dated 1986. The product code on the box dates 1985. The holster is for a model 624-3"" which is also a Lew Horton limited production gun that was made 1985-1987. The gun is likely manufactured 1986. Caliber: .44 Magnum Action Type: 6-Shot, Single And Double Action Revolver with Swing-Out Fluted Cylinder. The product code on the box is reported as unfluted. This is unverified according to our edition of the Standard Catalog. Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked “SMITH & WESSON”. The right side of the barrel is marked “44 MAGNUM"". The yoke cut is marked with the serial and model number and the yoke is marked ""S D 14 / 7X8X8"". The right side of the frame is marked with the four line Marcas Registradas address, the right side plate has S&W’s monogram logo. The left side of the grip frame is marked “7X8X8 / D14 / F1”, the butt has the serial number. The right side of the grip frame is marked ""Y"" in circle, ""7619"" and ""D"" in triangle. Barrel Length: 3” Sights / Optics: The front sight is a ramp blade with an orange insert. The rear sight is a square notched, white outlined leaf in a S&W micrometer click base that is adjustable for windage and elevation. Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are wood Combat with S&W medallions. The wood is high grain and beautiful. There is a nice gloss finish. The grips don't appear to have any chips or cracks. Any light sanding marks under the finish are likely factory in our opinion. The grips rate in Excellent overall condition. Type of Finish: Stainless Finish Originality: Original Bore Condition: The bore is mostly bright and the rifling is sharp. There is no erosion in the bore. There is some old powder / stubborn fouling that should scrub out with some patience. Overall Condition: This handgun retains about 98% of its metal finish. The cylinder has an extremely light drag line, most would not mention it. No evidence of long term use is found, a few general handling marks and rubbing wear from normal operation is seen. The metal to metal fit is flush. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are Clear. Overall, this handgun rates in about Excellent condition. Mechanics: The action functions correctly. We did not fire this handgun. As with all used firearms, a thorough cleaning may be necessary to meet your maintenance standards. Box, Paperwork & Accessories: Included is a S&W cleaning kit (it appears to be for a 44, we have our reserve about the size of the bore brush looks like it will barely work). There is an assortment of paperwork and the wax paper is present in the box as well. The best part is the S&W model BLW-624 leather holster. This holster was made specially for the S&W 1985 Limited Edition Model 624-3"" Stainless .44 Special Combat. Yes this revolver is a 629-1 and not the 624, however there was overlap in production during this time and the BLW-624 was likely offered for this revolver as well. Our Assessment: This gun sure has sparked this writers interest in the original production and procedures at the factory. Looking at the model number and configuration we can assume the gun was manufactured 1986-1987 as one of 8,000 manufactured with a round butt and 3"" barrel, distributed by Lew Horton and S&W. The product code on the factory box tells us that the gun is a 3"" RB (round butt) manufactured in 1985 with 5,000 manufactured. The Standard catalog goes on to note that these revolvers were reported to be unfluted with smooth finger groove grips. This note is unverified by the author. Obviously this revolver is fluted, and the inside of the grips date to 1986, so a little different then what the Standard Catalog has. If things didn't get more interesting, our consignor purchased the holster with the gun. The Holster is for a 624 NOT a 629. However there were some years of overlap in the 80's during the manufacture of both pistols, especially by Lew Horton. It is more then likely the only holster made at the time by S&W that would fit the 629 3"" was the 624 3"" holster. After all, both guns were in production at the same time and the only difference we can tell would have been the product code on the box. We wish we could have found the serial number prefix ""ANC"" tied to either production, just a note that revolvers produced 1986-1987 had it. This is an awesome revolver that sure has an interesting place in S&W manufacturing history."

Has some holster wear and trigger guard is brushed steel (black poly-coat is gone) -- used to be my daily carry.  Pistol is in Very Good Condition but priced to sell at Fair condition price.  See the pix I've loaded. I have more pix if you're interested.  CZ-82 is SA/DA, semi-automatic pistol with a conventional blowback action that lets the barrel remain solidly fixed to the frame, which gives you improved accuracy over pistols with pivoting barrels (like M1911 type pistols). Low bore axis has less muzzle rise and gives you quicker follow-up shots. It has ambidextrous thumb safety and magazine releases and was the first service pistol to feature both these features in the world! Chrome plated bore gives it longer barrel life, rust resistant and easy to clean. Pistol has polygonal rifling so there are no grooves to wear out or get caked up. This pistol is still in use by the Czech Reserve Forces (Active Duty folks get the CZ 75).  This baby is priced to sell - no gimmicks -- no price gouging. I will work with you on Shipping and FFL Transfer if out of area."

Import; with two (2) 6rd mags; 9x18mm (Makarov) cartridge. DA blowback design and replaced the Polish Police and Military TT style pistols.  No secrets here -- This pistol has a harsh recoil caused by its relatively small size and the potent 9×18mm Makarov round, but Wolff Gunsprings produces a 22 lb recoil spring (get one for about about $22) that will greatly reduce the recoil when compared to the original recoil spring. This pistol is designed for steel case ammo (inexpensive to shoot), but brass works just as well.  There are many after-market grips/grip sleeves that may help reduce perceived recoil.  She's all steel and made to take a beating -- weighs 22 oz, and has a 3.3-inch barrel, 6.3 inches long and 4.3 inches high -- great for CCW -- easy to put inside a waistband, on ankle or pocket conceal.  Effective 25 yard range perfect for ""close-up"" engagment (that's what pistols are for -- right?) Muzzle velocity is 1,001 fps (with conventional 95gr rounds).  There are several quality HP rounds for this pistol making it a very good addition to a collection or arensal for CCW/personal protection. No gimmicks or price gouging - she's priced to sell.  Look at the pix -- I have more pix if you're interested. I will work with you on Shipping and FFL Transfer if out of area."
