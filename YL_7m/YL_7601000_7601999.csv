This rifle is like new and has only had around 20 rounds ran through it. A Pentax Lightseeker 3-9x43 sits on top of Leupold bases and rings. The scope has a heavy duplex reticle and Butler Creek flip up scope covers. It does great in low light and doesn't have any scratches on the lenses. There are a few ring marks on the scope because it was originally mounted on a different rifle. I’ll be happy to send additional pictures. Accuracy is 1 inch or less with cheap Winchester 130gr Power Point and Remington 150gr Core-Lokt. 120 rounds of ammo comes with the sale. Price is $550. I will sell the rifle nd ammo (without the scope) for $375
The rifle is in like new condition, very accurate, and ready to hunt.Also included with the sale is 120 rounds of ammunition:- 26 Federal 130gr Power Point- 77 Remington 150gr Core-Lokt- 17 Remington 130gr Power Point- Optional - 20 rounds of Nosler Trophy Grade 130gr Accubonds for an additonal $40 which would bring the round count to 140"

- Muzzle threaded to 14x1 LH and front sight block milled back to expose threads- Tapco muzzle brake machined to clock correctly to front sight block (custom fit, no crush washer), also comes w/ US made slant brake.- Bullet guide installed to allow use of standard AK mags- 2 unmodded Saiga mags that don't fit due to bullet guide install. I chose to leave the pricey Saiga mags alone and eventually buy some standard AK mags (which I never did). The Saiga mags are easily modded to work like AK mags but they're relatively expensive as is so I would recommend just buying some good standard Magpul AK mags.- Tapco G2 trigger.- Russian scope mount.- Hogue grip.- Tapco stock.- I've also got the 4 little plugs to fill the previous axis pin holes left from the conversion- Back half is converted, front half is not, except for barrel threads (see pictures), Stock hand guard and Tapco stock match impressively well.- Includes stock parts leftover from the conversion- I didn't count rounds when I shot it but I will say it's well under 1,000, probably under 500. It was brought out on a few range days but I have other rifles that I prefer to shoot so it was mainly fired by several different people using MY ammo so they didn't shoot it much either. - This was my first/only AK rifle and I prefer to shoot AR's and I don't see the point of keeping this one as it just takes up space in my already too small safe."

The MH1 was designed to maximize the user’s performance with a unique ambidextrous wireless IR PTT button (infra-red push to transmit) that controls activation and brightness of the reticle. Uses a shooter designed reticle which helps to maintain the weapon on a vertical plane for more Accurate shooting using balancing lines at 3 & 9 o’clock and a centered red dot. Unique functions such as a USB charging port and unheard of user interface control makes the MH1 one of the most advanced and innovative reflex sights in the world at a very affordable price. The MH1 offers the user a very different &efficient approach; efficient approach to battery consumption. The sight uses 2 batteries;a wall socket/lighter USB rechargeable battery and a standard single backup CR123 battery, allowing for extended battery life and easy reachable access. This, along with our sleep mode and dual 30° motion sensors which only activates the sight when a shooting movement takes place (no accidental activation), makes MH1 a truly ingenious sight. The ergonomic design of the MH1 allows for ambidextrous use of the uniquely angled rear activation buttons and easy access for the control panel, even when placed directly in front of add-on optical devices i.e. magnifier or Night Vision Device (NVD). The MH1 is built to MIL-STD-810F and is waterproof up to 20ft. It is equipped with MIL-STD. 1913 Picatinny /Weaver mounting system assembled on the right side of the sight to avoid accidental opening .Main AdvantagesEasily Accessible, Angled Ambidextrous Activation ButtonsThe Only Remote-Controlled Reflex SightOne Of a Kind USB Rechargeable Reflex SightThe Largest Field of View Through The SightAccuracy Enhanced ReticleSmart Battery ConsumptionCustom User Interface (optional)Sleep Mode & Memory ChipDual Motion SensorNight Vision ModeFighter Friendly Low Battery IndicatorLower 1/3 Co-Witness With Backup SightsTrue Parallax FreeDurable Antireflection CoatingInvisible Reticle From The Target Side of The lensMIL-STD. 1913 Locking Mechanism Positioned On The Right Hand SideNitrogen Filled Fog Resistant Internal OpticsRugged Design"
