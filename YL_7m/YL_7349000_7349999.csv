Because of this it is essential that the equipment used has to be up to the task more than ever. The Benelli M2 3-gun built in the performance shop is equipped to handle exactly this scenario. Its proven design and reliability have been part of the reason that it has been a favorite in many of the professional’s hands. In 2016 Benelli redesigned this shotgun to include an improved loading port for greater efficiency when quad loading, an XS express rear sight for slug accuracy and a port caddy for a spare shell. These upgrades with the proven Inertia Driven System, ComforTech technology for less felt recoil and the Crio system that treats barrels and choke tube for increased pattern density combine to create the ultimate shotgun in 3-gun.

The Next Generation of Confidence.  Introducing the GLOCK 17 Gen5 and GLOCK 19 Gen5 pistols.  GLOCK Gen5 pistols are the latest example of GLOCK’s constant pursuit of perfection.  Gen5 pistols feature over 20 design modifications from their Gen4 predecessors.  These changes deliver improved accuracy, durability, performance, control, and flexibility. Put the next generation of confidence in your hands. Five Distinct Features  More than 20 design changes distinguish the Gen 5 pistols from their Gen 4 predecessors. Among these design changes are five distinct features which deliver an improved overall shooting experience and propel GLOCK into its next generation of pistols. Learn more about these new features below.  Improved Durability NDLC Finish The GLOCK 17 Gen5 and GLOCK 19 Gen5 feature the proprietary GLOCK nDLC finish. This enhanced finish reduces corrosion and scratching and improves performance in adverse conditions.              Improved Accuracy Glock Marksman Barrel (GMB) The GLOCK 17 Gen5 and GLOCK 19 Gen5 feature the GLOCK Marksman Barrel. The barrel’s new rifling and crown deliver improved accuracy for both the beginner and the seasoned gun owner.            Universal Fit No Finger Grooves The GLOCK 17 Gen5 and GLOCK 19 Gen5 have no finger grooves on the grip. Removing the finger grooves improves the ergonomics of the grip, delivering consistent comfort and improved control to a wider range of consumers, regardless of hand size.      Quicker Reloading Flared Magazine Well The GLOCK 17 Gen5 and GLOCK 19 Gen5 feature a flared mag-well. The larger opening found in the mag-well of GLOCK Gen5 pistols makes quicker and easier magazine changes possible, particularly in high-stress situations where fractions of a second matter.      Ambi Operation Ambidextrous Slide Stop The GLOCK 17 Gen5 and GLOCK 19 Gen5 feature ambidextrous slide stop levers. Now it is easier than ever for both left-handed and right-handed gun owners to quickly, comfortably, and safely manipulate the slide.      Glock 19 Gen 5 GNS"

This little ’94 SRC has put in its time on the farm or the ranch and now it’s moving on. There is lots of original blue on the barrel. I’d rate it at about 89% with just a few miniscule freckles here and there and a slight bit of thinning in a couple of spots. It has a very good plus bore with bright, sharp rifling. The receiver blue has faded a bit but most of it’s still there with just a couple of very minor scratches. All lettering and proofmarks are still very readable. The stock has had its varnish pretty much worn away and it has a few small dings and dents, less than you’d expect on a gun of this age. There are two very slight cracks."

Gaston Glock's masterpiece would go on to gain worldwide acceptance with shooters in both professional and civilian circles, the GLOCK 22 Gen 3 has become one of the most popular duty sidearms ever produced.The latest GLOCK 22, the Gen4, is chambered in .40 S&W features a modular backstrap system that allows a shooter to tailor the rough textured grip of the pistol to their hand size for optimal ergonomics. Making the pistol even more user-friendly, GLOCK has introduced a reversible magazine catch on the Gen4 pistols, now right and left-hand shooters can enjoy the pistol as Gaston Glock envisioned. To tame the recoil of the powerful .40 S&W cartridge, GLOCK has introduced a dual recoil spring system that not only makes the GLOCK 22 a soft shooting pistol but also significantly increases the service life of the pistol. Police, military, competition shooters and those looking for a means of defense turn to the Glock 22 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments. Featuring a large 15 round magazine capacity that offers more than enough firepower when it is needed most.

A new rough texture on the grip guarantees that you have a solid grip even if your hands are wet or worse yet, bloody. With the update of the GLOCK 27, they improved the ergonomics with interchangeable backstraps and a reversible magazine catch for the left handed shooters. It wasn't long after GLOCK's acceptance by American shooters that the need for a smaller model geared towards concealed carriers was identified. To produce a handgun that was the right size to appeal to shooters that plan on hiding it in plain sight, GLOCK redesigned the popular GLOCK 23 into a new pistol they called the GLOCK 27. With a redesigned locking block, reworked frame and an all new dual recoil spring, the GLOCK 27, also known as the ""baby GLOCK"" was a fresh take on the now proven design.Shooters all over the world turn to the Glock 27 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments. With a 9 round capacity magazine, the GLOCK 27 is a perfect choice for a police officer's looking for a backup gun to their GLOCK 22 or 23, as well as off duty or plain clothes work and concealed carriers.

I'm in Rocky Top which is about 20 minutes north of Knoxville. For the right trade, I may come to you. Email for text, no requests for calls please. The reliability of the Browning® BPS® Stalker Pump-Action Shotgun starts with rigid, dual machined, steel slide bars, housed inside a receiver machined from a solid block of forged steel. The double slide bars eliminate twisting and binding for faster, more efficient operation. The BPS ejects spent cases out the bottom of the receiver so there is no ejection port on either side where a drenching rain can drip into the action, and the bottom ejection and top mounted tang safety make the BPS pump shotgun truly ambidextrous. A 3-1/2"" chrome-plated chamber cycles all types of 12-gauge shotgun ammo, making the BPS Stalker a superb all-round shotgun well suited for hunting nearly any species, from rabbits and quail to turkey and geese to coyotes and deer. The entire gun features a non-reflective, matte black finish that blends into the shadows of any game habitat, and a Dura-Touch® Armor coating on the stock and forearm improves your grip and overall shooting control in extreme weather conditions. A magazine cutoff eases loading and unloading when you need to change shotshells rapidly when encountering different species of game. A vent rib allows you to point naturally and swing smoothly, and the silver front bead picks up easily in subdued light. The BPS Stalker Pump-Action Shotgun utilizes interchangeable Invector-Plus choke tubes, and a back-bored barrel for dense, uniform shot patterns that down birds at maximum shotgun range. Includes 3 choke tubesRigid, dual machined, steel slide barsForged and machined steel receiverTop mounted tang safetyMatte black finishBottom ejection3-1/2"" chamberMagazine cutoffBack-bored barrel3 Invector-Plus choke tubes"

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to the rest of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. These upgrades mean the components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN.

These changes deliver improved accuracy, durability, performance, control, and flexibility whether you are on the range or in a situation where fractions of a second matter.Improved Durability - NDLC FinishThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature the proprietary GLOCK nDLC finish.

Removing the finger grooves improves the ergonomics of the grip, delivering consistent comfort and improved control to a wider range of consumers, regardless of hand size.Quicker Reloading - Flared Magazine WellThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature a flared mag-well. The larger opening found in the mag-well of GLOCK Gen5 pistols makes quicker and easier magazine changes possible, particularly in high-stress situations where fractions of a second matter.Ambi Operation - Ambidextrous Slide StopThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature ambidextrous slide stop levers.

The 2000 is fully compatable with any accessory the 58 can use, unlike the Century 2008. This rifle comes with 5 30rd mags, a Silencerco ASR muzzle break, a thread pitch adapter, a standard military muzzle break and around 1200 rounds of ammo. All but 180 rounds of the ammo is brass cased FMJ, the 180 is steel cased. The rifle is also outfitted with the military beechwood stock and not the usual ""beaver barf"" furniture. Selling because I've ran into some financial troubles so no trades, please."
