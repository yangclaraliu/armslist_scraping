The left side of the slide is marked “COLT’S MFG. CO. HARTFORD, CT. U.S.A.”. The left front of the trigger guard is marked “1” and with a “VP in a triangle. The right front of the trigger guard is marked “60”. The right side of the frame above the trigger is marked “7998”. Barrel Length: 5” Sights / Optics: The front sight is a short rounded bladed. The rear sight is a square-notched, flat-top sight that is dovetailed into the top of the slide. Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are fully checkered walnut with blued screws. There are several rubs, worn checkers, scratches, and stains. They have darkened nicely from handling and age. The right panel has the deepest scratch seen on the panels, between the screws. The checkering shows general wear but is still pronounced. The grips rate in about Very Good overall condition. Type of Finish: Blued. The trigger and magazine housing are serrated. Finish Originality: The finish is original. Bore Condition: The bore is bright with sharp rifling. There is no erosion in the bore. Overall Condition: This pistol retains about 75% of its metal finish. The right side of the frame and slide show the most wear and finish loss, with some scratching here behind the trigger. This was popssibly to remove a freckle? There is surface scratching and edge wear, with a light and scattered layer of surface erosion on the slide. The left side is better, with scattered surface scratches, thinning at the leading edges and edge wear. There is only a slight takedown mark. The hammer, magazine release and safety knurling and the slide and mainspring housing serrations are sharp. The recoil spring plug checkering shows moderate wear. The grip screws have thinned with light marks from a screwdriver. The markings are clear. Overall, this pistol rates in about Very Good condition and honestly used and worn. There is really nothing we hate about this pistol - it is parts and finish original (later magazine). Mechanics: The trigger pull is crisp. The slide is tight on the frame. The action functions correctly. We have not fired this pistol. As with all used firearms, a thorough cleaning may be necessary to meet your maintenance standards. Box, Paperwork & Accessories: This pistol comes with the addittional magazines as photoed.Our Assessment: The .38 Super cartridge was first introduced by Colt in 1928 as a higher pressure loading of the .38 ACP. It is capable of driving a 115 gr. bullet to nearly 1400 fps., producing almost 500 ft-lbs of energy. This is not quite up to the .357 Magnum, but was still capable of penetrating body armor and automobile bodies. Today, the cartridge is favored by many top pistol match competitors for its ability to make “Major” category with a lighter bullet offering less felt recoil than that produced with from a .45 ACP round.Colt first introduced the round in its 1911A1 frame, making it basically the same as the Government Model except for its cartridge. The 1911 pistol had already gained a reputation as a highly reliable pistol during WWI, Colt saw no reason not to capitalize on that reputation with a new caliber offering. This Super .38 pistol was made just production started. It is in about Very Good condition with about 75% of its metal finish remaining. The bore is bright with sharp rifling and no erosion. The Super .38 pistols are highly prized by collectors, and this one should be no different. Please see our pictures and good luck!

Chambered for the .30-06, the Johnson rifle was the main contender against the M1 Garand during the pre-WWII U.S. Military rifle trials. Although a limited number of Johnson rifles went on to serve with the U.S. Marines during WWII, the Garand was officially adopted instead, causing the Johnson to slowly fade into relative obscurity. It's interesting to note that there were many proponents at the time who stated the Johnson was clearly the better rifle. Extremely innovative, particularly for her time, the Johnson operates via a short recoil system whereby the barrel, bolt and carrier recoil backward together a short distance until barrel pressure drops and the barrel is stopped against a shoulder."

This is a German G.41(W), the earliest Nazi era full-power semi-automatic rifle. It featured a ""gas trap"" type system of operation where the muzzle cone redirected gas to drive a piston which in turn drove a sheet metal arm, operating the action. This rifle chambers the same 8mm Mauser cartridge used in the famous Mauser K98 bolt rifle and the 10-shot fixed magazine is loaded using K98 stripper clips. The rear sight base incorporates a rail designed to accept a ZF40 scope with special ""straddle"" mount (exceedingly rare today). Also of interest to the collector are the bolt locking flaps which were made with the experimental ball detents which were designed to retain the flaps during disassemble to help prevent loss during cleaning."

This thing is dead accurate, the full 3 white dot sights on the 3"" model are awesome and allow quick shooting, and the DAO trigger is absolutely phenomenal.
