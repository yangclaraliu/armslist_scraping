The 124 seems to be the sweet spot for the 9mm P320 and I’ve owned the Full-size, Carry, Compact, and Sub Compact. The pistol will sell with 6 - 17rd Sig magazines. Yes 6 and not knock-offs, but Sig brand magazines. If you see the orange dot on the front blade, that is NOT an updated sight. I used epoxy day glow orange paint on the standard factory sights. It make target acquisition much faster but it’s only paint and not an upgraded sight.  Also comes with an updated flat Apex trigger and spring. I also have the original trigger as well as another new in bag Sig factory trigger spring, in case you want to send it back for repair etc. it’s a Sig so Lifetine Warranty! Also includes the original case, owners manual, and gun lock. Oh and the mat too. Price is rock solid $500. I don’t like negotiating price and this is by far a very fair price for this setup. So so why am I selling? I got a P226 Legion SAO that I use for IDPA now. I still have my P320 9mm Carry that I use for EDC - it also has the Apex flar trigger. I live on James Island and prefer you come to my house for sale. You will need to bring a CWP or a valid SC Drivers License."

The Taurus Tracker double action revolvers are built on a compact frame that allows for easy portability. Now, Taurus has introduced the Tracker chambered for the .44 Magnum cartridge. By using a five-shot cylinder, The Tracker can handle the high pressure of the magnum, yet still have plenty of cylinder wall strength. Weighing in at just 34.8 ounces with a four inch heavy barrel, the .44 Tracker carries very well in a belt holster, weighing not much more than a good twenty-two caliber revolver, but packing a much more authoritative punch.  The .44 Tracker is made for hunters, backpackers, and fishermen who need a good powerful handgun while in the great outdoors to defend against predators, of both the two-legged and four-legged varieties. While not designed as a primary hunting weapon, the Tracker does very well on deer sized game at close to medium handgun range.
The Tracker wears excellent adjustable sights that are easy to see, with a white outline rear and a bright orange insert in the front ramp. The rear sight is easily adjusted for windage and elevation, and the sight picture provided by the flat rear face of the sight blade is near perfect."

Product Description
The criteria for the gun:
To achieve this, the gun was designed from its inception to be small, roughly 5.2 "" x 3.7""; to weigh a mere 13.5 oz; to be slim and smooth, devoid of any sharp edges or protrusions; and to have no external levers or controls to be manipulated. To get into action, one simply has to pull the trigger, which is a double-action only. The Rohrbaugh R9 is manufactured with space-age technology, using state-of-the-art CNC machining, which keeps tolerances to a minimum, thereby maintaining complete consistency in functioning. It is ergonomically designed to work seamlessly with the human body to point naturally and keeping the wrist and forearm in line. The design of the grip is also designed to push the recoil to the center of the palm, thereby reducing felt recoil.
State of the Art:
Rohrbaugh firearms are designed with the use of CAD/CAM programs. CNC machines perform the manufacturing. Then each gun is then hand fitted and assembled in our state of the art facility. The materials used are of the highest grade, including quality stainless steel, 7075 aircraft aluminum, G-10 grips and Wolff springs.
The R9 Steath is another version of the award-winning Rohrbaugh 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The R9 Stealth slides are coated with Titan Kote C12, which reduces friction, increases wear resistance and has anti-galling properties.

The P229 in DA/SA include a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The pistol is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG and also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc., P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most."

This is a build based on a genuine Colt ""M4"" complete lower receiver, with a colt 1x7 twist chrome lined pencil barrel. Other parts include an A1 flashider I believe is colt, a Right to Bear Arms upper receiver, a drop in carbine length Midwest Industries USA made rail, foregrip, a hogue grip, strike idustries trigger guard and charging handle, a RRA bolt carrier group and ATI ultralite stock. Also included are rail covers, dustcover and dustcover parts, and a flat metal trigger guard in the baggie. If you want, I can also throw in an A2 pistol grip, which could help if you are trying to make a military clone rifle. This rifle works fine and was test fired for 5 rounds to make sure the build worked and put away. Asking $630 or best offer.I'm open to trade offers, but would prefer cash. Thanks."

RARE SS192 “Green Ammo” was produced for ONLY 3 months before FN turned to the SS195LF. The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

I do have more pictures of higher quality availble to show you. This is a 1988 Taurus model 66, 4 inch barrel, 6 shot, 357 magnum revolver. It is a hand cannon. The gun is chambered for 357, so it also shoots 38 special and 38 special +p without any problems. The gun is tight and operationally perfect. I literally picked it up on Friday, September 8th 2017 from the gunsmith where he applied a hot satin blue finish and installed a new firing pin. So the gun is good to go. It is missing the rear sight however as i just haven’t taken the time to get one for it. This gun does come with a Folbus paddle holster as well. This particular gun is very well known as one of Taurus best revolvers. I highly encourage you to look it up for yourself. I am in Maryville and will only meet in Maryville due to transportation complications. Must be willing to sign a bill of sale for both of our records and safety. Main trades I will accept are a sccy cpx-2 in any color except pink, or Ruger lcp with ss slide. Maybe others, but those are the main 2. Thank you."

Automatic Rimfire.  For a long time, the ammo was not available, but Aguila is making it again (as is CCI on a limted basis).  The book says the production was from 1903 to 1932, but the serial number guide goes up to 1936 and indicates that this one was from the last year of production.  For an 80 year old gun, it's in good shape.  The bore is immaculate.  The blueing on the barrel is very nice and the blueing on the receiver is largely plum colored.  The stock shows some honest wear, but it's not all beat up.  Now that ammo is again available, prices on the gun are going up already.  Book value in good condition is $600.  I'm asking $450 for this one.  REDACTED"
