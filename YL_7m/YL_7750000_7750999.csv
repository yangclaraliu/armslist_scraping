This excellent MKII was built in 2000. I bought it 2.5 years ago. It is the Standard Model. With 4.75"" tapered barrel. It is cosmetically very nice with good bluing. Included, as you can see in my picture, is the original box with OEM grip panels. It is now ""wearing"" cherry grips with RH thumb rest. Recently I started to experience frequent failures to fire. (FTF). I assumed that some springs were getting ""tired"". I then bought a full set of WOLFF MKII springs. (4). And, had installed by a gunsmith. It has ended up with a very light trigger pull. 2.5-3 pounds. By far the lightest of any of my several pistols. As a Standard this RUGER has fixed iron sights. It is quite accurate when target shooting. There are aftermarket sights that can adjust for both windage and elevation. EZ installation in the OEM dovetail. Included with the original box are FIVE 10 round RUGER magazines. Also, a printout of the correct RUGER Owner's Manual. These RUGER pistols were well received and thousands were made. They were also considered to be a challenge to clean. My learning curve was slow but once mastered it is no big deal. To keep it that way the pistol has the recently invented Hammer Strut Support. Problem solved. For everyone. Every thing pictured is included."

Here's why.a...It's light, you can carry it all day (unless you put some huge 10 pound scope on it).b...Will knock down any game in the lower 48 that I know of.c...A reduced recoil cartridge is commonly available that hits and kicks like a .308/7.62 NATO. This would be very adequate for your typical MO/KS deer. But, if you want to go after Elk, this will do it using the full house Magnum round!d. It you do want to go someplace where you would shoot at longer ranges, the 300 WIN MAG will do it. This has been a long time favorite round of military sharpshooters. Excellent wind-bucking characteristics.e...Condition is VERY good. No dings, big scratches, no excessive wear.f...I have lots of ammo and accessories for this that I'd be happy to tell you about (see my ad) so, you could save money on needed items as well.Trades? Yes, I would be interested in a Walther PPS M2 or maybe some decent brand 5.56 ammo.PS I have posted a separate ad for a nice stack of 300 WIN MAG ammo at a great price.Best thing to do is call me at REDACTED and I'll give you the most complete description."

I have put a lot into this gun and it's been my carry gun for about 2 years. It started life as a shield .40 but it's spent the last year with a true precision 9mm conversion barrel in it. No failures with either barrel. It's definitely nice to be able to shoot both calibers!Internals have been polished so the trigger is nice and smooth. Also comes with a tlr6 light/laser combination, great for when things go bump in the night! I also have a Tulster holster and mag carrier, also comes with at least 3 magazines. I know I have more, I'll see if I can find them. Looking for a SA/DA compact 9mm but I would prefer cash. Or a cz 2075 RAMI!Thanks for looking, get a hold of me if you have any questions.

Included, as you can see in my picture, is the original box with the OEM grip panels. It is now ""wearing"" cherry grip panels with a RH thumb rest. Recently I started to experience frequent failures to fire (FTF). I assumed some springs were getting ""tired"". I then bought a full set of WOLFF MKII springs. (4). Which I had installed by a gunsmith. It has ended with a very light trigger pull. 2.5-3 pounds. By far the lightest of any of my several pistols. As a Standard model this RUGER has fixed iron sights. And, it is quite accurate when target shooting. Aftermarket sights are available adjustable for both windage and elevation. EZ installation in the OEM dovetail. Also included are 5 10 round RUGER magazines. Also, a printout of the correct RUGER Owner's Manual.These RUGER pistols were popular and thousands were sold. They were also considered to be a challenge to clean. And reassemble. My own learning curve was slow but once mastered it was no big deal. To keep it that way my pistol has the recently invented Hammer Strut Support. Problem solved. For everyone. Everything pictured is included."

Also I am firm on the 160 if this is to be a cash transaction. I have already turned down several offers for 150. I really don't care if I get rid of it.  I would like to use it towards a trade on something else more than cash. Also please don't make me offers if you don't even have a permit.  I am not looking to break any laws.  I will be taking a picture of your driver's license and your permit.   Also I will not be taking any road trips to get rid of a $160 gun. Must meet in the Cedar Rapids area.  You can call me at 815-603-5294 but I will not respond to text messages."

Very Clean!Comes with one magazine, wallet holster, case, original box and 75 rounds. GREAT FOR ALL-DAY CONCEALED CARRYThe Beretta 3032 Tomcat is tiny. Besides offering the power of the .32 ACP cartridge, it sports a tough and durable blued-steel finish. This double/single-action auto-pistol is perfect for deep concealment or as a backup second handgun.EASY OPERATIONThe controls of the Beretta 3032 Tomcat are designed to be simple and to provide safety and peace of mind while carrying. The two-position safety engages crisply and positively, and locks the slide as well as preventing the pistol from firing. The magazine release is located to the left of the grip, making it easy to locate and operate even with one hand.CONVENIENT TIP-UP BARREL DESIGNIts tip-up barrel design makes it easy to load, operate, and maintain, while its traditional looks give it the allure of a true classic. Thanks to this design, you never need to rack the slide and you can load that first round directly into the chamber. This is especially convenient in cold weather, or for people with weaker hands. Another advantage is that the barrel may be easily cleaned without taking the pistol apart, making it convenient to give the pistol a quick wipe after a session at the range.TIP-UP BARREL RELEASE LATCHThe Beretta 3032 Tomcat‚Äôs barrel tips up (that is, it swings upward pivoting near the muzzle, thereby exposing the chamber); this is achieved by simply operating the tip-up barrel release latch on the side of the pistol.TIP-UP BARRELThe tip-up barrel design has several advantages. It makes it easy to visually check whether the chamber is loaded and it allows for effortless loading and unloading without racking the slide. This last feature makes it particularly ideal for shooters with weaker hands.EASY TO CONCEAL AND SHOOT Right from their inception, Beretta small frame pistols such as the Beretta 3032 Tomcat were designed to be carried concealed. The lines are snag-free, with the sights being engineered to easily slide in and out of a holster, pocket, or belly-band without catching on anything. The rear sight is adjustable for windage, so you can easily experiment shooting different loads while keeping your sights on target. All these features have made Beretta small frames like the Beretta 3032 Tomcat a favorite for concealed carry and self-defense. CONTOURED TANGThe tang will gently hug the web of your shooting hand, minimizing the chance of ""slide bite."" Thanks to this and other details, the Beretta 3032 Tomcat will feel ergonomic and efficient in your hands, in spite of its diminutive size.BLUED FINISHThe blued steel finish on this handgun makes it highly resistant to sweat, rain, and powder residues. A tiny workhorse that will give you years and years of trouble-free service.RECESSED MAGAZINE RELEASEThe mag-release button on the Beretta 3032 Tomcat is designed to do two things. First, it positively releases the magazine when you intend to swap it or remove it from the pistol. Second, its recessed design makes it virtually impossible for you to accidentally press it when the pistol is in the holster or while shooting.SPECIFICATIONS-Action: Single/Double-Barrel Length (mm): 61-Barrel Length (in): 2.4-Caliber: 7.65 (32 Auto)-Magazine: 7+1-Overall Height (mm): 95-Overall Height (in): 3.7-Overall Length (mm): 125-Overall Length (in): 4.92-Overall Width (mm): 28-Overall Width (in): 1.1-Weight Unloaded (g): 410-Weight Unloaded (oz): 14.5"
