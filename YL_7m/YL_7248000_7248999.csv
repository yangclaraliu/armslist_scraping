While Swarovski/Zeiss may make better glass for a higher price, stabilized binoculars allow you to use higher magnifications otherwise possible without a tripod. No larger than a set of 10x50 binoculars, these image stabilized binoculars allow you to resolve more detail while staying locked on to the area you're trying to observe. Canon's excelent UD glass works well even for low-power astronomy, so you'll have no problems at dusk or dawn. Prefer cash, but willing to consider trades for Canon or 3rd party EF mount lenses, bulk brass .223 ammo at $.25/round, steel case .223 at $.22/round, safes, or interesting semi-auto firearms, with a particular emphasis on HK pistols and rifles. I'm able to add cash for the right deal."

The carrier has front, rear, cummerbund, and side Soft ballistic Kevlar and ability to add up to a medium sized ESAPI/SAPI Plate and ESBI side plates. The carrier is a X-Small but will run up to  a Medium ESAPI Plate. This is a awesome carrier and is low profile while providing the operator with the same level protection and coverage as the IOTV but allowing much more mobility and speed while being less bulky and fits and feels a whole lot better. KDH made this Carrier for the US Army to provide a option to certain SF/Ranger units other than the standard issue IOTV. The carrier uses no Velcro to keep noise to a minimum using quick release clips(2 on each side of the vest). The wearer can easily add or remove the side plate carriers from the cummerbund while wearing the vest without having to remove their armor leaving them exposed during a mission if a threat level becomes greater or less. This is by far one of the Most sought after Plate carriers by operators and collectors alike, not to mention one of the rarest. If you have any more questions I will be glad to answer them. I also have front and rear plates available for the right price so don't be afraid to make offers on either the carrier or the plates and carrier. I will also consider trades for firearms, and other related gear, as well as other items of value or interesting got to have items. The price is negotiable so please contact me with your offers of cash and trades or combine both. Thank you."

It is now DISCONTINUED. The IOM has a M1913 accessory rail, serrated slide and trigger guard, and fully adjustable rear sight. It also incorporated magazine safety mechanism to prevent the weapon from being fired without a magazine inserted. IOM’s have the rounded trigger guard for gloved finger. The IOM Model use to be only available for agency purchase. Yeah, this is the REAL DEAL. Gun dealers are saying USG IOM. Or IOM with conventional square trigger guard. These are not IOM, but are USG. USG’s are NOT nearly as valuable. This is a REAL IOM model, not a standard USG that sellers MISREPRESENT as IOM's. The differences between the IOM and USG models are: IOM's have only made about 4700 . IOM's have a rounded trigger guard instead of a square one. IOM's have a smoother grip than the harsh checkered USG grips. Shooting one of these are best described as an AR-15 5.56 round coming out of a pistol with a recoil of a .22 long rifle. These pistols are very accurate too. IOM’s aren't made anymore and have become highly collectible. It comes with one 20 round magazine and a box (not the original box). Unknown round count.

Also included is a two sided (not the weaver one side) scope mount that uses the existing trigger assembly holes for attachment and a set of one inch scope rings.  I have used a scope on top of this gun for both turkey and deer and it makes for a very accurate and effective set up.  I do have a nice Weaver K2.5 made in the USA scope that I would add to the deal for another $75.00 if wanted.  Gun also has QD sling swivel studs in magazine cap and stock. Have had this gun for a long time just don't use it anymore.  Prefer cash and if I did consider a trade it would have to be greatly in my favor and no junk. Thanks for looking.  I will not ship this gun.  Must be FTF with buyer providing CC or willing to provide ID proving 21 years of age and sign a bill of sale. Thanks for looking!"

 I originally purchased this pistol as a cheap training gun in place of my XD9.   With that in mind, I had a local gunsmith make the following four improvements:
 1) Grip bumps filed off.  The stock finger grooves were badly placed and fell under the fingers rather than between the fingers.
 2) Trigger covered.  The stock trigger does not feel like a XD or Glock.   The stock trigger is razor sharp and cuts your finger.  This was remedied by covering the trigger with two layers of heat shrink tubing.  Now, the trigger is awesome, but, the trigger safety is disabled.
 3) White dot sites painted black.  The front site repainted Day Glo, Hi Viz Orange.
  4) Right hand take down flange lowered.  The take down bump interferes with drawing from a holster.  This was lowered to facilitate smooth draws.
 Before inquiring about this firearm, please review the listing photos and compare this pistol to a stock gun.  THIS IS NOT A STOCK GUN.  Personally, I really enjoyed the modifications and thought they were big improvements over a stock pistol.
 The ISSC M2 shoots best with CCI Mini Mags, but will do okay with cheap Federal bulk pack ammo as long as the slide rails are well lubed.  FFL transfer only.  Buyer pays FFL fees, and shipping fees, if any."
