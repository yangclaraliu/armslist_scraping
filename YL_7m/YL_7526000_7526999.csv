Sorry for sounding like a jerk, I’ve just been running into a lot of idiots on here lately. Anyway here is the list and details of the sidearms and thank you for your time. 1.)Glock 19 4th Gen: Absolutely flawless and looks as if it just came off the assembly line. It’s never been placed in a holster. All original other then an Extended Slide Release. Comes in the original Glock hardcase with all the factory accessories it comes with new.2.)CZ PO7 9mm: Absolutely flawless and looks as if it’s never been removed from the case. It’s never been placed in a holster. 100% original and comes in the original CZ hardcase with all the factory accessories it came with new. 3.)Sig Sauer P320 9mm Carry: It is in excellent condition. It’s never been placed in a holster. 100% original and comes in the original case with all the factory accessories it came with new. 4.)FN FNX-45: It is the two-tone model with the stainless slide and black frame. It is in excellent condition. It has a couple range trips on it so it’s had a little more use then the other 3. Like I said though it is still in excellent shape. It comes in the original FN hardcase with all the factory accessories it came with new ‘EXCEPT’ for 1 of the 2 backstraps. It originally came with 2 but one was dropped at the range and by the time I realized it was gone it was to late. The backstraps are $5 online and I’m sure something that tiny would only be a couple bucks for shipping. I preferred the one that is on it now so I never had a reason to order the other one."

Nickel outside is pitted up of course for a hundred year old revolver but still looks great and rifling is good. Made off the Smith model 1 it has the free spinning cylinder.  (Meaning cylinders on these do not fully lock and will spin one way when cocked which is why gun shops don't recommend shooting them)Breaks open with a simple lever push and ejects spent casings very easy and fast to reload.Ejector works amazing and has good trigger pull in single action when cocking hammer and smooth easy pull in double action then push trigger forward if you pull it in double action to reset it.Gun does shoot and actually pretty accurate at 25 yards but for the age of course gun shops don't recommend you shooting them and because of it being the free spinning cylinder model.  Great conversation piece or great display item or get it out every now an then an shoot just be careful. But again I don't recommend anyone shooting it.Pick up in Utica or Newark area only. thank you.Was gonna ask $200 but dropped to only $85 cash for a quick sale."

Also I prefer factory built rifles. Not looking for something someone spent $500-$600 to build and somehow has it in their head it’s worth $1,200-$1,500.

Sorry for sounding like a jerk, I’ve just been running into a lot of idiots on here lately. Anyway here is the list and details of the sidearms and thank you for your time. 1.)Glock 19 4th Gen: Absolutely flawless and looks as if it just came off the assembly line. It’s never been placed in a holster. All original other then an Extended Slide Release. Comes in the original Glock hardcase with all the factory accessories it comes with new.2.)CZ PO7 9mm: Absolutely flawless and looks as if it’s never been removed from the case. It’s never been placed in a holster. 100% original and comes in the original CZ hardcase with all the factory accessories it came with new. 3.)Sig Sauer P320 9mm Carry: It is in excellent condition. It’s never been placed in a holster. 100% original and comes in the original case with all the factory accessories it came with new. 4.)FN FNX-45: It is the two-tone model with the stainless slide and black frame. It is in excellent condition. It has a couple range trips on it so it’s had a little more use then the other 3. Like I said though it is still in excellent shape. It comes in the original FN hardcase with all the factory accessories it came with new ‘EXCEPT’ for 1 of the 2 backstraps. It originally came with 2 but one was dropped at the range and by the time I realized it was gone it was to late. The backstraps are $5 online and I’m sure something that tiny would only be a couple bucks for shipping. I preferred the one that is on it now so I never had a reason to order the other one."

Right now I’m mainly looking to trade one of them for an AR or an AR Pistol. I can add cash depending on the trade but I am not interested in trading 2 for 1. I’d rather add cash on top. Also I prefer factory built rifles. Not looking for something someone spent $500-$600 to build and somehow has it in their head it’s worth $1,200-$1,500. I’m interested in other handguns as well. I’m also in the market to get my fiance a new sidearm so I would also be willing to trade down with cash on your end for a smaller framed cheaper handgun in .380 or 9mm. The fastest way to contact me is by text at REDACTED. For some reason my email is not allowing me to upload or send pictures so please don’t email asking me to send pictures. You will have to text me for pictures. Sorry for sounding like a jerk, I’ve just been running into a lot of idiots on here lately. Anyway here is the list and details of the sidearms and thank you for your time. 1.)Glock 19 4th Gen: Absolutely flawless and looks as if it just came off the assembly line. It’s never been placed in a holster. All original other then an Extended Slide Release. Comes in the original Glock hardcase with all the factory accessories it comes with new.2.)CZ PO7 9mm: Absolutely flawless and looks as if it’s never been removed from the case. It’s never been placed in a holster. 100% original and comes in the original CZ hardcase with all the factory accessories it came with new. 3.)Sig Sauer P320 9mm Carry: It is in excellent condition. It’s never been placed in a holster. 100% original and comes in the original case with all the factory accessories it came with new. 4.)FN FNX-45: It is the two-tone model with the stainless slide and black frame. It is in excellent condition. It has a couple range trips on it so it’s had a little more use then the other 3. Like I said though it is still in excellent shape. It comes in the original FN hardcase with all the factory accessories it came with new ‘EXCEPT’ for 1 of the 2 backstraps. It originally came with 2 but one was dropped at the range and by the time I realized it was gone it was to late. The backstraps are $5 online and I’m sure something that tiny would only be a couple bucks for shipping. I preferred the one that is on it now so I never had a reason to order the other one."
