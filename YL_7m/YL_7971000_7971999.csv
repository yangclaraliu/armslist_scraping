Cerakoted in burnt bronze. This gun took over a year to build and is very high quality. Must see it in person to really appreciate it. The trigger has zero creep and has about a 5 pound trigger pull. Great for fast shooting. Gun is in great condition. Must see it in person to appreciate the quality.I had it built when I was doing Uspsa, and steel challenge. I haven't done any of that in years. It's just been sitting in the gun safe and it's to big to be a carry gun for my comfort. It's only had around 1500 rounds through it on the high side. By the time this gun was finished it was close to Obama's second reelection when ammo prices skyrocketed and I could not shoot anymore at the ammo prices. Comes with a soft case, 4 cobra mags, plastic holster, and a CR speed belt size 42 and 300 rounds of freedom munitions 9mm.This gun is worth way more then the 1500 and if you held it and compared the quality you would understand. Everything is perfectly tight, gun doesn't have a single rattle and the trigger is the nicest trigger I have ever seen. I have sold off many things recently to pay off lawyer fees for a adoption we recently went through for my son. I really want this to go to the right person who can appreciate what it is.This gun cost $1124 in just raw parts not including labor, cerakote, grips, or magazines. I was not the gunsmith, it took the gunsmith over a year tweaking making sure it was perfect. He did a absolute amazing job."

Low recoil, perhaps for those not seeking full recoil, or lighter individuals. This caliber is fully capable as a deer rifle or varmint rifle.This beautifully crafted walnut stock rivals today’s the higher priced ‘Super Grade’ quality. Barrel length is estimated at 22” and in flawless quality. Obviously lightly used. Optional equipment includes the new Leupold VX-2 (3-9X, 40mm), value $300, and can be removed for $250 reduced selling price, if no scope is required. Approx 30 rounds of Winchester .243 ammo included (100 Grain). Hoyt leather trimmed canvas rifle bag, valued at $60 is included.This Rifleman’s rifle needs little introduction, introduced first in the 1930’s, it has been the standard by which all bolt action rifles are judged. The 1964-1992 Winchester Model 70 differed from the pre-1964 models by forging the receiver for the first time, which increased strength and reduced machining  labor. The bolt action was also changed, with the bolt face now fully surrounding the cartridge rim. Although cheaper to manufacture than the prior undercut bolt face, and built as 2 separate pieces then brazed together, it is considered stronger."

It is the second H & K  that i've owned..H & K doesnt make bad pistols..(my experience, at least)it comes with the original plastic box, manual and all things from the factory. I have four high capacity magazines with it..(one of the magazines isnt pictured in these pictures but it is included) If your not familiar with them, look them up on the net. This one is practically new. I'm not interested in a trade at the moment and im firm on the price. Thank you for looking! God bless."
