This gun has had two owners. The original owner was a USA Olympic marksman. He set it up with two barrels, a scope, and custom grips.The original Matched High Standard Victor barrel is unmodified with the vented rib from the factory. The second barrel is a NAPCO Barrel, marked with its own serial number. The NAPCO barrel has an ADCO Solo Red Dot scope / sight mounted on it.In addition to both barrels, and the red dot scope, this comes with both its original High Standard checkered walnut thumb rest grips and a pair of Randall Fung custom made Match Grips.It also comes with an extra 10 round magazine (for a total of two magazines), and a High Standard box that is in great shape.I am the second owner. I bought this because I like nice things and I wanted an accurate 22 to teach my children with. I owe the set up of the extra barrel, the scope, the custom grips, and the extreme care this pistol has had to the original owner. He upgraded the trigger to a target / match / competition trigger.I can vouch for its accuracy. It is amazing. But I didn't enter any competitions or win anything, except for the admiration and attention of others at the range.I have never used the original barrel. I only used the NAPCO one with the scope on it. I did take the other out of the safe twice a year and oiled it.I am selling this simply because it doesn't get used any more. It has always been way above my level of ownership. I'm not a collector. I'm a guy who likes nice guns and who takes them out 2-3 times a year (I wish I went more, but most years its less) to shoot them. This one went out when my kids were young, but it has sat in the safe for maybe 10 years. It's time to sell it.My loss is your gain. The barrels look mirror clean to me. I tried to capture every flaw in pictures. It is a beautiful gun. Its serial number is #2434099. You can see that in the pictures. The box is correct as to what gun it is. But I am not sure why the serial number on the box does not match. I think I mixed up boxes at some point. At one time I had four of these High Standard Victors. I sold two years ago. I kept this one because it was always the nicest. I still do have one other. It's a plunker that I'm keeping because it is not worth much.I have this listed with more pictures on Gunbroker.

The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly.

The P220 features a stainless steel slide machined from barstock and coated with a durable, wear-resistant Nitron finish, light-weight alloy frame with integral accessory rail, and the SIG SAUER four-point safety system of decocking lever, patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and trigger bar disconnector.SPECSCALIBER45 AutoACTION TYPESemi-AutoFRAME SIZEFull-SizeFRAME FINISHHard Coat AnodizedFRAME MATERIALAlloySLIDE FINISHNitronSLIDE MATERIALStainless SteelACCESSORY RAILSIG RailTRIGGERDA/SABARREL LENGTH4.4 in (112 mm)OVERALL LENGTH7.7 in (196 mm)OVERALL WIDTH1.5 in (38 mm)HEIGHT5.5 in (140 mm)WEIGHT30.4 oz (862 g)sigsauer.com/store/p220-nitron-full-size.html--."

This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features expected in the SAM7 Family. From its reinforced under-folding buttstock to its 14x1mm left hand muzzle threads with muzzle nut, every component of the SAM7UF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7UF rifle is bound to become a sought-after and collectible firearm.The New Reinforced Under-Folding StockThe SAM7UF utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock, which locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle.  In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, this stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces the climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it.  Rifle Includes 30 round magazine, 3% CC fee $40 for shipping"

This hunting rifle is a 300 Win Mag and is recognized for its legendary performance and accuracy, the Model 700 has a rigid, cylindrical receiver design that adds stiffness and a solid bedding area for the action in the stock. A counterbored bolt face encloses the cartridge head with an unbroken ring of steel, which then fits inside of the barrel chamber, surrounded by the receiver – creating the famous Remington “three-rings-of-steel.” This time-proven design creates an action of unparalleled strength. With this solid construction and advanced design, the Model 700 has earned a reputation for its out-of-the-box accuracy.
The Model 700 CDL “Boone & Crockett” Series provides that same renowned accuracy and reliability in a classically styled, well-designed package. Housed in a straight comb, brown laminate stock with right-handed cheek piece, black fore-end tip and grip cap, this Model 700 defies the elements and provides the hunter a solid platform he can depend on in any weather. The rifle wears a fluted carbon steel barrel 26-inch barrel, with receivers drilled and tapped for ease of mounting optics. Both barrel and action wear an attractive, non-reflective satin blued finish. A jeweled bolt body completes the classic look of these centerfire rifles.
The hinged floorplate magazine has a three round capacity. Fit with a patented Remington recoil pad, even the unwelcome “punch” of the high-powered magnum is significantly diminished. This high performance rifle also has the X-Mark Pro™ fire control system that delivers crisp, perfect trigger pulls with virtually no creep and come set at three to five pounds from the factory. An attractive medallion featuring the B & C logo is inset into the grip cap and “Boone & Crockett” is laser engraved into the barrel, recognizing this most American of conservation organization."

Nothing wrong with the gun.The Springfield XD-S 9mm with Fiber Optic front sight is lightweight and compact, ideal forcarry and concealment for self-defense purposes.  The pistol grip has been enhanced and texturedto increase confidence in the shooters grip. The XD-S slide is formed frombillet design and the barrel is hammer-forged for enhanced accuracy and durability.The Springfield Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System guards againstaccidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearwardpressure is applied only by gripping the pistol grip, and the Loaded Chamber Indicator informs the shooterwithout a doubt the Condition of the firearm. To maintain accuracy and consistency,the trigger has been designed to minimize trigger pull and reset, which alsoincreases ease of operation and manipulation. Combined with all these features as well as Springfield Armory’soutstanding engineering and quality control techniques, shooters can beconfident in choosing the XD-S as their valid source for self-protection andrecreational shooting purposes."

Here it is, the new Citori Micro Midas Satin Hunter. It is a shotgun suitable for any lover of over/unders, but this special model will fit youth and ladies very well. The satin-finished Walnut stock is shorter for easier shouldering. The length of pull, which is the distance from the center of the trigger to the center of the butt pad is only 13"". This makes the gun easier to shoulder, quicker to point, lighter and easier to carry — something that is very appealing to younger people and experienced shooters and hunters alike. It carries all the fine features that have made the Browning Citori the number one selling over and under shotgun in the world.Look carefully. The all-steel deeply blued receiver and barrels, the single selective trigger and hammer ejectors with the famous and easily navigated top-tang barrel selector/safety. These time-proven features may not be readily understood by many shooters, but will play a key role in how the gun works in their hands, and how easily it is operated and shouldered. A recoil pad is fit to the 12 gauge models.Family is the real reason. This is a very fine choice for the dad who is looking for a lighter, smaller over/under and certainly ideal for youth and ladies. And, the Browning name fits right in with the family. It has for generations."

It's by far the nicest 1911 I've owned and I've owned quite a few. It will come with 2 mags and it's blue Springfield case. It's too good of a gun to sit around doing nothing but gathering dust. I'll have pictures up tonight. The sale will require:A valid PTP or PTCMN state licenseAnd that you are at least 21 years oldCash onlyNo exceptions to any of the above. The only trade I'll consider is an AR pistol (7.5 - 10 inch) with a brace plus cash if the cheaper hybrid models. $750. No low balls. I don't need to sell if don't want to. The price reflects what will convince me to sell it.

I had no use for it, but could not ignore the price.  20 rounds through it, and it shoots very well.  Weaver scope blocks, and if you want Japanese Weaver 6x fixed, add $75.Not desperate with this or the Remington 870, just no room and no use.  If not gone tomorow, I'll just give them to deserving kids."
