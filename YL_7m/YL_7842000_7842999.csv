It does show light signs of being carried and used here and there but here is no major marks to speak of. The action of this Smith is amazing, smooth as glass cylinder and perfect trigger lock-up. Pictures best describe this firearm for exactly what it is and what you will receive! Smith & Wesson's production of a large N-frame revolver chambered for the .44 Remington Magnum cartridge began in 1955. It was not until 1957 that this revolver received the name ""Model 29"". First offered in 1978, the Smith & Wesson Model 629 was essentially the stainless steel version of the Model 29. The 629 model designation derives from Smith & Wesson's practice of denoting a stainless steel version of one of their already existing designs by placing a 6 in front of the model number of the original weapon. Elmer Keith's achievements in maximizing the power and performance of the .44 Special was the inspiration and driving force behind the introduction of the .44 Magnum by Smith & Wesson. His intention for the new round was for it to be used in sidearms for hunters of large, dangerous game, rather than for self-defense, though with today's specialty cartridges, it can be a good defensive round. It remained primarily the province of handgun enthusiasts, some law enforcement personnel and hunters until 1971, when Clint Eastwood made it famous as ""the most powerful handgun in the world"" in the movie Dirty Harry. After the movie's release, retailers had trouble keeping the Model 29 in stock."

As you will see in the extras I have installed a choke adapter on this gun.  As it happens this gun is amazing with clay pigeon shooting.  I ran a vortex optic on it and it was TOO EASY.  Also, if you like attention, people will want to see the gun at the clay range as it looks nothing like anything else.  You will also see I've bought and installed an extended top rail.  It may not seem like a big difference to you but this allows you to have a good long sight radius with BUIS and an optic.  The added benefit is if you have a folding rear BUIS it won't hang off the back of the rail and be in danger of getting broken off.  In all, this gun is super fun to shoot and I hate to see it go but family comes first.  As for the extras, they are listed below at their MSRP not including any shipping costs or tax I paid: Rear QD Sling Mount- $29.99 Front QD Sling Mount Rail Mount- $18.95 Extended Top Rail- $99.95 Barrel Nut Removal Tool (To replace the barrel nut with the choke adapter)- $29.95 Choke Adapter- $56.00 KSG Handstop- $10.00  Total of $244.84 in extras!  These guns themselves are running around $650 new and I understand you may not want all of these extras so I'm pricing my gun quite competitively.  Please let me know what questions you have!  This weapon does come with the original Manual.NO TRADES"

The full-size frame and the compact slide have joined forces to produce the ideal pistol for all conditions and all situations. “The G19X was developed for the military and is a practical everyday pistol that will do what you need it to do, when you need it to; every time, in every condition,” says GLOCK VP Josh Dorsey. “The pistol was developed for the military using GLOCK’s combat proven experience with consideration to efficiency, dependability and durability. Through rigorous testing, the G19X stands out above the competition and has the ability to function in all situations with ultimate reliability and accuracy. Our goal was to meet the demanding needs of the military while maintaining our standard of perfection. With proven results, the G19X delivers maximum efficiency and trustworthiness.” Confidence now comes in the coyote color with the first-ever factory colored slide. The nPVD slide coating of the GLOCK 19X prevents corrosion, resists chemicals, and stands up against the elements. Additional design features of the G19X include the GLOCK Marksman Barrel (GMB) with enhanced polygonal rifling and an improved barrel crown for increased accuracy, ambidextrous slide stop levers and no finger grooves for better versatility, and a lanyard loop for retention. The pistol includes a standard 17-round magazine and two 17+2-round extended magazines along with a coyote-colored pistol case. You can now get it only at Doc Holliday's General Store for only $595.99!Available at two convienient locations:-Forsyth-15262 US HWY 160Forsyth, Mo 65653417-546-4867-Ozark-737 N 20th StOzark, Mo 65721417-581-7296Be the first to get it!Available January 22.2018"

The car starts and runs. It has been sitting awhile but I have moved it around a few times and it still shifts and stops. The car needs work, I would love to restore it but have too many other projects and hate to see it rot away. There is a rust hole in the rear cradle, it could be fixed or the cradle could be replaced. The exhaust manifold gaskets need replaced and the ac clutch bearing is bad, but the compressor is good and was operating when I took the belt off. I am interested in selling or trading for firearms. I also have a 84 fiero that could either be restored or used for parts, I would have to file for a new title since it has been lost. I also have a 3.1 out of a apv complete with transmission and wiring harness and can add any of this for the right deal.
