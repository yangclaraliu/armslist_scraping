It holds 3 rounds in the magazine and 1 in the chamber.  It is equiped with a Remington R3 recoil pad.  Shipping via UPS will be added to the cost of the rifle, but only the actual shipping costs.  The rifle and scope will be shipped in a hard gun case and the other accessories will be shipped in a separate box.  The only acceptable payment method is a USPS money order.  The rifle MUST be shipped to a FFL.  No sales tax will be collected.  Listing states that there will be no shipping; however, I will ship to a FFL in the lower 48.  Buyer pays only actual shipping costs.  Contact me for more pictures or information."

Fixed mag ARs start at $549+Tax/DROS and featureless are $599+tax/DROS. The difference between the two is that the fixed mag version will keep the flash hider, collapsable stock, and pistol grip, but you will have to separate the upper and lower receivers to remove the magazine. The featureless model will have a shark fin grip, the stock will be pinned so that it is fixed, and the flash hider will be replaced with a muzzle brake. The reason featureless cost more is because the kits I buy don't come with featureless parts, so I have to buy those separately. I strongly recommend featureless, just because they are safer to deal with in the event of a weapons malfuntion. The picture you are seeing is a generic photo from Anderson's website, and is similar to how the fixed magazine version will look. Rifles will include cleaning kits and one 10rd magazine.

Looking in the receiver and at the bolt group it is clear this rifle has seen little use.
This is a duplicate and I’m thinning down my collection. I’m willing to ship but prefer a local sale.
If the rifle is no longer available the listing will be updated to reflect such or removed. I will not respond to adds that do not show someone has read the add or is only asking if available. I will not repond to simple questions only asking ""still available"", ""call me"" or similiar. Too often these are phishing attempts and without something in your communication to show you read the add I will ignore. 
Cash preferred but willing to consider interesting trades. If asking about a trade please send exactly what you are considering including any cash offered or needed to make up a value difference. I have other items listed and can work deals either way. Currently looking for a high end 1-6 or 1-8 LPV scope and other quality optics.
I'm located near Mansfield Dam  on Lake Travis, nearest cross streets being Hudson Bend and RR620. I either work from home or at the Capital Complex during the week. I will want and happy to provide a bill of sale."

This is the only .41 mag Virginian dragoon in existance with a factory engraved 7 1/2 inch fitted barrel along with a companion 12 inch barrel that was fitted by Interarms for this same receiver. In 1980 Interarms advertised their Virginian Dragoon revolvers to include .41 mag with a 7 1/2 inch barrel but never shipped or sold any to their dealers. All but one of the .41 mag. factory made 7 1/2 inch barrels were scrapped except this factory made blued barrel. I will consider trading for a Colt Python or selling to the best offer above $3,750.00. I will send detailed pictures to serious interested buyers. Ship FFL to FFL only."
