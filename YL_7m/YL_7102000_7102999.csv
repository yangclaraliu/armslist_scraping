Far as I can tell this gun dates to around 1947 based on the ejector and serials. This gun was rechromed at some point by the previous owner and as a result a few of the marked lettering is filled in but in turn the gun shoots fantastic. Has a nice smooth double action pull with a crisp light single action. Very accurate at the range and a joy to shoot. This would make a great truck gun or range toy. Comes with the original wooden grips as well as a very comfortable set of replacement grips in to keep the originals in good shape. mostly looking for trades, open to pretty much anything. must be willing to meet face to face in Plano-Richardson, and of course must be legal to own a handgun and show ID at time of purchase or trade.

The lower is a UIC by American Defense Manufacturing (ADM). A Spike's Tactical enhanced lower parts kit provides the guts for the lower. The trigger pull is set at 3 lbs. I could not install the anti-rotate pin set due to the ambi controls on the lower. The Spike's T2 Buffer in a Spike's mil-spec buffer tube make this a soft shooting heavy hitter.

I am including 3 cheek risers with the rifle. They are .25"", .50"" and .75"". The .50"" is on there now. The fore end is a Phase 5 LPSN-15, 15"" fore end. The optic is a Lucid L7, 1-6x24mm, with an illuminated blue/red reticle. The reticle is also black. You do not need to have the illumination on to see the reticle. The optic is mounted in a Burris PEPR, one piece, mount. This rifle will come with 2 Magpul Pmag mag kits. I only put a few rounds down range to check the rifle's function and it cycles great.
