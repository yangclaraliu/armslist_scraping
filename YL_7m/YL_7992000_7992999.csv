Similiar to the K31 but older. Date of manufacturer is 1921 based on serial number. The serial numbers are present on the bolt, barrel, and the magzine. It appears to be all original and in very good condition with the only issue being two small places on the stock of the weapon. Bore is bright and shining with strong rifling. Aciton is smooth and lock ups tight. The wood does have some scratches and the two small places. The classic rifle would make a perfect additon to any collector of military firearms. It is a strong caliber of 7.5x55 which are readily available on today's market. This is a straight pull bolt action rifle and these are known for their accuracy. Making this not only a collector but a weapon you can shoot to have fun with. I am not looking for any trades at the moment and prefer to do face to face to purchase the firearm. I will require you to sign a gun bill of sale. I may do shipping only to a FFL and must be able to verify your identity prior to shipping weapon."

CPM S90V is an advanced particle metallurgy steel with an extremely high vanadium content. Produced by the Crucible Particle Metallurgy (CPM) process to ensure an ultra-fine, extremely homogeneous grain structure, its alloy composition promotes the formation of hard vanadium carbides instead of chromium carbides, enhancing the steel’s wear resistance and leaving more free chromium available for superior corrosion resistance. The full-flat-ground PlainEdge™ blade of this elite knife harnesses the full potential of this steel’s performance and features a fully accessible Trademark Round Hole™ for swift, ambidextrous, one-handed opening. The other distinctive feature of this Para 3 is its handle, which features stunning solid carbon fiber scales with a subtle peel-ply texture for a secure grip. Stainless steel liners nested within the scales provide superior structural strength and form the foundation of the knife’s high-strength Compression Lock™ mechanism. They also anchor its four-position pocket clip, which supports ambidextrous tip-up or tip-down carry. A truly extraordinary expression of one of our most refined designs, this Para 3 Sprint Run is destined to become a highly prized collector’s item."

It is in phenomenal shape. Bought it a few months ago, and the guy I bought it from said he bought it brand new and only put a mag through it, and I've only put two mags through it. These guns are hard to find, and ones with 30 rounds down the pipe in mint condition are almost impossible to find. Absolutely zero issues, shoots great, and is dead accurate. It has probably the best trigger I've ever encountered on a .22 pistol. These firearms are unique because the barrel sits low, and has a bushing on the end that you can pop off and but a threaded one (like $20) to put on a suppressor. Since the barrel sits so low, no high sights are needed, and they make phenomenal suppressor hosts. The 2206 is also a full stainless steel firearm (slide and frame) which makes recoil laughable. It comes with the original box, manual, 2-10 round magazines, and one orange follower 12-round magazine which is VERY rare and I've seen them list for $80-$140 alone which is crazy for 2 extra rounds.Asking $500.

Please click link below to purchase. https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/spyderco-shaman-folder-black-blade-3-6-in-plain-black-g-10-handle-c229gpbk/  Description   The Shaman is a hand-filling, no-nonsense folding knife based on the proven design theme of the iconic Spyderco Native. About 20 percent larger than the Native, it offers the same refined ergonomics, as well as a few significant differences. Available with either a PlainEdge or fully serrated SpyderEdge, the Shaman’s blade is crafted from CPM S30V stainless steel and features a very high flat grind that balances strength, low-friction edge geometry, and an acute, utilitarian point. Its signature Trademark Round Hole™ is fully accessible from both sides to support swift, one-handed opening with either hand. For tactical applications where light discipline is a concern, this version of the Shaman also boasts a non-reflective black Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) blade coating. Although the Shaman’s handle shape and ergonomics follow the spirit of the Native, its construction and lock mechanism are distinctly different. The scales are 3-D machined from G-10 and thoughtfully contoured to provide a comfortable, secure grip. Skeletonized stainless steel liners nested within the smooth, matte-finished scales reinforce the handle’s structural strength and form the basis of the knife’s patented Compression Lock™. To ensure convenient carry and keep the knife poised for immediate access, the handle includes a four-position pocket clip that supports left or right-side, tip-up or tip-down carry. Like the blade, the clip and all handle hardware feature a non-reflective matte black coating."

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action.
The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to the rest of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well.
These upgrades mean the components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired.
With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use.
After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.
Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN."

These rifles are very much the epitome of what a top tier AR-10 is and should be. They were designed by an aerospace engineer for maximum efficiency. They come with Rock Creek Barrel and that barrel has a chemically induced heat treated finish on the inside (bore) to increase barrel life. POF told me they expect a 100,000 round barrel life from these top of the line Rock Creek Barrels with the nitride coating. The rifles also feature an oversized barrel nut that fastens the barrel to the receiver and it acts as a heat sink drawing heat away from the chamber/receiver area to help the gun run cooler. Also, the gun is piston driven and this keeps the gun running so much cleaner and cooler than a conventional gas impingement AR-10. This resuts in no hot gases with gunpowder residue ending up in the chamber thus heating up the chamber excessively and making it very dirty and cleaning a chore. This gun will operate so much cooler and cleaner than a gas operated AR-10. It saves you time cleaning and your receiver and bolt assmebly last so much longer. There is also a setting on the gas piston  (piston driven gun not gas impingement) for using a suppressor. The rifle also featuers fully ambidextrious controls, and NP3 Nickel finish on the receiver which is just gorgeous, and enough picatinny rails to put whatever you will need on the gun and a quick detach sling fixture on the front left side of the forend. It takes magpul magazines and has Patriot Ordnance's proprietary trigger. POF states the gun should be MOA or better in accuracy, and told me that 0.7 MOA with  good ammo is very common. The rifle's MSRP is $2699 and the do not make it anymore in a 20 inch barrel, and that is too bad becasuse not only can you use it as a main battle rifle, you can also use it as a precision long range AR-10 that will shoot 1,000 yards and beyond with good ammunition. The 20 inch barrel gives you all the velocity to lauch those heavy 175 grain to 190 grain bullets fast enough to shoot 1100 - 1200 yards with control. You can also hunt with this rifle and take down anything that walks on the North American Continent with the right bullet. At 8.9 pounds this rifle is the lightest 20 inch barreled AR-10 on the market, except that these are now getting hard to come by because they are now only made in 18.5 inch and shorter barrels. You give up about 100fps when you drop from a 20 inch barrel to an 18.5 inch one. I've studied this. I'd rather have a 20 incher and get all the perforrmance.  Gun comes in a hard plastic case."

I ""think"" it's Russian, but I'm not certain - see pics. I have a third unopended spam can (440 rounds). Again, I ""think"" it's Russian, but I'm not certain - see pics. As these look to be 1985 and 1976 manufacture, they are most certainly corrosive. I don't know if the cans in the crate have openers as its sealed and will be sold sealed. The third can definately does not have an opener. The crate (two cans) is $300, the third spam can is $150 or $450 for all. I'll sell the can seperately but I'm not splitting up the crate. These have been stored under the stairs inside my home and off the floor (pallet) since I purchased them from on-line retalers years ago; so in ideal conditions. These spam cans have pretty much dried up. You won't find more economical ammo for your mosin-nagants.Price is absolutely firm. I'll need to see a MN drivers liscense for proof of age. I'm willing to meet at Arnzen arms in Eden Prairie or Fleet Farm in Carver. If the Ad is up, the ammo is still available. I'll only respond with a PHONE CALL so include your phone number with email.
