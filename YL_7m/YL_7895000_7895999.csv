All 5 for $70. I paid over $117.00 for them from the online CZ Custom store a couple months ago. Excellent condition and little use. I have 5. Four in Silver and one in gold. The gold was to indicate the first mag loaded with the extra bullet (Barney bullet) for use in USPSA competition. Anyway, I since then have purchased a different type/size that fits my hand better for my USPSA rig. So these are for sale and very new at about half price. The mag base colors will go with just about any pistol and look very cool. See picture of what they look like on my CZ Custom Shadow 2.Fits 9mm or .40 magazines. I used them on my new CZ Shadow 2. Call Scott for details at REDACTED.If you have a PayPal account I would ship them for $5. Thanks for inquiring."

The Spanish FR-8 Mauser Carbine was created for rear echelon troops when Spain was converting from Mauser rifles to CETME's.

The wood is dinged up from use over the years, but is in good condition other than that. More interesting about this rifle is that they didn't start issuing this model until the early 1950's and this one was made in 1949. The rifle include the bayonet and sling. Shipping is $30"

I put about 100 rounds down the pipe; it was a blast, and pricey. the gun runs well, especially with full power loads. it especially likes FMJ rounds- cast/unjacketed bullets are a no go. This gun has a gas system you can foul up with lead, and they don't feed well. Im open for just about any trade offer, with a preference to handguns. Otherwise ill do just about anything else. Multi-gun trade, milsurp, glock, sig, AR, AK, whatever! just shoot me an offer.or you can outright purchase it for 950. Comes with what I got with it; a magazine and nylon holster Respond to this or text me at 480-7IO-77O7. Thanks! (side note; if you reload I have some brass too)"

It will work as a sporter stock on a Saiga or vepr that has the trigger moved to the rear of receiver and will not require a pistol grip. It will also work for a standard AK with a pistol grip and acts as an extended stock that is longer than a regular ak stock, also it doesn't look strange used in conjunction with a pistol grip suprisingly, cut and paste the picture of it onto a regular ak with a pistol grip to see what it looks like. Like new, I removed it as soon as I got my rifle and replaced the furniture."
