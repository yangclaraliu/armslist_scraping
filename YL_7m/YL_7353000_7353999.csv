Based off of the GLOCK platform, ZEV pistols use ZEV’s own manufactured upper mated to a highly-modified stripped GLOCK frame fitted with ZEV parts. ZEV Technologies slides are precision machined from 17-4 stainless steel and coated with a durable Titanium Gray Coating/finish for superb wear resistance and durability. The tolerances are held extremely tight for increased consistency in barrel lockup and slide to frame fit, attributing to exceptional accuracy and performance. ZEV Technologies slides are also lighter than GLOCK, allowing for less perceived recoil when cycling, which reduces fatigue and attributes to a flatter shooting gun for faster follow up shots. The RMR cut allows for the use of the Trijicon RMR red dot sight, while co-witnessing iron sights. Alternatively, the cut can be covered with the ZEV RMR Adapter plate for a seamless appearance when using iron sights only. This slide, mated to the ZEV match grade stainless barrel, results in an extremely accurate, yet reliable pistol.The lower utilizes a highly modified Glock frame which has been professionally textured; the trigger guard is also undercut to allow for a higher grip on the gun. Both features allow for improved recoil management while ensuring the pistol is extremely comfortable in the hand. ZEV Technologies pistols also feature the Fulcrum trigger providing a crisp, clean, trigger pull with a very positive and short reset. The trigger is also fully adjustable for not only weight, but also length of pull (via overtravel and pre travel adjustments). The magazine release is oversized for quick access without the need to shift one’s grip on the pistol. Barrel-DLCZEV Technologies Match Grade drop-in Glock replacement barrels feature extremely tight tolerances and are manufactured with pre-hardened chromium stainless steel (416R) that was originally designed for use in Match Grade rifle barrels. This material provides high tensile strength and toughness to withstand typical chamber pressures while still being highly corrosion resistant.ZEV™ Match Grade barrel bores are some of the most precise in the industry. The threaded barrels come with 1/2 x 28 standard suppressor thread pitch. Every barrel is double honed (rough and finish) until a minimum surface finish of 16 RA is reached. During this process the barrels are held to a final dimension of +/- 0.0002"" for consistency and accuracy.The barrels are cut rifled and 100% inspected for groove dimensions and broach finish. Slide Cut- Spartan CutThis visually stylish slide was created for a special project ZEV did a few years ago. Since its creation many people have asked us to offer it as a signature cut. The wait is over! This slide takes some of the best and most requested features from our other slides and combines them into one. Its angled front and rear serrations offer plenty of grip without getting hung up on your holster and the small top serrations help to reduce glare. The window cuts on the top edge of the slide round out the slides highly customized look.

The 629-5 series was first to have the firing pin in the frame and the last 629 to not have the dreaded internal lock.  On this pistol, the double action trigger pull is buttery-smooth and single action is super-crisp (much better than my custom 1911) and only fired infrequently.  I'm only selling it because I have two other superb S&W 44s.  Search around and you'll see that this particular model is not easy to find and priced very fairly (no haggle price).  Price is firm so don't ask; not in a hurry to sell and just as happy to keep a great pistol.  Please don't ask me to trade for chinese made rifles or plastic guns...not interested.Transfer at Quantico Arms & Tactical Supply in Tacoma at buyer's expense (only $15 and excellent customer service).  Local face-to-face sale to Washington state concealed carry licensed buyer only (and no, you can't send a cashier check and have a friend pick it up for you)."

Aluminum has one major advantage, and a few disadvantages. The major advantage is the lighter weight, being half a pound lighter than the steel version. This weight advantage cannot be over-valued for those who carry frequently. Our aluminum frame is made from 7075, the strongest aluminum alloy available and the same material used in M-16/AR-15 assault rifle receivers. The tensile strength is more than adequate for the durability requirements. However, no aluminum is as abrasive resistant as steel because it is slightly softer on the surface. This means service life will be somewhat reduced, and the frame is easier to damage. A steel version might be expected to last many thousands of rounds of shooting. An aluminum frame will also last thousands of rounds, but certainly not as many as steel. The Kobra Carry Lightweight features the following: 4.25"" Commander model slide, single stack commander Bobtail frame. The John Browning traditional design innovatively modified for concealed carry, without significantly detracting from reliability or accuracy. 7075 Aluminum frame and Bobtail housing. All other components steel, identical to steel version Kobra Carry. Weight: approximately 27 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted. Exclusive Snakeskin treatment on forestrap, and aluminum Bobtail housing. A beautiful, unique, and snag free gripping surface. Gen4 coating for low glare, superior rust protection, and improved wear resistance. Matte finished slide for low glare, with snakeskin on rear of slide only. Ledge style U-notch plain black rear sight with .156 notch, for fast aquisition of close targets. Red fiber optic front sight (shown with optional front night sight). Slim wood grips for a thinner width. ""LW"" insignia on slide, which stands for ""Lightweight""."
