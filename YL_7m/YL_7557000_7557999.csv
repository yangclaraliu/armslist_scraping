No scratches. On gun, the 2 cartridges do have a little ware on paint from being loaded and unloaded but besides that gun works like a champ. The few times it was shot it was cleaned and has always been oiled.Gun description from website:The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01. The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

I purchased this pistol brand new from my FFL dealer a few months ago and have done little with it and prefer some of my other carry guns over the 19. I installed a set of Trijicon HD XR Tritium Night Sights using a MGW Sight Pusher so it was done correctly. After installing the sights I put the first and only box of ammo through the pistol (since new) to verify the sights were on. After the one range session I completely stripped the pistol down to springs (see pictures) in order to properly clean and lubricate before the next use. Included in the sale are the following items: Glock 19 Gen 4 BFG, three 15 round magazines, Glock provided ""speed loader"", lock, factory Glock case, paperwork, four backstraps, installed Trijicon HD XR sights along with original sights, one full box of Hornady Critical Duty +P ammo, and a Right Hand carbon fiber kydex holster from SAS Holsters with adjustable tension and cant.

This particular gun is sought after due to the ease in which it is converted to an SBR, after appropriate ATF approval of course. It is pretty much a long barreled Krinkov (google it) complete with hinged top cover and folding stock. I purchased the rifle on 1/27/17 from Copper Customs for $1299. In an effort to recoup taxes and FFL fees I'm asking $1500.00. I am willing to ship at buyers expense as long as your FFL will accept from an individual. Face to face transactions here in Boise will have to wait until 11/20, as I will be out of town until then. I accept PayPal (if you pay the fees), USPS Money Order, and Cash, face to face. Item is cross posted and the first person that gets me some money takes it. My email is m.ziegenhorn @yahoo.com and my phone number is REDACTED. Thanks for looking."
