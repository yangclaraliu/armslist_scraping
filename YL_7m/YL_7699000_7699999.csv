I'm mostly looking for dead presidents on old paper on this one, but am willing to entertain trades. Bear in mind this is around 1800 dollar trade value, so mid range to upper end stuff or multiple gun trades are what I’m looking for."

As you can see it has a midlength gas system and a fixed front sight gas block. It has had approximately 394 rounds of mostly Wolf steel case through it with one failure to cycle. The upper receiver itself is actually from Digital Tool and Automation in Minnesota. It is without a bolt carrier group. I will sell an Elzetta flashlight mount(ZFH1500) for an additional $15, other wise I'll just remove it before you buy. The light mount will come with the original packaging and spacers. Over all this upper works flawlessly though it is pretty scratched up. Also the receiver has M4 feed ramps.Please text, email, or leave me a voice mail at REDACTED."

Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package."

For Sale/Trade is an Olympic Arms AR-15 chambered in 5.56x45mm. Yes, you can shoot .223 Remington should you choose. 
Standard A2 style sight. Barrel is a 1/9 twist with factory furniture. Olympic Arms has an interesting story. They've been innovators in the  AR-15 world and have been producing parts for decades (although right now they're going through a complicated bankruptcy situation). This specific rifle is great, I personally am the type of person that likes to try things out for a while and then sell/trade as I see fit.Also, negotiations are fun. If you don't know how to negotiate, check out this article: https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/how-to-negotiate/P.S. I recognize that this rifle is a standard AR-15 and not a collectors item at this time. But please be reasonable with your offers (someone offered me $75 not too long ago). If you wouldn't take the offer, why should I?
