Comes with new USGI front sight that has not been sanded/filed and was professionally installed by Wright Armory. Comes with one 15-round magazine and six 30-round magazines. Also has windage and elevation adjustable rear sight, sling, and oiler. The Bad - At some point, someone tried to ""customize"" this carbine by adding a side-mounted scope mount, refinishing the stock to a lighter color, and adding a recoil reducing buttpad on the stock. When I acquired the carbine, I took it straight to the aforementioned gunsmiths and had them profesionally remove the scopemount. You will see where the markings on the front of the receiver are no longer there due to that process, the rear markings and serial number are intact on the receiver. It is also missing the USGI buttplate. The carbine is perfectly usable as-is, it is a good shooter. If someone wanted to make it ""correct"", a new stock would need to be sourced. The price I am asking reflects that; NPM M1 Carbines with all matching parts and in original condition regularly go for $1,100+No trades. No shipping at this time. Face-to-face in the valley with a valid Arizona driver's license. Permit to carry and/or Mil/LEO preferred."

Barska Contour 4x32 Rifl_escope Illumi-nated Red/Green Mil Dot
The 4x32 IR Contour Riflescope from Barska combines a weather-resistant housing and fully coated optics to create a day scope for close-range targets. In addition to pairing the scope with an AR or hunting rifle, this multi-purpose optic is also a viable option for crossbow mounting. The IR Contour scope has a Mil-Dot reticle that can be red or green illuminated depending on the shooting conditions. Red illumination will provide better contrast in low light and against a woodland landscape, green reticle illumination is more suitable for daylight conditions. Reticle color and brightness are selected using a dedicated side turret. A built-in sun shade, 1/4"" impact point correction turrets, and included Picatinny/Weaver scope rings equip this Contour series riflescope for a wide range of recreational shooting tasks."

It is a 45 acp or 45 auto caliber round and uses 1911 pistol magazines. It has a 16.5 barrel and wood stock. Both the wood stock and metal is in very good condition. I added a rail scope mount that is see-thru so you can use iron sights still and has a tru-glu red/green optic on it. This is a very fun gun to shoot and is very accurate with no recoil. It hasn't been fired much and is easy to tell by the condition of it. These are not made anymore and are going for a good amount if you can find one.

I also had better eyes. Its a sporterized Winchester-made 1917 Enfield with an aftermarket peep sight made by ""Pacific"". The rifle shoots well, though whoever did the front sight blade used soft copper. Thus, watch out to prevent accidently banging it. It also performs well with standard ammunition you find at the store currently.The gun may be sporterized, but it still retains a lot of the original characteristics of a time when we still machined and hand fitted firearms at the factory.I am willing to entertain offers, but usually when I place my faith in humanity, I get lowballed or obviously ridiculous offers. I am going to give it a go again, but if I get something silly I am not going to respond."
