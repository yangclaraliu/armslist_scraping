I had this built in the mid 1990’s and have shot it very little. It has had sporadic feeding issues since it was built. Sometimes it runs flawlessly and sometimes I can’t get through a single magazine without a failure to feed. I lost interest and it has been getting shuffled around my safe for over 20 years. I don’t have the time, or desire to mess with it and I need the safe space. I believe it wouldn’t take much to make this a reliable battle rifle.
The rifle was assembled with US made parts and stock. All original factory components and 7 like new 20 rd Belgian magazines included. The price for the rifle, spare parts and magazines is $750.00 Mostly looking to sell, but open to the idea of interesting trades. I am located 40 miles NW of Lafayette, but travel to Valparaiso several times a week.

The hard-chromed barrel bore reduces barrel wear and protects it from corrosion. The falling locking block design provides good accuracy and operability with suppressors due to the in-line travel of the barrel. This is in contrast to the complex travel of Browning designed barrels. The magazine release button is reversible with simple field tools. Beretta now manufactures magazines that hold fewer than the factory standard 15 rounds. These magazines have heavier crimping (deeper indentations in the side) to reduce the available space while still keeping the same external dimensions and ensuring that these magazines can be used on existing firearms. This is a very durable and reliable weapon trust me you won't be disappointed cuz she's got you. Shipping fee, handling and insurance is just $50. There would also be a warranty for one year on it."

The RFB uses metric FAL magazines,[6] which insert straight into the magazine well and do not need to rock into place. It has a short-stroke gas piston operating system. The rifle uses a patented forward-ejection system via a tube placed over the barrel that ejects the spent case forwards, over the handguard of the rifle. Extraction is accomplished by two extractors, each with two axis of rotation. The extractors may move side-to-side to engage the rim of the case, and pivot upwards to extract the spent case after firing. Empty cases remain in the ejection chute until either the weapon is tilted downwards, the charging handle is operated, or they are pushed out by following cases. Cases drop gently from this chute to the left of the barrel.This is one hell of a weapon system. And it also comes with light and laser installed in the original box. On purchase of this gun a warranty would also be given."

I have only shot about 100 rounds out of this when I first got it. It was used but I doubt it was used very much due to how good condition it is in.

It is all metal with aluminum alloy frame, stainless slide, and stainless barrel. It has an ambidextrous safety/de-cocker lever, a slide release lever, a magazine release, and a magazine disconnect which disables the trigger when the magazine is removed. It is thin, at barely an inch wide, making it a favorite for concealed carry.The trigger is DA first shot with following shots SA. The difference between this pistol and others claiming to be double action is that the first shot is true double action. The hammer strikes every time the trigger is pulled just like a revolver. Trigger pull is very smooth with DA pull at about 10 lbs and SA pull at about four lbs. A short reset allows quick follow up shots. Comes with 3, 8 round magazines, manual and original case.

Also has a Hogue grip that fits much better in the hand. I’ve carried this gun for the last 6+ years on my person. Great for any occasion due to being able to throw it in an empty pocket and go. I also have an outside the wasteband holster that’s included and the original box and nylon pouch. The gun is highlighted with green accents done with enamel paint that can easily come off with some acetone. Not looking for any trades unless it’s a G42 or G43. Asking $350 firm due to all the upgrades that completely change the pistol from the standard horrible LCP to an actual practical and useful defense pistol. Gun also has some custom stippling for added grip considering it’s such a small weapon. Thanks for looking. Feel free to text Kris @ eightfourthree-345-threezerothreethree"
