Gun is in excellent working condition, no issues whatsoever regardless of ammunition used. Chambered for 2.75"" shells. This firearm also has the much sought after SLAMFIRE ability; holding down the trigger allows the slide to be worked continuously with the hammer dropping at the end of each pump stroke. Very cool!Bluing is heavily worn but no surface rust or pitting, just some staining. Stock and forearm are in solid and well-worn condition with no cracks or gouges. Buttplate is in near perfect condition, likely a replacement part.

The reason for its popularity is because it shoots great, looks great and is remarkably affordable – about half the price of the competition’s rifles. The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself.The Henry Lever Action also features side ejection, an adjustable rear sight, a hooded front sight and a 3/8″ grooved receiver for mounting a scope. The blued steel barrel is machined with state of the art multiple groove rifling. The result is a highly accurate shooterThe barrel length is 18¼”, overall length is 36¼” and it weighs in at a very comfortable 5¼ pounds. The easy to load tubular magazine can handle 15 rounds of .22 Long Rifle, 17 rounds of .22 Long and as many as 21 rounds of .22 Short, making it a viable alternative to a semi-automatic .22.

A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic’s front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 mount for the PRO Optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic’s front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in a emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.Features:– Always red – always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. No need to fumble with switches prior to use.– 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.– In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking and maintenance easy.– Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared to iron sights and magnified scopes.– Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with Aimpoint 3X Magnifiers and Concealed Engagement unit.– Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.– Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD).– Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.– Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with both covers closed in an emergency.– Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces.– Modular mount set up for use on flat-top AR15, M4 Carbine and M16 rifles. (Adapter available for carry handle mounting)– Removable spacer. Remove for use on shotguns and sub-guns.– QRP2 rail grabber mount. Snap knob three times for a perfect mount.

This sale is for just the frame, (which is considered the firearm) no slide assembly. It has all original Glock parts in it and has never been modified. This frame is ready for any full-size slide assembly; just slide it on and it's good to go. You can use this lower for anything from .22LR and 9mm up to .40 and .357 Sig. You could also use this for use in a MechTech, or a dedicated training pistol with a .22LR conversion kit.Originally I was going to use this lower and a .22LR kit as a dedicated .22LR pistol but have shifted gears towards other projects so I have to sell. This frame is used but saw less than 100 rounds through it while I've owned it. It was used before I bought it but is in excellent shape. This would be perfect for a custom stipple job if you don't want to modify your brand new Glock lower. With one complete upper you can switch between lowers with ease. For example, take your G17, G22, G31, G34 or G35 Gen 3 or aftermarket slide assembly (slide, barrel and recoil spring) and simply put it on this lower. You could also make this into a competition lower and replace the trigger and other internals, while keeping your new Glock lower completely stock for carry (many people don't advise carrying a firearm with a modified trigger, especially if it's been modified specifically for competition shooting). We must meet at a gun store. We must meet at a gun store in PA. Absolutely no exceptions. Do not waste your time or mine trying to convince me to sell this to you without a transfer. This is considered a handgun and must be transferred by an FFL. If you are a NJ resident, make sure you have all that you need in order to legally take possession of this firearm. It is your responsibility to make sure you can legally purchase and own this firearm (from what I understand, NJ residents must apply for a purchasing license and have a license to own each individual firearm). I will not travel to NJ. If you're a NJ resident you must travel to PA to compete this sale. If you pay my asking price and meet me at my FFL in South Philly I will cover the transfer fee! If you wish to meet at an FFL of your choice then the transfer fee is on you. I am willing to meet at any FFL in PA within a ~30 minute drive of Philly (not including traffic, so pretty much anywhere).Included in this sale is the original Glock case, all original paperwork (including the spent case from the factory) all with matching serials. It also includes the Glock cleaning rod and .40 brush. Feel free to message me with any questions.

Product Description The VP Series is Heckler & Koch's first striker-fired HK since the P7 series pistols introduced in the 1980s. It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. The VP Series integrates a striker firing system with an enhanced, HK ""light pull"" trigger. HK's cold hammer-forged barrel made from cannon grade steel ensures long service life, as does the polygonal bore profile which also provides a slight increase in muzzle velocity. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame, and the paddle-style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A unique VP feature is HK's patented rear-mounted charging supports on each side of the slide provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP SK subcompact models feature a more concealable design with a shorter barrel, abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail, and a compact grip frame which retains the adjustable VP grip feature of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels.

MOS has four plate options to comply with the specifications of some of the most trusted optic manufacturers in the industry, and a cover plate when no optic is mounted. MOS gives you the option of adding tall iron sights allowing the optic and the iron sights to co-witness. This pistol does not include the modular sight, just the bracket to mount it on.

-Factory Case
-Original Manual
-HK branded cable lock
-Original diaopter sights
-HK branded tool for adjustment and disassembly-The vertical grip is also an HK product and marked as such.  -TROY rail covers, the only non HK parts on the gun besides the optic.The weapon has less than 1000 rounds through its 16"" barrel and the exterior is in very good condition with the painted factory markings still crisp and bright and the black finish unmarred.   This rifle is currently wearing an Eotech EXPS3 holographic weapon with a matching Eotech G33 magnifier on a flip to side mount.  This is an excellent pairing of optic and rifle, however should you not be interested the optic may be omitted and a comparable discount negotiated.
Please note that while all STANAG magazines will work perfectly well, first and second generation Magpul PMags will not lock into place properly with this rifle.  Current third generation PMags work without any problems.Contact me if you have any questions.  This is an excellent example of the type and it will be a great addition (or start!) to any HK collection.  Further pictures are available upon request!
As the rifle was purchased in California it does currently wear a 'bullet button' magazine lock, however the original magazine release will be included with your purchase and the weapon may be easily restored to standard condition once outside the state.  Due to the somewhat convoluted laws regarding firearm ownership in the state of California at this time, I am looking for buyers OUTSIDE of the state unless you are authorized to receive an assault weapon in California.  There is a small amount of exterior wear on the vertical grip from normal use."
