Everyone who has tried it agrees that Bushnell hit a home run. Leveraging successful design features from their Bushnell Elite series, Bushnell has arrived at an outstanding scope at a very competitive price. Great features like a 34mm tube, first focal plane magnification and locking target turrets make the HDMR an excellent value, and credible contender in a competitive tactical optics market. The Horus H59 Reticle The H59 is a normal mil-based; standard Horus subtended 0.2 mil reticle with newly added extended mil dots to keep the reticle clean while giving more wind capability. The Accuracy 1st Speed Shooting Formula has been implemented into the reticle to allow fast accurate acquisition of targets by a refined milling-to-drop method. LT104 mount The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief. The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping."

The next one is a x foxx tactical iwb tuckable holster for glock 17/19/26 but its missing one of the clips which shouldn't be hard to replace. The next two are notning special one is a nylon iwb that i used to carry an xd9 in and glock and the other is a blackhawk belt holster for a glock 26/27 which isnt a bad holster its just not my style.
