These include nickel plated bolt and lever (Winchester nitre blued or blackened the exposed surfaces on these two parts) and butt plate (not blued), and extra length special order 28” barrel. The original caliber was 40/82 but was rebored and re-rifled by the factory to 45-70 (probably during the 1896 return to the factory listed in the Cody info). This was at a time when the Army was releasing large stocks of surplus 45-70 ammunition as they transitioned to the Krag rifle, and many 1886s and Marlins were converted to take advantage of plentiful ammunition. The original 40-82 caliber was over stamped, and the initials of the Winchester gunsmith were added. The ""REFINISHED"" mark is a Winchester factory stamping that was added when guns were customized or otherwise underwent significant overhaul. There is some discussion of these marks here: The gun was well cared for and has survived in excellent condition. The original smooth satin finish of the deluxe stocks has not been glossed up with additional oil, and wood only has small, scattered marks in it. Although fading, the color case hardening is still quite nice, with some forging striations on the receiver starting to show through with age. The bore is excellent with sharp lands and grooves. The barrel and magazine tube have excellent rust bluing with loss mainly on the high points of the metal. Screws are not damaged (its only finish wear on the high points in the photos) and still retain lots of their nitre blue finish, as does the loading gate. Screws were removed with properly fitting screwdriver tips wrapped with thin tape and absolutely no damage was done to the screws when removing the wood for this photo set.Sale includes an original hang tag and Cody research info. This is an excellent antique 1886 deluxe Winchester with some interesting special order features. As this was manufactured prior to Jan 1st, 1899, it is considered an antique gun by the feds, and can be shipped directly to you, unless your state requires antiques to go to an FFL. Certified payments only please. Please check out my other auctions too."

This carbine, serial #1729642 was manufactured in 1950. As for condition the receiver retains 99% of its original bright blue finish. The original 20"" round barrel and full magazine also retain 99% of their original bright bluing. The original walnut stocks are in excellent condition, retaining all of their original finish and showing only very minimal light handling marks. The action is tight and smooth, mechanically like new. The bore is MINT. The screws are excellent. The sights are original and like new. It still retains the original hood for the front sight. The buttplate retains all of its original bluing as well, which is almost unheard of as this always shows a little wear from storage. The hammer, lever, bolt and internals show the gun has only been cycled a minimal amount of times. There is no evidence the carbine has been carried even. In all this is an outstanding example of a very collectible Model 94. This gun would make an excellent vintage hunting rifle or a great addition to ones collection. I have provided over 70 photos and offer a 3 day inspection period so you can bid with confidence. All pictures were taken outdoors in natural light and provide an accurate depiction of its condition, if anything I feel the gun looks better when held in person as the camera lightens up the look of the finish some. I will need a signed C&R or FFL to ship. Insurance is included with shipping. Thank you for looking."

The most common variation of a Diamondback is a 4in 38 blue model, and on down the line. Thus, a very scarce combination would be a factory nickel snubnose, which this revolver is! This Diamondback also comes with the original box and paperwork, the coin SAT and the original sales receipt! What a package! SN - D47848. This particular revolver was carried some by the previous owner. There is some tarnish noted to the backstrap and the left side of the frame, above the cylinder release. There is some corrosion unfortunately but the spots are relatively small. The main 2 spots are on the cylinder with a few smaller spots also on cylinder, as pictured. There are also 2 small spots noted on the left side of the barrel. There is a tiny spot on the frame below the cylinder, on the left side. I took good pictures of all of these spots to show what they are. This revolver could be refinished to look great again, but I will leave that to the next owner. This Colt revolver works properly in all ways, and the timing is perfect - I checked each chamber. The bore and chambers are perfect. The grips show light wear, but nothing serious. Aside from those spots, this revolver has much going for it other than its inherent rarity. First, the box not only has the correct end label, but it numbers to the gun as well. The box shows wear, but we know its an original partly because of that. With all of the knockoffs coming out of China today, you cannot be too careful! The grips also serial number to the gun, which is great. The test target numbers to the gun, as does the warranty card. This gun shipped in 1971 to a suburb of Pittsburgh PA, and I am only the second owner since 1971! Hard to believe, but true. In addition to being a great firearm, the investment potential is incredible with many firearms, and Colts are certainly in the ""blue chip"" category. Of the Colts, the snake guns need no introduction for desirability or collectibility. The rare variations of the snake guns are even better yet. Don't let this Diamondback get away! Good Luck!!!"

It has the aftermarket aluminum recover block instead of the plastic piece of garbage that come with the original kit. Stamped ""DEMO"" because it is a Dealer's model we bought because we received a question about them from a customer. We ended up not offering them because we are a custom gun shop that builds high end ARs and Glocks. A bump stock doesn't exactly belong on an AR with a $400 barrel and $250 two-stage trigger. Regardless of the stamp, it is fully functional. I just fired a magazine using it yesterday and it works like a charm. Make me a reasonable offer. I'm not looking for $800(+) like they are getting on Gun Broker, but I'm not going to give it away, either.

I work as a custom gunsmith, I don't want the AR you put together from PSA or Anderson kits in your kitchen. Especially if you don't know about things like galvanic corrosion and don't own a torque wrench. -Reloading Equipment. I don't really need components, as I'm a little picky, or single stage presses, but hardware like RCBS powder dispenser/scale combo, progressive presses(more than happy to add cash for certain Dillon presses). -If you've got something else to trade, just ask, I promise I won't be an ass about it."
