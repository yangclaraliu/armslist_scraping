This chronograph will provide an accurate velocity reading from speeds of 5 to 9,999 fps within .25% accuracy. Caldwell achieved this level of accuracy by using a high speed 48 MHz processor and calibrating every unit after assembly before it leaves the factory. The chronograph also remains simple to use giving a readout of velocity in Feet per second or Meters per second on a large LCD screen. Extra wide sun screens are included for shading in full sun operation along with a 1/4-20 threaded insert on the bottom of the housing for use with a tripod. For shooters looking to fully take advantage of this chrono, this unit includes a 15' audio jack cable which can be plugged into an iPhone or iPad to use a free app called ""Ballistic Chronometer"" available for download. This app will display the velocity of each shot on the screen and record it with other data identifying the current load and environmental conditions during the shooting session. Other data calculated by the app include average velocity, standard deviation, minimum velocity, maximum velocity, and velocity spread for shot string. This data is stored and can easily be exported through email or SMS messaging or simply stored for recall on a later date. Take your shooting to the next level with the Ballistic Precision Chronograph by Caldwell."

This is a one owner gun purchased new in 1976 by me. This shotgun is in AWESOME condition. Very light use on the trap range. Truly a one owner gun for 35 years. I am not a gun dealer so please look closely at the photos and come to your own conclusion regarding condition. The condition was put at 98% by my local gun shop. The Smith & Wesson Model 1000 was produced between 1972 and 1984. It was produced by Howa Machinery in Japan, the same manufacturer of the Howa 1500/Weatherby Vanguard series of rifles. The M1000 is gas operated and is comparable to the Remington 1100. When S&W discontinued the shotgun, the design was taken up by Mossberg. Despite the relatively short production run, the M1000 is built to high standards, and is very reliable. The alloy receiver is engraved and the cap on the pistol grip sports a beautiful Smith and Wesson symbol. This particular gun come with two ribbed barrels. One is 28 inches long and the second is a 30 inches ribbed barrel and both have a modified choke. The finish on the shotgun is in excellent condition. The wood finish is beautiful awesome. With a modified choke, the M1000 would be useful for shooting to medium distances making it useful for hunting or target shooting. The magazine holds 3 rounds plus 1 in the chamber for a total of 4. If you are looking for a dual-purpose shotgun, the M1000 is a fine choice. On the other hand, if you are a collector of all-things Smith and Wesson, the M1000 is a must have. Please take a very good look at the pictures provided and ask any and all questions that you may have before bidding on this item, as I do not offer refunds or exchanges on any of my personal guns items. Will ship only to current, valid FFL dealer. Will not ship or sell to California or international buyers or locations. Cash, bank check, personal check, PayPal or money orders. No credit card payments. If you wish to use PayPal, please add 3% to the sale price. All funds must clear completely before item will be shipped. No exceptions. This is not a business for me. I am simply selling my personal firearms. I will be happy to answer any of your questions. Thanks and good luck."

Double-Action trigger pull is heavy but smooth. Single-action is light, crisp, and has a great reset. This gun has double-strike capability, but I've never had to use it.It came from the factory with two magazines, a magazine loader, two Taurus Security System keys, large and medium and small backstraps (medium is installed), and the user manual. You get all that plus another magazine (for a total of three magazines) and a right-handed angle-adjustable Cytac paddle holster.It's been a tremendously reliable gun. I put about 200 rounds through it altogether. It shot whatever ammo I fed it - brass, steel, and even aluminum case. No malfunctions. I'm selling it to buy another full-size Taurus."

Built on a Remington 700 action. 28"" Shilen 9 twist barrel that finishes at .960"". Shilen competition trigger. McMillan M40A1-htg stock, professionally bedded. Talley lightweight rings. Burris XTR312 3x-12x tactical scope with illuminated Ballistic MilDot reticle. The scope has been recently gone through by Burris. They rebuilt the objective lens pack, rebuilt the parallax adjustment, resealed and nitrogen purged, then recoil tested. Also included will be RCBS standard dies, brass, remaining handloads with 175 grain Nosler Accubond Long Range over H1000 (G1 bc of .672 at 3150 fps).  A few factory loads. (Nosler 160 grain Accubond at 3280 fps)I had the barrel scoped at my gunsmith and he said ""It looks good, definitely not shot out."" I bought it used, so the exact round count is unknown to me. My smith said that the work appears to have been done by Shilen, given the markings on the barrel. Due to the weight of the rifle, around 14.5 pounds, the recoil on the bench is more pleasant than an 8 pound 7mm Rem Mag. Asking $1500. I will not even consider a low ball offer for $3000 or more worth of custom precision. This rifle shoots 1/2"" groups with Nosler factory ammo. Also shot a .75"" 6 shot group with the ABLR with 6 different powder charges while doing a ladder workup.  The only trades I would consider would be a high end rifle in more of a lighter weight hunting configuration, (Sako, Weatherby, Remington Custom), or a high end tactical shotgun. (Benelli, Beretta 1301, or Wilson 870)Let me know if you have any questions."
