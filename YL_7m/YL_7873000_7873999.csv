The butt has been heavily modified with pieces of wood added. Excellent bore. Excellent working order. Markings are clear. Equipped with a Paker-Hale scope mount on the left side of the receiver.

More competition-oriented, the Pro Series has two major improvements over the basic M&P pistols. First, the Pro Series uses a Novak® green (or red) fiber-optic front sight and a Novak® Reduced Glare rear sight. A plain black rear sight is gaining popularity among today’s action pistol shooters. The low rake angle of the rear sight cuts down glare. Since both sights are dovetail mounted, both may be changed to M&P tritium night sights for departments that require them.     
Perhaps the biggest improvement in the Pro Series over the basic M&P pistols is the enhanced trigger system. Most serious shooters who use the M&P9L upgrade the trigger with an after-market “hard sear” or complete Competition Action Enhancement Kit from Apex Tactical Specialties. Try a Google search with “M&P9L trigger pull” and you will get a screen full of blog posts and YouTube videos on improving the trigger pull and on websites selling trigger-pull improvement kits.
For the Pro Series pistols, the S&W Performance Center adds a different sear, and polishes some of the mating surfaces in the trigger group. The basic M&P pistols, including the M&P9L, have an average trigger pull of 6.5 pounds. The smoothed-out Pro Series pistols have an average trigger pull of 4.5 pounds. (The Glock 34/35 trigger averages 4.5 pounds compared to 5.5 pounds for most other Glocks.) The Pro Series trigger group has less slack than the basic M&P pistol and also a much shorter trigger reset distance. The Pro Series trigger is simply amazing.
Bridging the gap between main production and the Performance Center, the Smith & Wesson Pro Series represents the next step up from standard production line models. M&P Pro Series pistols include numerous enhancements yet still remain true to “stock”. Bringing competition specifications and features in factory models, the Pro Series offers that ready-to-go package while still maintaining production line integrity.

I've been wearing Incog holsters for about 4 years now, and have been through 2x pistol classes wearing one. They hold up extremely well, are very comfortable and the retention is excellent. This design has two dimples to lock into the trigger guard. I've adjusted the retention to have a nice ""click"" and lock. Locktite has been applied, but you can adjust as you need.The reason I'm selling is I've sold the pistol to a family member who already has light + holster, so I no longer have a need for the combo.At the time of this posting, the cost of the pair, without considering taxes and shipping, exceeds $170.Asking $150 for the pair, and I'll pay any shipping costs."

Rifle has no pitting and is good condition. Was my squirrel gun for years so the plastic stock has a few small scrapes from being out in the woods. Look up a YouTube video on these rifles, they are very accurate. This isn’t a $400 rifle but always served me well in taking a variety of small game. I am open to trade for other firearms or possibly Bows. Do not hesitate to ask. Askibg price is $100. Could get more but need the $"
