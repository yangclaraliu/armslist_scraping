I paid $750 new for the gun and scope. Make offer. Detailed description below:call or text Brian: REDACTEDI can also send any pictures you want.The Accura V2 LR features a 30” fluted barrel, with a 1:28 twist rate, which is engineered for long distance shooting. Each Bergara barrel is made from high quality, 416-grade nitride-treated stainless steel, making it near corrosion-proof and extremely accurate. The salt bath nitride process coats the barrel inside and out, virtually eliminating corrosion and pitting that can reduce accuracy over the life of the rifle. The Bergara barrel on the CVA Accura V2 LR does not come drilled and tapped for open sights, but comes with a Durasight™ Dead-On scope mount, which is ready straight out-of-the-box for scopes with up to a 44mm objective lens. CVA decided not to drill and tap the LR for open sights for one reason, the rifle was made to be a long distance muzzleloader, and even with the best fiber optic sights, a 200 yard target acquisition is next to impossible.Each rifle is equipped with a Nitride version of CVA’s patented Quick Release Breech Plug (QRBP), which is a unique tool-free design and is easily removed by hand. CVA’s Blackhorn 209 QRBP, which is recommended when using Blackhorn 209 loose powder, will work perfectly with the Accura Long Range. New for 2016, we also carry the Blackhorn 209 Breech Plug with a Nitride coating, to fully match the appearance of the Accura Nitride models.Cleaning the rifle is quick and easy, as the break action design quickly and easily exposes the firing pin and breech plug for removal. The Accura Long Range comes with the CVA Palmsaver Ramrod, which helps the cleaning and loading process by protecting your hand, and provides more torque when seating your bullet or running a patch through the barrel.The Accura LR features a fully adjustable trigger, which offers the ability to fine-tune the trigger pull for each shooter. Most CVA triggers are set around 4 lbs from the factory. The LR is engineered to comfortably fit a right or left-handed shooter, featuring raised cheek plates on either side of the stock, as well as a reversible hammer spur. The thumbhole stock is outfitted with Realtree’s Max 1 Camo, and this muzzleloader comes with a matching Quake Claw rifle sling. The Soft-Touch Camo thumbhole stock keeps the wrist at a comfortable angle for steadier shots. The soft rubberized grips along the forestock and rear thumbhole create an extremely comfortable shooting platform. This muzzleloader also sports a CrushZone™ Recoil Pad that will help dampen recoil, even with magnum 150-grain powder loads.CVA guarantees the Accura will be the most accurate muzzleloader you’ll ever shoot, or your money back. Over the past year, the Accura LR has been tried and tested by hunters all across the country, and has met or exceeded expectations. The Accura LR also carries CVA’s Lifetime Warranty, that can be handed down to the next generation."

Many collectors and shooters consider the refinements of the 'Twentyseven Dash Two' to be the pinnacle of Smith and Wesson's 'Pre-Lock, Pinned & Recessed' production- with an additional premium placed on these early 'S' serial numbered guns due to the extra care usually taken to polish, fit, and finish these fine revolvers. This all original example shows shows only minor signs of use, is in excellent physical and mechanical condition, and retains it's near perfect original grips. All the case hardening remains on the hammer and trigger, gun locks up very tight, and both the single and double actions are smooth as glass. It's accuracy with Old School Class. They just don't make 'em like this any more, guys-and you won't be disappointed with this one. It'll make a great shooter, hunter, or target revolver-as well as grace any collection.
