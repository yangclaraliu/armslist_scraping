As the current state of the suppressor industry grows and evolves, the demand for a high-tech, cost effective suppressor becomes more apparent.  The new Turbo™ utilizes a tubeless design made from heat treated 17-4 stainless steel along with a heat treated 718 Inconel blast baffle. The combination of these materials allows the suppressor to be full auto rated and designed for rigorous use. The overall length measures 6.5” with a 1.5625” diameter -all while weighing in at a surprising 13.5 oz. Having an average sound pressure level of 134dB on a 14.5” AR shooting 55 grain ammo, the Turbo™ is well within the hearing safe threshold of 140 dB.  Built with the same care, quality, and attention to detail that has defined the YHM®brand for generations. With an MSRP of $489 (which includes a Q.D. brake) the Turbo™ was created to supply the modern suppressor community with a full-featured suppressor at an affordable price. This suppressor only takes YHM-3102 Q.D. Flash Hiders and the YHM-5M2-QD Muzzle Brake. Specs:  Weight:...............................13.5oz Diameter:...........................1.562” Length:..................................6.5” Construction:.....................17-4 Ph SS / Inconel Mount:................................Q.D.

The Geissele trigger is a 2 stage trigger, the first stage=2.5 pounds, the second stage=1 pound, the total pull is 3.5 pounds. The scope pictured on the rifle has been sold. The back up iron sights are Magpul MBUS Pro 45 degree flip up offset sights ($150). To top it all off the rifle was outfitted with a Haley Strategic one to two point multicam sling ($100). This rifle is in excellent condition with only about 100 rounds down range. The total package minus the scope cost me approximately $2,000. Im asking $1500 or best offer. You won’t find a nicer rifle with all of these upgrades for less. I have plenty of other pictures feel free to call or text REDACTED anytime for more information or if you have any questions. I’m only selling this rifle bc I have a take home patrol rifle from my police department and have no need for it."

These adjustable triggers are specially designed for competition, hunting, tactical, and military use, where both accuracy and robustness are critical. As an adjustable trigger, the first and second stage weight distribution, as well as, total pull weight, over-travel, and sear engagement are all to be tuned to the shooters preference.The Geissele Service Spring SetThe Geissele Hi-Speed Service is designed for NRA High Power Service Rifle competition. It is an approved trigger for use in CMP sanctioned competitions such as: National Trophy, NTIT and all Excellence In Competition matches. Service Rifle competitions require military-based weapons to meet certain criteria, one of which is a minimum trigger pull weight of 4.5 lbs. Our Service Rifle Trigger includes our exclusive 5-Coil trigger spring which will give a nominal 4 lbs. on first stage. The Service trigger pull weights are biased with most of the pull weight on the first stage. This will allow a light second stage with an icicle-sharp break, effectively giving your weapon a match-grade trigger let-off."

(only 2 mags are in the pictures) Have the finger extensions for all three, but one of them has the flush steel plate to keep it small. Has the slide lock hex key gun safety with it. Only a soft holster for it that's mostly just for storage in the BOB. When I carried it I used a G26 holster that I now use for my 19. It has the origial smooth ""carry"" grip, but it's too smooth for me. I had always just wrapped it with electricians tape. But that looked ghetto so I put a pachmayr grip that's not been fired with. Must be 21 and have a valid NM I.D. and be able to legally purchase a handgun. send me your number and I'll text you. Meet at one of the calibers.."

It is brand new in the box just recently purchased &  never fired!  The only reason I am considering selling this pistol is because it does not fit my hand properly I have very large hands so I am limited to full-size grips and this one leaves me with my pinky hanging & with most people that doesn't happen if you have a Glock 19 generation four and it fits you this will fit you better  and more comfortably. This is the best concealed carry option available at the moment in my opinion and the reviews are  raving about the trigger it really is amazing at 4 to 5 pounds it is very light and smooth and it is a  crisp single action.  Triggers  like this normally have to be purchased aftermarket. 2-mags, Manual, sticker  and all of the factory stuff. $325 cash /NO TAX OR FEE  just an Ohio drivers license valid/ or CCW and it's yours  you get everything in the picture. * this pistol also has the bonus of being modular rumor has it Ruger is going to be releasing grip frame modules so you will have a pistol that you can swap frames with that is a  huge advantage *"
