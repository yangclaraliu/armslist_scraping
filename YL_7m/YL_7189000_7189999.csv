Has a versacarry which I find to be the easiest and most comfortable way to conceal. For self defense, if you hit with this gun, the threat will be neutralized or your money back. Made for the very serious business of self-preservation the 605 is built to the Taurus Zero Tolerance standard in design, fabrication, fit and performance. Meaning there is simply no tolerance for parts that do not perform as if someone's life depends on them. Using the powerful .357 Magnum ammo this quick-draw revolver has plenty of muscle to back it up. Features include fixed sights, crisp single-double action trigger and a transfer bar for added safety.

The X-Series grip module is exclusive to this line and features a deeper trigger guard undercut, a higher back strap and an extended beavertail to ensure a higher grip for better recoil management. It also comes standard with a removable grip weight for improved balance, as well as a removable magazine funnel and extended slide catch lever to facilitate faster reloads. Like all X-Series P320s, the X-Five has the straight trigger that breaks at 90 degrees for an even better feeling pull. The 5"" bull barrel and lightened slide pair perfectly for match-grade accuracy and are equipped with Dawson Precision® Fiber Optic front and fully-adjustable rear sights. Additionally, the rear sight plate can be easily removed as a unit and replaced with a ROMEO1 optic, which means every P320 X-Five pistol is optics-ready right out of the box.

The stock appears to be about an inch short. As you know, these rifles never had bayonet lugs. The barrel is in excellent shape. Appears to have had a refinish done at some time in the past.  It does have the French metal sling piece on the stock. The stock is matching to the rifle."

With its digital control switch, users can adjust up to eight daytime brightness level settings and six night vision modes yielding superior variability. The magnesium alloy housing converges with the sustained performance of up to 1,000 hours of battery life to provide exceptional functionality. The all new locking quick detach mount ensures the sight remains secured to the weapon. The device features a fully submersible shockproof frame for up to .50 caliber recoil, and a protective hood shielding it from impact. The Ultra Shot M-Spec LQD is also equipped with a dual-pane, parallax corrected lens system providing accurate shooting from 10 yards to infinity.
This M-Spec uses an accelerometer that detects motion, so if the rifle sits motionless for more than 5 minutes, the attached sight will shut off. When the rifle is picked up or moved the sight will turn on again. This feature was implemented to conserve battery life and gives shooters an option to keep the M-Spec in a “sleep” mode and stay ready at a moment’s notice."

This gun has a factory milled slide with a battle worn finish on it. Very good looking gun. I bought it new for $650 and I've added night sights since then. Comes with the box and 3 mags at $600 this is a great value. Text me with questions or for more pics. The pic on here doesn't do it justice.

This collectible P01 model comes in olive drab and sports a decocker and NATO-approval NSN number on the left side. I purchased this from an acquaintance and decided that, since it was a special edition, I'd rather see it go to a good home since I'd rather not mess up the finish. I have not fired this pistol and the previous owner said he fired less than fifty rounds to check for function. As such the trigger is not broken in but the pull can be improved by use and dry-firing.
 
There are only two blemishes on the pistol that I can tell, one being a tiny mark by the take down knob, likely caused by the disassembly tool. The other are two small marks on the bottom of the picatinny rail caused by a weapon light. The only upgrade I performed was the addition of less-abrasive grip panels so that the next owner can carry it more comfortably. The original grips are included. I prefer cash but I am open to trades. Feel free to email me for more pictures and/or information."
