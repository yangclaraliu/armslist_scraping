Model: G30 Serial Number: 1202175B Year of Manufacture: Modern Caliber: .300 Winchester Magnum Action Type: Bolt Action, Internal Magazine Fed Rifle with Hinged Floorplate Markings: The right side of the barrel is marked “.300 WIN. MAG.” with Griswold’s logo and “GRISWOLD BROTHERS GUNSMITHING / VENTURA, CA”. The left side of the receiver is marked with McMillan’s logo and “McMILLAN / PHOENIX, ARIZONA USA”. The butt of the grip has a sticker that reads “McM”. The recoil pad is marked “Decelerator”. Barrel Length: 24”, with threading near the muzzle; the muzzle diameter is 0.59”, the barrel, before the threading, is 0.80” in diameter and the barrel reads 1.280”. Sights / Optics: The rifle does not have provisions for iron sights, the top of the receiver has a picatinny scope base currently installed. Stock Configuration & Condition: The stock is a McMillian M40A-1 HTG (general purpose hunting) camo stock. The stock free floats roughly 21 ½” of the barrel. The inside channel is fiberglass filled to perfectly mate with the rest of the barrel and receiver portion. The sides of the forend and pistol grip have nice texturing for traction. The stock has a semi-pistol grip and fluted Monte Carlo comb. The stock shows scattered scuffs, some of which penetrate the outer paint but mostly goes unnoticed since the stock has a camouflaged pattern. There are no cracks or chip losses. The LOP measures 13 5/8” from the front of the trigger to the back of the black solid rubber shotgun-style Decelerator recoil pad; the pad is set with a black spacer and shows only light scuffs, in Excellent condition. The stock rates in about Excellent overall condition.Type of Finish: Matte Blue Finish Originality: Original Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp; our bore gauge gave an M.E. of about 0.0. There is no erosion. We believe the rifling has a 1 in 10” right hand twist. There is stubborn fouling at the muzzle. Overall Condition: This rifle retains about 97% of its metal finish. Outside of a few light scuffs on the floorplate and trigger plate, there are only a few extremely faint scuffs present on the surfaces. The bolt and receiver have normal operational wear. The rifle has been well taken care of in the interim. The scope base has some light finish loss from the previous installation of scope rings. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are crisp. Overall, this rifle rates in about Excellent condition.Mechanics: The action functions correctly. We have not fired this rifle. As with all previously owned firearms, a thorough cleaning may be necessary to meet your maintenance standards. Box, Paperwork & Accessories: None Our Assessment: This is one hell of a setup! The Griswold Brothers heavy profile 24” barrel has bright, sharp rifling with an M.E. reading of about ZERO, and is free-floated the first 21”, in the camouflaged synthetic McMillan stock. The rifle is in .300 Winchester Magnum, with a spiral fluted bolt, which glides with ease. McMillan and the Griswold Brothers are two very well known and revered precision companies with a solid background in custom builds; this setup was done professionally and should make for an extremely accurate piece with the addition of your favorite optic. This rifle should ring true for long distance shooting and would be just as well suited for hunting larger game. Compared with the 30-06 Springfield the .300 Winchester Magnum provides a nearly 300 ft/s (91 m/s) increase in velocity. This translates to about 20% greater energy advantage over the 30-06 Springfield cartridge. The .300 Winchester Magnum is known for its accuracy and has been used for 1,000-yard (910 m) and 1,000-metre (1,100 yd) competitions. Some consider it the most useful and popular cartridge today. The cartridge was championed by the legendary American Sniper, Chris Kyle, who claimed it to be one of the best rounds ever made. Please see our pictures and good luck.

The frame is based on the Officer model, but for those with large hands, it features an extended magazine well that gives you the length you need to get all your fingers on the grip. The extension also serves another function. The hand-cut geometric angles really add to the looks as well. The slide is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a better sight radius.
Another consideration is weight. The T3 actually weighs one ounce lighter than most officer size 1911s. This makes the T3 the first choice for an all-day carry pistol.

Chrome also aids in chambering, extraction and overall performance of the barrel, meaning better weapon reliability and operator confidence with reduced maintenance requirements. We have our chrome lining applied to twice the thickness of standard small arms barrels.Barrel SteelThe Chrome-Moly steel alloy used in our hammer forged barrels was specifically developed as a machinegun barrel steel providing increased barrel life under prolonged rigorous firing schedules."

The Ascent22 is rated for semi-auto use with  the following calibers:.22LR, .22 WMR, .17HM2, .17HMR.Building upon the palpable momentum created by the well-received and impressive Axiom can, Tactical Solutions designed the new Ascent22 silencer using some of the same qualities shooters have come to expect from the Boise-based manufacturer. This particular unit boasts a stainless steel and Tactical Solutions’ patented split-tube design, which makes cleaning simple and efficient. (Remember, less time maintaining means more time shooting.) In addition, DiamonDyze™ coating safeguards the baffles for increased durability. Not to mention, a titanium blast baffle and thread adapter enhance the already stellar heat- and wear-resistant design utilized in the Ascent22.

This 7.62mm suppressor comes with a muzzle brake threaded in 5/8""-24tpi to match the vast majority of modern rifles in .308/7.62/300BLK on the market today. The rear mount has wrench flats to torque the suppressor to the muzzle device. There is a secondary retention latch that is depressed to remove the suppressor from the mount. The SRD762Ti-QD is rated up to 300 Win Mag and any other rifle cartridges that are of equal or less projectile diameter, pressure and case capacity. Examples of this would be .204 Ruger, .223/5.56x45mm, 5.45x39mm, 7.62x39mm, 300BLK, 6.5 Grendel, 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.8 Spc, .260 Remington and other cartridges.

The single-tube design allows for additional internal volume; while maintaining, or exceeding, the strength of traditional 2-tube designs.  As a direct result of the additional volume, the SRD suppressors are some of the quietest suppressors - while having exceptionally low blow-back in semi-automatic weapons! Sig has a reputation for precision manufacturing - and that experience has allowed them to use very tight tolerances, which equate directly to increased accuracy and reduced Point Of Impact shift. If there is damage to the front of the suppressor, or any of the internal baffles, the SRD can be easily repaired because the rear section is the only serialized partTake a look at this photo of an SRD suppressor, in the middle, compared to traditional suppressor designs:   Porting allows the SRD suppressors to efficiently use the internal volume - which directly equates to a quieter design   The single tube design is lighter, quieter, and just as strong - by using Sig's precision welding"

817,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7451817,For Sale:  Surefire SOCOM300 SPS Rifle Silencer 7.62 300WM,"Bend, Bend, Oregon","$ 1,049","Listed On: Sunday, May 6, 2018",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Originally released in 2012, the SOCOM Series Suppressors were selected by US Special Operations Command as first among all competitors, the most extensive and rigorous suppressor evaluation in history. The awarded full-length suppressors cover all aspects of performance to include effective reduction of sound attenuation, flash and dust signature, and also received the USSOCOM official safety verification in support of fielding. Additionally the suppressors were designed for optimum durability and service life. Since then the SOCOM suppressor has been sold to military units and police departments throughout the United States and the world over within allied NATO countries. Initially introduced in early 2015, the SOCOM2 suppressors have minimal increase in capability than that of the SOCOM option, and have had a significant increase in production capability. Now when using computer controlled laser welding there is a significant decrease in production cycle-time, thus a reduction in cost, which has been passed along to the end-user offering the best suppressor product available at a lesser price. The SOCOM2 suppressors continue to be constructed of advanced high-temperature alloys and stainless steel featuring a redesigned internal venting system to additionally reduce back pressure and in some cases a further reduction in sound attenuation. Ascetically the visual difference of the SOCOM2 suppressors is a new recessed end cap. There is no change in suppressor adapter attachment between the SOCOM and SOCOM2 suppressors. The SOCOM 3-Prong Flash Hider, Muzzle Brake and WARCOMP option adapters are designed for use with weapons system from carbine through machine gun variants. Like all SureFire SOCOM Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM2 produces minimal consistent shift in impact, if at all, compared to that of the unsuppressed weapon. As always SureFire suppressors are designed and manufactured in the USA.  Features  All SOCOM rifle and carbine suppressors are test fired and must shoot a group no more than 1 MOA than that of the baseline platform unsuppressed group to pass Highly specialized V-shaped baffles provide truly unprecedented levels of sound attenuation Optimized for .300 BLK/Whisper subsonic and supersonic ammo, including and also compatible with other calibers 5.56 through .300 WM Solid high-temperature alloy blast baffle increase durability Patented no-tools Fast-Attach® design attaches and removes in seconds Best performing suppressors for .300BLK (Blackout) system both with Sub and Supersonic ammunition. Quietest suppressor in compared to that of other SOCOM suppressors with minimal increase in back pressure. Capable of being fired on 5.56 through .300WM bolt actions systems. Full-Auto rated on .300BLK Sub- and Supersonic ammunition. Minimal and consistent point-of-impact shift Lightweight for minimal impact on weapon-handling characteristics Constructed of advanced high-temperature alloys and stainless steel for long service life Made in the USA"

This is the SIG MCX® Rattler. Featuring a 5.5"" PDW barrel, the MCX platform has never been more compact or accessible. Ready to go wherever it's needed, the MCX Rattler PSB features a 3-position telescoping pistol brace for stability and easy concealment. This gun was designed from the ground up to be as discrete as possible while retaining all the robust capabilities of the MCX. Free-floating M-LOK® handguards matched with a PDW upper and 5.5"" barrel, the MCX Rattler PSB is the ideal choice for fast-moving operators. Sig Sauer’s newest addition to the MCX line goes further than ever before, with a short 5.5-inch barrel and a specialized PDW upper giving the pistol an overall length of just 16 inches when the stock is folded/collapsed. The Rattler offers “M4 ballistics in a subgun-sized package,” the company says, a manageable weapon just three inches longer than the ultra-compact MP5K.In March 2017, SOCOM released a Request for Information calling for a new PDW conversion kit chambered in primarily .300 Blackout cartridge, but also the standard 5.56x45mm round. The command is apparently looking for a kit that can convert a standard M4A1 lower by adding a new upper receiver, a PDW that weighs no more than five-and-a-half pounds and extends no longer than 26 inches with its stock folded. The Rattler meets all of these requirements. Sig Sauer’s product page for the weapon explaining that the Rattler was “designed from the ground up to be as discreet as possible while retaining all the capabilities of the MCX.” In addition to a lightweight aluminium folding stock, the firearm also has a free-floating M-Lock handguard and a three-prong flash hider and can easily attach a suppressor."

I bought new a few years ago and has had a total of 212 rounds through it, all cartridges being Winchester Match King Pro or Fusion.

I really don't want to sell, but my style of shooting is changing and would like to see it go to someone that will push it to it's limits."
