The extras are accessories included: what is in the pictures, over $240 worth, including Sticky pocket holster,$25; Kydex quick draw trigger/laser guard cover,$10; 2 +1 mag extensions,$20; extra mag from another LCP; Techna belt clip, $25; laser,$150; not in pictures: 150 rounds of target ammunistion and about 18 rounds of Sig Sauer holliow points.After receiving payment, I'm willing to ship this to your FFL in state or out of state for an additional $25. I accept money order payments and cash on delivery locally. A local buyer must be 21 years old and ahve a valid Florida ID and be legal to purchase a firearm in the state and willing to sign a bill of sale.Pistol: I broke it in firing it 100s of times using Tipton brand spring loaded snap caps and it has not more than 300 rounds of target ammo through it. This pistol shoots better than new because i broke it in and modified the trigger surface as well as the stupid one dot sight that can't be seen in daylight or dark. The result is that it is more comfortable, esier to see and better to shoot than original. I repaintedthe sights with red and yellow fingernail polish so that they can be seen, at least in the daylight.It has some rust on the slide all ready. Also, rounded off the stupid square corners of the OEM red finished, aluminum trigger and painted it black, some of which chipped off (see picture). but I (ust touched uup the trigger after taking the pictures).It comes with 2 OEM Ruger 6 rd mags with +1 floor plates for mag capacity of 7 rds each mag.The breaking in greatly reduced the pressure needed to pull the trigger as well as fire it. This breaking in did not harm the function of the pistol. It also made the slide a bit easier to pull back.Note that I have bought tried the Ruger LCP, LCP2 & B. THough these LCP mags work in it , it won't cycle and fire the 7th round. The LCP Custom has a nicer (operating) trigger than ANY of the others and more capacity than all but the LCP because it is the same gun, same capacity exc ept for the trigger. The Beretta, brand new, wouldn't reload after firing! All the LCPOs I've had fired reliably and accurately out of the box. Also, breaking in the Pico resulted in a sloppy loose slide because the slide spring apparently is a weak POS and couldn't handle the break-in period.The Bodygaurd had the hardest and longest and nastiest trigger pull of them all and I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with it even though it was well used and fired a lot it stil had a POS trigger pull.Laser: black Crimson Trace model for the LCP with the instant on switch behind the trigger well on the grip.Sticky pocket holster, Kydex trigger guard that fits over the laser as well & a Techna belt clip mounted on right side for IWB carry on right side I use it (with the Kydex trigger& laser cover)."

Up for sale is my mint condition and only once-used Viper HS + Aero mount. I leveled it and installed it on my SPR with the recommended 15 in/lbs of torque and a small drop of blue loctite on the screws. However, I no longer need it, as the furthest range I can reasonably shoot at is about 200 yards. 10X is just a bit much for my uses.
The mount is rock solid and the torque specs + loctite kept it in place when I put the 30 rounds through my rifle while it was installed.
I paid $450 for this optic and around $80 for the mount from Amazon. I'm asking $400 shipped and insured, which is a pretty good discount given the immaculate condition of what's pictured. Vortex gives you stellar glass quality and an unbeatable warranty. For the price I cannot recommend it enough. Slap this on an AR or bolt gun and you'll have a very versatile tool.
Only had this thing for about a month. Phenomenal scope--I just wish I had a use for it. REDACTED"

Blue is very nice and so is the bakelite grips and I'm no conditions expert so I will low-ball the condition and say it is 80%. Minimal scratches, but they're there, afterall the handgun is fairly old. Holds 7+1 rounds, comes with two magazines, and original box. All matching serial numbers. Much rather have an xbox than a handgun, which is why I'm selling."

The rifling is also very sharp, and the firearm was cleaned after every time it was taken to the range.
This was my dream gun for a very long time, however I need money for a 3D printer and for some of my other projects.
If you think that my rifle is to expensive than please go to Gun Broker, there you will find SVT-40’s for about $1600 which you can pay to have shipped to a store, and then you can pay the stores fee to hold the firearm and tax on the rifle. I know this because that is what I had to go through to get it.
