By simply switching the barrels you are able to shoot 2 different caliber rounds thru this pistol. This is fully functional and I have shot it on several occasions with the 9mm barrel. It works perfectly when used with 9mm magazines. That being said there are no 9 mm magazines included in this sale. I do not own any and had to borrow a friends. it will shoot the 9mm using the 40 s&w magazines but this is a little iffy. They shoot ok but may or may not lock back on the last round and you do get the occasional double feed. You could probably tweak a 40 cal magazine to fit the 9mm better but I have not tried that. Check the Smith and Wesson forums for more info on this. I am pretty sure you can also install a 357 barrel in this and it will also work. And 357 will definitely fit the 40 cal magazines.Pistol is in great condition and comes with the additional 9mm barrel, factory case, extra backstraps, (3) 10 round 40 S&W magazines of which (2) have pinky extension plates, (1) Pro Mag 14 round magazine and an XGRIP magazine adapter.

I'm really only trying to sell the upper, but if you must have a complete rifle, we can probably work something out on a lower too. I built this to be the ultimate whitetail and pig killing rig for any type of hunting -- light and handy yet accurate, and packing a lot of firepower. It would also make a great fighting rifle that offers a good bit of barrier penetration advantage over 5.56. As you can see I used all high quality parts on this build -- no cheap shit.The barrel is a FN 16"" cold hammer forged 4150 CMV with mid-length gas, high pressure tested and magnetic particle inspected with the SPCII chamber (bought from PSA). It's what they call ""lighter profile,"" which makes the rifle carry and handle very nicely. The bolt is from Stag. Pinned low profile gas block under a BCM KMR-A 15"" free float handguard, which includes a QD sling mount and extra rail section. Mil spec 7075 charging handle. The muzzle device is currently a Silencerco suppressor mount flash hider for Omega or Specwar cans, but if the buyer would prefer, I would switch it out for a Black River Tactical Covert Comp linear compensator (designed to be quieter to the shooter for hunting while keeping recoil and flash down) or a PWS FSC-30 flash suppressing compensator. If you don't want any of those I'd throw an A2 style flash hider on it and knock $50 off the price. I also have 7 D&H 25 round steel mags (same size as 30 round 5.56 mags) that will go with the upper.I also have 300+ rounds of S&B 110 grain FMJ ammo (great quality brass) and 300+ rounds of Federal Fusion 115 grain soft points (great hunting or defensive ammo). FWIW the lowest going price for FMJ ammo is 60 cents per round right now, and the lowest price on Federal Fusion is 94.4 cents per round, so this is $460+ worth of ammo. I started out with 500 rounds of each type of ammo, so that gives you an idea of the round count on the upper -- close to 400 (just barely enough to break in a CHF CL barrel)!The scope is a Leupold Mark AR Mod 1 3-9x40 with the green Firedot TMR mil reticle and 0.1 mil turrets, mounted with a Midwest Ind. extended base and Vortex Viper rings. It's a great lightweight hunting/precision scope with excellent glass, and I was planning on keeping it, but if it helps sweeten the pot I'm willing to make a deal on it. It's a $450 scope new, the base + rings are $100+, and it comes with Butler Creek flip caps.OK, let's talk prices.Upper and mags: $650Ammo: $350Scope and mount: $400Upper, mags, and ammo: $900The whole damn shootin' match (upper, mags, ammo, scope, and mount): $1200If you're interested in buying this as a complete rifle, talk to me and we can work out a deal with a lower thrown in -- either with the stock/grip pictured or something else.Call, text, or email. email: henschman at hotmail dot com; cell: 4 oh 5, six 3 3, five 1 six 4."

Used for about 100 rounds. Still looks brand new. JP EnhancedBolt assembly completion group, includes firing pin, cam pin and retainer pin, .223/5.56 caliber. This version of the bolt is compatible with any AR-15 platform using a Mil-spec bolt carrier and sub-components. The latest edition JP EnhancedBolt is made from SAE 9310 high-grade steel. This material makes for an extremely hard surface with a tough, ductile core resistant to structural failure and a life expectancy far exceeding Mil-spec C-158 bolts. SAE 9310 is the same type of steel used in the transmission gears of Formula One racecars, and the high-load application of a bolt assembly is ideal for this state-of-the-art material; the results of actual full-auto endurance torture tests prove it. The design of the JP EnhancedBolt addresses many other fine points, the most important of which is the utilization of a standard configuration extractor. Most users want the ability to replace extractors and other parts with commonly available Mil-spec parts instead of being dependent on proprietary parts that can be difficult to acquire. Therefore, this new bolt will accept standard extractors, pins and springs."

Only trade I'd consider would be on a Ruger Precision in a 6.5 Creedmoor.thanks for looking.This is some info on this Saiga, it's not your standard AK,Russian American Armory Saiga 100DescriptionThe Russian American Saiga 100 is a semi-automatic hunting rifle chambered in .308 Win. and .30-06 Springfield. The Saiga family of rifles are based on the ubiquitous Kalashnikov assault rifles, of which the AK-47 is the most widespread exponent. The AK design is very rugged because it can still function after being exposed and submerged in water, sand, dirt, and mud. Just like the AK, the Saiga 100 uses a very clean gas-piston operating system. It functions by capturing propellant gases into a tube near the muzzle and onto a piston, the piston then drives the bolt to the rear and the bolt ejects an empty casing and loads a fresh round. What makes the 100 different from other Saiga rifles is a black, reinforced plastic housing that encloses the receiver. Otherwise features include iron front and rear sights that are adjustable for windage and elevation.The Saiga 100 is recommended for hunting large and medium-sized game."
