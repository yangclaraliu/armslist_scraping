Will be getting a new cylinder lock (not pictured). Trigger has been adjusted to have a very smooth first stage with no creep and a predictable 5.5lb break, but I may end up taking the weight down to 4.5lbs. The glass I have on it right now is a Vortex Viper HS LR 4-16x44 (30mm tube) held by lapped EoTech PRS low rings and a Vortex bubble level. Will drop price if you don't want the scope. Test fired out at 1,123yds and was hitting steel no problem.Price is negotiable, will come with the original furniture, 20 round mag, black soft case, as well as factory paperwork. I am a gunsmith, and this is my personal project.

Price is negotiable. This is a VERY lightly used rifle with a new barrel, NOT something I need to sell fast. Let me know of anything you could put towards trade. I'm a big sucker for WWI and WWII firearms.Unfortunately I won't be able to bring the rifle back to Florida until March break as I'm still in school. I'm willing to drive a good distance. If you would like more pictures, feel free to ask. Contact me with your phone number and I will text or email you back shortly. Face to Face ONLY."

The packaging was opened to inspect them when I first purchased them, but I never installed them (as I had two sets). I no longer need to have backups so I want to get rid of them and sell them to someone who could use them.These sights are fantastic. I use them myself on my M&P Shield 40 and they provide a highly visible sight picture both in the dark and during the day, as well. They were only purchased less than 2 years ago so they're still just as bright as when I got them. This is a perfect opportunity to pick up a brand new set without having to pay retail prices and without having to compromise on quality.If interested, please email me via Armslist or text me at REDACTED.

I bought this shotgun new and have put less than 10 rds thru it, no one else has touched it. The walnut stock is very nice with cut checkering (not pressed) front and back. The matte blue finish is equally as nice and both are what you would expect from Browning. Comes with matte Burris Signature Series E-dot 1.5-6x32 scope properly mounted in matching Burris Signature Series Zee rings. E-dot is a tiny red point of light in the center of the crosshairs with variable brightness, makes a huge difference in low light when the crosshairs are hard to find against outline of a deer's body.  This scope is a nice piece of glass with exceptional clarity and light gathering ability, and is Made in USA, I paid as much for the scope and rings as I did the gun.  I took this gun out twice, otherwise it just sits in the safe. Accuracy is phenomenal, recoil is mild, gun is light and fast handling and follow up shots are quick. I gave up 12 ga slug guns because of the heavy recoil and the 20 ga kills deer just as good with about half the recoil. This gun is zero'ed in ready to hunt and needs nothing, and I'll throw in a box of Hornady sabot slugs. 20 ga slug ammo comes in many varieties from 2 3/4"" reduced recoil to 3"" heavy magnum loads. Gun has factory installed sling mounting studs and it also accepts standard Browning BPS field barrels for traditional shotgun hunting. Comes in orginal Browning box. This is a current production gun and you can read all the specifications at Browning's website. Will meet buyer in Southern Maryland as far north as Upper Marlboro for a FTF cash and carry, legally compliant sale during daylight hours in a public setting, buyer must be MD legal resident with no arrest record.  Active duty military stationed in MD ok.

The Silver Pigeon I is built on the legendary 686 action, a long-standing favorite among hunters and competitive shooters. It features two conical locking lugs at mid-action, right between the barrels, giving it great locking strength and durability while keeping the action’s profile considerably lower. The advantage is that the eye of the shooter is a lot closer to the plane of his supporting hand: considerably better swing and hand-eye coordination. While not as elaborately decorated as our premium shotguns, the Silver Pigeon I has all the elegance that you can expect from a Beretta. The oil-finished stock sports a beautiful and crisp checkering pattern, and the schnabel fore-end adds to the classic flavor of this over-under. The scroll-engraved receiver is a functional work of art in itself, with its interesting geometry blending perfectly with the stock and contributing to the gun’s graceful lines. This is a shotgun that has all the elements of a treasured heirloom. This firearm includes 5 choke tubes for any situation. firearm must be shipped to an FFL holder for transfer."

Included in the sale are the following items: Glock 19 Gen 4 BFG, three 15 round magazines, Glock provided ""speed loader"", lock, factory Glock case, paperwork, four backstraps, installed Trijicon HD XR sights along with original sights, one full box of Hornady Critical Duty +P ammo, and a Right Hand carbon fiber kydex holster from SAS Holsters with adjustable tension and cant.

Here for true no reserve auction is Colt Custom Shop Python .357 mag that features deep colt blue finish, original wood grips, all original paperwork and custom shop box. With the desirable serial number of K50000, this went thru Colt's custom shop and features a red ramp front sight and white outline rear on top of the vent rib 6"" barrel. Finish is amazing- no scratches or thin areas. Wood grips have no dents in checkering. There is nothing like that deep blue old Colt finish. Mechanical lock up is like a vise. Timing perfect. I can not say that this is unfired, but it shows very little wear from having been shot much at all. Bore is bright. Forcing cone is clean. The paperwork, box and Styrofoam are ALL ORIGINAL- not like these reproductions that come with a lot of pythons recently."

Price is negotiable.The original DA 38 Derringer was made only in 38 special chambering.The logo ""BTJ"" stands for Bellmore Johnson Technologies. (the ""T"" is in the middle as a stylized logo)A company called ""Maxim"" run by a person named John Galt -if memory serves me- began distributing these derringers in 1985. Interestingly the design is very similar to the High Standard derringers, and the address Hamden, CT is the same as High Standard's address. I do not know if BJT bought the right to manufacture from High Standard. But in less than a year the company was gone with no fowarding address. If anyone knows the reason, please post it.The DA frame is aluminum and the barrels and latch are stainless steel. The stainless castings were made by Pinetree Castings, the same company that Ruger often used.The original BJT derringers did not actually have wood grips but are made from a composite wood look-alike. Later, the rights to manufacture and leftover parts were bought up by American Derringer Corporation, who began making these in 38 Special and 9 mm para. The earlier ADC-DA derringers have the BTJ logo and the Hamden CT address since they were leftover and already stamped by BJT. The ADC derringers now have wood laminate grips.Later American Derringer began chambering the DA derringers in 357 magnum and 40 S&W.It is not possible to make these DA derringers in a caliber larger than 40 S&W without enlarging the barrel casting width, so you are not likely to see one. There is a difference between the ADC derringers and BJT that you can see at a glance: the Safety on the ADC derringers have a center screw to adjust the safety tension. The BJT derringers have a solid safety piece and do not have or need the screw."
