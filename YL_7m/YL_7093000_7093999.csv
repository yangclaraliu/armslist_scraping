3,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7093003,For Sale:  Rainier Arms A-DAC-F Lower Receiver,"Renton, Seattle, Washington",$ 175,"Listed On: Monday, April 30, 2018",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Features: The most innovative forged lower to hit the market ever! Rainier Arms is proud to announce our partnership with AXTS Weapons to introduce the first and only lower to incorporate a bolt hold back with the mag release button. This will aid the shooter to clear malfunctions quicker and get back into the fight. Rainier Arms forged lower receiver is made from 7075 aluminum. The best anodizing dies are used for a deep black finish. Features a upper to lower tensioning screw and a flared out magwell for quick mag changes. Battle Arms 45 Degree Selector Compatible Benefits:  Removes six steps from the Manual of Arms when clearing a double feed malfunction. The device adds the ability to use the right hand to lock the bolt to the rear while still leaving you the option of using the standard left hand method. Greatly reduces the amount of time needed to clear a malfunction. Unlike all other devices there is no need to learn to find a new location for your trigger finger as one experienced with the weapon already instinctively makes contact with the magazine release button first to clear any remedial action malfunction.  Trouble free simple design:  Can be field stripped with no tools. Only one additional part is required and is completely internal to the receiver. There are no screws to come loose. There is no weight added to the bolt catch that could cause it not to lock open on the last round like other devices which bolt on. Nothing to snag on clothes or other gear.  Safety:  Virtually eliminates the possibility of the user's finger unintentionally entering the trigger guard while locking the bolt to the rear. When used, makes it impossible to inadvertently lock back the bolt with a loaded magazine left in the receiver. This prevents the possibility of chambering a round in the event the rifle is bumped causing the bolt to drop. Nothing to accidentally trip the bolt release when reloading or clearing a malfunction as it is only a bolt catch. Allows you to keep a firm grip of fire control - making it much easier to keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction when locking the bolt to the rear. Nothing obstructing any portion of the trigger guard - preventing any issue with snagging a gloved hand.  Shipping  Will only ship to another FFL dealer. Please have your dealer email a copy of their current FFL to info@xtarmory.com.  $25 shipping"

I put this rifle together to shoot long range steel competitions and it served me well. The rifle outgrouped many of the others that had over 3k invested. No problem shooting sub MOA groups out to several hundred yards with the right ammo. It's a great entry level rifle for people trying to get in at a bargain price. If you shoot at any distance you know how much that starts adding up to. Or if you are just interested in a good deer or coyote gun this would do incredible for that too. If you're not familiar with the 6.5 grendel a little research will show you it actually outperforms the 308 in many areas with very little recoil felt. Uses stock 223 mags and the upper is interchangeable with your other AR15 platforms. This weapon is a bargain at this price. 24 "" barrel with keymod rail. PSA lower with upgraded LPK.

I have a really nice Kimber Ultra Ten II. This model is a poly frame double stack 1911 compact. It holds 10 in each magazine, hence the name. The 3"" slide is stainless housing a bushingless bull barrel and comes with night sights. I have a spare 10 round magazine for it as well as a magazine scabbard and two leather holsters (one IWB and one bianchi open top OWB.) I have a variety of ammo that I could include if necessary. Mostly high-end defensive ammo is what I buy but I've also got some target ammo as well, around 130 rounds total. I am NOT willing to ship the gun to an out of state buyer! It is too much of a hastle and risk for me so please don't ask. I will only meet the buyer in a public setting locally I will consider all offers for cash or trades but bear in mind that I don't need to sell it nor can I add any money to a sale. I do, however, have other items I can stack into a deal to negotiate upward. Feel free to look at my other items linked here:http://www.armslist.com/posts/7017464/indianiapolis-indiana-rifles-for-sale--diamondback-ar-15
My top choice for a trade would be an FN Five-seveN. I would also be very interested in an FNX (or FNP) 45, a CETME .308 rifle, a decent shotgun  (likethe Mossberg 930 series), a Kimber 4"" or 5"" 1911 or something comparable in value. I am mostly wanting another handgun though I'll entertain all reasonable offers. Just let me know what you think and include details of any trade offers. This is a great little pistol and they're becoming difficult to find, especially in this condition.Let me know if you would like additional pictures of anything I have listed. If this ad is up, I still have everything available. Should the availability of anything change, this post will be amended. Thank you for looking!"

Be aware of prices at places like Palmetto State and Bear Creek, I am. I'm not going to pay the same for a used upper as I could buy it new, what's the point?I am looking for a 5.56 upper for a simple reason, I want to try camo painting an AR, and I don't want to try it on my more expensive uppers first. I don't care if it's scuffed, within reason (long as I can paint over it). I'd prefer if it came with BCG but if not, that should be accounted for in the price. I would prefer if the handguard is keymod or mlok, but basic handguards are OK if the price is right. I can buy something like I'm describing new for $215 with BCG at Bear Creek (though it comes with a basic handguard) and up depending on features. So, don't try to sell me an upper minus BCG for $200 or something like that. By the time I add the BCG, I'd be up to like $270, which is more than $50 over what I'd pay to buy the same thing new. I am looking for a bargain, don't waste your time or mine with a regular market price. Again, scratches and wear is OK."
