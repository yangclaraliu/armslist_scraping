The Marlin 30AW is a derivative of the venerable 336, holding six rounds of .30-30 in a tube magazine mounted below its 20-inch micro groove barrel. This rifle comes with handsome beech furniture, an attractive blued finish, and Marlin's signature gold trigger. The top of the receiver is drilled and tapped for a scope mount, and a scope mount (not pictured) will be included with the rifle, for all your scope mounting needs. The side-eject design of the Marlin makes it well suited for optics, unlike it's top-ejecting Winchester counterparts. I beleive this particular model was made in 1991. It's JM stamped, so that means it was manufactured before the Remington shenanigans. It's in great condition - the action is smooth and the gun shoots accurately and reliably.  There's a tiny bit of finish wear on the left side of the receiver and a couple nicks in the wood, but otherwise the gun is in excellent shape cosmetically. I've had no mechanical issues with the rifle, I've fired a little less than 100 rounds through it without any problems. It sports a leather wrap around the lever to make quick follow-up shots a little more comfortable, but it's easily removable if you don't care for it."

As for condition the receiver retains much of its original case colors, fading some on the sides, showing more of a nickel finish on the left side with bright colors on the top, under the lever and in protected areas. The original 24"" octagon barrel and full magazine retain around 90% of their original bright blue finish. The original walnut stocks are in excellent condition, retaining nearly all of their original gloss finish with slight wear on the bottom of the forearm from light carry use. They show minimal light handling marks. The wood to metal fit is tight and proud. The lever retains much of its very bright original case colors, showing very strong in protected areas. The action is tight and smooth, mechanically perfect. The hammer spring is strong. The bore is in excellent condition, retaining some shine with sharp rifling. I would rate it at 90%. The loading gate still retains most of its original fire blue. The barrel address and caliber markings are perfect. It comes with what is possibly a factory installed Lyman Tang Sight. The sights are original and in excellent condition. The screws are excellent and with the exception of the tang sight screws most appear unturned. In all this is a higher condition example of an all original and unmolested Marlin 1893. This would not only make a nice addition to ones collection but it would also make a great antique shooter/hunting rifle. I have provide over 100 photos and offer a 3 day inspection period so you can bid with confidence. All pictures were taken outdoors in natural light and provide an accurate depiction of its condition. If anything I feel the gun looks better when held in hand as the camera lightens up the look of the finish some. This 120 year old Marlin is considered an antique and can be shipped directly to you with proof of age (NO FFL REQUIRED). Insurance is included with shipping. Thank you for looking."

This old scattergun is a rebranded version of the Browning-designed Stevens 520, and features a six round tube magazine, 2 3/4 inch chamber, slam-fire capacity, and a quick takedown feature that separates the barrel and magazine tube from the receiver in secconds. That the destinctive double-hump receiver bears a resemblance to the iconic Browning Automatic Rifle is no coincidence, given their shared paternity in our lord and savior John Moses Browning. The quality of this firearm harkens to a time where quality steel and intricate machining were the norm, and is a far cry from the mass-produced shotguns of today. It's a solid and stout hunk of steel. For a gun that's nearly a century old, this aged warhorse is in remarkably good shape. Mechanically, everything functions as it should - the action is slick and smooth, and takedown is quick and painless. Externally, I believe the gun is sporting an older refinish - the markings on the side of the receiver are faint, and the bluing does not appear factory. There is a little bit of light pitting here and there, but nothing out of the ordiary for a firearm of this vintage. The checkering on the stock and is worn, and the varnish is a little inconsistent, but there are no major cracks or splits. The recoil pad appears to be a latter addition. While not pictured, this shotgun will come with a set of sling swivels that were likely added at the same time as the buttpad and refinishing job. The barrel has been cut down from the factory 30(!) inches to a standard riotgun length of 20 inches, so that when the gun is taken down the two components are approximately the same length. This makes for a compact package that can easily be stored in a backpack or duffel bag. I had the barrel work done by a gunsmith, so it's cut and crowned neatly and sports a properly-mounted bead sight. What used to be a heavy old field gun is now a unique and handy riot gun, well suited for home defense or fun on the range. The lack of a trigger disconnect allows for slamfire, which adds to the entertainment value. If you're looking for a charismatic home defense gun that can fit in a suitcase, look no further. This is all sorts of old-school cool."

This riflewas manufactured in 1893. As for condition the receiver retains much of its original case colors, fading some on the sides, showing more of a nickel finish on the left side with bright colors on the top, under the lever and in protected areas. The original 24"" octagon barrel and full magazine retain around 90% of their original bright blue finish. The original walnut stocks are in excellent condition, retaining nearly all of their original gloss finish with slight wear on the bottom of the forearm from light carry use. They show minimal light handling marks. The wood to metal fit is tight and proud. The lever retains much of its very bright original case colors, showing very strong in protected areas. The action is tight and smooth, mechanically perfect. The hammer spring is strong. The bore is in excellent condition, retaining some shine with sharp rifling. I would rate it at 90%. The loading gate still retains most of its original fire blue. The barrel address and caliber markings are perfect. It comes with what is possibly a factory installed Lyman Tang Sight. The sights are original and in excellent condition. The screws are excellent and with the exception of the tang sight screws most appear unturned. In all this is a higher condition example of an all original and unmolested Marlin 1893. This would not only make a nice addition to ones collection but it would also make a great antique shooter/hunting rifle"

The mag release I changed to a hyve instead of Zev because the hyve is much better but the Zev mag release still comes with the gun, the slide release is a sure touch extended slide release because it too is better than the Zev, but the Zev slide release also comes with the gun. All stock parts also come with this package that includes all the internals the trigger the barrel, all factory parts all you would need is a frame and a slide and you could build a whole different gun. Also comes with 4 mags 2 taran tactical extended base plates and one hyve +5 extended base pad. The sights are trijicon fall night sights with tritium, the optic is a Burris Fastfire 3. I would also include a owb safariland holster. I have a good deal of money in this gun. The gun was $650 and I probably have close to $1600-$1700 dollars in everything. And you can still sell the factory parts or build a new gun for very cheap with them. I will take $1300 for the whole package.please text REDACTED to talk about making a deal"

$660 firm in cash or a little better in trade.  New, this set-up would run $1,140 for everything before any other fees, so a discount of around $500 is pretty good.  I would ask more if there were no finish issue, so price is firm and fair!
Looking for cash, but if offering a trade, let me know the details, +/- cash trade offers also OK.

$760 in cash or might look at trades.
Looking for cash, but if offering a trade, let me know the details, +/- cash trade offers also OK.  Mostly into semi-autos, but let me know what you have and the deal.
