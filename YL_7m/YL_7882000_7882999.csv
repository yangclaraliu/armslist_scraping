This is a one off, no other like it anywhere. I am a master machinist by trade and had this pistol a a long time idea. Now its time to part ways. The pistol was never fielded.The inner barrel is a Prometheus 6.03 TBB 247mm. Barrel runs entire length of reciever and suppressor in one piece. I machined the barrel to exact tollerances the origional KWA barrel was to fit the hopup properly as well as a proper crown. Outer barrel was modified to fit threading the fake suppressor. Crono clocks .20 at 350fps and .25 at 310fps. It likes .25 best.Folding stock is the first gen, the solid constructed one that goes on both sides of mag.Pachmayr slip on finger groove grip.G&G Armaments rail for a Berretta M9 was modded, tapped and pinned to frame and slide clearanced for proper operation. Mounted with 4 screms.Bushnell First Strike 5 MOA red dot. Sensor still auto sets brighness when powered up. Wired a pressure switch to turn on red dot with finger located on Raffica foregrip. Works awsome.The internals like slide rails, frame rails, hammer contact areas where given a high polish to ais in efficiancy of movement. This increased ROF tremendously. It literaly shoots rope for 50 rounds in about 3 seconds. Thats why the 3 round burst is awsome.x4 50 round KWA magsIncludes stock inner barrel, new outer barrel with porting, hopup adjuster and mag nozzle tool.$800 obo"

The Weatherby is nicer. Awesome rifle. NOTE: I live in NE Salem, 35 minutes south of Bridgeport Village or Cabelas area. I can drive to meet you at an ffl if you are in Oregon, Washington, or Idaho. ALSO: The picture with the right side buttstock has a spec of material that landed on the rear part of the buttstock.

Finished in a proprietary Legion gray coating and featuring custom G-10 grips with a Legion medallion, the P220 Legion is improved in nearly every way. The stainless-steel slide sports SIG SAUER Electro-Optics X-RAY high visibility day/night sights as well as front cocking serrations that provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm or conducting press checks. The P220 in DA/SA includes a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip and a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. The P220 Legion also features low-profile decocking and slide-catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. designed P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most. The P220 Legion ships with three 8-round magazines. Challenge Coin and Legion Case Included. This gun has been to the range exactly one time and has had less than 100 rounds put through it (Sig 10mm Ammo). Also has the Exeter, NH mark on the frame (as opposed to the Newington mark found on later guns). Incredibly smooth trigger and powerful, yet manageable (for most) pistol. After 4 surgeries to my right hand, it simply got to be too much too quickly (but it was FUN). I didn't even finish off the ammo I took to the range."
