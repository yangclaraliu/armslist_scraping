I was very interested to see it divided it’s values into there catagories, Free state, restricted state and Massachusetts. With that being said I find it rediculous that people can ask $500 to $800 for a stripped lower. Even in Massachusetts the value is in the $225 to $300 range depending on the manufaturer and composition, Glocks are catagorized by generation, a Gen 3 19 with night sights in Mass is valued from $450 to $550.00 depending on condition, mags (not hi-cap) box papers... Maybe if we stop overpaying the Massholes on Armslist will stop overcharging! Know what your are buying and know what it’s worth!"

This morning I found a gun value website that charges $30 a year, it divides catafories into dealers and personal. I was very interested to see it divided it’s values into there catagories, Free state, restricted state and Massachusetts. With that being said I find it rediculous that people can ask $500 to $800 for a stripped lower. Even in Massachusetts the value is in the $225 to $300 range depending on the manufaturer and composition, Glocks are catagorized by generation, a Gen 3 19 with night sights in Mass is valued from $450 to $550.00 depending on condition, mags (not hi-cap) box papers...

No tinkering with it at all!Lone wolf also makes great conversion barrels so you could shoot 9mm or 357 sig from this same pistol. 9mm would need the G17 mags for the best performance.As far as I know, this would still be legal in USPSA production class as well.Reason for selling: I want the funds to build yet another gun, so I won't need this as my backup anymore.Note to buyer (or anybody that runs a Glock): if you reload your own ammo, make sure that the primers are seated in all the way. If you have a ""high primer"" the gun will have a failure to fire, I learned this the hard way; not the gun's fault, but just something you should know.Price: $700 for everythingShipping: $25If you are interested, throw me an offer.Thanks for your time."

Never used, original tags. Being jammed in confined spaces for hours is an unfortunate part of the business for many professionals we serve. Whether it’s a military unit in an a.p.c., a pilot in a cockpit, drivers in a HumVee, or a journalist in the back of a goat truck, they all have to bring their gear. And they all may need to ‘relocate’ in a hurry. This is the environment for which our Evac(TM) line of sling packs has been geared. They are slim shaped to be easily maneuvered in crowds, or stored in vehicles/lockers, and are quick to take on or off. They are also ambidextrous, and unlike others in this class, are actually comfortable on the shoulder; The bottom strap clips from either the right or left lower corner and the padded section realigns itself ergonomically in the correct body-hugging direction. The bag can be rotated to the chest for on-the-go access, and all pockets are designed to face the user in this mode on either the right or left side. One-strap-carry also makes shouldering a long-gun comfortable - unlike a backpack."

Chambered for the .22 LR the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art-precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded, and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new authentic looking flat-sided hammer makes this Rough Rider both functional and handsome. Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting. Let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. PROUDLY MADE IN OUR USA. All Heritage revolvers combine quality and affordability ... an American tradition. This has consistantly been one of the top selling handguns in the United States for the last 2 decades. They look great, they work great and they are at a great price. This is the perfect glove box or field carry revolver and just tons of fun to shoot.   It's affordable to own and inexpensive to shoot.
