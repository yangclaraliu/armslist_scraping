The SI Fuel Cell is available in Daniel Daniel Mil Spec + and features a small DD logo laser etched into the corner of the lens for a completely custom look. The idea was to create clean, authentic style for those who don’t just walk the path of life – they stomp it and leave footprints. That’s what led to Oakley FUEL CELL®. The idea here is unflinching originality and a smooth look. It’s proof that when authenticity speaks for itself, it speaks with volume.  FEATURES Plutonite Lens One of the most optically pure materials used in eyewear today, it maximizes clarity and impact resistance while filtering out 100% of all UVA, UVB, UVC and harmful blue light up to 400nm. Not a coating, the UV protection is from the lens material itself. High Definition Optics High Definition Optics (HDO) is a collection of patented technologies that allow Oakley eyewear to meet or exceed the testing standards of the American National Standards Institute for optical clarity, visual fidelity, and impact resistance. Impact Protection Backed by decades of innovation, Oakley performance eyewear offers uncompromising protection against high-velocity and high-mass impact. The protection is a benefit of the premium materials and unique architectures of Oakley lens/frame combinations. UV Protection Eye damage attributed to ultraviolet light includes cataracts, pterygium and macular degeneration. Our Plutonite® lens material filters out 100% of all UVA, UVB, UVC and harmful blue light up to 400nm. The protection is from the lens material itself. Three-Point Fit A patented innovation that ensures the frame makes contact only at the bridge of the nose and the sides of the head. It holds lenses in precise optical alignment with a secure fit that eliminates the pressure points common with frames that hook the ears. O-Matter A stress-resistant frame material that withstands environmental extremes, it is lightweight yet highly durable. Controlled flexibility enhances impact resistance while contributing to the all-day comfort of frames made with this innovative synthetic. Iridium Designed to balance light transmission and reduce glare, this premium lens coating is made with superheated metal oxides. It is available in a spectrum of colors for optimizing vision in virtually any light condition. Frame FitLens Width: 60 mm Bridge Width: 19 mm Lens Height: 40 mm Temple Arm Length: 130 mm"

Our contact # does not receive text messages.Up for sale is a brand new in the box Heckler & Koch MR762.   Taking an essentially standard MR762A1 semi-automatic rifle, HK turns it into a more effective precision rifle by an astute addition of the right optics and accessories. A Leupold VX-R Patrol 3-9x40mm scope and mount, HK G28 adjustable cheekpiece buttstock, and LaRue Tactical BRM-S bipod are the primary add-ons that make the MR762A1 Long Rifle Package (LRP) more than a sum of parts. This model employs the same HK proprietary gas piston operating system found on current HK rifles and carbines, using a pusher rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. Shooters can expect a long-life barrel due to HK's famous cold hammer forging process. It has a Modular Rail System (MRS) keymod handguard. Additional accessories and add-ons for the LRP variant of the MR762A1 include an Ergo pistol grip, Blue Force Gear sling and mount, Otis cleaning kit, and an HK multi-tool. This rifle package, complete with one 20- and one 10-round magazine, is shipped ready to use with the scope attached in a compact, 42"" Model 1720 Pelican case.

The scope is currently zeroed at 100 yards using 140gr Hornady ELDs. I have shot this rifle out to 575 yards and was hitting a 4"" steel plate repeatedly. If you're looking to get into shooting long range stuff with the caliber that has become extremely popular, this is a set up that will get you there.i have a 20 round box of Hornady ammo I will include with it, as well as brass from the 30 rounds I shot when I took it out to zero it/see what it was capable of.What I have in this set up vs what I'm trying to get out of it is quite reasonable, but make me an offer anyhow."
