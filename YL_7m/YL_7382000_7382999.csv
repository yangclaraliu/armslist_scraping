I'm kind of attached to it. I'm considering selling it because I don't have an AR right now. I just don't feel right without one. The rifle has the RD stock adapter, alg trigger, and a Magpul SL-S. it will come with one Bakelite mag, one moe Pmag, and 5 steel com bloc mags. I have 500 rnds of 8m3 spec ammo and a couple hundred rounds of monarch, as well. I'm keeping the old aimpoint and surefire.I'll leave the fabled US PALM grip. It adds +5 handling. I would like to trade for an AR. I prefer a 14.5"" or 20"" barrel, but I'm not dead set on it. I would sell the whole package for $1100"

Has a decent Feyochi 8-32x50 scope on it that I bought from a local shop near me, it's not a great brand and I only spent $130 on it but it has worked perfect out to 500 yards for me. Also put a bi-pod on it. Both scope and bipod come with it, along with 2 10 round mags, and original box and manual(everything that came with it when bought new) I paid $1437.27 after taxes for just the gun and got around $180 with the scope and bipod. Have some ammo that will go with too. I'm asking $1200 obo. I figure that's a fair deal considering it's basically a brand new gun.

INOX mags!  This is obviously an earlier model with all SS/INOX controls and the INOX mags also have the SS/INOX base plates, not the black ones, this is as good as it gets as far as the INOX 92FS goes for any collectors out there.  I purchased this one a while back from the original owner who said he had never fired it and I have not fired it.  I did clean it when I first got it and it was super clean, virtually no powder residue anywhere.  I have had the mags in and out several times showing friends etc. and the slide has been racked several times by me, but other than that it looks like it's fresh off the shelf.  Prices on this particular model are all over the place without the INOX mags and I sold a couple fairly quick a couple years ago at $800 each without the INOX mags and with minor marks and I'm sure they are worth more now.  When I was looking them up a couple years ago just the INOX mags were going for as much as $80 each.  This is the nicest INOX I have owned or seen in person hands down.
$1,000 FIRM in cash or might consider trades.  If for some reason you don't want it after inspection, no problem as long as we meet close to my area, but I will not drop the price as it is as clean as it looks in the pics, I'll just hang onto it a bit longer.Prefer cash, but on trades, mostly interested in semi-autos right now, but will consider others, just let me know what you have and what the deal is and I'll get back to you either way.  The only thing I can think of right now on a trade would be a Kriss Vector Gen II pistol with brace in 10mm, maybe .357 or 9mm.  Might also trade on a Sig MPX Gen 2 with folding brace.Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX and have valid ID.Thanks for looking!"
