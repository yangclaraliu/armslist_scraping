The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.
The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).
The International is an outside the waistband holster with a modular mounting design giving the user 16 holster options in 1.  Designed to be worn at 3:00 this holster is perfect for competition shooting, concealed carry or general use. The International’s all-Kydex body provides a rigid material that is custom fit to each firearm and maintains its shape even with the pistol un-holstered. The smooth, low friction surface allows for a fast draw and easy one-handed re-holstering of the firearm. The all-Kydex body will not bend or stretch over time and is impervious to sweat and solvents. The raised lettering on the front of the holster specifies the make and model your holster accommodates, so you will never forget what gun it goes with.
The International comes set up as a Belt Holster. The two additional mounting options will be included in the package at no extra charge!
The Belt mount is the most popular holster among competition shooters, a secure hold that is designed with a curve to fit comfortably on the hip. The Belt Mount will accommodate either a 1.5” or 2” wide belt. Once belt width is widened to 2” it cannot be changed back.   The Paddle Mount is the answer to anyone who wears many different styles of pants. You no longer will have trouble feeding the holster around your belt loops. The paddle slips over the belt and inside the waistband for a comfortable, secure fit that is quick and easy to put on or take off. With vents in the paddle portion this is a cool and comfortable option.
 Comp-Tac has worked for years on the best way to fit each person’s shape and size. The drop offset is the answer. The Drop-Offset piece is specifically designed to help set the pistol away from the body and drop it to a lower position for a more comfortable draw. Designed with a cross brace to keep stable during the draw, the Drop-Offset is ideal for lady shooters whose waist and hip measurements may make proper holster fit a challenge.
 The holster is designed with 8 mounting holes which allow it to be configured for a straight/speed draw, an FBI cant, or a cross draw rearward cant. Easily changeable, the holster is compatible with many mounting systems offered by other holster manufacturers.
Mounting hardware will accommodate a 1.5” or 2” belt width, once the adjustment tab has been removed it cannot be reattached.
The International holster body is available in multiple colors but the mounting hardware is always black.feel free to ask any questions or request additional pictures."

Beretta answered the call successfuly, not just by merely rechambering the PX4 Storm to .45 ACP--but rather by redesigning its internal components to meet and exceed all these.requirements. The result is a pistol that satisfies not only SOCOM's requirements. The “SD” denomination of this handgun stands for “Special Duty.”  the PX4 Storm SD have proven that it will keep performing in spite of salt, mud, water, rain, snow, sand or anything else you can throw at it. This is because every internal component was engineered, produced and treated to function in such extreme environments. The PX4 Storm SD features a rotating barrel system. This means that under recoil, the barrel rotates, thereby dissipating momentum radially, which translates in much lower felt recoil and muzzle jump, even with hotter .45 ACP rounds. Furthermore, the extended cold-hammer forged barrel is 4.5” long and allows the power of the .45 to fully develop before exiting the muzzle.Bereta Px4 Storm.

This means it comes with the actual Accutrigger unlike the plain Axis models which have a notably heavy and not crisp release. It is safer and also end-user adjustable from 2.5-6lbs with a clean crisp release. I think it is better than the X-mark pro triggers on Remington 700's. It also comes with a Weaver Kaspa 3-9x40 scope mounted and bore sighted from the factory. And it has the detachable 4 round magazine which is a nice featureThe Accutrigger alone usually runs between $80-$100, the scope is in the same price range, plus the rings. So all in all it is a pretty good package. At Cabelas they go for around $400 +tax.It is still unfired, in mint condition, no issues, scratches, rust, etc. Very lightweight for the barrel size(8lbs 6oz with the scope) so easy to tote into the woods if desired.May consider Remington Model 8 or Model 14 in 35 Rem, Ishapore 308 Enfield, 1897 Trench Shotgun, Ruger M77 All weather w/ boat paddle stock in 308 - 30-06 - 7mm Rem mag - 300 win magSavage 10 FCP-SR 308Maverick 88 / Mossberg 500 Field and Security combo modelStihl or Husqvarna Chainsaws, Power equipmentDewalt, Milwaukee, Makita tools (NOT RYOBI, KOBALT, Etc)If you are a PA resident I require a legible copy of your Current DL and CCW, or do an FFL transferPrefer FTF, but if you are not a PA resident I can ship the rifle to an FFL of your choice WHERE LEGAL. They must accept rifles from private sellers."

Manufacturing of this gun commenced in 1994 and ever since it became quite popular as sporting (IPSC and IDPA), self-defense and service weapon, used by numerous police and special military forces around the world, to include Latin America, Asia and Europe. Produced in a wide spectrum of modifications, Bul M5 pistols combine time-proven design and ergonomics of legendary US M1911A1 pistol with most modern materials and production techniques.Bul M5 is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses Browning-type tilting barrel locking with single swinging link that connects breech of the barrel with the frame. Wide-body frame is produced from impact-resistant polymer and can accommodate any caliber available in M5 product line without any changes (obviously, caliber change requires swapping barrels, magazines, springs and possibly slides). The single-action trigger system is same as in M1911A1 pistol, providing high accuracy potential and efficient safety measures, combining manual frame-mounted safety and automated grip safety. Pistols utilize double-stack high capacity magazines."

No Trades at this time.Shirogorov F95RFull (anodized Blue/Bronze & tumbled) titanium frame lock. A matching titanium sculpted titanium pocket clip for Rt. hand tip up carry.The Blade: A 4"" drop point blade with a full flat ground; Blade is made of M390 Steel (Bohler M390 is equivalent to CTS-204P & 20CV which are todays super steels). This is highly regarded as being the best blade steel that you currently can get). The blade has a super tight beadblast finish that screams quality. There is ample jimping (fine enough to lock your thumb right were it needs to be) on the spine of the blade for a secure grip when handling cutting tasks.Flipper Tab: Is very suttle and is out of the way while riding in your pocket. The flipper tab also has some nice jimping along the tab which aids in its snappy, smooth & quick deployment.Pitvot System: The blade rides on the Shirogorov (MRBS) Multi-Row Bearing System which is one of the smoothest actions that you will find on a production or even a whole hell of alot of custom knives out there. ( The action of the deployment and closing is buttery smooth as the blade rides on multi-rows of tiny bearings the blade freely swings out with authority and closes with no help of shaking it after disengaging the lock bar) Its just something you need to feel in your hands to understand the beauty of it. Shirogorov Knives have multiple pivot systems and to locate what type you have all you have to do is look inside the scales and it is ingraved into the titanium ""MRBS"". Stainless Steel Lock Bar Insert/Overtravel tab: This increases the longevity of the locking surfaces o the lock-bar & blade. It is replaceable if you were ever to wear it out (I doubt you could  in a life-time). It also ensures perfect lock-up and ease of lock-bar disengagement. There is a also a small tab machined into the stainless steel lock-bar insert that prevents the user from over extending the titanium when disengaging the lock-bar.The knife was purchased only 5 months ago, carried a handful of times. Cut open some letters and a couple pieces of paper but the factory edge is as sharp as the first day i had purchased it.Shirogorov Knives are tuff to get and are usually crazy expensive. I do have to say, it's a well precisioned knife with precise tolerences, top tier materials and insane quality (even on the inside of the knife is masterfully finished). Im only selling this for another important project, I will more than likely buy another. So here's your chance to score one at a good deal.Buying the F95R with the MRBS and M390 blade steel it will run you $1100-$1250Pricig: I use PayPal (FF) friends & family otherwise the buyer will have to pay the PayPal fees and the full amount for the knife. Once I revieve full payment and confirm it i will ship the knife to your destination. I have sold knives on other forums if you need a referenceThe knife includes: The box, microfiber cloth & the Certificate of authenticity$925 Insured & Shipped priority mail$900 FTF in the Metro Detroit Area"

The other thing to mention is some light discolored spots on the right side of the barrel where it meets the receiver right around the REP barrel mark. These spots can be seen in the one close up photo. The wood is mint. This is a rare caliber to find in the 7600 only a few where made and finding one nicer than this one would be really hard unless someone has one new in the box.
