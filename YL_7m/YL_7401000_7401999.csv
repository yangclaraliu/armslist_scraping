The conversion barrel works great; I've never had a single malfunction with it, including freedom munition reloads and hollowpoints of various flavors. The holsters are in great condition, and some of the magazines have never actually been used; I started stocking up during the great magazine/ammo scare of 2008. The holsters have seen very light use; typically only OWB under a jacket in winter, so they aren't all sweaty and gross. I wore the mag carrier a grand total of 3 times before I realized that OWB is more comfortable for me. The sights still have life in them, but aren't as bright as a brand new set.If you have any questions, please look closely at the pictures to see if they show what you have a question about. If not, feel free to contact me and I'll get back to you within a few days. Local sales only; I live in Wilsonville and would be willing to conduct a transfer at any dealer within 75 miles or so."

It is chambered in 7.62x54R, a widely available cartridge, which can be thought of as the bigger brother to the popular 7.62x39.The condition of the rifle is mil-surp; you will see scratches and imperfections. The bore is bright and in great condition.For a Kansas City sale based in Missouri, a simple bill-of-sale will suffice, which will verify that you declare that you would be able to lawfully own this rifle. A driver's license is needed as well.For a Kansas City sale based in Kansas, a FFL transfer would be required and is paid for at your expense. There's numerous gun stores on the Kansas side that would perform a transfer for a fee. You will need a driver's license for that."

The Halo V Automatic from Microtech is the class of the OTF world and has one of the strongest firing blades we've ever seen. The blade is a whopping 4.6"" tactical awesomeness and is available in a variety of shapes and configurations. The handle is over 6"" in length so it's large enough for any sized hands, yet slim enough to carry with relative ease. The push button fires the blade out lightning fast and it also unlocks the blade so that when you pull the tab at the butt end of the knife, the blade retracts easily into the handle to fire again. It might be a little large to EDC for some but this knife is definitely a head turner and something you will hardly ever stop playing with. Comes complete with a Kydex sheath with Tek-Lok adapter so it can be carried at any angle you see fit on a belt. This is an absolutely amazing knife, one that really gives you an insight into how nice Microtech offerings are.FeaturesAutomatic Opening OTF designAction: Single Action - Auto Fire Pull tab incorporated into the back of the handle to retract bladeNo pocket clipTamper-resistant screwsLarge actuating button to accommodate glovesIncludes Kydex sheath with Tek-Lok adapterSpecificationsBlade Length: 4.6""Closed Length: 6.15""Overall Length: 10.75""Blade Style: Tanto, Black, Single Edge, Plain EdgeHandle Material: 6061-T6 Aluminum Mil-Spec Hard Coat AnodizedTrigger: 303 Stainless SteelSheath: Kydex with Tek-Lok AttachmentWeight: 5.2 oz.

Product Description
The criteria for the gun:
To achieve this, the gun was designed from its inception to be small, roughly 5.2 "" x 3.7""; to weigh a mere 13.5 oz; to be slim and smooth, devoid of any sharp edges or protrusions; and to have no external levers or controls to be manipulated. To get into action, one simply has to pull the trigger, which is a double-action only. The Rohrbaugh R9 is manufactured with space-age technology, using state-of-the-art CNC machining, which keeps tolerances to a minimum, thereby maintaining complete consistency in functioning. It is ergonomically designed to work seamlessly with the human body to point naturally and keeping the wrist and forearm in line. The design of the grip is also designed to push the recoil to the center of the palm, thereby reducing felt recoil.
State of the Art:
Rohrbaugh firearms are designed with the use of CAD/CAM programs. CNC machines perform the manufacturing. Then each gun is then hand fitted and assembled in our state of the art facility. The materials used are of the highest grade, including quality stainless steel, 7075 aircraft aluminum, G-10 grips and Wolff springs.
The R9 Steath is another version of the award-winning Rohrbaugh 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The R9 Stealth slides are coated with Titan Kote C12, which reduces friction, increases wear resistance and has anti-galling properties.

The 10/22 receiver remains mostly stock, with the standard trigger group; however, it is upgraded with a scope mounting rail and a heavy charging handle.2 barrels are included in the sale. Currently mounted (in the photos) is a .17hm2 caliber heavy barrel. Also included is the standard 10/22 barrel, chambered in 22LR. This gives the shooter 2 different caliber options. Switching back and forth takes about 5 minutes. 2 standard ten-round magazines are included.I won't factor in the value of the .17hm2 barrel in my asking price, since the ammunition is difficult to come by these days. Although, if you dig around online, you can still find it for sale. That's my loss, your gain.Condition of the rifle is good, although the finish inside the upper receiver seemed defective and flaked off easily; this is purely cosmetic and isn't visible from the outside.For a Kansas City sale based in Missouri, a simple bill-of-sale will suffice, which will verify that you declare that you would be able to lawfully own this rifle. A driver's license is needed as well.For a Kansas City sale based in Kansas, a FFL transfer would be required and is paid for at your expense. There's numerous gun stores on the Kansas side that would perform a transfer for a fee. You will need a driver's license for that."

Single action has a nice crisp break with no creep, while the double action is surprisingly smooth for factory. Everything locks up tight. I am the second owner as far as I know and have carried it in a hip pocket and leather holster periodically, but have not abused it nor pushed its limits. Feel free to make an offer. I have additional pictures available upon request. Please email or call/text with further questions . Thanks for looking.
