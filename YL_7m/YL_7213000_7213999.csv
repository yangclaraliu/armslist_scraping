Spyderco Spyderfly.  The spyderfly infuses traditional bali-song knife elements with innovative Spyderco design.  The blade is VG-10 that is sharpened on one side only. The spyderfly utilizes a dual-tang-pin-design. Large tang pins give a bigger contact area with the handles and are, therefore, stronger and more durable. If you squeeze hard you can just barely get them to meet. The harder you squeeze, the stronger an open bali-song is... until the handles touch. So by using a large tang pin and spacing the handles apart, spyderco allows you to squeeze hard and get a strong knife as a result. This is important because the spyderfly cannot be locked open. The latch only works to lock the knife closed. This may skirt legal restrictions on locking knives in some areas. However the spyderfly can lock shut making it a very safe knife to carry. In fact, the latch is part of  what makes the spyderfly unique. It's spring loaded. Just squeeze the handles and the latch springs open. The blade is a modified spearpoint. Spyderco hardens the blade to 59-60 rockwell hardness. The blade is made from 1/8"" thick VG-10 steel. The edge is flat ground and very sharp. the blade has a very nice brushed finish. The blade is very symetrical. Beautiful piece to have and not easily found in new, mint condition in original box"

The top barrel is choked full whereas the bottom is improved modified. As far as I know the gun is mechanically sound, but exhibits some wear as it is my go-to gun in weekly league trap shoots. Some bluing wear is evident on the underside of the receiver, but the barrels are bright and shiny. The lever appears to be slightly to the left of center, but the gun still locks up tight. The mid-bead is not the original white Browning mid-bead, but is a replacement type. The screws also have slight indentations from being removed and re-installed.I replaced the original high gloss forearm and buttstock with factory original Browning parts that have a hand-rubbed oil finish and a Browning buttpad. The LOP on the attached stock is approximately 14 1/8"" whereas the original wood had a LOP of approximately 13 3/4"". I replaced the wood because it looks prettier and to get a LOP that matches my shooting form. The original forearm and buttstock also had holes drilled on the underside, presumably to attach a sling and are included with the shotgun. There is no indication of salt wood issues with this wood. There appear to be two slight dings on the new wood from use and a hairline crack appeared on the left side of the forearm that is visible only if you really look for it."

This is an awesome carry pistol. It's compact and light but has the grip and feel of a medium sized pistol. I can shoot this pistol much more accurate than other small conceal carry guns because of the grip, it doesn't have that thin feeling.Bought the gun brand new earlier this year and have shot less than 100 rounds through it, all I did was break it in and clean it thoroughly after each time shooting. I like the Bersa so much that I bought 2 of them, it's my daily carry gun, I always have one on me. I figured I might as well get rid of the one I have hardly shot so I can buy something else. It was going to be my wife's carry pistol but she found something else in a much bigger caliber that she liked. I put a custom grip on it that I bought from Bersa. It's more of a rubber material and has finger slots, it's very comfortable and much better than the stock grip. I also replaced a few parts with polished nickel parts, mainly for looks, the mag release and the safety switch. I also have a nickel slide lock and a Nickel Trigger but haven't put it on yet. I have all the stock parts too that will come with the gun as well as the hard plastic Bersa gun case and all original paperwork. This gun also has a key lock for the trigger which is pretty cool, makes it very simple to lock the trigger so the gun can be stored safely.I also have extra mags for the gun, I will include an extra one, and will sell more of them if you want more, as well as ammo too.Will also include a nice custom holster. The free one is a ""sticky"" holster that you put the gun in and tuck the holster into you pants for easy concealment. It's my favorite kind of concealing holster. The other holster I have is a Fobus paddle holster to wear the gun on your hip by just sliding The ""paddle"" inside you pants along your hip.. It's custom fit for this gun and is a very good quality, it's also the most comfortable holster you will find, it doesn't pull down on your belt or move around while you're walking. I'll include it for an extra $15 which is way less than you can buy one for."

It's a standard A2 configuration with a chrome lined match grade HEAVY PROFILE barrel. It is the classic M16 A2 style with a NON-DETACHEABLE CARRY HANDLE. The rifle is zeroed in at 100 yards. I've only put around 300 rounds through it and it has been absolutely flawless with every magazine and is a tack driver. I only shoot brass .223 and XM193. Rifle has always been well maintained and looks almost brand new. The lockup between upper and lower receiver is extremely tight and still requires the rear takedown pin to be tapped out for field stripping.
 
The rifle is about a pound heavier than a standard government profile rifle but the extra weight isn't that bad. Still feels lighter than a fully loaded AK.
Just looking to downsize my collection. It will come with the following:
 
SIX aluminum GI 30 round mags of various manufacturers (BCM, ASC, C-Products)
TWO steel Israeli Elander 30 round mags
TWO  Brownells 20 round mags.
Surplus US military mag pouch (holds 3 mags)
OD green nylon web sling
Ontario replica M7 bayonet (excellent condition)
Blackhawk Sportster soft case (pictured)
M16 buttstock cleaning kit (located in buttstock) It actually counterbalances the weight of the heavy barrel very nicely when the rifle is shouldered.
.223 boresnake
Original manual
 
Asking for $500 cash only. No trades. No shipping. Price is firm. I don't need to sell the rifle so don't bother with lower offers. I can meet around Saint Paul (Midway area) weekdays after 6pm or weekends before Noon.
 
Must show a valid ID and PTP/PTC to buy. No exceptions. Thanks for looking!"

Top of the line shotgun, perfect for Trap-Skeet-Hunting. Comes with four different chokes as well as Beretta soft cover. Save yourself several hundred dollars !The A400 Xplor is a gas-operated action that was built for speed, reliability and versatility. Featuring the Blink technology, it is capable of firing 4 shells in less than 1 second, giving you the fastest follow-up shots of any shotgun on the market. Also, with this shotgun you can safely fire lead and steel shot, as well as chamber the best shell for the job regardless of length (2 ¾” to 3”) or power (mild for target to hard-hitting for hunting). Last but not least, the A400 action is light and trim, making this shotgun’s balance, swing and pointability an absolute best in its class.the A400 Xplor Action features multiple recoil-reducers that greatly diminish the impact of each shot on your shoulder (by as much as 70%). Inside the stock, there are hydraulic shock-absorbers that--much like in a modern luxury car--absorb the impact of any sudden bump, giving your shoulder a “smooth ride.” Also, the buttpad’s Micro-Core technology adds extra softness between you and any recoil that is left, while still allowing the shotgun to slide up effortlessly to your shoulder without the gummy friction of other pads.Sale will occur at my FFL shop here in Franklin, Tn. for safety and security reasons.

Use your compliance kit for a variety of builds!Video of the prototype installed on a Glock 17:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f586VbyE5nIFAQQ: Do I really need to build my 80% handgun this way to be legal?A: If you are a California resident and intend to build here, yes http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/showthread.php?t=896755 (AB 1964). If you plan on registering your gun, CA DOJ is asking for proof (pictures) of how it was built legally.Starting July 2018, all 80% builds will have to go through the registration process with CA DOJ CA Penal Code prohibits building ""unsafe"" handguns like the Polymer80 PF940C except:(b) Article 4 (commencing with Section 31900) and Article 5 (commencing with Section 32000) shall not apply to a single-shot pistol with a break top or bolt action and a barrel length of not less than six inches and that has an overall length of at least 10½ inches when the handle, frame or receiver, and barrel are assembled.Q: How is this better than a complete upper/slide replacement?A: The Easy Bolt was designed to be as safe and cost effective as possible. You are converting a Glock slide without having to modify any of the critical (and proven) slide components that interact with the components on the frame. You can also test your completed pistol frame (fitting the rails and testing the trigger) without breaking the law.Q: Can I use this to do SSE2 transfers of pistols such as the Lone Wolf Timberwolf Glock frames?A: The way AB 1964 amended the single shot exemption to the Handgun Roster, you can no longer SSE handguns that were previously semi auto (such as a Gen 4 Glock 19). We developed this solution for 80% builds, but it might be possible to SSE a Timberwolf frame if it is truly a virgin frame. We do not explicitly advise anyone to attempt this without first consulting with an attorney and have the blessing from Lone Wolf or another FFL that is comfortable doing the transfer. View the discussion on this topic http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/showthread.php?t=1301726Q: How do I load it when it's single shot?A: You will load a cartridge directly into the breech from the top. You must be careful not to damage your extractor when loading this way. Slamming the breech shut will likely damage your extractor. If you are worried about this happening, it is best to remove the extractor when you convert your slide. Leave the extractor in at your own risk.Q: Do I need to modify the magazine release to make my build single shot?A: Using the .25ACP Barrel Insert renders your slide a single shot. There is no way to magazine-feed in this configuration."

Talking mainly about holsters, pouches, etc."
