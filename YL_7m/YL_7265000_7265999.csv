Like its legendary FN forefathers, this combat handgun was designed to not only survive the battlefield, but to emerge victorious. It is the latest in technological advancements in handgun engineering, offering .45 ACP performance and a host of unique features that no other handgun can match.
Its 15-round magazine is precisely engineered to take a dive to the prone position and naturally roll up toward the target. The checkered polymer frame has a low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil, enhanced operator control, and a grip angle that provides unmatched natural point of aim. Four interchangeable backstraps come standard to quickly customize the grip feel. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous for ease of use. The 5.3″ cold hammer-forged stainless steel barrel has a threaded muzzle to accept sound suppressors, compensators, and other accessories. The stainless steel slide has high-profile combat night sights and includes two mounting bases to accept multiple styles of optional red-dot electronic sights."

It is the Performance Center model with large fiber optic sights, a ported barrel and slide, and an Apex sear.($40)The trigger is absolutely great. Crisp break, light pull (~5 lbs) and short reset. With the ported barrel and light bullets, I can shoot it just as fast and accurate as my full size M&P at 7 yards (~.16-.17 second splits)However, I am an expert pistol shot and this Performance Center Shield is not accurate enough for me. With my buddy's normal Shield, I did a 9 shot 25 yard group of about 2.5 inches. This gun won't do better than 6 inches at 25 yards. It is far more likely that I will use my ccw on a coyote or small game than anything else, and this shield is not rabbit accurate at 25 yards. That is the full disclosure on why I want to get another gun, and I imagine that it won't be a deal breaker for many people because I am an oddball who shoots small game with a ccw handgun.Anyways, I am looking to sell outright for $440 or trade for another 9mm Shield + cash on your end. The PC model and the sear put this at about $140 more than a standard Shield. Text or voicemail at 33030751ohfive"

Very little use on AR. Have boxes/accessories. Love this optic but I'm downsizing some things and just no room to keep. Cash only. No shipping. No trades. When situations demand split-second target acquisition and maximum field of view, mount up the StrikeFire II and shoot—both eyes open. Feature-rich, versatile and reliable, the StrikeFire II is a great choice for shooters who want a quality red dot sight, but don’t want to break the bank. Sleek rear-facing controls allow for easy adjustment of ten dot intensity levels—lowest two settings are night-vision compatible. The 30mm aluminum alloy chassis provides extra-high recoil rating and is waterproof and fog proof. Simple, fast, effective—the VMX-3T Magnifier will work with any of our red dots but it is not recommended for use with the prism scopes. The push-button design of the VMX-3T engages and disengages the flip-mount, allowing the magnifier to lock in place. The result, 3x magnified or unmagnified views at will. Optics are fully multi-coated for optimal light transmission. Lightweight and tough; hard-coat-anodized machined-aluminum construction ensures durability. Internally nitrogen purged for reliable waterproof/fogproof performance. Ultimate magnified versatility for virtually any AR-height red dot sight."

This Kel Tec Sub 2000 is compatible with 9mm Glock 17 mags and this offer comes with two 33 round magazines (""happy sticks""). This collapsable 9mm carbine is one of the coolest looking, most bad ass, and most functional guns around. The portability of this gun is insane. You can literally fit it in a backpack. Yes, you can fit a CARBINE in a backpack. Best of all, it's chambered in the super affordable 9mm so it’s a very economical gun to own. This gun has only been taken to the range and used 4 times. It's almost brand new. It also has a threaded barrel so you can shoot it suppressed if you want! The only complaint I've heard about the Kel-Tec Sub 2000 is that people with long arms find the stock a little short. No worries here. This gun comes with the removable stock extender pad. So if you have long arms, you are good to go. I'm 6'3 and it fits great with the extender. If you don't have long arms you can just take it off."
