I purchased this rifle on 10/20/2017 from Cabela's for $1,279.99 plus tax. This is an absolutely beautiful rifle but since purchasing I have changed my mind on it and want to get a bolt action hunting rifle instead. These Windham Weaponry rifles (the old Bushmaster company) are among the nicest you will find with a fit and finish that is the best I have seen on an AR type rifle. Rifle has a lifetime warranty which I didn't register for yet (warranty is transferrable also). Rifle also comes with an extra brand new Magpul 308 P-Mag.

I had two of these built from original HK33k parts kits with US made barrels around 2010 for use with my sear. This one was tested and ran flawlessly and has since remained in the safe. I’m keeping the other and no longer desire a duplicate. Since that time 33k parts kits have skyrocketed and I doubt you could get a premium HK builder to duplicate this toy for less than $2,200.Note that this does not have the pistol end cap. Never had one as it was used with a sear thus a stock was added. You will need to purchase an end cap or arm brace to use this as a pistol.

Stock # SA3-CEE. Serial # 33277. For the very Advanced Collector, this is a 7 ½” Colt SAA in .45 Colt Caliber. Made in 1876, the pistol was originally sold to the US Military as an “Cavalry” SAA. It was rejected by the Military Inspectors, and sent back to Colt. Colt re-worked the gun, and then sent it to J.P Moores Co in New York for resale on the Civilian Market. The pistol comes with a Colt factory letter that shows the shipment in 1876. The pistol still has a 7 ½” barrel, and the original wooden grips, there is a faint Military Inspector’s marking on the butt of the right grip. The pistol has the Colt Patent Dates, as well as a “US” marking on the left side of the receiver, it also has the # “3351” stamped in that area. The pistol has Colt’s Hartford address on top of the barrel. It also has an interesting 5 notches cut on the left side of the barrel, and also on the butt of the right grip. All the finish is missing, the pistol has patina and areas of very mild freckling, the grips show commensurate wear, the bore is somewhat dark with some visible marking. The cylinder retains all 4 cocks and locks up tightly. This is a excellent Colt SAA that will enhance a great collection! This is an antique firearm – if it is legal for you to own this weapon where you live, and with a copy of your Drivers License, establishing that you are over age 21, we can ship the rifle direct to your home, an FFL License is not required.Questions & Bidding: Please contact us with specific questions BEFORE bidding on an item."

Go ahead and compare it to the other one on here. You wil be hard pressed to find another rifle with these parts for this price again. And to be honest this has far superior internals and barrel than what F1 sells with their rifles.

The only thing on it that is ""budget"" is the red dot, and thats only on there because I put the MRO on a different rifle I just built.Email me or text me at REDACTED.

This medium frame, 6-shot revolver features comfortable rubber grips and a deep, lustrous finish. With fixed sights and a custom Single Action/Double Action trigger for improved accuracy and speed, the 65 is the perfect partner for whatever trouble lurks around the corner.Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.Features:Caliber: 357 MAGCapacity: 7Barrel Length: 4""Finish: Matte Stainless SteelGrip Black RubberAction: Double/SingleWeight: 38 ozRate of Twist: 1:16.5""Frame: MediumWidth: 1.496""Front Sight: FixedLength: 10 1/2""Grooves: 6Safety: Taurus Security System Transfer BarRear Sight: FixedHand: RightHeight: 5.48"""

The barrel measures 4 3/4 inches. I will tell you what I know about this 135 year old Colt as follows: I received this years ago from a cowboy/western shooter locally who used the gun in western competition shoots. He gave me several hundred rounds of .45 Colt black powder loads with the gun he had worked up over the years. I have never fired the gun. He asked a local gunsmith to clean up the finish on the gun The gunsmith ended removing all of the bluing, and it is now in the white. There is no significant rust or serious pitting. Please see the photos. The bore could use a good scrubbing. It has some corrosion, but the lands and grooves are present. The three serial numbers on the bottom for the frame match up to the serial number, 81855. There is no serial number on the cylinder. The side latch is numbered 232. It has bone or stage type grips on it which are not original. Everything appears to be functioning as far the action. I can not guarantee it's functioning as I have not fired it or had it checked by a gunsmith. I would recommend taking it in to a gunsmith if you plan on firing it. All in all a pretty neat old gun.This is an antique firearm and does not require an FFL transfer. Please ensure that you can legally receive it in your locality. The winner will send me a copy of their driver's license and payment within seven days. The gun will be packed carefully and shipped USPS priority with a tracking number."

The barrel measures 4 3/4 inches. I will tell you what I know about this 135 year old Colt as follows: I received this years ago from a cowboy/western shooter locally who used the gun in western competition shoots. He gave me several hundred rounds of .45 Colt black powder loads with the gun he had worked up over the years. I have never fired the gun. He asked a local gunsmith to clean up the finish on the gun The gunsmith ended removing all of the bluing, and it is now in the white. There is no significant rust or serious pitting. Please see the photos. The bore could use a good scrubbing. It has some corrosion, but the lands and grooves are present. The three serial numbers on the bottom for the frame match up to the serial number, 81855. There is no serial number on the cylinder. The side latch is numbered 232. It has bone or stage type grips on it which are not original. Everything appears to be functioning as far the action. I can not guarantee it's functioning as I have not fired it or had it checked by a gunsmith. I would recommend taking it in to a gunsmith if you plan on firing it. All in all a pretty neat old gun.This is an antique firearm and does not require an FFL transfer. Please ensure that you can legally receive it in your locality. The winner will send me a copy of their driver's license and payment within seven days. The gun will be packed carefully and shipped USPS priority with a tracking number."

It was one of the earliest Japan version with beautiful aged dark wood stock with gorgeous Rosewood inlays / tips and the white diamond under the pistol grip. My understanding is that this is the rare KTG version between the Italian Berretta version but prior to Nikko Kodensha in Japan taking over and then Mossberg and eventually Howa. It comes with a five rounds magazine. It has a very nice adjustable trigger that is light and crisp. My guess would be about a 2.5 lb trigger. It has a jeweled bolt and smooth action. It has the factory flip down rear sight set for different yardages. Another unique feature of this rifle is the fact you can shoot it in semi-auto mode or single shot. The single shot is great for new shooters or for training an experienced shooter to take their time between shots. The receiver looks nice and the barrel has a deep and dark blue to it. There are small spots where the blue is missing and some pitting set in at one point. The wood has nice checkering and a beautiful aged wood tone to it. There is a small hairline crack on the top where it meets the receiver. You can twist on it and the crack does not open up at all so i don't think it will effect the performance. I could not get any more photos to upload, so if you would like to see that photo or any other photos, email me and I am happy to send that photo.I will only sell to a legal buyer willing to show ID and sign a firearm bill of sale. or we can transfer through the dealer of your choice at buyers expense.
