The price is barely above the factory cost plus shipping, tax, and FFL fees I paid. These limited-edition rifles sold out very quickly, and you can no longer get one from the factory."

It is no safe queen, and shows the characteristic lines of wear on the slide from being carried a lot because someone loved it. It has around 2k+ rounds through it, and though there is some small dings in the frame, it was extremely well maintained internally.

This is the original .22 pistol that Bill Ruger invented back in 1949, and it put Sturm Ruger on the map as a serious gun company. Manufactured in 1975. The condition is good. There is significant wear on the back strap from use, and some minor imperfections on top of the receiver. This is one of the sweetest shooting .22 pistol I have ever owned. Comes with one magazine.I am 20 years old, and legal to buy, sell, and trade handguns in Tennessee.
