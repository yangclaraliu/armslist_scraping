Chambered in 9x19, the G19 has found worldwide acclaim with both private and public security agencies. In addition to being used as a conventional service pistol, it is ideal for concealed carry or as a backup weapon.The most popular GLOCK pistol of all time is now available with the numerous improvements that define the Gen 5 pistol line. The versatility of the G19 is further enhanced in its fifth generation while also preserving the dependability it is known for.The GLOCK 19 Gen5 showcases the latest technology and engineering that drives GLOCK's constant pursuit of perfection. The G19 Gen5 features over 20 design modifications from its Gen4 predecessor, including the GLOCK Marksman Barrel, an nDLC finish, ambidextrous slide stop levers, a grip with no finger grooves, and a flared mag-well, all wrapped in a package perfect for concealed carry or use as a back-up weapon. These changes deliver improved accuracy, durability, performance, control, and flexibility in both low-stress and high-stress situations.Improved Durability - NDLC FinishThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature the proprietary GLOCK nDLC finish. This enhanced finish reduces corrosion and scratching and improves performance in adverse conditions.Improved Accuracy - Glock Marksman Barrel (GMB)The GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature the GLOCK Marksman Barrel. The barrel’s new rifling and crown deliver improved accuracy for both the beginner and the seasoned gun owner.Universal Fit - No Finger GroovesThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols have no finger grooves on the grip. Removing the finger grooves improves the ergonomics of the grip, delivering consistent comfort and improved control to a wider range of consumers, regardless of hand size.Quicker Reloading - Flared Magazine WelThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature a flared mag-well. The larger opening found in the mag-well of GLOCK Gen5 pistols makes quicker and easier magazine changes possible, particularly in high-stress situations where fractions of a second matter.Ambi Operation - Ambidextrous Slide StopThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature ambidextrous slide stop levers. Now it is easier than ever for both left-handed and right-handed gun owners to quickly, comfortably, and safely manipulate the slide."

The versatility of the G19 is further enhanced in its fifth generation while also preserving the dependability it is known for.The GLOCK 19 Gen5 showcases the latest technology and engineering that drives GLOCK's constant pursuit of perfection. The G19 Gen5 features over 20 design modifications from its Gen4 predecessor, including the GLOCK Marksman Barrel, an nDLC finish, ambidextrous slide stop levers, a grip with no finger grooves, and a flared mag-well, all wrapped in a package perfect for concealed carry or use as a back-up weapon. These changes deliver improved accuracy, durability, performance, control, and flexibility in both low-stress and high-stress situations.Improved Durability - NDLC FinishThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature the proprietary GLOCK nDLC finish. This enhanced finish reduces corrosion and scratching and improves performance in adverse conditions.Improved Accuracy - Glock Marksman Barrel (GMB)The GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature the GLOCK Marksman Barrel. The barrel’s new rifling and crown deliver improved accuracy for both the beginner and the seasoned gun owner.Universal Fit - No Finger GroovesThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols have no finger grooves on the grip. Removing the finger grooves improves the ergonomics of the grip, delivering consistent comfort and improved control to a wider range of consumers, regardless of hand size.Quicker Reloading - Flared Magazine WellThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature a flared mag-well. The larger opening found in the mag-well of GLOCK Gen5 pistols makes quicker and easier magazine changes possible, particularly in high-stress situations where fractions of a second matter.Ambi Operation - Ambidextrous Slide StopThe GLOCK Gen5 pistols feature ambidextrous slide stop levers. Now it is easier than ever for both left-handed and right-handed gun owners to quickly, comfortably, and safely manipulate the slide."

It is a Model 70 Winchester Ranger in 30-06. It shoots extremely well and currently has a Bushnell Banner 3x9 with an illuminated reticle. It isn't a super high end scope but it is clear and holds true. The stock has no markings that I can find and the bluing is in good shape all around. Smooth action and decent trigger to still be factory original. I actually bought it off someone in financial trouble last year and honestly have no need for it. I have other great rifles I am more partial to. So I would honestly just like to free up the cash i have in it and look onward to my next purchase. Feel free to contact with any questions.

In the attached pic, you'll see a 7-shout group, at 1.4 MOA using Federal match ammo, in high wind.  That's off the bipod and a sandbag at the back, nothing else.  In other words, this delivers the goods, and THEN some, no tricks.  That translates into hitting man-sized targets consistently out to 700-800 yards, with off-the-shelf ammo.  Further load development should improve that a bit more, if that's your thing...This thing just *shoots,* eats anything you feed it, and is no-BS reliable...  And everyone who sees it thinks it looks REALLY cool.I'm selling it to get something smaller, lighter that I can handle more easily while carrying all my gear.  Questions, text or call at REDACTED.  [Yeah, originally a California #, but I live here in PA now, so there you go....]"

I've had some failures to eject (using my preferred ammo Magtech which I have a ton of, did fine with some S&B I tried) after installing everything and haven't messed with it enough to get it up to snuff, I honestly was hoping the trigger kit would do more and have decided to give up on the gun but I have kept all the original parts so you can either try to find ammo it likes better like the Sellier & Bellot or try switching things around to get a good balance. This trigger kit alone was $100 so if you aren't in the market for a Bodyguard that's had some work done to it this probably isn't for you."

Not a scratch or speck of rust on it. I purchased this shotgun late last season for upland, only took it out twice total on trails. I've trap shot with it mostly, only 250 shells or less through the gun. I've shot trap with it 7 times total and the rest is generously estimated rounds used while hunting. The ONLY reason for me selling is I've acquired a new shotgun that is left-handed (I'm a lefty in a righty world)... and I'll never use it now that I have a shotgun that's true-handed to me.I have all the original packaging, extra chokes, choke key, and spacers. Everything that comes with the gun out of the box... I have. The shotgun runs flawlessly and has been extremely well maintained with ""Lucas Extreme Duty Gun Oil"". And still has technically 5 years on its factory warranty.this is a great buy for someone looking to save $140(including sales tax) on what pretty much is a new gun. *Will listen to serious offers***MUST BE at least 18 years of age to purchase****MUST fill out a private bill of sale****Sale is final, no return, no refund.**"
