Revolver is of modern design and of all stainless steel construction with a very nice finish. Revolver appears to be little fired, might be unfired, I have not fired it. Revolver shows no holster wear, no rust, no drop marks, action is smooth, trigger is nice, screw heads are not buggered. Bore looks like new, action is tight, Pachmayr grips are very nice and provide proper puchase, rear sight adjustable for windage. Buyer must have HQL or be HQL exempt, will meet buyer at gunshop in Southern Maryland of your choice for lawful transfer, buyer pays all transfer fees, but there is no sales tax on this kind of sale. Not interested in trades."

It features a reinforced polymer body that cuts down on the weight, stainless steel .223 Wylde barrel, birdcage flash hider, oversized trigger guard, and alumnium handguard with rail sections. This is the second generation ATI Omni with the reinforced buffer tube thread -- not the first gen model. Speaking of buffer tube, the castle nut is not staked so you can easily replace the padded buffer tube with a SIG or Shockwave brace. I bought this gun for my trunk, but it's seen very little use. After lubing and examining the build, I ran four magazines through it -- all flawlessly. That's it. It will come with two polymer mags, including a new-in-package PMAG. If you prefer aluminum mags, I'll swap them out for you. Face to face transfer within 25 miles of Boones Mill/Roanoke/Salem. I will need to see valid Virginia ID.

I am the original owner and it only has 6 rounds through the 9mm cylinder and 54 round of 38 special target loads and 12 rounds of .357 Magnum target loads through the .357 cylinder. It comes with the original box and paperwork. I am asking $650 or best reasonabe offer. Cash only (paypal accepted). Absolutely no trades of any kind. I am selling to raise money for a business I am starting, so another gun or ammo won't help me.Here is a link to the pistol on the Lipsey's website:http://www.lipseys.com/itemdetail.aspx?itemno=RUNVB-35XProspective buyers must be at least 21 years of age, a Georgia resident, be able to show that they are not a felon (i.e. voter registration card, CCW permit), and be willing to sign a bill of sale.  If you do not have all the proper ID's, we can meet at an FFL to have a background check done, but you will be responsible for the entire fee the FFL charges for that service.I am located between Newnan and Peachtree City."

Its inertia-operated system with rotating locking head shoots everything from 1 oz. field loads up to 1 3/4 oz. magnum loads, including steel shot, without any adjustments. The recoil spring is housed in the fore-end, increasing the strength of the stock and allowing a more elegant grip design.  This 212 Series semi-automatic shotgun features an inertia operated system, black synthetic stock with blued 26 inch barrel, 3"" chamber, and recoil spring that is housed in the fore-end of the stock. It is comprised of high quality materials with precise craftsmanship and comes complete with choke tubes and stock shim kit that allow for a customized fit and feel. This lightweight, balanced shotgun will be your best friend for a hunting day with a long walk. The Dickinson guns are built in the AKTAS factory located in Huglu, Turkey.

It has only been used for one round of trap at my local range. This gun is everything you’d expect from Beretta, its smooth and very well balanced. This gun is an investment that can be passed on for generations; all of the components and functionality to this gun have been designed with the sportsman’s field needs being top priority. The matte finished wood stock and bronze recover will stand out while on display in a gun safe or local trap range. The Barrel sight rib was damaged while it was placed in a holding rack at the trap range. The firearm fell over and landed on the concrete while out of my sight and I had not even fired a round with it yet. It was immediately looked over by a professional gunsmith that happened to be onsite at that time and was determined the damage was isolated to the site rib only and was safe to use. Immediately Beretta USA was contacted with an email and pictures of the damage, after review of information it was sent to Beretta’s factory gunsmith shop Colegunsmithing. This second party specializes in shotguns and is one of only a handful of shops in the United States Authorized to do factory repairs of Beretta Shotguns. The Barrel was fixed and the dents were removed, it was then thoroughly inspected and given a clean bill of health from the team at Cole Gunsmithing. I have all paper work and receipts confirming this work along with all purchase receipts and warrantees. I am willing to provide all stated paperwork on request. I have also requested Cole to assist in any other verification and questions the new owner may have."
