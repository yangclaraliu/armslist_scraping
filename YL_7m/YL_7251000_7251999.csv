The nicely painted McMillen stock has an anschutz rail for that accepts both bi-pod and sling adaptors. The rifle was fired at one NRA 600 yard match using sierra 220 grain bullets. It shot very well and held 3"" of elevation through three seperate 20 round strings of fire at 600 yards. The butt plate is fully adjustable as is the cheeck piece. I purchased this rifle from Kent Reeve ""world renown highpower marksman"" after he won the national championship with this rifle in Camp Perry, Ohio for $2000.00. I had to rebarrel the gun since the barrel on it was shot out. A certified gunsmith install the new barrel, he also did the bedding and trigger as well as recoat the action. I purchased this gun to shoot F-Open and NRA highpower. I do not have the time to invest in F open or NRA highpower so my loss is your gain. I have about $3500.00 is the rifle I am asking $2200.00 plus shipping and handling. I also have forester dies, 300 WSM brass, and a few hundred 215 berger hybrid projectiles if you would like to purchase them with the rifle. Bottom line is this rifle shoots very very well...

The Nitecore TIP 2017 edition is every bit as powerful as its predecessor with new dual modes and a detachable clip. The new “Daily” and “Constant On” modes give users more control over their light based on their intended frequency of use. In Daily mode the Tip will automatically shut off after 30 seconds of use meaning you’ll never have to worry about leaving your flashlight on again. For those who desire more control, Constant On mode will stay on until turned off.   Weighing under an ounce, the TIP 2017 uses a CREE XP-G2 S3 LED to emit a max of 360 lumens. Instead of an electronic lockout mode, the Tip 2017 has the new detachable multi-purpose clip which doubles as a switch protector, preventing accidental button pushing. Rechargeable through the built-in micro USB port, the internal li-ion battery and circuit design give this keychain flashlight up to 46 hours of run-time and holds up to a year in stand-by. A few minutes with the Tip 2017 and it’s clear this flashlight is a worthy addition or upgrade to any keychain.

This trigger is a $300 upgrade from the standard 1416 D HB. Quality at it's best fit and finish.   Low round count . I bought a brick wolf match ammo and still have 100 rounds left from it so its had 400rds through it mostly hunting. The accuracy is amazing.  it lives in my safe and don't see much day light any more.  It has a custom aluminum tactical bolt handle.  If your looking for tiny groups this one will do it from bench rest target shooting to squirrel hunting it will shoot 1 hole 5 shoot groups at 50 yards off a rest with match grade ammo.  She has a few light handling mark on the stock from hunting but Nothing bad. Bluing is still great and no scratches. I have about $1300 in it and the accuracy is worth it. Will leave scope and rings on it for the right deal.  I ain't seen a anschutz that won't shoot lights out. Not for sale.  trade only.  FTF TRADE ONLY.  No Shipping. IF YOU ARE READING THIS AD IT'S STILL AVAILABLE.........for TRADE ONLY.
