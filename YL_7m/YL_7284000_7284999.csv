A collaboration between Spyderco® and Italy’s LionSteel, it traces its history to the two companies’ first cooperative effort, the LionSpy™, and that knife’s inspiration, LionSteel’s award-winning SR-1. In simple terms, the Lil’ LionSpy distills all the unique qualities of the popular full-sized version in a more compact, pocket-friendly format. Its blade is ground from premium Elmax steel—a third-generation powdered metallurgy steel from Austria’s Böhler-Uddeholm. Known for its high carbon and chromium contents and extra-fine grain structure, Elmax provides extreme edge holding and corrosion resistance. The Lil’ LionSpy’s two-piece handle construction consists of one black G-10 scale and one titanium scale. The titanium scale is precision machined from solid 6Al-4V titanium and serves as the basis of the knife’s stout R.I.L. mechanism. To minimize lock wear and guarantee a long service life, this mechanism features a hardened steel insert and LionSteel’s patented RotoBlock device. This titanium disk serves as an overtravel stop for the lock bar and, when rotated, wedges the lock bar in place to prevent unintentional lock release during hard-use cutting chores. The handle features an open-backed design to reduce weight and simplify cleaning, as well as a series of CNC-machined grooves to enhance its texture. A compact pocket clip attached to the titanium scale supports right-side, tip-up orientation and ensures convenient carry and easy access.            Model Number    Model Name    Closed Length    Blade Length    Edge Length    Blade Thickness    Steel      C181GTIP    Lil’ LionSpy    4.02″/102mm    3.12″/79mm    2.96″/75mm    .157″/4.0mm    Elmax      ~Model Number Model Name Closed Length Blade Length Edge Length Blade Thickness Steel C181GTIP Lil’ LionSpy 4.02”/102mm 3.12”/79mm 2.96”/75mm .157”/4.0mm Elmax"

I've owned it for almost two years now, and at this point I'd rather sell it for a SCAR 16s SBR.Let's get the FAQs out of the way:1) First and only owner. Upper was bought new from the MFG.2) About 2000 rounds through it.3) No broken parts. Upper is fully functional, and even reliable if lubed properly with firearms grease (not oil).4) Steel feed tray and semi-auto BCG. The BCG cut may work with a lightning link if you're into that, but this is unconfirmed.5) Does not include a lower. If you want it shipped, it goes straight to your door (except where prohibited - state and local laws apply).6) Cash or trade for a SCAR 16s. Other offers need not inquire.Comes with about 100 new (never fired) M27 links, AR magwell -> SAW nutsack adapter, one UCP-patterned 100 round nutsack, extra power buffer spring, H3 buffer, carbine stock spacer, and a worn-ish 16"" heavy profile quick-change barrel.This item is priced to move quickly, mostly so I can get a tax stamp in on a SCAR in time for an event next year, and because the barrel isn't in the shape the rest of the upper is. The upper was used, but never abused. No FA belt/mag dumps or anything like that. However, wear is wear, especially on a barrel which often travels loose outside the gun."

That DESCRIPTION FROM BERETTA: ""The Beretta 3032 Tomcat Inox is tiny, sized like average cell phone. Besides offering the power of the .32 ACP cartridge, it sports a tough and durable stainless-steel finish. This double/single-action autopistol it is perfect for deep concealment or used as a backup second handgun. Its tip-up barrel design makes it easy to load, operate and maintain, while its traditional looks give it the allure of a true classic. The controls of the 3032 Tomcat Inox are designed to be simple and to provide safety and peace of mind while carrying. The two-position safety engages crisply and positively, and locks the slide as well as preventing the pistol from firing. The magazine release is located to the left of the grip, making it easy to locate and operate even with one hand. The 3032 features a tip-up barrel design typical of the classic Beretta small-frame pistols. Thanks to this design, you never need to rack the slide and you can load that first round directly into the chamber. This is especially convenient in cold weather, or for people with weaker hands. Another advantage is that the barrel may be easily cleaned without taking the pistol apart, making it convenient to give the pistol a quick wipe after a session at the range. Right from their inception, Beretta small frame pistols such as the 3032 Tomcat Inox were designed to be carried concealed. Therefore, the lines of the Tomcat are snag-free, with the sights being engineered to easily slide in and out of a holster, pocket or belly-band without catching on anything. The rear sight is adjustable for windage, so that you can easily experiment shooting different loads while keeping your sights on target. All these features have made Beretta small frames like the 3032 a favorite for concealed carry and self-defense."""

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are checkered double diamond walnut. Both panels are heavily worn, with smoothed checkering and many surface marks and scratches. Despite the age, there are no cracks and they still fit the frame well. The grips rate in about Good condition. Type of Finish: The finish is Parkerized Finish Originality: Though we cannot find an arsenal mark, it looks to be arsenal refinished for WWII Bore Condition: The bore is gray and the rifling shows light wear. There is light erosion the length of the bore but a good cleaning may improve it greatly... It is dirty... Overall Condition: This pistol retains about 60% of its metal finish. The newer finish shows natural age and thinning, with edge wear and scattered light erosion. If we had to guess, we would assume the gun saw lots of service after the refinish. Despite the honest wear, there is nothing obtrusive... The screw heads are mildly disfigured. The markings are soft but visible. Overall, this pistol rates in about Very Good condition. Mechanics: The action functions correctly. It has both a manual and grip safety and the trigger pull is crisp. The slide is tight to the frame. We did not fire this pistol. The pistol has a lanyard ring on the bottom of the mainspring housing. Box, Paperwork & Accessories: This pistol comes with one blued 7 round magazine. It is marked with an S on the top of the tope for Scovill. The magazine is in about Good overall condition. FOR ANY OTHER INFORMATION FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME. THANKS"

You can safely hide your guns in plain sight yet have fast easy access to them.It much safer than storing your firearms in your nightstand ,closet, or under your bed especially if you have children in your home. Also works great for storing jewelry,valuables,or anything else you don't want someone else to find and plus a thief can't steal what they can't find. The shelf is designed to conceal your firearms but not take the place of a safe. Safes work good for storing firearms but are a disadvantage if you need to access you self defense weapon in a hurry. This shelf only takes seconds to open.
 
 The 4"" candlesticks holders have magnets in the bottom to use as a keys to open the shelf. To open the shelf you place the candlestick holders over the  area of the lock .The holders will draw itself to the locks then you give the shelf a slight squeeze to release the lock.The shelf will slowly lower down with the gas struts.The shelf only takes a few seconds to open.

.
The top trim closely overlaps the bottom trim to help hide the seam where the shelf opens.When close no one would ever think that the shelf opens.
 .Our shelves have straight interior trim walls which provide more usable interior space and prevent items that are not trimmed into the foam from falling out when opened.  .  ***trade for handgun**"
