In Double-Action mode the internal striker is at rest with no pre-load and the trigger travel is 14 mm (0.55 in) long at approximately 38 N (8.5 lbf) trigger pull. When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon (re)loading, the internal striker is manually pre-cocked to Single-Action mode and the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot and the Anti Stress mode is activated. The trigger travel is 14 mm (0.55 in) long in the Anti Stress mode at approximately 20 N (4.5 lbf) trigger pull. On all subsequent shots, the P99AS is automatically pre-cocked and the trigger travel is reduced to 8 mm (0.3 in) at the same 20 N (4.5 lbf) trigger pull. For manually deactivating the Anti Stress mode and setting the pistol to Double-Action mode the P99AS features a decock key or knob on the slide. The Anti Stress mode can also be manually activated by moving the slide approximately 10 mm (0.4 in) back. It has a Double-Sided mag release on the trigger guard. I am including 150 Jacketed Hollow Point and 150 Standard rounds, totalling 300 rounds, a Blackhawk holster, All factory paperwork, 4 mags, and a quick loader. I have also included a picture of the serial number for easy lookup. Please call David at REDACTED."

I also have the original box, if that interests you at all.While I am open to considering any offer, some things that I am particularly interested in are a Spyderco Manix 2, Spyderco PM2, a Griptilian with a sheeps foot blade instead of the drop point, or something else of similar value with a hole and/or an emerson opener. But like I say, I'm a knife guy and I will consider anything. I would prefer a knife of similar value.

Manufactured from 1989-1999, it found quick acceptance by law enforcement and remains one of the most iconic duty pistols of the 1990s as seen on TV in Miami Vice and Terminator movies to mention just a few. This is a big bad pistol with the legendary stopping power of the .45 cal. round. 
This pistol is a late model 4506-1 manufactured 6/11/1998. The Hogue grips are brand new and the finish is a very good @ 95%. The pistol is exceptionally clean and the internals were polished for butter smooth action including an awesome Performance Center quality trigger for oustanding accuracy. There are no noticeable signs of wear and the bore is excellent.It comes with three 8 round magazines in a Smith & Wesson plastic case including the original instruction manual.
The action is called Traditional Double Action (TDA) which describes a longer 1st shot trigger pull which cocks the hammer, and single action short, crisp, and light trigger pull on subsequent shots. The spurred hammer can be manually cocked to single action as well. An ambidextrous safety / decocker is featured for convenience and ultimate safety. These pistols were overbuilt to last a lifetime.  By today's standards this is no carry gun at 41 ozs., but an ideal collector piece or perfect for home protection and an absolute joy at the range. 
Please email  or call / text Bill 813 . 857 . 8287 for more info or pictures. I'm willing to meet anywhere in the bay area to show this fine pistol."

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.   While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit. Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine. Made in U.S.A. FEATURES   Next-generation impact and crush resistant polymer construction   Modified dimensions allow for wider compatibility with non Colt-spec ‘STANAG 4179’ platforms   Constant-curve internal geometry for smooth feeding   Anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability   Long life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, black-oxide coated (MIL-DTL-13924D)   Anti-glare translucent MagLevel windows on both sides of the body along with a painted indicator on the spring allows for easy determination of rounds remaining from 1 to 30   Over-travel insertion stop on the spine   Ribbed gripping surface and new aggressive front and rear texture for positive magazine handling   Paint pen dot matrix panels on the bottom of the body to allow for identification marking   Flared floorplate aids magazine handling and disassembly yet is slim enough for use with many double and triple pouches   Pop-off Impact/Dust Cover to minimize debris intrusion and for ammunition protection in storage and transit"
