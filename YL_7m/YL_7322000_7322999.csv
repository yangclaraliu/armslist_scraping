SMITH COLLECTORS GUN CASE.  If you like the guns restored, we can provide that service to historical perfection in a very reasonable amount of time.  When they only made 10 of them, this is truly your only chance to own such a fine Elsie.  Don’t let this one get away!  Thanks for looking."

The bluing is excellent and the bore is very shiny. The stock has a significant amount of trench art indicating it was used as designed.

The Colt Peacemaker Model 1873 was the mainstay of the Frontier.  This Colt, sn249268 shipped in 1903, is in superb factory original condition, untouched by the restorer’s hands, still retaining 97% strong factory case color, about 85% nice dark factory blue (showing some natural holster wear, but no rust, pits, or remnants of such), a desirable 7 ½” barrel with excellent sharp rifling, clear sharp lettering and stampings, excellent original screws, hard rubber grips original and serial numbered to the gun with just light wear to the checkering, all matching serial numbers…just a delightful, honest example of a fine Colt from the turn of the century.  A factory letter documenting the gun is included in the photos and will accompany the gun upon sale.  The .32-20 was only 8% of the total production of Colt SAA revolvers, so represents a rather rare caliber.  It is also a caliber that interchanged with the Winchester 1892 rifle so that a cowboy could have one batch of cartridges for both rifle and handgun.  The ammunition is still available and a recent gun writer dubbed the .32-20 the first “MAGNUM” .32 caliber cartridge, as it develops impressive speed and ballistics for a smaller caliber SAA.  What a fun gun this would be to shoot some tin cans or jack rabbits with.  Just imagine where this gun has been and the stories it could tell!  The gun was shipped to San Francisco, California in the days there were still cowboys and drifters gambling in the saloon and gunfighting in the streets.  It was likely ordered by a rancher or picked up at the General Store to carry while tending cattle and riding the range.  The mechanics of the gun are excellent, with the timing of the action perfect and no play in the cylinder when cocked.  If case color remaining is the measure of the gun, as some people say, this is a very high condition gun indeed.  I state 90% overall with no excuses.  Thanks for looking!"

They are truly the worlds most battle proven firearms manufacture.I'm asking $1200 cabelas sells them for $1349 and maccabee arms sells them for $1289 when in stock. So i don't think $1200 is unreasonable considering, it's brand new never fired abd your saving taxes and BG check. FNH shipped this gun to Nevada on 9/11/2017."

""The SpecterDR 4x/1x Dual Role Optical Sight represents a revolution in optical sight design. The world’s first truly dual field of view combat optical sight, the SpecterDR switches instantly from a 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight with the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes.
Depending upon the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the crosshair or just a brilliant red dot in the center. In 1x mode, the SpecterDR has by far the largest field of view in the industry. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN’S legendary crystal clear image.
The SpecterDR 4x/1x offers the best single solution for both Medium Range and CQB engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use."""

This is a 1988 Taurus model 66, 6 shot, 4 inch barrel 357 revolver. This gun was just picked up from the smith a few days ago where he applied a satin blue finish. And before he got it, it had just returned from Taurus in Florida where they replaced all the internals that showed signs of wear, such as the firing pin. The gun is tight and is a power house. The model 66 from 1986-1988 was produced using the same exact machines and metal as the S&W K-frames of the time due to Taurus buying an S&W's factory and using the equipment and left over material. You can look up this year model, it is sought after as it is known as the best revolver Taurus has ever made. I am looking to sell it, but i would trade for another handgun only. I would even trade it for another revolver that is smaller and is rated for continuous 38+p. Just let me know what you have to offer."

Smith & Wesson has pioneered the use of titanium alloys in its revolvers, resulting in weapons that are much easier to carry concealed, without sacrificing strength. Titanium, when compared to steel, is lighter, tougher, and absolutely rust-proof.Â  The 342PD is over four ounces lighter than the aluminum-frame/steel cylinder 442, and three-quarters of a pound lighter than the stainless steelÂ  model 640. In a pocket gun, every ounce counts, and the 342PD is the lightest concealed-hammer .38 Special revolver you can buy. Only the S&W 337PD exposed-hammer Chiefâ€™s Special is lighter, by one-tenth of an ounce. The 342PD has a handsome two-tone finish, with the aluminum frame, barrel shroud, and cylinder yoke finished in a matte black, and the titanium cylinder and stainless barrel liner in a dull gray. The barrel / cylinder gap on this revolver is very even and tight for a revolver of this type, measuring only three one-thousandths of an inch. The 342PD has a fixed notch rear sight with a highly visible red insert in the ramp front. These sights are just about perfect for a snub-nose revolver, and are absolutely snag proof. The trigger is five-sixteenths of an inch wide and smoothly finished on its surface, resulting in a trigger pull that feels lighter than the ten and one-half pound measured pull weight. The feel of the action, in typical Smith & Wesson style, is buttery smooth. The trigger is within easy reach of even a small hand, but the excellent Hogue Bantam synthetic grip feels great in my large sized, fat-fingered left hand.Â  The ejector rod on the 342PD is protected by the barrel shroud, and provides a five-eighths of an inch ejection stroke. The top of the frame, bottom of the trigger guard, and back strap of the grip frame have been relieved of excess metal for further weight savings. This gun is a one owner gun that has been test fired only.MN buyer needs MN stae photo ID and Permit.Out of state buyer pays flat $30 shipping to his local FFL."

It takes the concept of a modular rifle to futuristic levels, while maintaining an absolutely simple operation that make it ultra-reliable. With ambidextrous controls, easily-replaceable barrel and virtually endless possibilities for customization and accessorization, the ARX100 is adaptable to any firing scenario and is perfect for today’s most demanding tactical shooter. The ARX100 features a constant contact/short-stroke gas piston system that makes it feed and fire under the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight techno polymer receiver allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricants. To make maintenance easy and trouble-free, this rifle has no pins and can be completely disassembled in a matter of seconds with no tools at all. This rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction. The possibilities for accessorization on the ARX100 are limited only by the user’s imagination. It comes out of the box with a full-length Picatinny rail on top, which is perfect for attaching a variety of optics and other sighting systems. It also has Picatinny rails on both sides of and under the fore-end, which offer countless possibilities for easily adding lighting systems and other tactical devices."
