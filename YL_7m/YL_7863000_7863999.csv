Why meddle with an axe shape that has been tried and true for over a thousand years? That’s the logic designer and veteran Elmer Roush brings to the Freyr tactical axe. The deep beard echoes Viking style. But its balance and pure burliness boosts it into a contemporary league all its own. Shield and Viking battle cry not included. Elmer Roush of Brasstown, North Carolina has one foot definitively in the past. When it comes to designing axes, that is. Though the Freyr’s deep beard might not be put to use drawing back an enemy’s shield as it would have in Viking-patrolled seas of lore, the balance it adds elevates this axe to a modern workhorse. Named after the Norse god of prosperity, its Viking soul stands up to its classic appearance. The blade itself is hot forged of carbon steel and receives a passivation treatment for ultimate corrosion resistance. It’s met with a handle carved of Tennessee hickory and is precisely crafted for durability and ease of use. An aftermarket leather sheath is available for purchase. If it’s true that history repeats itself, then this utilitarian axe is definitive proof.         Hot Forged 1055 Carbon Steel         Prominent Useful Beard Design         Tennessee Hickory Handle         Designed By Elmer Roush         Lifetime Warranty         Axe Head Plain Edge"

The blade has two finishes: a satin finish on the grind and a stonewashed finish on the upper. The handle’s front scale of textured G-10 offers a secure grip and the handle’s stainless steel back has a solid frame lock. The CQC-6K is a manual opener using either the thumb disk or the patented Emerson “wave shaped feature.” This opening feature enables the knife to be opened as it is removed from the pocket. By the time the knife has been fully withdrawn from the pocket, the blade is deployed and ready for use. A small wave-shaped tab on the top of the blade is built to catch on the pocket seam, opening the knife as it comes out of the pocket. This instant-open feature is a favorite among military, rescue, and law enforcement knife users.

Up for sale is my Arsenal SLR104fr. I bought it in fall of 2017. It has approximately 400rds through it of Silver Bear ammo. To go with the rifle, there are 2000rds of Barnaul lacquer coated and sealed 5.45 from SGAmmo, plus whatever was left from the Silver Bear. It will come as shown with the RS Regulate side rail mount, and a Holosun with the ACSS reticle. It also sports a Magpul ms1 gen 2 sling that has been attached to the original Bulgarian sling clip. I also have a spare bolt repair kit for it that will go with the rifle. It currently wears a Polish safety with the finger tab from AKOU. Original trigger and safety will go with rifle as well. Cleaning kit still resides in the stock, and will go with rifle. The rifle has never seen corrosive ammo. Still, it was thoroughly cleaned and lubricated after its only range day. I really enjoy the rifle, but am looking into a 308 that I can't afford without letting go of something else. I’m not willing to part out at this time, it’s a package deal. Asking $1800.00 shipped. I can meet face to face near Kent/Akron, OH. Otherwise, I can ship my FFL to yours. I will accept certified check/money order, or PayPal gift. I have an eBay account (hox013) if you're looking for seller feedbacks. I am happy to answer any questions and provide more pictures if requested. I receive email to my phone, and will probably be the quickest way to receive a response. This will be cross-posted to other places. First ""I’ll take it"" by time stamp will receive it. Thank you for looking, stay safe."
