She's a perfect example of a Luftzeugamt (LZA for short, Luftwaffe Equipment Depot) repaired K98. She is all-matching and in surprisingly nice condition. No import marks. Price is negotiable and I can provide pics of anything, check my other listings.-----For those of you unfamiliar, the Luftwaffe was the air force of Nazi Germany. The Luftwaffe (air force), Kriegsmarine (navy), and Heer (army) were the three branches of the Wehrmacht.The 'M' marked Kriegsmarine and 'L' marked Luftwaffe rifles are more sought after and generally in better condition than their 'H' marked Heer counterparts.More info on the factory rebarreling: the markings indicate that the raw forging was made by Ruhrstal, who sold it to Geco, who in turn sold the barrel to a Luftwaffe ordinance which put it into use. The barrel was made in 1940 but the rifle could have been rebarreled any time between then and the end of the war. This is a time period accurate restoration."

I have an RA-140 in my LR308 – It's beautiful. So, I bought this trigger for my S&W M&P .22, but turns out it is not designed for .22s. I sent it back to Rise Armament (great customer service). They double-checked it and fine-tuned it – and also told me they don't recommend it for the S&W M&P .22. Since I don't have another AR that needs a trigger, I decided to sell this RA-140. You could buy a new trigger, or you could buy this one that has been factory tuned by Rise Armamnent. You will get a trigger with less than 50 -.22 rounds fired; that has been back to the factory for fine-tuning; that I tested at ~3.25 lbs.The RA-140 fits AR-15 and AR-10. It will work as designed with center-fire calibers. The one in my LR308 is spectactular. My friend bought two – one for his .556 and one for his .300 Blackout. Free shipping in the USA."
