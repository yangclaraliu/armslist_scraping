My girlfriend took it to the range once and I shot one mag through it a week later. It worked flawlessly and has a surprisingly good trigger. Very low recoil shooting 22wmr rounds but quite loud and powerful. Fiber optic sights make sure you dont lose your sight picture.

This rifle as shown in the picture is one of only 2,000 original select fire rifles ordered by Luxembourg (of the 6,000+) total.  Upon importation into the country the mechanics of select fire were ground off to be made legal for US laws.  These are looked upon as more collectible by most.  The two dimples on the trigger guard reflect the select fire switch removed.
This rifle functions and the bore is shiny.
The rifle has a few imperfections that I will list below.
-The stock has been slightly sanded, but the cartouche and serial number still remain clearly.-The magazine has a small dent in the charging side.-The underside of the stock near the muzzle has a hole the size of a sling swivel nut. I believe possibly someone had a bipod on the rifle at some point?
 This rifle is extremely rare and deserves a place in your collection.  Again, only 6,000 of this contract were made in the desirable 30-06 Springfield Caliber.
 Additional pictures upon serious request only.  Can meet anywhere in local 5 SE Counties or Will ship to FFL 01 or FFL 03 upon payment. *Item is cross posted.
 Thanks for looking."

Wow, so much better then its predecessor. Only reason I'm contemplating parting with it, is a recent purchase of a SIG, who has earned the EDC spot. I have fed it 100ISH rounds (original owner 250-300) and it ate everything up. Ruger did alright with this one, so it will come with everything you'd get new and it has a Hogue grip on it (helps fill out the hand). Also I went ahead and polished the feed ramp, no reason, it's just something I do to all my beauts. Lmk if your interested but to be clear, $250 is firm, FIRM.

Meet in VA BEACH And have proper ID for legal transaction. Ruger LCR .38. Comes with factory soft case and I’ll throw in the 5 rounds of critical defense ammo I keep it loaded with. Good condition. Operates perfectly. Front blade sight has been painted bright orange. Super light weight; 13oz if I recall correctly. DAO and very accurate due to the ruger trigger. Round count is unknown as I took it on trade. I personally put 50-75 rounds through it and it fires perfect. I like this gun but I went a little overboard and picked up 4 new revolvers in one month and don’t need that many similar guns. Taurus 651 titanium (5 round .357 magnum with low profile hammer) in like new shape with very low round count and an owb fobus paddle holster). Bought this one new around 12 years ago. Never carried. Like new condition. Original box. Less than 100 rounds through it. This model weighs around 17oz compared to the regular 651 which was about 25oz."

I have also installed a Hogue AK pistol grip and a Tapco G2 double hook trigger. I have fired approximately 500 rounds through the rifle and I have had never had any misfeeds, misfires, or failure to extract. The rifle has run flawlessly and is an awesome rifle. I also have the original 5 round chinese magazine and the original metal bipod that came with the gun that I will include, as well as, one 30 round magazine. I don't know how many rounds were fired through the rifle before I purchased it but the bore is clean and the rifling is sharp. I have kept the rifle clean and stored properly since I have owned it. There are normal signs of wear but the rifle has no rust damage or significant damages to the finish of the receiver or barrel. This rifle is in GREAT shape and I hope someone can enjoy it as a rifle that you can shoot A LOT.

The etched reticle requires no illumination, but a CR2032 battery illuminates the center through 5 red brightness settings and 5 green brightness settings. The scope is extremely durable, designed to handle heavy recoil and extreme weather conditions, with a 3-year warranty. A 1913 Picatinny mount is included, but this versatile optic is also able to accept ACOG, quick detach (QD), and standard bases for AR15 and AK 47 platforms. The standard mount can be removed for use on AR15/M16 carry handles in conjunction with our carry handle screw, product code 92581A320. An optional kill flash (product code PA5XKF) is also available for purchase. PA5XKF is a proprietary kill flash that fits the larger objective lens on PAC5X. Please note that PAM4KF will not fit! NOTE: To remove the allen screws holding the base to the body, we recommend applying some heat directly to the screws in order to soften the factory thread locking compound. Several seconds with a lighter does the trick and the allen screws will come out much more easily.  Local, face to face."
