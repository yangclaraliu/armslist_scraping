The open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping allows for one cartridge at a time. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table or door. The Beretta exclusive Bruniton non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear-resistant finish.

Polaris is not pretty but is a brute. Needs a brake handle and possibly rear pads. I’m having trouble keeping it running now. Not sure if it needs a tune up or if the gas is bad. Don’t have the time to deal with it and it’s to damn cold to work on it with no garage. Make an offer. Worst I can say is no.
Located in Randolph, Vt . And no before you ask I have no way of bringing it to you. Pick up only!!!"

I'm not the first owner, i've had this about a year and it handles the .45acp like a dream, may be due to it's rotating barrel system like the px4, (as opposed to the tilting barrels common today). It's kind of like the px4's uncle. The frame is alloy, all steel slide, barrel, and guide rod. Minimal wear. The barrel was polished until it was a chrome colored stainless steel by the last owner. The sights were black so I filled them in with some birchwood casey sight paint. It'll come with 2x 8round magazines and some ammo (federal HST's)I love this thing, especially since it's my first .45acp I just have a bug to see what's out there. Mostly interested in lightweight da/sa .38 special revolvers but i'll consider other trades. Only .45 acps i'll consider though are 1911's or something with doublestacked mags."
