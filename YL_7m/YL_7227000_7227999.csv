The eye relief is set and the scope was attatched on the rifle useing a precision engineering steel bubble level. The scoped does need to be rezeroed.I atleast spent a little over two hours getting the scope to be as perfectly horizontal with the rifle as possible. The rings put tension across the rail as well as tension pushing the entire set up back into the rail giving the optic set up a more firm lock on the rail vs the standard nut and bolt ring set up. The screws on the rail as well as the rings have been succured with lock tight.What i had in mind when putting this rifle togeather was to get a good base rife and to have the best accessories i could possibly put on the rife to get optimal performanceout of a beginners long range set up.The rifle is capable of punching out a one inch circle at 100 yards like the picture shows in the gallary. That was a four shot group at 100 yards useing reloaded ammunition. The rife has only had about 200 rounds shot out of it, so i would go as far as to say that the rifle is pretty much new.The only reason i'm selling this rifle is cause as a 22 year guy i just don't have the time or the motivation to learn how to use it when there is so much going on at this point in my life.In total i put about 1650 dollars into this build, not including the case. You can add the parts listed above for conformation if you so choose.I will only except cash or a cashiers cheack."

When run as a stand alone, the platform is low profile enough to be worn fully loaded and not print on a normal/loose fit jacket or sweatshirt. When run on a armor platform with a quick release system, such as SwiftClips™, it can be attached or stowed in seconds, giving the end user the versatility to transition from low vis to high vis or vice versa. The rifle magazine pouches accept AR type magazines as well as AK 7.62 x39mm and 5.45 x 39 magazines. The Multi-Mission Pouches accept 1911, Glock, Sig, M&P, XD and other standard double or single stack pistol magazines, as well as many handheld lights and multi-tools. The rig intentionally does not include a radio or dedicated full size medical pouch so no matter the posture, essentials such as communications and medical kits can remain on the end user at all times.Used a a few times and sat in storage once I bought a plate carrier. Still has all shock chord and Hypalon tabs. Can carry a sidearm in a G-Code INCOG holster as pictured above.

Optic not included. The rifle is extremely accurate, and if you want to reach out and touch something, this is the gun. This rifle can chuck lead over a mile and a half.  Less than 100 rounds through it. The only reason I am selling is to turn some of my firearms into a car, this rifle is seriously amazing, and I am sad to list it. When finances are better I probably will buy another one. .338 Lapua Magnum is a powerful, flat shooting round. Zero a scope at 100 yards and it will stay accurate out to around 600 yards. Read all the specs here at the Savage Website. MSRP is $1400.  If you reload, I can add 50 rounds of 1-2 Times fired Lapua Brass as well as RCBS Dies for an extra 100. Bought the brass once fired and Lapua is the highest quality found. A reloader can get around 15 if not more shots out of one Lapua Brass. Optics can be discussed as well."

Background: The Beretta-created Stoeger 8000 Cougar semi-auto pistols inherit the reputation of the original Beretta 8000 as reliable, durable and powerful. First designed primarily for tactical undercover work, the Cougar is now carried by a growing number of police officers as their official duty sidearm thanks to its ergonomics, low recoil and inherent accuracy.  The goal was to be a smaller, more compact and concealable pistol for undercover and security work. The LAPD issued a variant of the Cougar with a 4"" barrel for a time.
Beretta bought Stoeger for their skilled manufacturing employees and then shipped the original Beretta Cougar machines to Stoeger to continue making the famous Beretta Cougar pistol (which made room to make the PX4 model pistol).
In its new incarnation, Beretta developed an ergonomically-advanced pistol that is compact but capable of handling high-power cartridges, offering high magazine capacity and giving a long service life. This has been possible also thanks to the innovative adaptation of a locked-breech system with a rotating barrel. Today, the Stoeger 8000 Cougar pistol is manufactured by the Stoeger Silah Sanayi A.S., strictly in line with the most traditional Beretta quality control and attention to detail.    LOW RECOIL
Upon firing this pistol, shooters are amazed by the low felt recoil. This is due to two factors working together. The first is the rotating barrel system, which dissipates recoil radially rather than directing it into the shooter’s hand. The second is the central block, which absorbs the mechanical recoil from the barrel and the slide before this is transferred to the frame. When the Cougar is in battery, the positive lock-up of barrel to slide assures perfect alignment of barrel and sights. Upon firing, the barrel travels and rotates with axial movement. Besides low recoil, the result is superior accuracy and quicker recovery for follow-up shots.
ADVANCED ERGONOMICS FOR EASY HANDLING, CONTROL, CONCEALMENT
The Cougar is one of the most ergonomically advanced pistols in its class. The user-friendly, contoured frame and grips make the Cougar exceptionally easy to control during firing. By taking hand anatomy and instinctive hold into account, the Cougar accommodates smaller hands and also protects larger hands from being bitten by the slide. All edges are rounded or beveled, and are carefully finished to make the Cougar virtually snag-proof and exceptionally easy to draw and conceal.MORE FEATURES
Rotating barrel action: the barrel stays put while the slide travels backward, rotating approximately 30 degrees by means of a cam pin and tracked milled onto the barrel and frame that unlocks the barrel from the breech once a safe chamber pressure is reached. This enhances accuracy as the barrel stays pointed on target and does not travel to the rear and then slightly tip up at the muzzle as in many other designs.
All metal lower frame: In stark contrast to the polymers used by most other semi-auto handguns being sold today. No plastic guns here. Visible External Hammer – a real hammer like a real gun!Double action and single action.
Safeties: Safety and de-cocker are combined into a convenient single lever.  It is also AMBIDEXTROUS for right and left handed shooters.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding return-to-zero when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The SLiM Rail features the battle-proven Bolt-Up System which provides modern flat-top upper receivers with a free-floating, continuous, uninterrupted upper rail platform and allows for simplified alignment to the host weapon upper receiver. The long, 15 rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, preventing over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. When mounting a front sight to the top rail, it allows the shooter to have an extended sight radius enabling more precise shot placement. Ambidextrous sling swivel attachment points are integrated into both the left and right side rails at 1 and 11 o’clock. The SLiM Rail can be used with a low-profile gas block on pistol, carbine, mid, or rifle-length gas systems. Made in the USA Features: – Light Weight Free Floating Barrel Design– Steel Barrel Nut– Uninterrupted Mil-Spec 1913 Picatinny Upper Rail– KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, & 9 o’clock positions– Ambidextrous Sling Swivel Attachment Points at 1 and 11 o’clock– Patented Bolt-Up Mounting System– Aircraft Grade 6061-T6 Aluminum– Mil-Spec type III Hard Coat Anodized Finish– Grade 8 Military Specification Fasteners Specifications: – Length: 15.20″– Width: 1.74″– Height: 2.09″– Inside Diameter: 1.08″– Weight: 11.2 oz.– Barrel Nut: Steel (For Patented Bolt-Up System)– Gas System Length: Rifle– Free Float: Yes– Continuous Upper Rail: Yes– Integrated Sling Swivel Attachment Point: Yes   INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS Bolt-Up System Barrel Nut Wrench (Supplied) Allen Wrench (Supplied) All Daniel Defense products carry a 100% satisfaction guarantee against defects in original materials and workmanship.

Precision ground from VG-10 stainless steel, the Roc’s blunt-tipped, PlainEdge™ blade features a low-profile matte gray finish and a saber grind that balances high-performance edge geometry with the strength and heft of a full-thickness spine. A long section of jimping (textured grooves) on the blade’s spine provides a solid purchase for the user’s thumb, and an easily accessible Trademark Round Hole™ ensures swift, positive one-handed opening with either hand. The Roc’s handle combines full skeletonized stainless steel liners with textured G-10 scales and an open-backed construction that reduces weight and simplifies cleaning and maintenance. Its thick liners also form the foundation of the knife’s sturdy LinerLock mechanism, which includes a Bob Terzuola-inspired concave lock ramp on the blade’s tang. To ensure convenient carry and immediate access, the Roc features a reversible deep-pocket wire clip attached to the butt end of the handle to offer left or right-side tip-up carry"
