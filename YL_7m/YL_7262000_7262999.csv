I got it in on trade thinking that I was going to put it in a pelican case as a dedicated travel kit. While this is one of the best shooting bows I've ever had the pleasure to shoot and own, that said I prefer a slightly lower wrist angle. The draw is marked at 55lbs at 28"". I draw 29.5"" and don't perceive stacking. Condition is 10/10 mechanically and 9.5/10 cosmetically. There are a couple of tiny freckles on the back of the bottom limb that are highlighted in the photos. Also the area underneath the arrow keeper, which I took off but still have and will ship with the bow, doesn't have as much patina as the rest but it will catch up with rest over time. It came with a Velcro shelf covering which I replaced with genuine seal skin (MUCH smoother on the draw and more durable). It comes with two strings for $675.New, this bow would run the following plus wait time:825 - Base stickfinger100 - osage riser upgrade125 - grip checkering115.50 - federal excise tax1165 total (plus the cost of sealskin at unknown value, probably about $10-20)Specs are:Osage riser with cocobolo accent, checkered grip, sealskin rest, two strings with wool puff silencers, and brown glass limbs. 60"" bow with 55lb draw at 28"".In the link below are detailed photos. If you click the little ""i"" in the top right it will pull up descriptions of the photos which labels the top/bottom and belly/backs of limbs to help you get oriented and has some additional details where applicable.I have a matching limb bolt quivers too if you want. It is a brown Kanati (no longer in business) that looks great with it for an additional $75 (originally ~$125). Kanati is no longer in business, and the rich brown leather on it looks absolutely perfect with the cocobolo accent piece and brown limbs in the riser. The center of the hood is a dark reddish brown and the sides are more of a dark brown. There is very little contrast between the two but it looks absolutely stellar with the reddish brown cocobolo accent wood and brown glass limbs. I've shot well over 400 bows and owned probably 200-300 bows and this particular one is among my favorite 5 I've ever shot. I may regret selling it later on but it's not getting the attention it deserves and my wife and I are cleaning out and downsizing. I'm going back to just one bow for a while. Brian typically marks build date on the limb attachment points of the riser. This bow doesn't have that info as it wasn't originally intended to be sold because it was his personal bow. He sold it to one of his friends who needed a lighter bow post surgery for an elk hunt. I came into the bow on trade.https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipM3lgXk6VU9TJ_2dCTGqFboHzk-YCdAoSNFy75dZfLkUEl5MC04rqwtcGNwtc-DdQ?key=WjhoVE4yQ2FVUDF0SExRRlVzSWFBOFRaNEt5VWx3If the add is still listed, the bow is for sell.
