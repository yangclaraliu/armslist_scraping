Its serial # 3614XX dates it to 1914.
It has a 5-inch barrel with a blade front sight and notched rear, six-shot double or single action design and a blue finish. I’m pretty sure the handgun has been re-blued but all the stampings are clear and crisp. It is fitted with oversize, combat design, Mustang grips made of Exotic African Zebra wood stamped “The Original Mustang #2 and OCDZ” (I believe).
This model was produced from 1908-1927 and this one was made in 1914, by serial number search. There is something engraved on the frame under the right grip, three letters and three numbers. 
Used, good condition, some pitting on the exposed rear frame and trigger guard. 
Mustang Grips (stamped OCDZ?) should fit Colt Officers Model Match, Python, Trooper, Official Police and Army Special. Exotic African Zebrawood, combat design. Lacquer finish."

The free-floating barrel is cold-hammer forged, providing consistent accuracy when launching .50 caliber BMG (12.7x99mm) rounds at an effective range of up to nearly 1,650 yards (1,500 meters). A 33” (838mm) barrel version is available in the single-shot Standard as well as an M1 configuration that includes a 5-round detachable magazine and a 24” (610mm) barrel option. An important feature of the HS .50 is the ability to quickly assemble and disassemble the weapon platform. This allows for very rapid deployment as well as breakdown. The barrel-mounted scope also increases the speed of assembly, ensures accuracy between uses and also allows for quick conversion of specialty optics for a wide range of applications. The chassis of the rifle includes a pistol grip, a newly designed bipod, and a stock that features a screw-adjustable monopod in the butt of the stock with an adjustable spike. The recoil pad can be adjusted vertically as well as for length of pull and an adjustable cheek piece allows for ideal cheek-weld.UPC: 688218715857"

The free-floating barrel is cold-hammer forged, providing consistent accuracy when launching .50 caliber BMG (12.7x99mm) rounds at an effective range of up to nearly 1,650 yards (1,500 meters). A 33” (838mm) barrel version is available in the single-shot Standard as well as an M1 configuration that includes a 5-round detachable magazine and a 24” (610mm) barrel option. An important feature of the HS .50 is the ability to quickly assemble and disassemble the weapon platform. This allows for very rapid deployment as well as breakdown. The barrel-mounted scope also increases the speed of assembly, ensures accuracy between uses and also allows for quick conversion of specialty optics for a wide range of applications. The chassis of the rifle includes a pistol grip, a newly designed bipod, and a stock that features a screw-adjustable monopod in the butt of the stock with an adjustable spike. The recoil pad can be adjusted vertically as well as for length of pull and an adjustable cheek piece allows for ideal cheek-weld. UPC: 688218525098"

In any event, it is mechanically sound,but it has a working gun's cosmetics...some finish wear here and there (AKA ruggedly handsome).  It has been electro-pencil etched on the left reciever and near the trigger guard area with departmental numbers.

This is the second of my two 9mm, the first one being the one I used out in competition. This was the safe queen. This pistol has 6 magazines through it, both the 10 round and 8 round magazines. So, let's just say it's been fired 60 rounds from me. It does look brand new. If I wasn't honest, I'd say it was brand new, and you wouldn't even be able to tell the difference, that's how clean this gun is. I will include the pistol, all original documents and case, and THREE 10-ROUND mags. Please text me (28l) 773-82 SlX Nlne"

This case is close in size to some of the other Pelican cases, you can get a complete specifications list of all of Pelican's measurements wheels, colors etc.I was shocked when I saw the prices@ Pelican's web site, E-bay was not much better so I recommend you check them out.I figured the person that purchases mine will be ""Military or ex-Military"" or a weapon lover. I purchased this set buy really wanted the foam with the solid sheets so I can burn out my pattern."

Bore: bright/shiny crisp rifling
Outstanding condition
Years back I was lucky enough to find 3 Mosins in excellent condition with perfect bores. I took one of them and built the weapon you see here. As I handload, I was able to design a round for this weapon that grouped consistent 1.25” at 250 yrds, 2.5” groups at 300 yrds. With the right load it will drive tacks out to 150 yrds. With off the shelf ammo, it prefers PPU 150gr BTSP that grouped consistent 3” out to 150 yrds, 6” at 250 yrds. Simply put, it’s a great shooter. I’m now looking to expand my weapon collection and need to make a little room, and seeing I have three Mosins, I’m going to let this one go.
I live in Green Bay, WI, will NOT ship this weapon, but am willing to meet anyone in Wisconsin committed to purchasing this weapon half way. Any and all questions please get hold of me and I will be glad to let you know anything you need."

Based on recent internet sales: Estimated retail value, in “near new”, very collectible condition = ($2,000. to $2,450.) The sale price includes Hornady reloading dies and Redding 7.62 X 39 Russian case resizing dies (neck down to 6mm). In 1987, Kimber of Oregon announced a new edition to their line of rifles, the Model 84 Ultra Varmint, and offered the rifle in a small group of calibers: .222 REM, 6MM PPC, 6X45MM, and .223 REM. In 1988 and 1989, the dealer price lists offered the Ultra Varmint in a different group of calibers: .17 REM, .221 REM and .223 REM. In 1990, Kimber listed only the .222 REM and .223 REM calibers for the Ultra Varmint rifles. In 1991, the year that Kimber closed their doors due to bankruptcy, Kimber listed the Ultra Varmint calibers as .17 REM, .22 Hornet, .222 REM, .22-250 REM, and .223 REM. The 6MM PPC was listed as a factory offered caliber in the Ultra Varmint only for the introductory year, 1987......and it NEVER WAS listed as an available caliber for the Ultra Varmint rifles after that year. How many 6MM PPCs exist? We do not know. We do know that Kimber built a very few Ultra Varmint rifles chambered in the wonderfully accurate 6MM PPC. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE RIFLES!! The Ultra Varmint was (and is) a varmint style of rifle designed to tolerate inhospitable field conditions while delivering consistent accuracy. Starting with a laminated birch stock with a straight comb and no cheekpiece, Kimber added 20 lines-per-inch checkering, a curved rubber butt pad, a widened forearm designed to provide stability, a “medium-heavy” stainless steel 24 inch varmint weight barrel, a matte blue receiver and trigger guard, a three dimensional steel grip cap in matte blue finish, and two post-style sling swivel studs. This Kimber Ultra Varmiter is a single shot 6MM PPC wearing serial number “6PPC468”, with the Heavy Barrel with its bead blasted matte finish and its 0.6875 inch muzzle. This rifle has the Kimber disc safety and the Model 84 standard bolt, with its Mauser-style extractor and matte blue handle and shroud. A correct one piece, matte blue finish, factory provided and installed Kimber scope ring mounting base (no scope rings included) is on the top of the receiver waiting for your choice of scopes and mounting rings. Weight: ~7 pounds 12 ounces. OAL: ~42.5 inches. LOP: ~13 5/8 inches. This rifle is in “as new” condition. Kimber Ultra Varmint rifles do not come to the market often, and almost never are they seen in this “as new” condition. Ultra Varmint examples in the 6MM PPC chambering are very rare. SN “6PPC468” I only shot the M84 to check that it's functions were ok and did not shoot at targets and have just stored it in my collection or rare rifles. I believe that the heavy stainless steel barrel is free-floated in the rigid Birch laminated stock. (the stock's wood has a dark stain and does not look like Birch). So, driving nails, (with custom loads), at 100 yards, should be no problem."
