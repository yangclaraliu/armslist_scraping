It's been an awesome shotgun that would certainly be perfect for anyone looking to buy their son or daughter their first bird gun, or someone who simply enjoys shooting a .410.Though nothing significant, the gun does have some cosmetic scratches on the wood and barrel from using it over the past three years. It was oiled and taken care of the entire time I had it, and the aforementioned scratches certainly don't impact the quality/reliability of operating it. I can promise you, she's still smooth as butter.In addition to the gun itself, this listing comes with a gun sleeve for protection as well. If you're interested, please text me at REDACTED. I'll be happy to send you any pictures or details that are requested!Thanks!"

My intentions were to clean it up and use it as my bedside home defense weapon, but when I bought it I didn't realize it was chambered for 3""-3-1/2"" shells, and there aren't many aftermarket stock options, much less a possibility for a tactical set up. I have cleaned every square millimeter of this gun, reblued the metal, painted the stock(in which I am VERY proud of for a rattlecan job lol), and brought it back to life. Again, It was never my intention to 'flip' this gun per say, but I have put a lot of time into it so I'm asking $50 more than what I paid. Cash price is $350 firm, and I will entertain just about any trade offer you send me. Thank you for your time."

The ELF Drop-In AR-10 Trigger has been built to withstand the punishment of high powered calibers. The only AR-15 trigger using aircraft needle bearings, making for an incredibly smooth and fast trigger pull.  The heavy hammer combined with our exclusive .043 double double wound polished piano wire hammer spring ensure full ignition of any ammo including .308 and 7.62×39. Pull weight from 2 3/4lbs to 4lbs is so easy to adjust it can be done in seconds without removing the trigger from your lower receiver. The AR-10 trigger is essentially the service trigger with a lighter pull weight range. A second-to-none AR-15 drop-in trigger system that is strong and light,  made of wire EDM machined, hardened A2 tool steel and lightweight aircraft-grade aluminum. Installation can be done in minutes using your AR’s original hammer and trigger pins. The AR-10 trigger may be ordered with a curved or straight shoe.  The amazingly short takeup, glass-rod crisp break and next to zero over-travel can be compared to the finest custom 1911 triggers. Adjustability puts you in charge based on your preference. If you are looking for the finest adjustable trigger for your service AR-15 platform, this is the trigger system for you.

Well it’s not, It has trouble with ejection and shells in the feed tube are held in by the feed ramp and not by a stop that maybe bent? I don’t know,you can still pump shells from the feed tube into the chamber but once fired, ejection is a “no go”. The shell will be pulled out from the chamber but not “fling” outside the port. Have to tilt the gun to make it fall out. I took it apart and cleaned it with no success. Oh well. So selling as is. We went through an FFL too so I gotta get it out from under my name. I will split the cost of the transfer with you. I know 2 FFL’s that charge only 20 bucks. So 10 bucks each. 70 cash, for the shotgun.My work schedule limits my availability for tranfers to mornings only during the week."

With only 32,000 produced (compared to 250,000 Parkers!), any high condition Model 21 is a valuable, investment quality firearm sure to appreciate as you enjoy its use. From 1930 to 1980, they only made about 2900 twenty-gauge guns in all grades. Model 21's are fully capable of shooting the most powerful loads available, SO IF YOU LIKE MAGNUM LOADS FOR PHEASANTS, DUCKS, OR OTHER TOUGH GAME, THIS IS YOUR GUN. Most every M21 20ga. you find will weigh between 6 ¾ to 7 1/4lbs. and feel like a heavy target gun, and they do well in that role. I purposely search out the rare lightweight guns that feel lively in hand and will not drag you down as you traverse hill and dale all day long after upland game with fine dogs and friends. This pre-war, original, untouched factory gun, sn14133 made in 1941, is a nice, light 6lbs. 6oz., shipped as a Skeet Grade gun with 26” barrels and WS1/WS2 chokes. The gun has been well maintained and retains 97% barrel blue and 93% receiver blue (just some light scratches on the trigger plate), barrels tight on hinge and breech face like a new gun, perfect screws, strong well-timed ejectors, crisp and proper functioning single selective trigger, no cracks or repairs, some handling marks on buttstock. It is a nice find to have a M21 with the original checkered butt and nobody has added a pad! Examine the factory letter shown with the photos and you will note the gun was returned to Winchester in 1950 missing the barrel assembly and was provided with new barrels and assumably new forend wood with the new diamond checkering pattern at that time. This fine Winchester Model will make you a fine upland and sporting clays/skeet gun for decades to come. Priced to sell and in great factory original condition.
