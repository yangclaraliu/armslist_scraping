But do you own research.These are known to be accurate and reliable.The rifle looks like it's in awesome shape... The bad part is... The previous owner was a jackass and broke/cracked the stock he just sawed it off behind the hand grip.  Apparently with the intention to repair it... I know... I know... I thought the same thing... How about just using wood glue instead of chopping anything up?But he chopped it and never fixed it.So it will need a new stock or you can just shoot it without cheek weld. (It's a 22. There's no recoil)I intended to fix it up and give my 11 year old something to practice with but then I won a ruger 10-22 at an NRA auction.  Needless to say he uses that and I haven't gotten another stock either.I did look into stocks for it though. There are a LOT of options.  You can get a used one online almost anywhere for $20. You can spend $30-$40 and get a tactical looking one with an adjustable stock. And they even make target/precision stocks for these. They are more pricey though.Any stock that would fit a Marlin model 60 or 90 that is tube-fed will fit with no modifications.I have never fired it.I took it apart to inspect, clean, lube it. And it all looks great (I don't think this rifle was fired very much).I just don't need it.  Maybe someone could find an original stock from Western Auto Supply and have a nice little piece of history.  I'm setting the price at $100 and that's negotiable.So $100 OBO.I don't like selling things so I'll probably sell to the first person who shows up with a realistic offer.I prefer texts or emails.52 O,  2 72 , O2 20"

Chambered for the .22 LR the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art-precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded, and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic laminated, or white grips, makes this Rough Rider both functional and handsome. Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting. Let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. PROUDLY MADE IN OUR USA. All Heritage revolvers combine quality and affordability ... an American tradition. This has consistantly been one of the top selling handguns in the United States for the last 2 decades. They look great, they work great and they are at a great price. This is the perfect glove box or field carry revolver and just tons of fun to shoot.   It's affordable to own and inexpensive to shoot.

The Sabot Designs LLC 25 round box of 12 gauge flechette sabot ammunition is packed with a patented sabot holding 19 new spin stabilized 1 inch 8 grain steel flechettes heat treated to Rockwell C 45/55 with a muzzle velocity of 1925 feet per second, with all flechettes pointing forward for optimum penetration. Our spin stabilized flechettes have superior grouping and accuracy at all ranges with reduced yawing and increased point impacts on target.

This flechette sabot ammo is long range, bore safe, and high performance - it has been in production since 1998 and exceeds the performance of any other ammunition of this type. It is used for hog and turkey hunting, predator control, anti-piracy, military security and home defense.

I have the 12 round mag, with pinky extension (as shown in the holster), as well as the 17 round mag for back-up/night stand duty. What they say about the triggers on these is true. Kind of like Glock meets 1911. One of my most accurate handguns. Eats all ammo. May or may not include the DeSantis IWB holster as I just bought it, and it fits another gun I own. Box, papers, etc it came with. See below for trades. MUST meet in Winter Park, and you MUST be legal to own/buy a firearm in Florida."

This rifle has excellent rifling inside it's barrel and is in very good mechanical condition. It shoots very straight and is 30/06 in caliber. The wooden stock is in good condition with no wood missing. The wood stock carries a very used look and represents itself as you would expect from a former WWII battlefield firearm. The metal is all rust free and has no issues on it's parkerized finish. This weapon is extremely collectable, especially being a 1943 Springfield. The numbers do not match throughout the rifle and to find one that does is more then a rare occurrence as they all were assembled of parts from millions of guns off the assembly line after WWII and the Korean war. This weapon has obviously seen battle and been a part of WWII, Korea and possibly the beginning of Vietnam. I have fired this rifle and can assure you it fires very well, and hits the target. It ejects fine and never jams. The firing pin hits the primer dead center and in the same location every single time. It has the original rifle sling as well. Bayonet does come with the rifle and I am positive it's a US Military bayonet but I am not positive it's the original bayonet that was issued with this rifle. Although it is the bayonet and sheath I received when I took possession of the weapon. Rifle comes with 3 ammo clips as well. Buy with confidence and I will consider any firearm trades as well. As for trades I will look at anything as for rifles and pistols but I prefer tactical weapons. I may even consider a four wheeler if it's reliable and looks nice."
