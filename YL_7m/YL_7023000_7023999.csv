(Now traditions)  It was built by my father in 1980. It has never been fired.  However, it could fire. Everything was done properly. Barrel was heat treated etc. This rifle was used since day one as a wall hanger for decoration in his office.  Only taken down to wipe down every once in a while.  Never seen direct sunlight.  It has never been fired. But I took it to a gunsmith and had him look it over. He said it's ready to fire and should do just fine.  It is a 45cal black powder muzzleloader. It has the octagon barrel.

Well, now if you have it for far less, if you have any halfway decent lower receiver lying around (or plan to). I have for sale a complete direct gas upper from LWRC, chambered in 5.56 NATO, lightly used and well cared for. Just drop it on and you're good to go. This one has a 16"" cold hammer forged heavy barrel, coated with LWRC's proprietary NiCorr treatment, and spiral-fluted for strength and lightness. (This also looks really good, and makes you feel like the coolest dude on the firing line. ) It's got a 1:7 twist to stabilize just about anything, and it's free floated away from the handguard for eliminate barrel harmonics. All this accuracy stuff they did really works, too. This upper has shot (""theoretically can shoot"", but HAS shot), consistent 1/2 MOA groups at 100 meters, and some 2 MOA groups at 600 meters, this last not with match grade ammo, not even with heavy stuff, but 55 grain cheap PMC ammo. That means 2 MOA even after the round goes transsonic. Tough to beat that. The bolt carrier group has LWRC's proprietary nickel treatment. This is good stuff... it loses its silvery shine quite soon, but it stays really smooth and slippery, and just runs with whatever you throw at it. Here's a list of every malfunction I have ever had with this upper: { } Basically, this is half of the best rifle I have ever owned. So why sell it? Because I bought the same thing in a gas piston version, which is much easier to clean. Frankly, this thing will run super dirty, and lubed with nothing but the tears of liberal politicians, but I like clean rifles, and so I've made the switch, and I'm selling off everything DI that I own. For non-locals, I can ship this right to your doorstep if you pay shipping (because legally, it's the lower that is the actual firearm). I'll include the original recoil spring and buffer, so you can be sure the timing will work right. Open to interesting trade offers, but no junk, please.If you are reading this ad, it's still available... for now."

If you do some research you'll find that these rifles were made by Maadi using Russian tooling by Egyptian workers trained by Russians. So the Maadi is the closet thing there is to a real Russian military AK. This particular rifle is the post ban model with the laminated thumb hole stock that has a dark brown color. I bought this in 1998 stuck it in a safe, forgot about it and never used it. So it's literally New and Unfired although stored for the last 19 years. I split open the plastic bag the rifle was packaged in from the factory for pictures but have never actually removed it from the box. It comes with a factory 5 round magazine, sling, instruction manual and certificate of authenticity. Also the guy who sold it to me in 1998 had a couple of nice used 30 round Egyptian mags and a few boxes of real Egyptian 7.62x39 AK ammo so I bought one of each and they are included with the rifle. Today these Maadi rifles and the Poly Tech Legends are the two finest AK style rifles ever imported into the USA. Price is $900 picked up in the Brandon area by a Florida resident who is at least 18 years old. I'm not set up to ship firearms and will not do so. Also I'm looking for a  sale only and not trades. Thanks for looking."

Having escaped Wheedon conversion, the gun retains its original volley sights-with the front sight being unmarred and the very rare rear volley sight in place. Broad Arrow marked on the buttstock, there is also what may be a Second World War homeguard cartouche. No rust or deep pitting are present and all markings are correct, legible and matching. The furniture shows clear markings, a unit disk and cartouche on the buttstock. Mechanically, the rifle appears flawless and the bore is very good having strong, sharp rifling beneath residue and lint. Would Ship!"

It would make a perfect duty pistol, or a protective house gun.Here is a little history on the P9RK pistol:The FEG P9RK is the short-barrel version of the P9R pistol. Both guns are made in Hungary by the FEGARMY Arms factory. The P9RK uses the modified P9 frame and action, with a Smith & Wesson double-action trigger system. The P9RK is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. The barrel is operated using a Browning cam system, and is locked to the slide by three locking lugs on the top of the barrel, which fit into mated recesses on the inside of the slide, just ahead of the ejection port. Frame and slide are made from carbon steel and have a blued finish. The Double Action trigger system with external hammer has a slide-mounted safety lever, which also works as a de-cocker when safety is engaged. The front sight is permanently fixed to the slide, while rear sight is dovetailed. Just contact me if you have any questions."

These have a full-length double zipper that allows one to access the whole bag. For anyone who has used an Army duffel, there are times where what you need is at the bottom of the duffel, and essentially one has to dump the whole duffel to be able to get at it. These duffels don't have that problem, you can unzip the bag to see what is in it from top to bottom. However, the hasp where you can put a lock to prevent others from getting into the bag is retained and the zips can be situated so that they are under the hasp when closed. Also, these duffels have backpack straps, just like the old ones, so that the bag can be carried on the back. There are also handles on both ends for pulling the bag in and out of storage and a handle on the top for carrying with one hand. On one side of the bag there is a clear document holder that can be used to slip in either the name of the owner, or perhaps the contents of the bag. Essentially one can put whatever one wants in the document holder, presumably to idenfity the owner or contents of the bag.   This bag is new, but may show some storage marks from being in a tote. It originated with the US government, and is the same bag that they sell at AAFES clothing and sales for $40. I have more pictures if needed.  Can ship for $5."

The Trilux SUIT is a 4X, fixed-focus scope. Normal used prices range from $300 - $ 450.The sight has a lever to change between  short range (300 meters) and a long range (500 meters). It has a prismatic offset and a unique inverted (upside down) tapered sight post, ending in a point.  The prismatic offset keeps the scope short and improves clearance around the action. The inverted sight post allows rapid target re-acquisition after recoil lifts the barrel.  It is supposed to be illuminated with a red glow down the length of its center for low-light battle conditions.  Previously powered by a tritium insert, required to be removed by U.S. law before importation  into this country.  The sight was modified here to take a battery for power to the red glow.   Other rifle accessories include: Tapco aluminum receiver cover with Picatinny rail for normal scope mounting (that cover not mounted on rifle); Australian Military issue cleaning kit; removable raised butt stock comb piece to allow proper cheek weld with the high-mounted SUIT scope, hard case.Totally reliable battle weapon known as the ""right arm of the free world"" and adopted by some fifty countries.  Used by both sides in the Falkland War."

These have a full-length double zipper that allows one to access the whole bag. For anyone who has used an Army duffel, there are times where what you need is at the bottom of the duffel, and essentially one has to dump the whole duffel to be able to get at it. These duffels don't have that problem, you can unzip the bag to see what is in it from top to bottom. However, the hasp where you can put a lock to prevent others from getting into the bag is retained and the zips can be situated so that they are under the hasp when closed. Also, these duffels have backpack straps, just like the old ones, so that the bag can be carried on the back. There are also handles on both ends for pulling the bag in and out of storage and a handle on the top for carrying with one hand. On one side of the bag there is a clear document holder that can be used to slip in either the name of the owner, or perhaps the contents of the bag. Essentially one can put whatever one wants in the document holder, presumably to idenfity the owner or contents of the bag. Can ship for $6.50.  This bag is new, but may show some storage marks from being in a tote. It originated with the US government, and is the same bag that they sell at AAFES clothing and sales for $40. I have more pictures if needed.If you see the ad, the items are availible.  Queries such as ""Is this still availible,"" will be treated as attemps to phish my e-mail and ignored."

Approximately 30 miles to Truman Lake, Stockton Lake and Lake of the Ozarks. 35 miles to Bennett Spring State Park. Located just west of Galmey, MO, south of Hwy 254. 8 miles to Wheatland or Hermitage, 25 or so to Bolivar, Buffalo or Warsaw, 60 to Springfield. The cabin is near public land for deer and turkey hunting. The cabin overlooks a small wet weather creek and waterfall. More photos here.http://s1185.photobucket.com/user/lthobbes/library/Lake%20cabin?sort=3&page=1900 feet of primitive road, water hauled in (or set collect and filter roof water.)Property comes with used generator, propane camping stove (bring your own propane), first aid kit, ladder, 55 gallon food grade water barrel, an old barrel stove, futon bunk bed, a table, and a few other odd and ends. Very rough land covered with cedars, oak and other trees.This makeshift cabin was built by an old Navy Corpsman, he had artistic tastes which is one reason why he put so many windows in this elevated cabin. The cabin is very primitive, it's certainly not the Hilton, but it is effective shelter or a fun little retreat.When the deer in the pic was taken, the hunter had barely been in the even cabin 30 minutes before this deer came along on the trail about 50 yards away."
