It is registered with Remington. The gun is all metal except for the changeable polymer grips. The frame is aluminum and the slide is steel. Reviewers report good things about the gun, it’s accuracy and it’s reliability. It is known as the easiest to rack pocket pistol. I had some parts switched out to improve recoil, and trigger pull. Here are the changes made using Galloway Precision parts:1. recoil rod spring to reduce recoil,2. hammer and firing pin springs to reduce and smooth trigger pull,3. steel hammer spring retainer to replace original plastic one.All original parts are retained and will be included with the gun. I can reinstall them if desired but the changes make the gun better. Included items are as follows:The pistolTwo magazines, one with extended base and one with flat baseOne extended magazine base plateQuick loading device for the magazinesOriginal manualOne box of 20 of rounds Remington Ultimate Defense (hollow point bullet)Two boxes of 20 rounds Lehigh Defense Extreme Defense (hydrostatic bullet)If purchased separately the parts listed above and the ammunition included would cost $135.I am selling the gun because I am getting out of gun ownership.

All American made with milled trunion (not cast metal trunion like generation 1)The AK Operator's Union has put this model through their grueling 5000 round torture test, and it has come through unscathed and shining. Some online 3rd party reviewers are stating that this model is the Cadillac of all AK's.It is apparent that PSA has made their mark on the AK market, they had always made a great AR15.Mine functions perfectly of course, looks almost new and has a low round count.It is very accurate and shoots tight groups off the iron sights at 40 yards (where it is currently sighted)This is the Magpul edition with steel Korean magazine. It is very sharp looking, and feeling. It feels like quality in your hands.The bad: I don't like the factory trigger. It is a two stage trigger design that is pointless in my opinion, and I will change it to the Tapco G2 for $25.00 if I keep the rifle. This is a well built rifle and is underpriced."

There is a brass bead sight on the barrel and a small hole just behind it where the original white bead was.  These replacement beads are available.  The interior of the barrels are shiney with a few imperfections.  There is no visible rust on this gun.  The lock plates are silver, no case color is showing.  The lock plates have border line engraving around them and LC Smith is engraved on each.  The opening lever has light engraving on it as does the barrel bosses and the underside of the water table.  Serial number is 22791which appears on the forend and barrels also which places it before 1913.  The splinter forend has an ivory insert in a v configeration and it has a fine crack which was reparied previously and the checkering is worn.  The stock has a broken butt plate which is of a dog watching a falling duck or goose. A replacement butt plate is available.  There is a small chip missing from the heel of the stock and another chip missing from the toe.  There is a finger of walnut missing from the stock on the right side next to the trigger guard that would need to be replaced. The figuering and grain of the walnut is very nice but the checkering is worn down.  Tha action operates and locks up tight.  The safety is a 3 position one I believe.  Action needs cleaning and lubricating.This gun is in NRA Antique Firearm Condition Standard; GOOD as a collector firearm.  In perfect shape it would be worth $1,800 + or -  The Old 10 gauge Girl would be a great addition to any Elsie collection as they didn't make all that many 10 gauge guns; only 1,795 between 1886 and 1913.Get yourself a winter time project and have a piece of classic American Shotgun History."

You will like this stuff. And if you reload, my experience with the TAA brass is that it's niot as brittle as LC or WCC so will last a cou0ple loadings longer....also easier reforming into wildcats like 6 x 45 and 300 Blackout.Packed in ten round stripper clips with cardboard sleeves in green cotton bandoleers, 120 rounds to each bandoleer, seven (7) bandoleers packed in the ammo can for a total of 840 rounds. Each bandoleer includes a black safety pin for carry strap adjustment and a magazine charging tool, as packed by government ammunition plant.....packing cardboard included!The four pocket bandoleers are expandible too, with the pull of a thread. You can load your 30 round magazines, pull the string and store the magazines in the four pockets for easy access and easy carry.Nice stuff and some of the nicest you will find anywhere.The ammo can and bandoleers, stripper clips, etc. are worth an extra fifty bucks so this is an extraordinary bargain!I know, you can buy 1000 rounds in a loose pack cardboard box for just a bit more, but then there's tax, no bandoleers, no stripper clips, no cardboard protectors, no ammo can and what you get might be factory seconds, or maybe foreign? Guess it depends on if you just want cheap blasting ammo or the real deal for your bugout bag.....your choice.Got JUST ONE LAST available at the price of $310.00 cash. That is a solid price and a good deal on USGI ammo. Current prices are higher for foreign made green tip....this is genuine USGI and comes in the can with all the bandoleer components, making this a great deal.If you want to offer less, please offer to someone else - don't bother me.Thanks for looking!"

Very good cylinder scene. Back strap reads “N.M Nolan U.S.A” Nicholas Merritt Nolan was born in Ireland and immigrated to the United States just in time for the Civil War. He was originally in the 2nd Dragoons, then joined the 6th Cavalry. He was wounded twice, participated in the Gettysburg campaign along with a slew of other battles and then in 1865 became a prisoner of war. He mustered out in 1866 and quickly joined back in to the 10th Cavalry the same year. The 10th Cavalry was an all black regiment with white officers which was typical at the time. He enlisted as a 1st Lieutenant and quickly was promoted to Captain. He stayed in the 10th Cavalry in countless battles and skirmishes across Texas and the southwest, In 1883, after 16 years in the 10th Cavalry, it’s thought he had a stroke and died. He is buried in San Antonio National Cemetery in San Antonio, Texas. Along with this gun comes a binder with all of the biographical information. Captain Nolan was one tough soldier!

The P229 in DA/SA include a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The pistol is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG and also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. designed P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most."
