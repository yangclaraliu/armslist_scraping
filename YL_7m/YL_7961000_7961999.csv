Piston rifles such as this one run much much cleaner than gas tube rifles. They’ll also cycle any ammo you want to use. 200 rounds of cheap steel case ammo through a piston rifle is leaves the bolt and chamber cleaner than 20 rounds of good brass ammo through any other rifle. I’ve been shooting ARs since the mid 80’s, and nothing I’ve shot compares to this one. I’ve never had a hang up or malfunction of any type with any ammo through this rifle. This is NOT a home/custom build rifle! It’s extremely dependable! Has a factory voodoo barrel, magpul grip and hand guard, laser with pressure switch, 45 degree backup iron sights, red/green lighted reticle scope, Rogers super stock, aftermarket oversize charging handle, and single point sling. Also has rifle specific cleaning kit, double rifle padded camo case, about 14 mags, and around 2000 rounds of ammo. Really nice setup! I have well over $2000 in this setup! It’s a steal, considering the ammo and mags cost over $1000 alone!"

It comes in the extremely rare (to find in the US) Sabertooth II stock system from Matador Arms. This stock system uses standard AR buffer tubes and pistol grips, so it can be customized with whatever buttstock and grip you want. I have included on it standard AR grip and the Magpul CTR buttstock. The bolt assembly has had the mod done to it to accept mags with the bolt closed, and the bayonet lugs grounded off. The whole gun has been cerakoted to Tungsten grey (stock is still black) and come with two 20 rd and one 30 rd mags. The bolt and barrel/body have matching numbers, the trigger assembly does not because it is a brand new CNC'ed trigger asembly with new crisp springs. The sights are Williams Fire Sights, but they can't be used in this stock due to the high cheek rest with the buffer tube placement (hence the Vortex Spark II). I have the original trigger assembly as well. This also has an AR-Style quick mag realease for easier mag swaps.  I have well over $1500 in this build and it is definately one of the coolest guns you'll ever shoot! Call, text, or email Ryan at REDACTED with offers or questions. $750OBO, and the Vortex spark can be included for extra."

The B-GRF is a fast-shooting, smooth trigger ideal for 3 Gun competition and recreational shooting alike. It pulls like a single-stage, but resets like a two-stage. Two trigger springs are included so the B-GRF can be set up with a pull of either 4 lbs or 3.2 lbs. Does NOT convert semiautomatic rifles to automatic.Note: The B-GRF trigger has a very short, light pull and reset. It is not recommended for bench rest shooting or shooting small groups. It is designed for CQB-style rapid target engagement and quick follow up shots.This trigger is gently used. I enjoyed getting to know it and it works great but it is not my style. I found it too fast for me. If you like to shoot freaky fast it is great. Even if you don't like it , you will enjoy trying it. Price includes shipping to 48 states."
