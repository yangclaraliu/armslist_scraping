Thread protector was carefully removed so you can thread any kind of 24mm attachment you want. I also refinished the wood. Comes with 1 Polymer Bulgarian magazine. Low round count.These will likely no longer be imported. What’s left being sold online is probably what’s left. I’m trying to offload this to finish other projects and likely will never SBR this pistol.I also have a muzzle extenstion that threads in to give the pistol an overall length of 16” so you can add a buttstock after it has been permantly pinned and welded and a pistol brace adapter with triangle stock to go with it,  I can work into a deal. For my labor cost I can also convert this into a triangle folder with correct triangle folding rear trunnion or underfolder rear trunnion for you and pin a barrel extension until you get your stamp back.Text Only or Email only: fivefourone - 366 - sevenzero22"

Manufactured in 1980 this rifle is designed for one of the more powerful cartridges used in a lever-action rifle, .375 Winchester. Based on the Model 336C, the Model 375 was meant to be a rifle that could be used to hunt in forests and heavy brush, without being stopped by the vegetation. The action is similar to that of the Model 336C along with the same barrel length, and the stock has a pistol grip wrist. It is outfitted with a receiver sight which is sufficient for a range up to 100 yds. but shots beyond 150 yds. are not for the average hunter.More photos are available, send me a note for a link.
This rifle is in very good condition with minimal use and minor wear. The is a dent in the forearm, a spot of rust on the barrel, note that the front sight blade is not a perfect fit for the ramp, there is some evidence of wear on the front sight ramp, slight ding in the stock where it meets the butt pad but I guess most folks wouldn’t notice. Photos of all of the above are available. The bull’s eye in the stock is a replacement for the original which was missing for several years.
I will provide what ammo I have. A set of dies (not the exact ones pictured) with brass and bullets will be shipped free of charge from this guns original home. Local sales unless you’re prepared to figure out and pay for shipping. I assume shipping will be very expensive.

Have only about 500 rounds through this gun since I’ve bought it. It’s too large for me to conceal properly so I am selling to purchase a smaller handgun. Nice gun, never had an issue with it. Shoots like butter. Comes with three magazines, different grip backers for size adjustment and its case with all of the paperwork it originally came with. Would trade for a sig p938 or similar gun.. external safety and hammer fired are two of the main things I am looking for."

Manufacturing Inc. in West Jordan, Utah (USA; L.A.R. stands for names of company founders - Larisch, Augat and Robinson).  While a number of different versions were produced by L.A.R. Inc. between 1983 and 1999 (entirely in the United States) capable of firing a wide variety of different cartridges. The Mark V version was introduced much later designed to chamber the even more potent .50 AE. The L.A.R. Grizzly 50 was the most powerful semi-automatic pistol ever commercially produced, intending to compete with the IMI/Magnum Research Desert Eagle and the AMT Automag pistols. However, for various reasons manufacture of Grizzly pistols has ceased just before the turn of 21st century, and today these pistols are no longer made. However, L.A.R. Manufacturing Inc is still in business and I believe still offers advice, assistance, spare parts and service for its discontinued line of Grizzly pistols. No trades but will ship"
