The kit allows your current Glock 19 or 23 to shoot .22 LR rimfire cartridges. It installs in place of the centerfire slide and you then just load the included .22 LR magazine. You can change from centerfire to .22 LR in just a few seconds. It has adjustable sights, and the gun shoots accurately out to 25 yards, that's the longest distance I have tried it. You can also put other glock sights on it if you like. I have found it shoots the higher velocity ammo (1200 fps or more) very reliably. It will occasionally not cycle the slide with standard velocity ammo. I am thinning out some things for a future project. Asking $195.00. I work days, so I respond to inquiries later in the day. Thanks."

The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today.

I am running out of room in the safe, so I figured I'd see if there was a market for this.  I chose the OBR because the reciever/rail have 20 MOA built in.  There are certainly some other good rifles out there, but this rifle will shoot with any of them.Note - I used the Larue photo because the rifle currently has a Magpul PRS Gen 3, Silencerco muzzle brake and an expensive scope on it, and I want to avoid the inevitable emails from people asking if all that stuff is included. The rifle doese come with a Larue plastic case, 2 mags and all the typical Larue goodies. The stock and such are negotiable.From Larue's site:The LaRue OBR (Optimized Battle Rifle) was built from the ground up, using a newly designed upper-receiver platform, combined with a lower, inspired from our successful 5.56 MM lower. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet, for the optimum fit and consistency. The receiver components are designed with more material in critical areas to alleviate known issues of weakness in 7.62 platforms and to stiffen the receiver....translating into maximum accuracy.The upper-rail provides generous room for all issue weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations (suitable for 7.62 MM). The built-in 20 MOA cant provides correct ballistic orientation for all inline night vision combinations. The MIL-STD-1913 side rails are detachable, so that they can be configured for Vis / IR illuminators, etc, or left off to keep rails pristine, without the need for bulky rail covers. The bottom rails are also detachable, and can be positioned anywhere along the entire lower length, for the interface of MIL-STD-1913 equipped bipods, grips, tripod mounts, etc. These rails are offered as spare parts for field-service replacement, keeping repair cost at a minimum.Barrels:Available in 16.1"", 18"" & 20"" lengths. All gas blocks feature our unique Port Selector Technology (PST), a two-point adjustable gas selector that allows optimum function between suppressed, and unsuppressed operation at the flip of a switch. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24, with an A2-type flash hider attached (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). Internals:The Bolts and Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys. The carrier key contact areas are designed for zero gas leakage. About LaRue Firearm Accuracy: LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results."

The internal hammer of the 642 eliminates the risk of the hammer getting snagged on clothing, holsters, or purses when drawing the weapon in a self-defense situation. The low profile, ramp front sight and the fixed notch rear sight also aid in snag-free presentation of the weapon. The 642 is double-action only, making it an extremely fast personal-defensive handgun to deploy in stressful situations, as there is nothing to remember to do except point and pull the trigger. The synthetic grips and inherently ergonomic design afford natural pointability. The Model 642 is built on Smith & Wesson's famous J-Frame, it has a 5-shot cylinder rated for +P .38 Special ammunition. Stainless steel and alloy construction resist corrosion caused by humidity and perspiration when the revolver is carried close to the body. The Smith & Wesson 642 Airweight Double-Action Revolver carries easily, deploys rapidly, and has enough firepower to handle any self-defense scenario."

This is the nicest one I have ever seen in person. The 2017 blue book puts this at $2,900 in 100% and $2,300 in 90%. And I know blue book is low on true Colt market value. That being said I would rather under value the condition of a firearm rather than over value. I have many friends who are gun collectors. And more specifically Colt collectors. And we have all agreed it is between 90% and 95%. The rifles exterior and interior look like it may have 0-200 rounds through it. It was manufactured in 1980 and I have the original sling and 20 round Colt mag. I assume anyone spending this kind of money knows as much or more about this amazing rifle as I do. But feel free to ask me anything else via email. Or if you want more pictures. I have checked all proof marks and it is 100% original.I need some cash today or tomorrow only so this ad will be down if it doesn't sell. And the price is only good for today/tomorrow. I will only consider CASH OFFERS. PLEASE DO NOT ASK ABOUT TRADES!! I will not ship. So if you are not willing to meet face to face in Dublin or Worthington I won't be interested.

Less than 500 rds through it. This upper was put together at all suggested torque specs(between 35 - 80 ft lb).  The receiver was lapped on the receiver face to ensure it is perfectly square.  I used a Noveske upper because they undersize the barrel inlet for an extremely tight fit. All of this matched with a extremely capable barrel make for a very very accurate upper. Ready for your long range shooting and can even be used for Service rifle if you change the brake to a birdcage. Parts list.20"" standard profile Black Hole Weaponry barrel 1/8 twist, 5.56 chamber Noveske chainsaw upper receiver Samson manufacturing 15"" rail - Comes with multiple rails, a QD socket, and a sling swivel stud. $50+ in accessories for rail. SD Tactical titanium muzzle brake.This is over $700 worth of parts."
