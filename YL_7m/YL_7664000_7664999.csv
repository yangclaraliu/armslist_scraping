Narrows the size over the usual sig grips and just feels right Armory Craft adjustable flat faced trigger. Considered one of the best Sig Sauer triggers out thereLightening window on the top of the slide as well as made the ejection port wrap over the top of the slide and down the other side so you can see the barrelGREYGUNS Enhanced spring set. Probably the best aftermarket upgrade to do to these Sigs. Everything is just so crisp and clean!Comes with two holsters done by Legacy Firearms. Usually a 6-8 week wait. One IWB with microsuede on the outside. Holster can accommodate a Surefire XC-1. The other holster is a OWB paddle holster in grey with the same light configuration Please let me know if you have any questions. Looking to downgrade to a Glock 23, so will trade for one of those with cash to even it out, but that’s the only trade I’ll consider at this time. All reasonable offers will be answered. Please don’t DM “what’s the lowest you’ll go”. It’s a gorgeous gun that’s been well maintained and practically new, with upgrades and enhancements. But I do want it to move fairly fast so like I said, reasonable offers. Thanks for looking!"

You will be getting a lot of bang for your buck. Will take 675 cash OBO shoot me a cash offer or possibly open to trades. I bought the gun new for 599 plus tax it was 634 then added night sights, additional mags which are not cheap, apex trigger, and another frame. Round count is low and the gun has not been carried I do have my Missouri ccw license located in Columbia mo but will do a reasonable amount of driving I've made many deals with folks in STL and everyone has been happy with transaction. I'm sure we can come to an agreement on a place to meet we are grown adults. Just shoot me an email. Thanks. I've got plenty of pics so don't be afraid to ask"

A classic bolt gun with a nice piece of straight grained walnut well fitted to a beautifully blued cold hammer-forged 22” barrel. Also included are Ruger’s patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver, provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings, eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field (scope rings included). Non-rotating, Mauser-type controlled round feed extractor is the most positive case extraction system ever invented, and features a fixed blade-type ejector that positively ejects the empty cases as the bolt is moved fully rearward. Hinged solid-steel floorplate for easy unloading without having to chamber each cartridge. Features an engraved Ruger logo and patented latch that is flush with the trigger guard to avoid accidental dumping of cartridges. Three-position safety is easily accessible and allows the shooter to lock the bolt or to load and unload the rifle with the safety engaged. Ergonomically pleasing stock has rounded contours along the barrel, on the bottom of the stock and on top of the pistol grip and wrap-around checkering on grip and forend. Also includes: rugged one-piece, stainless steel bolt; studs for mounting sling swivels. The LC6™ trigger features smooth, crisp performance right out-of-the-box for increased accuracy on the range or in the field. To sum up: A pretty rifle in a fine caliber that I’m sure will shoot great.Shipping is $35.00 inside the continental U.S."

Hinged solid-steel floorplate for easy unloading without having to chamber each cartridge. Features an engraved Ruger logo and patented latch that is flush with the trigger guard to avoid accidental dumping of cartridges. Three-position safety is easily accessible and allows the shooter to lock the bolt or to load and unload the rifle with the safety engaged. Ergonomically pleasing stock has rounded contours along the barrel, on the bottom of the stock and on top of the pistol grip and wrap-around checkering on grip and forend. Also includes: rugged one-piece, stainless steel bolt; studs for mounting sling swivels.

The rifle is zero'ed in ready to hunt with rifle, Nikon scope, and 50 rounds of precision 165gr Hornady SST's ($120 value ammo alone!). This rifle has been carried but has low round count. As with all Vanguards this is an exceptionally accurate rifle. They are all manufactured by HOWA Precision Machine Company in Japan (aka Howa Custom Rifles). The rifle has been dipped professionally in MossyOak Bottomland pattern camo and is sporting a Nikon 3-9x40 scope. As with all Nikons it is covered by a lifetime warranty. This scope I believe to be an older Monarch which means better glass than current models. Any buyer must have a current AL Drivers License & current Conceal Carry Permit. Cash Sale only no trades.
