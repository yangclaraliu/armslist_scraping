The serial numbers of these pistols are 314-42397 and 314-42398 and the testfire date for both is February 2, 2001. The pistols have never been fired beyond normal testing during manufacture. The pistols’ slides are made of Terhune Anticorro stainless steel and feature nearly indestructible resin grip panels and custom compounded polymer frames. These manual safety model pistols incorporate a manual ambidextrous lever that, when engaged, prevents firing unless the lever is in the “fire” position. The KP95 pistols will each be shipped in a gray plastic pistol case along with one 10-shot magazine, magazine loader, and appropriate instruction manual. An original 2001 Ruger firearms catalog is also included with this auction. The pistols are being sold “as is,” and the purchaser assumes all liability for their safe and proper ownership, storage, use, and resale. Please note that the winning bidder of this auction is responsible for paying the Federal Excise Tax. The pistols are a part of the Ruger factory collection in Southport, Connecticut, and a Certificate of Authenticity will be mailed to the winner of the auction."

Compact and lightweight.
Round count is certainly less than 500, probably less than half that.
Included is a trigger laser. This has a small off and on switch. When on, it Is not continuous. It will illuminate for 7 seconds after you touch it with your finger. You do this unconsciously when you insert your finger in the trigger guard (this might not work with gloves as it might use static electricity). The laser works every time and without thinking about turning it on, unless you wait longer than 7 seconds to fire. Then you just take your finger a little (VERY little) off the trigger and it’s back on again.

It's an ak74, so those that aren't familiar with the platform it is chambered in 5.45x39, not 7.62x39. It's an awesome reliable shooter and it's really accurate as well, and in my experience shoots better than an ar15. The muzzle break on the end really helps out with the recoil to the point where it's literally almost nothing. It's weird especially if you are used to shooting a 7.62x39 ak lol. It's a Bulgarian pattern kit that was built on a nodak spud ak74 reciever. I can arrange a test fire for serious buyers only. It comes with 2 stock sets, a nice Bulgarian ""blonde"" wood stock set and the typical polymer black stock set, the wood one is pictured in the first one. It also will come with 6 pre ban magazines. 1 is a Bulgarian circle 10 black polymer mag and the rest are all Russian Bakelite magazines. Like I said it's in excellent shape and for serious buyers I can arrange a test fire at my sportsmens club. All laws will be followed no exceptions, and no scammers either! Thanks for your time!"

If you’re looking for a versatile carry pistol that is packed with features, has amazing capacity, and performs flawlessly, look no farther than the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is the smallest of the XD(M)® line, but it’s by no means the least. It boasts the same superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make larger XD(M)®’s easy and intuitive to use in a slightly abbreviated package. And you’ll be amazed at how fun it is to shoot.
The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact has a 3.8 inch barrel mated with a shortened compact frame. When combined with the versatility of XD(M) Gear® X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazines, the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is ready for daily carry or a day on the range. Put in an X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazine, and you have a 19 round full-sized 9mm pistol (16 rounds in .40SW, 13 rounds in .45ACP.) Use the flush-fitting 13 round magazine, and you have a Compact (11 rounds  in .40SW, 9 rounds  in .45ACP.) Like all XD(M)®’s, the XD(M)® 3.8″ Compact comes with three interchangeable backstraps, fiber optic front and low profile combat rear sights, mega-lock frame texturing, an ambidextrous magazine release, a multi-position frame rail, and a match grade barrel.You’ll also find all the safety features that make the XD(M)® a safe pistol in responsible hands.
If you want a gun for daily carry as well as a trip to the range, but you only want to buy one gun, try the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. You’ll be amazed at how controllable it is to shoot and how easy it is to conceal. It’s two guns in one."

Less than30 rounds through the gun; this is not a range gun; it is for personal carry only (my opinion). I am selling it because I want to standardize to the Beretta Pico for personal carry (I own three). Included in the sale are approximately $80.00 of new Seecamp parts. I purchased the Seeamp prior to the release of the Pico and was commiteed to the Seecamp because of its size (small, easy to conceal), design (can be carried safely, i.e. dropped without issue) and was cosmetically impressive. I purchased these replacement parts to faciliate maintainence but never needed them. I can be reached at REDACTED. I also have an Aegis Armory, Covert Carrier (left and right) and Recluse holster for sale under separate Armslist ads that could be part of this sale."
