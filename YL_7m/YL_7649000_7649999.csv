Built around our newest 18” Strength to Weight, Cold Hammer Forged barrel, this platform delivers the speed, controllability, and precision required to engage the most difficult multi-gun stages. The V7 Pro comes standard with the new MFR XS 15.0 M-LOK® rail, which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. An uninterrupted Picatinny rail on top and M-LOK attachment points ensure plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allow for the maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The long 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and it prevents over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnified optics. The newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb. A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset. Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle-length gas system, this allows for shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue. The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.I've owned this rifle for less than a year and I’m needing to sell it. I’ve reduced the price while the gun has had minimal usage, it is in EXCELLENT condition and has no scratches or marks on the rifle. The rifle comes with a Daniel defense case with manual, bi-pod, fore-grip, and a 3-9x40 AIM sport scope, and a 30 round magazine"

It will slam fire like older Ithaca 37s meaning you can hold the trigger down and keep pumping it until it's empty.  I need to sell it to raise Christmas funds so obviously I'm not looking to trade this one. It will come with the 5 round shell carrier and 5 rounds of buckshot but not the sling in the pic. I will meet anywhere in McIntosh Co and as far north as Richmond Hill over this weekend. I can go as far south as Brunswick . Asking price is $135.00 which is firm and fair. I have $150.00 in it."
