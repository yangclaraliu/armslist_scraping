The PowerDrive gas system cycles a wide range of loads and reduces the heaviest and slightest of recoils making the gun more comfortable to shoot and allowing you to get back on target faster. The Maxus has the fastest lock time of any shotgun in its class, reducing the amount of time from trigger squeeze to shell ignition, resulting in more consistent and accurate shots."

Here is a list of the goodies:Two 10 round mags with Pearce grip extensionsTwo 10 rounds mags with the Pearce +2 extensions, so they are 12rounds.Two 15 round Glock 20 mags, with X-Grips.Fobus OWB holsterGhost ring night sitesCouple spare recoil assemblies, one is a 20lb steel setup you can use for Nuclear rounds.Lone Wolf ported 9x25 Dillon barrel. This is a good barrel if you like fireballs. Underwood makes some nice 9x25 ammo, go to their website and check out the specs.KKM 4.6” extended barrelLone Wolf 6” barrel.
So, this this can be set up in multiple configurations. You can run the Glock OEM barrel and the Pearce grips extensions for the most compact setup with 10 rounds. You can toss in the 4.6” barrel and the +2 mags, shoot something with a couple more rounds and more accuracy, and still be able to carry. Or you can go full retard and slap in the 6” barrel and have 15 rounds of hunting ammo in it. There is lots of variations in between. This is like having a Glock 20 and a 29 all in one!

I really love this handgun but at my current income level its a luxury that I don't need. Besides it was a present from my ex wife so it's always gonna have that storm cloud over it for me.  Make me an offer if you don't like my list price, worst I can say is no. I am going to be buying a cheaper handgun to replace it with the money that I get from it so if you have something to offer to trade send me pics and your trade offer, like I said worst I can say is no.

He had the .45 shop in Odessa Florida and many of his 1911s shot at camp Perry along with those of James Clark. He was known for his ""wagon wheel"" looking sight which usually was a full rib for target and no rib for his street guns. His trademark were the welds he added to the inside of the slide to increase the lockup. Usually there was one but sometimes two or rarely three. His groups at 50 yards were phenomenal, something like 3/4 of an inch at 50 yards. This 1959 Colt is in excellent condition with 90% polished blued finish intact. Checkered Walnut Grips and the famous wagon wheel sights. This Colt will make you look good at the range with awesome groups.MN Buyer needs MN state ID and Permit.Out of MN buyer pays $30 shipping to local FFL."

I bought these with the intention to swap in a Glock rear and S&W M&P front, but life got in the way, and I decided to hold off. Now, you can decide what sights you want.Two 18 round magazines are included per pistol. The extra 20 round mags shown below the cases were recently sold. All of the other original equipment (holster / loader / etc) is included.Both pistols have a semi-aggressive stipple pattern on the front and rear backstraps exactly over top the factory stippling.Both pistols functioned 100% the last time I tried them.As seen in the picture, the TP9SF on the right has a bit of finish removed on the slide and some scratches / gouges around that area from a bad fall on concrete. Would be a good candidate for refinishing or leaving it as is for that worn look.Willing to meet up around the Grand Rapids area. You must have a CPL or signed pistol purchase form. Want to sell both at once. I accept cash or will trade for a Glock 19 or 17, and we need to meet in a public spot."

American made. Surprisingly accurate with an adjustable sight. Time tested design. The flagship feature of the Jimenez Arms J.A. Nine is its easy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern. These features coupled with a last round slide hold open makes this pistol uncommonly accurate and a delight at the range.  2 mags included.  I believe  one is 12 rds and the other might be only 10 round."
