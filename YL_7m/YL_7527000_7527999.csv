The 'LE' edition comes with phosphoric night sights and three magazines. The three magazines are 6, 7, and 8 rounds, giving more grip to large handed shooters. I only shot this gun once at the range. It's in perfect condition with no scratches or blemishes. I tested six different types of ammunition. It ran fine on everything except the lowest grain I could find, both ball ammo and hollow point. They just weren't powerful enough to fully eject and load the next round. Along with the gun, I'm selling my StealthGear Ventcore holster. This is one of the best made holsters I've ever owned. It fits the PPS perfectly and is incredibly comfortable to wear. I paid $110 for this holster and they are made to order. It's an IWB holster for a right handed shooter. I'm also including a gun and magazine holster made by Sticky Holsters that I bought for $30. These are perfect for carrying in workout clothes, in a bag, or anywhere else you can think of. Armslist will not allow me to post links, so please google the holsters for additional information. I've priced this gun appropriately and will not accept trades or negotiate a lower price. I will require you provide a driver's license and sign a proof of sale. Thank you."

Very good condition full size Lorcin 9mm pistol.  Supplier had fun messing with this one and replaced the springs and firing pin.  Includes a larger 13 round capacity factory magazine.  Finish looks very good, as do the grips.  For some unknown reason, prior owner filed out some of the magazine well.  probably did that to make another gun's magazine work.  The original mag still works and seats well.  Due to filing, there is some front to back play in the magazine fit, but doesn't affect function. If it bothers you, would be a easy 2 minute fix with some JB Weld.  Would have been nice if we knew which other manufacter's magazine he tried to make work, but I have no clue.  One of the cleanest Lorcin 9mm pistols I have seen.  Sights are nice.  Just a very nice older pistol.  Shoots the inexpensive and good  self defense 9mm round.  Way to big and heavy for personal carry.  Would make a fun range toy, or good home/truck gun.  Its alway nice to have an extra 9mm around.  I'm thinking about keeping this one for myself."

It is with a heavy heart that I post this baby but Im in desprate need for Money to get through this winter. She is a great shooter and was quite accurate. Such a solid piece that there wasnt much kick. DOES NOT HAVE THE BARREL. I had recently sold the barrel seprately on armslist cause it was custom threaded stainless and was a bit more valuable alone. You could eaisly pick up a barrel through BRPGUNS.COM or find a good deal for a surplus barrel at a gunshow or something. Very nice system for barrel changes if some one wanted to legally convert this bad boy to Full Auto in the future. Has a custom shroud with built in muzzle break That has a rail attachment to accomadate tactical lights or bipod. *BIPOD NOT INCLUDED* These are becoming quite rare now and are a reliable work horse for shooting. This will eat anything You put through it ammo wise. I have had very few stoppages that werent shooter related. It was fun to fill the drum lay prone at the range and tear up the targets all day or even throw on a grip and do some tactical shooting with the stick mags. Comes with a 70 round drum and 5x 36rnd stick mags. I will throw in a leather thompson mag pouch to store the mags Need to see Permit to purchase or Carry Permit with MN license so we can keep it legal. This is truly one of the best shooting carbines I have ever owned but I need the Money and selling all My guns but one Deer Hunting rifle. If I could Deer Hunt with this I would keep this One. I cant really afford to come down much considering the rarity and how heavy duty these are. I have reduced 100 for the Barrel. There is alot You can do with this Baby!

Height: 8” Overall Length: 35” to 38.25″ Stock: Black Synthetic Collapsible Features:  Lower receiver is fitted with Magpul® MOE® grip and MOE SL™ collapsible buttstock on the Mil-Spec buffer tube. Handguard is free-floating for accuracy and the slim, 15″ length provides enhanced ergonomics and support. Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability. Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability. The Ruger® Elite 452™ AR-Trigger is a two-stage trigger that offers a smooth, crisp, 4.5 pound trigger pull. It features a full-strength hammer spring for consistent primer ignition and a lightweight hammer that enables a 30% faster lock time over standard MSR triggers. Rifle-length gas system provides smoother operation and reduces felt recoil. Magpul® M-LOK® accessory attachment slots along the 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions with additional slots on the angled faces near the muzzle. Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8″ twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black nitrided finish provides corrosion resistance. Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance. Ruger® muzzle brake is a radial port design that significantly reduces felt recoil and muzzle movement. The 1/2″-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul® PMAG®."
