Shoots a jet of burning diesel fuel 50 to 60 feet at full pressure. Pressure is provided by a CO2 tank and regulated to a max of 120 psi. I have only done 1 full on test with it but it performed quite well (see picture, a screenshot from the video of the test).Pros: it works, it is simple, CO2 and diesel are easy to get, it uses ALICE pack shoulder and back straps and was built using dimensions of the ALICE pack frame.Cons: it is big, bulky, ugly, and heavy. I think with 4 gallons of diesel in the fuel tank it weighs on the order of 75 lbs. Also some of the welds on the frame are not perfectly square because I built this as a hobby project and did not have access to a welding table. It is rock solid though.I would like to get 400 for it because it cost about 500 to build but I will take offers.

It’s not a replica or a clone or a copy - the MKE Z-5K is manufactured on machinery originally supplied by H&K to MKE for license production of H&K firearms for the Turkish military. The smallest of the Z-5 series (13"" OAL), it is as close as a civilian shooter can get to the thrill of shooting an original MP5 without the prohibitive expense of locating one of the scarce and very expensive civilian legal variants made by H&K.These models have the ultra-reliable, super-smooth roller locking delayed blowback action of the MP5. Most if not all aftermarket accessories that fit the H&K MP5 will fit the MKE Z-5K. These come with the H&K drum style rear iron sights • 4.6"" cold hammer-forged barrel (1:9.8"" twist) of rugged chrome-moly vanadium steel• Detachable Picatinny optic mount included• Reinforced polymer lower receiver, with pistol grip molded as one unit, is extremely strong yet keeps weight down • Handy dual mag release: side button and paddle in front of triggerguard • Sturdy hard-shell case, 3x10-round magazines, sling, Picatinny optic mount, cleaning kit, and 2 spare takedown pins includedHere are few reviews (early and later on) https://loadoutroom.com/37217/zenith-z-5p-subgun-quick-look/ , https://loadoutroom.com/39259/zenith-mke-z-5p-sb-subgun-second-to-none/ ITEM DETAILSAction Type: Blow BackBarrel Length: 4.6""Capacity: 30-RoundCartridge: 9 mm LugerFinish: BlackFront Sight: FixedLength: 12.70""Magazine Included: 3 x 10-RoundMagazine Type: RemovableMuzzle: PlainRear Sight: AdjustableStock Material: PolymerWeight: 4.4 lbs Just as an FYI a actual H&K MP5 has dealer pricing at over 2.1k (this is beofre dealer mark up)***We are offering layaway on the MP5 model only.

I also have spare heaters that I can provide so that you can heat up accessories as well. The dates on the boxes are the Inspection Date, not the expiration date.Here is a guide to the date codes on the cases:  The first line is the date it was manufactured. The number before the dash is a combination of the last digit of the year of manufacture and the Julian date of that year.  The number after the dash is the lot number of that date that the case belongs to.  So for the case in the picture, it was manufactured in 2015 on June 4th, and was part of the first lot produced that day.  The second line is the Inspect/Test date.  The number before the dash is the last two digits of the year, and the number after the dash is the month after which it is supposed to be tested/inspected before being consumed.  For the case in the picture, the inspect/test date is June of 2018 (three years after manufacture).  You can check this for yourself here: http://www.mreinfo.com/mres/mre-date-converter/As you can see in the pictures, these cases haven't even reached their first inspection date yet!THESE ARE LEGAL TO OWN, so please don't be an internet lawyer and try to enforce a law that doesn't exist."
