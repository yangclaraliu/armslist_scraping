It's an awesome slug gun for use in the weapons restrictions areas or as a great home-defense shotgun. Took and awesome 6x6 whitetail buck with it this season. The magazine will hold 5+ 1. I've mounted a scope on the pic rail and it's an accurate 6 inch zero out to about 100 yards. Uses standard shotgun shells or rifled slugs. I've kept the rear sight and will include it in the sale with the scope. General Description: 3” gas operated, semi-automatic tactical shotgun that allows you to shoot light to heavy loads. Removable choke system that uses Beretta® Mobile threads includes one choke tube (Extended). Highly durable injection molded stock w/ fixed pistol grip and forearm. The Raptor ATAC features a picatinny rail and ghost ring sight mounted, plus a fiber optic bridge front sight, fixed pistol grip stock with soft rubber gripping and swivel studs.  Features:Magazine Cut-OffBridge Front Sight with Fiber Optic BeadPicatinny Rail with Ghost Ring Sight Mounted5 Round MagazineChrome-lined Chamber and BarrelSwivel StudsExtended Beretta® Mobile Choke Action: Gas operated semi-automatic. Bolt remains open after last round is fired. If magazine and chamber are both loaded, opening action will result in ejecting shell from chamber but will not cycling new shell from magazine into the chamber. Magazine cut-off is located near trigger guard and must be pushed to eject shell from magazine. This allows shooter to clear chamber but keep magazine loaded. Safety: The primary safety is located on the backside of the trigger guard. When engaged, the safety is designed to block the trigger, hammer lever and the hammer which makes the firing mechanism immobile. Magazine: Tubular magazine; bottom loading."

General Specs: Marlin Arms, Year 1888, .32-40, 8lbs 5oz, Lever Rifle Serial Number: 16681 What an incredible piece of history we have before us in this antique Marlin Deluxe special order rifle.  Can you imagine ordering a gun like this in 1887 and taking delivery at the local general store in February 1888?  What the town's people must have thought, and what pride of ownership the gent must have had.  This is a very rare example of John Marlin's first lever action repeating rifle, with only 16,378 made.  The Cody Firearms Museum letter gives us the basics; Model 1881, .32-40 caliber, 28"" barrel, shipped 1888.  As noted in Colonel Brophy's seminal book on Marlin guns entitled ""MARLIN FIREARMS --- A History of the Guns and the Company That Made Them"", the early records did not record whether the guns were ordered with engraving, or other special order features.  However, the gun does speak for itself, and we know that it was ordered on the small frame used for the .32-40 and the .38-55 with the special ordered heavy octagon barrel, that it was ordered with Deluxe grade English walnut, factory checkered buttstock and forend, a Lyman Ivory Bead front sight, and factory engraving.  Louis Daniel Nimschke is given credit in Brophy's book for most all of the engraved 1881 rifles, and if you look at the hand of the engraving, it is definitively Nimschke's signature scroll and game scenes.  Only 1785 of these rifles were made in the .32-40 caliber, and only 1303 with pistol grip butt stocks.  Only a tiny handful were factory engraved.  BEST OF ALL---THIS RIFLE IS UNTOUCHED AND RETAINS 45% FADING FACTORY CASE COLOR, 95% FACTORY BLUE, AND MOST ALL OF THE FACTORY WOOD FINISHES!  The factory checkering has never been recut, and the bore is mirror shiny with all of the rifling crisp and clear, the screws are in excellent condition, and there is no pitting inside or out. The mechanics are crisp and excellent in all ways. I am offering this historic rifle at a very modest price making it a great investment opportunity and fleeting chance to own a piece of history at a bargain price.  DON'T LET THIS ONE GET AWAY!

Included are all the bases for different sights for the MOS feature, 3 TTI +4 baseplates in red on each of the 3 OEM magazines, as well as the OEM baseplates, 3 Magpul 17 round magazines, a blade tec holster with a dual mag carrier, and a single mag carrier, all with the Tec Lok attachments, and a Mission First Kydex OWB holster.

I am not looking for trades, and low-offers will be ignored.  Molot makes some of the nicest AK-patterned rifles available and it's a shame we won't see any imported into the country for the forseeable future."

AR Stoner Complete Upper with a Rock River Lower.
The complete upper came having fired three rounds by the factory. I put it on a Rock River lower and then shot a 10 round magazine through it. That's all the action it's gotten. This was my secondary AR-15 and now that I've built an AR pistol I am getting it back down to two. 
It's got a 16"" barrel. Fixed front gas block. For more about the upper go to Midway and look up their AR Stoner AR-15 A3 upper receiver. its got a 4.6 star rating on over 400 reviews. This upper is worth the price alone.
The lower is a Rock River LAR15. Does not have the RR 2 stage trigger. Fit and function between upper and lower is great. Thanks for looking.

Mauser collectors, hold on to your hats!

(NO FFL REQUIRED FOR THE SHIPPING OF THIS ANTIQUE FIREARM)
 
Very seldom do these come up for sale in this condition, especially at this price point. If you’re a serious collector, this is the Mauser for you… A near-mint early serial number (A6201) rifle. Even the cleaning rod is original and serialized to the gun! Starting off with the stock, it is in overall great condition, with less than typical storage markings and no wear and tear from use. The cartouches are all there – the matching serial number with the star of David below it, the arrowhead behind the trigger guard, the four-leaf clover behind the rear sling mount, and the 1895 crest on the butt. There’s nothing to say about the bluing on this rifle, other than it being 100% with NO visible flaws at all. The Chilean crest on the receiver is beautifully stamped and visible. The original barrel is in shocking condition – this rifle was rarely shot during its 123-year existence. The bolt is smooth as butter and still has some cosmoline on it from storage.
 
Folks, there is no rifle that compares in quality to a near brand-new Mauser from 1895. The Mauser rifle was the precursor to almost every great bolt-action firearm today, and not without good reason. Just one minute of holding this rifle and you will instantly become a fan of it, and the Mauser line of rifles in general. To put it bluntly, this is the Bugatti of the bolt-action world.
 
This rifle is priced to sell at $1195 – make an offer, we entertain trades!"
