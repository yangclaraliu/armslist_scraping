I've had the gun for a little over a year and have put around 500 rounds through it with no malfunctions what so ever. I love this gun but I prefer 9mm. It does have some holster wear on the slide since it has been in my carry rotation since about a month after I bough it. Nice set of tru dot night sights on it that Still glow just as bright as they did a year ago when I bought them. I can also throw in a stealth gear vent core holster or maybe even some cash for the right trade. Looking for something in 9mm. Preferably comparable in size.

The Hi power design is a military/police pistol that was designed by John Browing in the early 1900s. My Hi Power was made in about 2003 based on serial number in and in an Argentine military factory(FM).  It evolved as the M95 which is the Browning Hi Power Mark IIIs. The magazine safety has been removed to improve the trigger pull to about 4.5 lbs.  The mag safety is sold with pistol.The pistol is single action and is in very nice condition. The thumb safety lever is on both sides of the frame. Construction is all steel with 3 mags marked ""made in Italy"". Grips are original thin Navidrex with thumb rest.
