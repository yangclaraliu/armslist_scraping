For those not familiar with this rifle  this is basically one of the best AR platforms (with AK 47 adapted designs) to be chambered in 7.62x39 caliber. If you are looking for an AR that will have the knock down power of a 308 for a lesser price then 223 then this is the rifle for you. Shoot hundreds of rounds each time you go out and hardly feel a dent in your wallet, and unlike a 223 when you hit something with 7.62x39 it actually moves......confirming a hit.Heres what’s included in the sale of this rifle that was not part of the rifle when I purchased it from dealer;Drago soft carry case with backpack straps ($80)Vortex Strike Eagle 1-6 magnification, illuminated reticle scope ($330)Vortex cantilever rings ($90)Vortex scope pop up caps ($40)Skeleton buttstock ($100)JP Enterprises silent capture spring ($140)Charge handle extension grip ($20)Key mod rail hand grip ($40)Rogue pistol grip ($20)6 AK-47 30rd P-Mags ($60)paid $1550 for rifle with add ons sits at $2,450if I can get $2,000 I’d be ok with thatWith questions or offers call or text nick at REDACTED"

It's a tack driver and with the RRA 2 stage tigger, shooting accurately is so much easier than with most any other factory trigger, and many aftermarket triggers too. It's a dream to shoot. Also included are 2 mags, offset sights, original paperwork from RRA and original hard case. I also have have for sale a, new in box, 100Rd Drum magazine that I'll throw in with this rifle for free if you buy the rifle before the magazine sells.

This mauser has been sporterized with nice Leopold 3x9 scope and mounts that allow you to still use the iron sights!!It is not in perfect condition but in great shape, it is sighted in well and killed deer this year.  Very cool old rifle would make a great addition to a collection. I'm keeping this post short and sweet, I can get you any pics or info you need. Please excuse my lack of enthusiasm lol from what I can tell almost all the numbers match, but I am not a expert on mausers and have not taken it down all the way to check internal numbers. The rifle was made in 1941 in the famous oberndorf germany plant. It still carries all of its war eagle/swastika markings.  Rifling is great on the barrel, it has handling marks, minor dings and scratches on the stock. It's been refinished at some point in its life and is missing the original barrel hood and sling. Overall in good shape, would make a classy hunting rifle or just a collector, it still shoots great. Cash talks throw me an offer or trade These only go up on value. Thanks,  Nick314 nine74 8051 call,text,email"

It also limits any dust signature from the weapon when fired from a prone position. The Warden Blast Diffuser attaches to any SureFire SOCOM 5.56 or 7.62 muzzle device through the same patented SureFire Fast- Attach® system found on SureFire SOCOM Series suppressors.

The 6906 is in very good shape with one table mark near the end of the slide, the 4013 TSW has considerable holster wear and was a police gun so other than holster wear is well taken care of and the 4566, for it's age, is as clean as it can be. No scratches just a little rub and has the original grip along with a Hogue rubber grip installed. All three function great and the 4566 is the smoothest gun I have ever shot. Only trades I will consider would be a Sig M11 A1 with extra mags, Sig P229 9mm railed with extra mags or a Beretta 84 with cash on your end. I went to my friend who owns a shop and he said the 4566 would be $650.00 in his shop so I think the price for the three weapons is more than fair. If I need to ship, it will be FFL to FFL and I will have to get back with fee when I check with my FFL. I will drive up to a hour in any direction for sale, let me know. I will send pics on request and would be easier by phone."
