I have several ARs I've assembled from parts since and don't shoot the Ruger, so I'm listing it to see what kind of offers come around.Frankly, given what I paid 3 years ago and the way firearms prices have come down, I doubt I would get an acceptable cash offer (I can't stomach much of a loss, and you get a new one for $480 on Bud's), so trade is most likely. The price listed is what I paid."

Not really looking for shotguns unless a KSG in new or like new condition with cash on your end. I can add cash on my end for something I like for maybe a Tavor or Sig MPX or something. Just let me know what you have. Multi-gun deals, Sigs, Hk, Glocks, and not really looking for ""custom"" stuff that you can't really google and verify the value. My Canik was $550, threaded barrel was $180, Burris Fastfire III was $229, Streamlight was on sale at Primary Arms for $99. Add tax and you see my value easily. Serious inquiries only. REDACTED.

The rifle features the signature 16-inch FN cold hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel and operates from a closed bolt position. Chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO, the rifle will accept both magazine and linked ammunition belt and offers a 4.0-6.5 pound trigger pull out-of-the-box."

If requested I can also insure your package if you would like. I am not sure if this is legal in CA so I will not ship it there.  These are going to be banned so here is your chance. Apparently the only difference between right hand and left hand is the small cut out on the left side.  One could actually cut the right side out and close the left and it would be identical to a right handed model. I will ship this the very next day after purchase.   Again, feel free to ask any questions.  Thanks, Mark"

The listing will be adjusted accordingly if I change either aspects.*Face to face sales only.The rifle functions and fires perfectly. It comes with an all matching bolt carrier from a Malaysian parts kit. The sights are appropriately aligned and it will seat a factory original claw mount without any issues. Cocking the rifle is not a problem by any means. outside of a few welds, it is an overall excellent build. The slight overweld is at the mag well, it is nothing major and does not hinder the insertion or release of magazines. The other place that would be noted from the original is the eyebolt. Rather than have the end crushed to hold it was welded over. This does not inhibit form or function, but if looking to being as close to original this is not. The receiver itself does not fit the hk93 design as it utilizes the G3 style of magwell support. The bolt gap is .018"". It will not completely fit the .019"", but slides in the .018"" gauge with ease. The rifle is parkerized with minor finish wear from the original carry handle, as well as when I added a trunnion clasped bipod. The flash hider, unlike the initial run, can be removed. There is no solder used to keep it attached to the barrel. Like most of the C93's it does not have a paddle mag release but does have the bayonet adapter installed. The receiver is manufactured by Hesse. The serial number is C9315XXX. I have fired (480) rounds of brass cased ammunition. All of which was Remington .223. There were (200) rounds of Wolf, and (280) rounds of Armscor. Using the original 40 round mag that was dented at the back there have been zero failures of any kind. I did check to see if steel 30 rounds will fit and lock in place. They will go in, but trying to remove them is a bit of a chore. The mag release stiffens and is impossible to push with your index finger from the pistol grip and clamps to the magazines for dear life. I would recommend either using strictly 40 rounders, shortening the shelf of the mag catch, or replacing the mag catch with a new one. On my other C93 the 30 rounders fit and release without a problem, but the mag catch was more worn than this one. I will adjust the price based on the setup you choose. Feel free to look at my other listing of HK parts to determine what is best suited for you. For Barreled receiver (excludes bolt carrier, magazine, handguard, stock, and carry handle) $250. For receiver w/ bolt carrier only, the price is $500. I will also sell complete rifle without the magazine for $575. The third image is of items I do own, but is meant as a representation of the possibilities to which one can set up the rifle."

Trigger has been returned to stock. Also comes with both black and green backstraps. Will come with 2 Glock mags with Vickers baseplates on them. As you can see I also dremeled off the finger grooves and did an undercut on the trigger guard.
