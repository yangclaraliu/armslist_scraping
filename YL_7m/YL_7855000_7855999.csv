Transfers at FFL of your choice or I have few I can recommend depending on the area. Serious inquires only please. To sweeten the deal I will even throw in a few boxes of ammo as well !!!!The new clarification of opinion on Pistol braces was published in an open letter this year, and the letter states, “an NFA firearm has not necessarily been made when the device is not reconfigured for use as a shoulder stock – even if the attached firearm happens to be fired from the shoulder. To the extent that the January 2015 Open Letter implied or has been construed to hold that incidental, sporadic, or situational “use” of an arm-brace (in its original approved configuration) equipped firearm from a firing position at or near the shoulder was sufficient to constitute “redesign,” such interpretations are incorrect and not consistent with ATF’s interpretation of the statute or the manner in which it has historically been enforced.”. In other words, if the brace is unaltered and you happen to fire it from the shoulder on occasion you have not made the AR pistol and NFA Short barrel rifle. This awesome build is the third of this type I have put together and sold. Once you get this in your hands you are going to love it! I am only selling this one since my furnace died (now fixed) and I am simply reimbursing my account after just getting paid. I have more pics if you need them since I am limited on the site as to how many I can post. Thanks again for checking out my listing, please see my other listings as well."

This one, however, is unique in that it was not arsenal produced and was ordered directly from renown swordsmiths F. Delecour & Bakes of Paris. The backstrap of the hilt was custom engraved with the monogram cypher of its owner, initials “J.R.” who would have been of some means financially, possibly of French nobility. The sword bears the FBD seal of F. Delecour and Bakes on the ricasso as well as being signed F.D.Bakes on the guard just below the ricasso. The sword remains in the unsharpened state it was received from the maker which is very uncommon to find. The braided brass wire on the walnut grip also remains intact.Ford additional pictures, check it out on gunbroker:https://www.gunbroker.com/item/739640228"

Looking specifically for Glock 34 with extras. For sale is my like new CZ 75 Shadow Tac II. Bought new for $1400. I have only had the chance to fire one mag through this pistol. It ran great on that, haha. But I havn’t had the time and other projects have made this more of a safe queen. Awesome pistol, I have 2 of them, this one is the newer one. Comes with all the standard features, 3 18 round mag kits, trijicon night sight on front, 3.5# trigger pull. So much more, this is CZ's custom line. I will also throw in a brand new custom Vega holster in brown leather, cost a little over $130. $1000. Or would make a trade for a nice 9mm Glock full size or similar in 9mm 4-$500 depending on firearm So I Would consider a half trade and cash for another handgun. But you cant say you bought your gun for this so and so price new and take that off the asking price. I paid $1400 for mine new. Everywhere I have looked they are going for $1300 used for the couple I can find and much more used then one mag through it like this one. The 2 new ones available around the country are $1550 at Brownells and $1630 at a gun shop in Montana.   Just common sense on offering trades please. I’m not gonna give new price for yours and take used on mine. This certain CZ was Discontinued in 2017. Our latest custom shop model, this defensive pistol has a tuned trigger system with a shorter single-action reset and a Pre-B style slide. The Tac II features a CZ Custom plain black serrated Combat II rear sight, Trijicon® tritium front sight, factory 85 Combat trigger, is sprung lighter (14 lb recoil and a 13 lb main springs), extended magazine release, drop-free magazines and a stainless steel guide rod. The resulting trigger pull is 3.0-4.0 lbs in SA and 7.5-8.5 lbs in DA. Features are rounded out with a short dust cover, high-rise beavertail, and checkered aluminum grips."
