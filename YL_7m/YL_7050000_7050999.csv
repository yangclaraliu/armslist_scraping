I love this rifle immensely, but unfortunately I am moving to California, and will not be able to bring it with me. This is a package deal for $995.
Background information:
I've owned it for a couple years and am the original owner. I've put about 1,500 rounds through it, and never had a failure to feed or eject a casing.
I've owned a lot of guns, but this is hands down the most reliable one I've ever layed my hands on. She's got a couple knicks and scratches on the paint, and she is by no means a safe queen.
I clean her religiously. There are a few things not stock, which I will list below.
 
Modifications:
I had a low profile gas block installed, as well as a UTG free floating quad rail. Installation was done by Allison and Carey Gunworks located here in Portland. I have fired her throroughly since then, and she is as reliable as ever.
Aside from the gas block and handguard, everything on the rifle is factory stock. I still have the original A2 handguard and A2 front sight, so you can revert her to her stock configuration if you wish to do so.
 
I have a number of accessories installed as well, which I will list below:
Accessories:
- UTG Tactical Bipod with thumbscrew
- Streamlight 1000 lumen weapon mounted flashlight with thumbscrew mount. Has 3 modes: Bright, strobe, and dim.
- 6 Magpul rail covers and 1 Magpul XTM Handstop Kit
- Quick Release sling mount
- Condor Speedy 2 Point Sling
- 45 degree aluminum canted iron sights
- Off-brand red dot sight (surprisingly useful and reliable for $20 off Amazon, I have had no issues with it)
* I also have a UTG 30mm SWAT 3-12x44 AO Rifle Scope, which has been barely used, but has been great.
- Removable shoulder pad on stock
- Magpul Rear Flip Up Sight
 Magazines:
Five 30 round PMAGs
Four 40 round PMAGs
One 30 round Windham Weaponry aluminum magazine
One Lula mag loader
 
Ammo:
300+ rounds of American Eagle 62 grain green tip - One box is unopened, the other box is opened.
150+ rounds of American Eagle 55 grain FMJ - Some unopoened boxes, some loose rounds.
75+ rounds of Hornady TAP 55 grain V-Max - 3 boxes unopened, the rest is loose rounds.
100 rounds of HPR Black Ops 62 grain OTF - 3 boxes unopened, the rest are loose rounds.
 
The retail price on the accessories, magazines and ammunition alone comes out to $700 (not including shipping).
The lowest retail price for an LE6920 I can find locally is $800.
However that's for brand new products, and I don't expect a buyer to pay retail price for used gear, no matter how good the condition is (though you're welcome to--I wont complain).

Because of this, for the package deal, I am willing to part with everything for $995, or the best offer presented to me.
 
If you are looking for an exceptionally well built, reliable home defense weapon, this is the AR package deal of a lifetime. Don't let it pass you by.
If I can't find a buyer, I will have little choice but to bequeath it to a friend or family member.
I am willing to part out the ammo, magazines and accessories, but I will not offer as steep of a discount.

I will not agree to meet without speaking over the phone.National Match 50 BMG - has the match grade 33"" fluted barrel vs. the standard 30"". Comes standard with skid plates for competition use, I have replaced with a bipod and rear monopod for daily long range shooting.I have about 100 rounds through it. Broken in with one shot, clean, one shot, clean for 15 rounds (took 2 seperate 5 hour shooting days to complete) then cleaned after 5 rounds twice (third shooting day). Has since been cleaned after every 5-10 shots. I bought it with the intent to compete, however 2 job changes and 3 states later, I don't have the time to, and also don't believe there are any competitions in my area. I don't expect to get what I paid for it, however I am not in any dire need to sell it. The cheapest I can find it for online is $3,500 before taxes and fees. I am willing to sell for $3,300 for the rifle, however $4,200 is the out the door price, as I will only sell it with the stainless steal case ($500) and the monopod+bipod set up.(Update - Price reduced to $3,750, which I believe is a fantastic price, would likely not even be able to get a standard model for This price).I didn't skimp on the accessories, bought the hard case and the ""essentials kit"" from Allied Precision Arms which was just over $1,000 with taxes and fees. I will drop $100 off the accessories as the case has standard wear and tear. Note that this is the only case specifically designed for the national match rifle, and does not require any parts to be disassembled to put into the case (other than the bolt being removed). I also have about 500 or so rounds I can sell for $3.50 a shot (same cost as the cheapest BMG ammo I could find online, however this is 750 grain ammo I paid $5.00 a shot for almost 2 years ago).I will not ship. I will pay any filing fee to have the ownership document with a licensed firearms dealer.Pre-Purchase fire is encouraged, however I want to discourage people from coming out just to shoot it. I will require a $20 non-refundable deposit on the rifle (that goes towards the purchase price of the rifle if purchased), and $5 per shot fired (My ammo, If you purchase the rifle, you get 2 shots [$10]refunded, and any shots past the initial two are reduced to $3.50/round). Can shoot on my land. (100-300 yard shots).Please email me with any questions, I love to talk about it. It is a real eye catcher and conversation starter.Please feel free to call/text me with any questions at REDACTED."

Needs an extractor, and they are hard to find, thus why I'm selling it cheap. It does shoot well, once, and then you have to hand load another round. I do have a new bolt on order through ratworx to fix this, however they are taking awhile. Can forward info on that for you. The bolt new is 150, and uses ar parts. Asking 1000 for the MSARThe Marlin is a large caliber short rifle. It shoots an enourmous bullet, and is tough on my shoulder. Functions flawless, I just don't shoot it.
