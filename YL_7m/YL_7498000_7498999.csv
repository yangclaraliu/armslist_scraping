The Caracal® Enhanced F – Limited Edition is a striker fired semi-automatic pistol chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum. The pistol is comprised of a Caracal International frame and a Caracal USA slide, and is assembled in the United States. Only a limited number of these pistols will be placed into the market, commemorating Caracal’s commitment in the industry and Caracal USA’s first consumer product release. 
 
The Enhanced F – Limited Edition pistol features a redundant safety system consisting of an integrated trigger safety, firing pin safety and a drop safety. 
 
The ergonomically designed contoured polymer frame, with its intuitive grip angle, incorporates a rail interface system for mounting lights, lasers and other shooting accessories. With an 18mm (0.71”) distance from the center axis of the barrel to the apex of the tang, the low slide profile puts the recoil axis close to the shooter's hand, which greatly reduces muzzle rise and felt recoil. The trigger shoe, trigger safety and trigger bar have all been designed in conjunction with a one-piece multi-function unit. Comes with 2 magazines, case and paperwork - $600.00 or consider trades.
