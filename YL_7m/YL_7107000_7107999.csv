It's a very well built rifle with no play in any of the action. The action was polished (not like the country) by a gunsmith and is VERY smooth. The breech locks up on go/no-go gauges and is very stabile. The folding stock has no catches or burrs and is also very smooth and solid with no wiggle. The wood stocks are very well taken care of with no dings. Bore is crisp and shiney. This is one of the most accurate Ak's Ive ever shot. I think it's becasue of the barrel thats on it. It's a good rifle. Comes with two Magazines, sling, hard case and 100 rounds of ammo. Chambered in 5.45x39. I'm not too interested in trades as I need the money but I do like other Polish and Soviet arms, so let me know what you have."

Trade value is on everything is around $1000.Would prefer to trade, but would sell it all for $850 FIRM.  Not desperate to part with it, lesser offers will be ignored.If interested feel free to call/text three 16 six 19 nine 853, texts preferred, leave a message if I don't answer a call.  ""Is this available"" emails will be ignored due to all of the spam lately.Thanks!"

Super-compact 40 S&W pistol that easily fits into a pocket or waistband.
Striker-fired action.  Trigger system is like a true double action/single action design.  It is fired single action every time, and the double action is there as a backup, in the event that a cartridge fails to fire on the first pull of the trigger.  In other words, the trigger system has double-strike capability. The slide does not have to cock the action before the trigger can be pulled again, allowing the shooter to try again if a dud cartridge does not fire on the first pull. Trigger pull is perfect for its size.
Multiple safeties:  Manual safety allows the pistol to be carried cocked and locked by blocking the trigger and locking the slide.  There is a trigger safety, so carrying with the thumb safety in the “off safe” position will work as well.  There is also an internal firing pin block, that blocks the striker from reaching the primer of the chambered cartridge unless the trigger is in its rearward position.
3 dot sight system.   Rear sight is adjustable for both elevation and windage. 
Grip well-textured for a positive hold and shaped for a comfortable feel.
Low-profile magazine release -- large enough for a quick reload, but is not so elevated above the surface of the frame that it might be unintentionally activated.
Barrel is 3.28” and provides excellent accuracy for such a small pistol.* Includes original plastic box from factory and paper work.
* This item is for sale.  It is not necessary to ask if it is still available.  If you are reading the ad, it is available.

This is the original .22 pistol that Bill Ruger invented back in 1949, and it put Sturm Ruger on the map as a serious gun company. Manufactured in 1975. The condition is good. There is significant wear on the back strap from use, and some minor imperfections on top of the receiver. This is one of the sweetest shooting .22 pistol I have ever owned.I am 20 years old, and legal to buy, sell, and trade handguns in Tennessee.

The BCM grip is $20 at Brownells and it makes the pistol much more enjoyable to shoot. The Magazines you can find on sale for about $18 a piece plus tax and shippig for the 30 rounder. I havent checked out the price the of 20 rounders but they are probably simlar and convient when fitting into a smaller bag.

No expensive was spared and I have the breakdown of the cost as well. I'm not naming ""phantom, unverifiable"" parts like some listing do. Just google what I'm showing you. This has about 150 rounds through it only, very low round count. It's the CZ Scorpion Carbine Rifle, with Silencerco Faux Suppressor ($899). I have the HB Industries AK Style Safety Switch ($29), HB Industries Theta Trigger ($35), HB Industries Theta Extended Charging Handle ($55), HB Industries  Reduced Weight Trigger Spring Kit ($9), HB Industries Trigger Pack ($5), YetiWorks Grip ($50), EOTech 518-2 Holographic Sight ($479) , EOTech G33 Magnifier ($499), two original 20-round mags (came with gun), three 30-round mags (3x $24). That's over $2600 before you even factor in Uncle Sam's take on the build. I have the original box for the scorpion and the cases for the Eotech optics as well. I'd consider a trade for an HK Mark 23 with a little cash on your end or I can keep the G33 Magnifier or the EOTech 518 or something. Also interested in a Desert Eagle Mark XIX in .50ae or the newer .357 L5 or .50AE L6. Possibly trade for a couple HK USP's or something along those lines. Multi gun trades including a Chiappa Rhino 200DS. Just let me know what you have but please, just be fair with your offer. I'm not going dollar for dollar but a $2000 offer is not a $2600 offer. I'd take a small loss on the HK Mark 23, but don't shoot off a bunch of random ""custom"" parts that can't be verified. Again, I did not add tax on my value and I know the HK brand new is about $1800. I've seen it in stock in Pearland and a couple other places. I would also consider a cash offer as well of $2000. Again, Trade value or Cash plus trade value needs to be in the $2500 - $2600 ballpark, give or take. Let me know what you have and I can send more pics if needed. Serious inquiries only. REDACTED"

This is a very accurate setup where a lot of money has been spent. The receiver is an early Winchester model 70 that was produced around 1970. The barrel is a custom piece that is fluted and built very heavily. The stock is a Custom coated textured finish that is Gray with black and white specks. The Optic is a rare and highly sought after original Leatherwood ART II (Adjustable Ranging Telescope) that was used in the late Vietnam Era on the M40 Sniper Rifles. It does have an adjustable ranging Cam for a .308. It sits on the original base that is required for the Optic to perform properly with Auto Ranging Technology. The scope is serial numbered as well to verify its authenticity. These Optics command a premium when they do come up for sale on the open market. This setup is in great shape and is very accurate. I have hit the same hole twice with two consecutive shots at over 100 yards with it in the past. I’m only listing it simply because I don’t have the time or real estate to enjoy the yardage and time that this gun deserves. It has a very light but crisp, tight trigger pull. It also includes a nice Harris Ultralight adjustable bipod as well. This piece is very fun to shoot and is definitely very reliable. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. If I can't answer, leave a message and I'll return your call. Thanks for looking!Dustin 270-317-4376"
