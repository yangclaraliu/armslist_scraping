The rifle is in really good condition because my brother religiously cleaned it every time he came back from the range and for good measure he took the scope off after using it to store it so it wouldn't potentially get damaged for whatever reason.

It also has custom touches like a competition trigger, match grade barrel, and a fiber optic front sight, which is brightly colored and easy to see. Like the original 1911, the GI Expert LTC uses a simple and effective recoil-driven action where the expanding gas produced from burning gunpowder is used to drive the slide back in turn eject the spent casing and load a fresh round on the return. It has a grip safety, which deactivates when a shooter wraps their hand around it, a manual safety, and a metal frame, which helps reduce recoil.
