This is the better design Swarovski explained based onsite serial number!This model was very close to the EL binoculars. This serial number was made in 2010.

The AF signifies that it has a lightweight alloy frame rather than a steel frame. I bought this new in 1991 from the Rod & Gun club while stationed in Germany. It is in really good shape cosmetically, it has never been carried so there is no holster wear but it does have a small spot here or there (there are a couple of very small marks on the front of the trigger guard where I used to have a laser mounted).  It has had less than 1000 rounds through it and it feeds flawlessly. It has been a home defense gun and safe queen its whole life - I pull it out every couple of years, fire a box of ammo through it, clean it and put it back. I recently used it for range time at a concealed carry class and at 7 yds I was putting 5 rounds through practically the same hole with cheap white box Remington ammo. I put Pachmeyer grips on it the day I bought it so the original walnut grips (pictured) are pristince. It will also include a few extras: an extended stainless threaded target barrel and compensated slide extension. I do not remember the manufacturer of the barrel and extension, it was 10+ years ago that I bought them, but while they were on the gun once for a short time I never shot a round through it. Do some research, you'll have a hard time finding an extended threaded barrel for under $100.  Since I rarely use this it is time to pass it on to someone else to enjoy.

I bought it back in March and I put about 1000 miles on it with no problem until the battery died last month and I unfortunately let it sit too long. I bought a new battery for it and it starts up but it dies when you twist on the throttle and give it gas which is why I have it priced so low. It either needs the tank flushed or carbs cleaned. Title is good to go so you can take it home same day you look at it. I prefer text but you can also call me at 5zero2-759-4nine88.

Do you need a top quality, reliable self defense gun that is equally well suited for concealed carry, or home protection, or even general sport shooting? Well, here it is, the Gen 4 Glock 26 9mm semiauto pistol. This is a new firearm that I acquired for a project which did not actually happen, and since I already have another G26, this one is for sale at a significant discount below new retail price. The handgun comes with everything that a new Glock comes with, including the sealed warranty package. In addition, I will throw in two Pearce grip extensions which I don't need that are installed on the two spare magazines (original baseplates included). If you need one, I can probsbly find you a right hand holster to throw in with the deal as well.
The Glock 26 is my favorite Glock and the one to own if you are only going to own one. It can be made to do just about anything the larger Glocks can do, and accepts its own 10 round magazines, as well as 15, 17, and 33 round magazines from the larger Glock 9mm pistols. It is the same general size as the single stack Glock 43, but is much more adaptable for a fraction of an inch more thickness, and holds many more shots. It is also more controllable, which is why it is the choice of professionals in a compact 9mm handgun.
I'm happy to show this handgun at my office just outside of Homestead by appointment. No parking lot deals, and all laws will be complied with. The price listed is already a much better deal than retail, but I'll listen to best offers. Not really interested in trades on this gun. Thanks for looking at my listing."

The gun comes with a special order Takedown feature, factory sling swivels and I believe a factory installed Lyman receiver sight with windage adjustment. The .405 was introduced in 1904.The Winchester .405 is, at least for me personally the medicine gun for lions!"" The .405 was discontinued in 1932. As for condition the receiver retains most of its toning original blue finish. The original 24"" tapered round barrel retains 95% of its original bluing. The original walnut stocks are in very good condition, The action is tight and smooth, mechanically perfect. The bore is MINTY, showing a mirror with sharp rifling. I would rate it at 95%+. The barrel address and caliber markings are perfect. The screws are very good and most remain unturned. The special order Lyman receiver with a windage adjustment is marked ""95"". The Takedown mechanism locks up tight. In all this old gun still retains a lot of condition, with an excellent bore that would make this rifle a great addition to ones collection."
