Condition:  New in Plastic.  Caveat: as discernable from my photos, the plastic wrappers are likely to show signs of shipping, storage, and being nested against other PMags in an ammo can.  There are likely to be little dimples and pinch marks on the plastic wrappers.  I bought these new from SKDtac.com, and if memory serves me, Palmetto State Armory, back in 2014.  I have been the only owner of these.  They have spent the overwhelming majority of their time with me nested in new production ammo cans, out of sunlight, in relatively stable temperature and humidity, doing nothing.  I have 5 of these 25 round capacity NEW IN PLASTIC Magpul PMAG 25 LR/SR Gen M3 7.62x51mm / .308 Winchester for sale WITH WINDOW.     I can fit 3 of them into a USPS flat rate envelope with no padding, which ships flat rate at $6.65.  I can fit all 6 of them into a USPS medium-size flat rate box, with some padding, which ships flat rate for $13.65  I will sell these for $15 per, with buyer paying for shipping.   If someone will make my life easier by purchasing all 6 in one purchase, I'll eat $6.65 of the shipping cost, leaving you with only $7 shipping cost to get all 6 in a medium-size flat rate USPS priority box headed your way.
I often feature a dollar bill and ammunition in pictures I take of magazines to list for sale.  There is no ammunition for sale here in this particular listing, nor is the dollar bill included in the sale.  Both are to communicate size and scale and my photos.
No personal identification of a buyer is necessary for this item.
If we meet in person for exchange, then I'll exchange for cash only. Will exchange with buyer at the ""craigslist parking"" area of Greer Police Department at 103 West Poinsett St in Greer, SC.    
And I am willing to ship this item, but don't see where to check such a box for the listing to not say, ""shipping: No"" .   I would receive and cash USPS money order before getting the order boxed and shipping it out via USPS.  And buyer would need to pay for shipping.
I now accept Square Cash (Cash App) as well as USPS money order. 
I will not ship magazines outside of the United States.  Sadly, that includes APO addresses (because of ITAR regulations).  I will not ship magazines to California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or New York.  I took more pictures than the 3 I am able to post on Armslist with my free account.  (I have one more picture).  If you want more pics, please let me know and I can email them.
The Ugly Part: If you buy something from me, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your use, misuse, application, gifting, regifting, or redistribution of the product.  By purchasing, receiving, or using the product, you agree to indemnify me and hold me harmless should any people, property, firearms, ammunition, magazines, or people's feelings get hurt by the product.  If buying a holster, you agree to check fit and function of the holster(s) with an UNloaded firearm to ensure nothing of the holster, firearm, modifications to either, or external environment factors induce a discharge of the firearm.  If buying ammunition, you agree handle it safely, assume full responsibility for its use and who can access it, and to use it only in appropriately chambered firearms of good working order."

237,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7725237,For Sale:  New PMAG 20 LR/SR Gen M3 7.62x51mm / .308 Win,"Greer Police Department, Greer, SC, Greenville, South Carolina",$ 15,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 30, 2018",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling my NEW IN PLASTIC Magpul PMAG 20 LR/SR Gen M3 7.62x51mm / .308 Winchester (20 round capacity) Right off the bat:  These are NOT for 7.62x39mm cartridges.  Condition:  New in Plastic.  Caveat: as discernable from my photos, the plastic wrappers are likely to show signs of shipping, storage, and being nested against other PMags in an ammo can.  There are likely to be little dimples and pinch marks on the plastic wrappers.  I bought these new from SKDtac.com, and if memory serves me, Palmetto State Armory, back in 2014.  I have been the only owner of these.  They have spent the overwhelming majority of their time with me nested in new production ammo cans, out of sunlight, in relatively stable temperature and humidity, doing nothing. I purchased these back when I was convinced that somebody who wanted to trample fun and freedom was going to get elected for 2017 and my few favorite toys were going to become very challenging to get supplies for.   Whoops, more battle rattle sitting around than I really want now.
Suggestion: Let my mistake be your gain. I have 35 of these 20 round capacity NEW IN PLASTIC Magpul PMAG 20 LR/SR Gen M3 7.62x51mm / .308 Winchester for sale.    ------------------------Update:December 20th: I have 31 of these 20 round mags left unspoken for.December 28th: 29 of these magazines remainingEnd of Update.------------------------------- I can JAM 5 of them into a USPS flat rate envelope with no padding, which ships flat rate at $6.65.  In that same kind of envelope, 4 fit ""ok"", and 3 fit very nicely.  I will sell these for $15 per, with buyer paying for shipping.
I often feature a dollar bill and ammunition in pictures I take of magazines to list for sale.  There is no ammunition for sale here in this particular listing, nor is the dollar bill included in the sale.  Both are to communicate size and scale and my photos.
No personal identification of a buyer is necessary for this item.
If we meet in person for exchange, then I'll exchange for cash only. Will exchange with buyer at the ""craigslist parking"" area of Greer Police Department at 103 West Poinsett St in Greer, SC.    
And I am willing to ship this item, but don't see where to check such a box for the listing to not say, ""shipping: No"" .   I would receive and cash USPS money order, or Square Cash (the Cash App) before getting the order boxed and shipping it out via USPS.  And buyer would need to pay for shipping.
I now accept Square Cash (Cash App) as well as USPS money order. 
I will not ship magazines outside of the United States.  Sadly, that includes APO addresses (because of ITAR regulations).  I will not ship magazines to California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or New York.  I took more pictures than the 3 I am able to post on Armslist with my free account.  (I have one more picture).  If you want more pics, please let me know and I can email them.
The Ugly Part: If you buy something from me, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your use, misuse, application, gifting, regifting, or redistribution of the product.  By purchasing, receiving, or using the product, you agree to indemnify me and hold me harmless should any people, property, firearms, ammunition, magazines, or people's feelings get hurt by the product.  If buying a holster, you agree to check fit and function of the holster(s) with an UNloaded firearm to ensure nothing of the holster, firearm, modifications to either, or external environment factors induce a discharge of the firearm.  If buying ammunition, you agree handle it safely, assume full responsibility for its use and who can access it, and to use it only in appropriately chambered firearms of good working order."

The new Walther SOFTCOIL gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.The CCP’s SOFTCOIL gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.Model Number 5080301"
