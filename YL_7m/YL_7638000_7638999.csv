Virtually all went to the German Police - except for the last 451 which were imported by Interarms – designated “P38 IV” instead of P4 to differenciate as a US gun.The P38 IV pistols were shipped by Walther without a serial number on the frame (presumably German law was satisfied by the s/n on the slide). This was not discovered by Interarms until some while later, and the remaining guns were sent out to have the numbers engraved on the frame by panagraph machine. The number consequently looks very neat, and was cut through the anodizing, so the numbers are bright in the bottom.** This P38 IV is one of the group that DID NOT get receiver or barrel lettering and the s/n is on the right side of the slide only. Receiver has some small proof marks but no lettering.Walther P38 production ended in 1982, the same year as this gun. The last serial number was 607,419.

This semi-automatic shotgun has a gas-operated system with a self-compensating exhaust valve and self-cleaning piston. It offers legendary Beretta performance, reliability, and worry-free operation. This shotgun is the perfect embodiment of Beretta's philosophy about maintenance: easy, quick and tool-free. The A300 Outlander breaks down into four major components, making it simple to take apart and clean even under less-than-ideal field conditions. It has a 3"" chamber, a low profile action, chrome-plated trigger, and a cross-bolt safety with ergonomics for better grip. The safety is reversible, making it a snap to adapt the A300 for a left-handed shooter. The barrel has .25"" x .25"" rib and a metal front bead sight. The A300 Outlander uses the Mobilchoke system and comes with F, IC, M. This model has an oiled wood stock.I was going to replace my older Beretta AL390 with this shotgun.  But after looking at the old gun, which I had so many good hunting memories with, I could not part with it.Comes with Allen 52"" softsided/camo shotgun case.If interested call Jeff at, six 5 one two 4 seven nine 6 six three"

Comes with box, 4 magazines, lock, and all paperwork. I bought this gun about 6 months ago and paid a lil over $1100 out the door.  A buddy of mine had one and I fell in love with it as soon as I saw it. But I happened to come across a great deal on a XD40 about a week after I bought it and it’s just a lil more convenient for every day use as it is a subcompact. I hate to get rid of the Sig but it’s Xmas time and moneys tight so I’m forced to let it go. I’m willing to take a lil bit of a loss on it but I dont see myself taking less than $800.. Might consider trades? Contact me at REDACTED. Serious inquiries only. Thanks for looking!"

It is a classic firearm with rich history. It is designed before the PPK (James Bond gun) and works flawlessly. It is in exceptional shape. The gun holds 8 + 1 and is quite small. It uses blowback action so it is accurate like the PPK and  many of the blowback 22 caliber pistols. It is quite reliable and easy to maintain. Feel free to do your own google search. I have only one magazine for this gun. What you see is what you git except for the vintage bullets (those would be by special request). I am not really interested in any trades or willing to ship. Will only sell to CPL holders (sorry) in a well lit mutual location. I would prefer to meet at my private range and club located just outside of Plymouth. Feel free to google this model or look at info at the following link:https://unblinkingeye.com/Guns/Wm4/wm4.html

This is the cabelas exclusive bitone version. At the moment they are selling for $879.00 and show out of stock. You can not get your hands on a sig gun with the Romeo red dot.  I also have 2 apex flat faced triggers that we can figure into the final price if desired. The asking price does not include these. Since they have started the voluntary recall these triggers don’t work with the upgraded fcu. This has not been sent it. These triggers are selling for $120+ on eBay at the moment due to them being discontinued. Let me tell you them make a huge difference. I have no problem holding on to this flawless gun. I am looking for $825 obo for the gun. *** I will go $750 firm if picked up before Monday December 4th***I would consider a trade of a Remington versamax in camo for the gun.

There are two new bills on there they will vote on and we need to contact our Reps ASAP. This is a call to action (Phone Calls, Emails, letters, and word of mouth), if I could be so bold to say so.  HR 651 - Will make it illegal to own or posses a bump stock in Georgia. ""There is no previsions for grandfather clause. If this bill passes, this will make you a criminal overnight if you own or posses one of these in the state of Georgia. There may be a provision later to allow you to get rid of them but you already paid for them and you wont get your money back from it. This bill is making you as a law abiding person a criminal just for owing something and they will send you to jail for 5 years if you do. "" HB 11 - Will make it mandatory that each person who carries a gun in obtain a weapons permit and have to go through a licensed weapons safety class. $30 for the permit and unknown fee for the class. "" this is another tax/ Fee for the Right to Bear Arms. This would mean everyone who isn't in the military or law enforcement would have to pay to go to a class in order to carry in the state of Georgia. If everyone has to go how long of delay would it be to get into a class? Ever hear of supply and demand? We should not have to pay a fee or a tax to exercise a right or have to pay someone to go to a class in order to pay for a right. We do not have to pay for any of the other rights, so why do we have to pay for this? It's just another way to limit the ""Free Exercise there of"" of the people while masking as a protection of our security and freedom.""
