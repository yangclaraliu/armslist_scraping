There is a small mark under the rear stock, but overall the blonde walnut glows in the sun showing rich wood grain and texture. She comes with the sporting sight in the rear and a dove tail up front. The rifle also features an 11 round tubular feed system and a 22"" round barrel. The pump handle is grooved and provides plenty of positive traction up forward."

The quality of the parts, the fit and finish and the silky-smooth action belie how much it must have cost to produce the Trombone. When you cycle the action, you can feel the engineering / manufacturing build quality. It locks shut with authority, it ejects with aplomb, the forearm moves like it's on ball bearings. She feels like a Swiss watch. It is certainly one of the most desired rifles in her class and has a following like few others. She comes to your shoulder like it was meant to be there. It is deceptively petite, but shoots the lights out. The re-blued finish is in excellent condition and the round knob blond walnut stock is in very nice condition showing only slight wear from handling and storage. There is a small mark under the rear stock, but overall the blonde walnut glows in the sun showing rich wood grain and texture. She comes with the sporting sight in the rear and a dove tail up front. The rifle also features an 11 round tubular feed system and a 22"" round barrel. The pump handle is grooved and provides plenty of positive traction up forward."

Its triangular barrel contour is a product of years of rigorous research and development focused on reducing weight, enhancing rigidity and promoting rapid heat dissipation. To decrease recoil and muzzle jump, this uniquely contoured 22"" barrel has an integral muzzle brake that’s machined in during production. Along with the barrel design, brought together a host of other cutting edge features on this super accurate Model 700 platform. The results are nothing short of astounding. Chambered for the inherently tight grouping 223 and 308 calibers, each model engineered with a rate of twist optimized for tactical style bullets, the Model 700 VTR is compact and swift handling thanks to its sleek lines and short action. The legendary “three-rings-of-steel"" and the many other superior design elements of this rifle deliver the highest degree of out-of-the-box accuracy available today. Plus, it’s matched with the new X-Mark Pro Trigger system for the ultimate in crispness and shot control. For improved consistency, the green synthetic stock has a vented beavertail forend that promotes rapid cooling. Its overmold accents provide a firm gripping surface, and the dual sling swivel studs permit convenient attachment of a bi-pod and a sling.

But I took it to a gunsmith and had him look it over. He said it's ready to fire and should do just fine.  I don't have a use for this. And it deserves someone that will use it, collect it, or hang it on their wall.  Rather than packed away in a case under a bed.  I have more photos available of it.  Just ask.   Also will take any specific photos a serious buyer would want.  Email or TEXT 513-708-428two Best cash offer. Thanks"

The P229 in DA/SA include a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The pistol is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG and also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc., P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most."

I've put about 100 shots through Kahr it and cleaned after every use same with the Ruger. On the Mahr, I have never ever had a FTF or FTE. These are nice pistols, but I have no desire to carry concealed, and the 7.5"" barrel on the Blackhawk gets a little painful after a while. I'm looking for trades only. Preferable a Glock 22 or any decent 9mm that holds13 or more rounds. Since I only have one mag, I will throw in a belt holster and a front pocket CC holster as well. Also pictured is a Ruger Super Blackhawk Bisley hunter with a very nice Simmons scopeFor the Kahr I will take a Glock 20/22 or similar large frame .40 cal/10mm. For everything, make me an offer. I will throw in all the ammo and accessories I have for these firearms.Once again, I am not looking for money, just trades. I would trade the Kahr for a Glock 20/22, the Blackhawk and the Kahr for a desert eagle .44mag, and I may even consider trading them both for the right AR or tactical long range rifle.
