It has brand new barrel, stock. Factory installed GF diopter and less important but really neat, it comes with that cool leather magazine pouch.

You should be. A great way to stop them would be with my lightly used Glock 20 in 10mm. 10mm pack a .357 punch but you get 16 shots versus the old six shooters. Plus this gun weighs less then most big six shooters so its not so bad if you are carrying it as a hunting back up. It is a Gen 4 with the stock sights. Comes with 3 15 rounds magiaizines. Let me know if you are interested. If you pay my asking price I will throw in some 10MM Ammo for free.

Comes equipped with a bull barrel, standard flash hider, diopter rear sight, and pic rails for bi-pods and scopes. The savage piece of German engineering also comes with 10 surplus magazines all of which function well. If you haven't discovered the joy of roller delayed blow back you are in for a treat this thing will kick your ass and take your wife out for dinner afterwords. This thing will also fling your brass 20 yards down range so your work area will never be crowded with brass. This also comes with the sight adjustment tool, which makes it easier to adjust the sight than using needle nose pliers. There is a huge aftermarket for this thing so you can build it out to your hearts desire. Bambi doesn't stand a chance when you roll in with 200 rounds of Real Fuckin' NATO and detachable box mags. In person sales only bring your Carry permit and a drivers license and be prepared to sign a bill of sale or arrange for an ffl transfer and we can meet at your favorite NOVA gun shop. Make an offer and let's make a deal if you have cool stuff to trade I'll entertain it, but cash and crypto are king."
