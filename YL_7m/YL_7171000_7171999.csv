Most all of the critical parts were sourced from Ballistic Advantage. The 10.5"" barrel with a pinned lo-pro gas block, The upper receiver and the bolt carrier group are all Ballistic Advantage. The rail is a 10"" Centuion Arms C4 quad rail. In my experience with working with these rails the last few years, I would put them against any othe rail on the market. The upper receiver is also Ballistic Advantage..It is made of 7075-T6 aluminum, and is precisioned to mil-spec specifications and M4 feedramps. The Ballistic Advantage Bolt Carrier Group is made to complete military specs. M16 Carrier Machined from 8620, 5.56 Bolt Machined from Carpenter 158, Forged Gas Key  Properly Staked, Tool Steel Extractor, Mil-Spec Extractor Spring with Black insert and Viton O-Ring, Grade 8 Hardware, Shot Peened Bolt, HPT/MPI Tested.

It was taken into the woods in Kentucky for the gun opener three years ago and did take a deer. It has never been in the woods since. I am the original purchaser and I have all original packaging. Being sold because I rarely hunt in Kentucky and high powered rifles are not yet legal to hunt deer with in Ohio.  Its pretty, but it is a gun-safe queen.  Call Steve at REDACTED.  More photos available upon request, just send me an email address as I can only post three photos here."

The DE/63 stamps are proper and within the known range for the gun’s serial number. The magazines matches the gun with “106” and “1” and ""2"", indicating a spare mag. The magazine has a great fit and the gun works just as it should, with a good release and the hold-open functioning properly.Vopo bakelite grips in very good condition, no cracks.

The G Date Lugers were produced in 1935 as Hitler and the Nazis tried to hide & disguise production. The Treaty of Versailles was still in effect and it limited the size of the German military and put rigid constraints on the types of weapons it could produce. The Third Reich was not supposed to produce Lugers with a 4” barrel in 9 mm, which is exactly what this is. The G was a secret code for the year 1935. The S/42 is a production code for Mauser. Reduced to $1100"
