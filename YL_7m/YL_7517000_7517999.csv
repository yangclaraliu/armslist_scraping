The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.
The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor ready. Its steel four port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick attach Barrett QDL Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold. Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side.The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion resistant and greatly eases cleaning. Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.SPECIFICATIONS:Mfg Item Num: 14085 Category: RIFLES CENTERFIRE TACTICAL Action :Semi-AutomaticCaliber :50 Browning Machine Gun (BMG)Barrel Length :29""Capacity :10+1Trigger :StandardSafety :Thumb LeverOAL :57""Weight :28.7 lbsStock Description :Fixed BlackMetal Finish :Black CerakoteMuzzle :Suppressor Ready Muzzle BrakeReceiver Material :AluminumSights :Flip-Up Iron RearBarrel Description :FlutedTwist :1:15""Barrel Length Range :28.00"" to 29.99""Weight Range :20.00 lbs and AboveHand :RightStock Finish Group :SyntheticMetal Finish Group :Blued/BlackCheck out all of our Barrett rifles http://shop.alphadogfirearmsaz.com/manufacturer.barrett?&caliber=94&manufacturer=370"
