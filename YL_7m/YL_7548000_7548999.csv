A must-see in person firearm for anyone appreciative of top-quality construction pistols. They don't make them like this anymore and never will again.*Made in 1982* [AI] lettercode. You can double check all of this yourself and I am more than happy to assist with any and all questions.Quick History: The Beretta 92 SB was introduced in 1981 for the USAF trials. These models were only produced for a very short time (less than 3 years) and many of the later ones were produced in the U.S., the Italian ones are obviously much more sought after. Production pretty much stopped when the 92F was introduced in 1984 with a different grip, trigger guard, and finish. If you notice in the pics, the 92SB still has the round trigger guard of the original 92 and the front strap of the grip is straight down, instead of curving in like the current models. Other than that, the lanyard loop faces a different direction as well. However, the biggest difference over the replacement 92F and all the models since is the deep bluing on the steel slide and the shiny anodizing on the aluminum frame. There was also a 92SB Compact model introduced a couple years later, which is slightly smaller and shorter holding 13 rounds instead of 15. Additionally, there was a 92SB Compact Type M model, which is a is single stack design."

The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match.  It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Although it’s easy to make and replace. There was a repair to a small crack by the lock at some point before I owned it. Although it’s VERY solid and was never an issue. It’s 160-170 years old. I Wanted to leave in orginal state. History- This gun was HAND made. All the screws, pins, locks, hammer, barrel, and stock. Nipple is original and wide open to the breach. All screws are original and locktite down. It was originally made as a target bench rifle with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes and mount holder on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very very accurate rifle, Bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1850-1860.. The lock is marked R & W.C. Biddle & Co. Philadelphia. This firm was a hardware store and was noted for importing or making hardware, gun locks, and barrels. Barrel is marked with T + F, in German script, believed to be Thomas Fenner, he was a gun maker from Philidephia Penn. 1829-1860 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel (under the rear sight). Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. 500$ cash - I have seen these priced 700-3500$ Hard to price history - Im not wanting to break the bank just a fair trade and hoping to send to a good home. I am open to trades for other firearms. I am looking for a Glock 19 gen 4/5, Browning Hi-power, or a decent 1911. email or text 918-4o2-o854"

It has raised suppressor high sights, so it's useable even without the sight. Get yourself a threaded barrel and it's good to go for suppressed shooting.

If you're local then cash is king. It'll take a lot of convincing to get me to go along with a personal check and I'd probably wait a long time for things to clear with a personal check before mailing anything off.I bought this awesome hand guard for my AK and realized after I recieved it that my AK was a Yugo pattern. So it's been collecting dust. If your AK is a Yugo pattern this will not work for you otherwise you're in luck. I spilled some gun oil on the Magpul box so there's discoloration if anyone really cared about the box. Other than that everything inside is brand new. I don't recall there ever being an allen wrench included. So there's no allen wrench if one was included originally but I don't think it was. This hand guard is super high quality with a full length rigid aluminum internal sleeve. Bummed I couldn't use it on my rifle. Product Details:Part number MAG586-BLKThe Magpul Zhukov Hand Guard is a fully-featured AK forearm for the modern AK. The Zhukov Hand Guard casts aside traditional AK forearm shortcomings and offers an extended option for modern shooting techniques, an aluminum chassis for strength and heat dispersion, a comfortable injection molded exterior for superior ergonomics, and M-LOK® slots for optimized accessory attachment. Compatible with the Ultimak gas tube rail for optics mounting, the Zhukov Hand Guard redefines functionality for the modern AK platform.Installation requires permanent removal of the hand guard retainer.Made in U.S.A. Hand Guard counts as one US compliance part for 922(r).Features:Extended length provides large gripping surface for modern shooting techniques as well as additional accessory mounting positionsMounts to most AK-47/AKM/AK-74 rifles with barrels between 16.75-18.25 mm in diameter under the hand guard and greater than 13"" in length*Full length, hard anodized, aluminum chassis clamps directly to barrel and provides for flex-free mounting as well as excellent heat shieldingDurable polymer outer coverSlots at the three, six, and nine o'clock positions for mounting direct-attach M-LOK accessories or M-LOK 1913 Picatinny rail sectionsIncludes replacement polymer Top CoverCompatible with UltiMAK Optics Mount top cover*NOTE: The Zhukov Hand Guard requires the permanent removal of the factory hand guard retaining cap and forward sling mount if so equipped. Please ensure your barrel diameter under the hand guard falls between 16.75-18.25 millimeters before cutting your retaining cap!Due to the wide range of tolerances of your typical AK, minor additional fitting may be required. Not compatible with Yugo pattern rifles or RPK style receivers.WARNING: Due to extended Hand Guard length, barrels less than 13” long are not recommended."
