I am selling it because I rarely shoot it and it sits in the case most of the time. I came with several aftermarket parts from RRA, for whatever that is worth. I added a 13.5"" free float rail with low profile gas block. 
Included is everything in the picture execpt the red dot, unless you want it then it's another $50. But I wouldn't recommend it because it is not that great and loses its zero.

I'm more of an AR guy when it comes to semi auto's.Rifle has 100% authentic Chinese standard style AK wood on it and is in very good condition. I have two dust covers, one that includes a scope mount and appears to be that is was imported with? Then I've bought a second Norinco dust cover because I wanted the correct AK look. Other than that, this AK is untouched.As you can see this is a straight cut receiver, not a slant cut.Comes with 3 factory 30 round Chinese Norinco magazines, two of which are brand new and one that has been used. Also includes two other random 30 round steel AK magazines as well as a 5 round magazine for hunting.Anyone who knows these AK's knows the triggers are amazing! This gun is dead on accurate at 200+ yards, I've shot 10 inch steel with 30 out of 30 accuracy using irons plenty of times at 200 yards and then some.Not sure what I'm wanting to do here. Trade maybe? I'd love an Amalite AR-10 or maybe a Ruger Precision in 6.5, .308 or somthing. Cash works also, then I can just buy what I want.Shoot me a PM if you would like to talk more about this rifle."

It takes its namesake from the Japanese martial, or underworld where the word “Kobun” means “soldier”. It’s a fitting name for a knife like the Kobun, which was effectively designed to be “a good soldier”. In profile it closely resembles the Master Tanto, but it sports a thinner blade, and that supports its main function; to be a light weight boot knife. Like the Tantos, it features the Tanto styled reinforced point. This contrasts sharply with most boot knives on the market today which are notorious for their paper thin points which are easily broken or bent. In contrast, the Kobun’s point is highly resistant to bending or breaking because it is reinforced by the full thickness of the blade’s spine which runs almost to the very tip of the blade. The Kobun’s deeply checkered Kray-Ex handle is designed to offer minimum bulk with maximum grip. Its cross section was made as thin as possible (approximately 1/2″), then contoured to resist turning or shifting in the hand. The Kobun comes complete with a Secure-Ex sheath. Specifications: – Overall Length: 9 7/8″– Blade Length: 5 1/2″– Blade Thickness: 1/8″– Handle Length: 4 3/8″ Kray-Ex– Steel: Japanese AUS 8A Stainless– Sheath: Secure-Ex Sheath– Weight: 4.40 oz"
