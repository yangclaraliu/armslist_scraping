Product Description

The criteria for the gun:

To achieve this, the gun was designed from its inception to be small, roughly 5.2 "" x 3.7""; to weigh a mere 13.5 oz; to be slim and smooth, devoid of any sharp edges or protrusions; and to have no external levers or controls to be manipulated. To get into action, one simply has to pull the trigger, which is a double-action only. The Rohrbaugh R9 is manufactured with space-age technology, using state-of-the-art CNC machining, which keeps tolerances to a minimum, thereby maintaining complete consistency in functioning. It is ergonomically designed to work seamlessly with the human body to point naturally and keeping the wrist and forearm in line. The design of the grip is also designed to push the recoil to the center of the palm, thereby reducing felt recoil.

State of the Art:

Rohrbaugh firearms are designed with the use of CAD/CAM programs. CNC machines perform the manufacturing. Then each gun is then hand fitted and assembled in our state of the art facility. The materials used are of the highest grade, including quality stainless steel, 7075 aircraft aluminum, G-10 grips and Wolff springs.

The R9 Steath is another version of the award-winning Rohrbaugh 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The R9 Stealth slides are coated with Titan Kote C12, which reduces friction, increases wear resistance and has anti-galling properties.

The upper is a forging made of 7075 T6, hard coat anodized aluminum. The BCG was identified by my FFL as a Daniel Defense full auto. Barrel is 16"" 4150 Chrome MolyVanadium with a 1 in 9 twist rate. Feed ramp is M4, and the rifle has a flat top upper. 10"" free-floating keymod handguard. 
 
Also included is a generic grip-pod, 2 polymer magazines, a set of FieldSport flip-up iron sights and a Vortex Strikefire II red/green dot with 4 MOA dot. The case is a pluck and pull Plano all-weather case. Has 5 latches to keep it secured closed, it's waterproof and floats. This case is TSA approved. I usually use one-piece cleaning rods, but I have an extra unopened Hoppes cleaning set for 22 caliber firearms. 
 
These rifles usually sell for around $650. Case was $70, grip-pod was $25 the mags are $25 for the pair, BUIS were about $30, and the Strikefire II is $180. That brings the total to about $980 here. 
 
Id like to see $650 for the lot, price is negotiable, but I won't dip too low on it. It's a good rifle, I've had zero failures of any sort."

I am running out of room in the safe, so I figured I'd see if there was a market for this.  I chose the OBR because the reciever/rail have 20 MOA built in.  There are certainly some other good rifles out there, but this rifle will shoot with any of them.Note - I used the Larue photo because the rifle currently has a Magpul PRS Gen 3, Silencerco muzzle brake and an expensive scope on it, and I want to avoid the inevitable emails from people asking if all that stuff is included. The rifle doese come with a Larue plastic case, 2 mags and all the typical Larue goodies. The stock and such are negotiable.From Larue's site:The LaRue OBR (Optimized Battle Rifle) was built from the ground up, using a newly designed upper-receiver platform, combined with a lower, inspired from our successful 5.56 MM lower. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet, for the optimum fit and consistency. The receiver components are designed with more material in critical areas to alleviate known issues of weakness in 7.62 platforms and to stiffen the receiver....translating into maximum accuracy.The upper-rail provides generous room for all issue weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations (suitable for 7.62 MM). The built-in 20 MOA cant provides correct ballistic orientation for all inline night vision combinations. The MIL-STD-1913 side rails are detachable, so that they can be configured for Vis / IR illuminators, etc, or left off to keep rails pristine, without the need for bulky rail covers. The bottom rails are also detachable, and can be positioned anywhere along the entire lower length, for the interface of MIL-STD-1913 equipped bipods, grips, tripod mounts, etc. These rails are offered as spare parts for field-service replacement, keeping repair cost at a minimum.Barrels:Available in 16.1"", 18"" & 20"" lengths. All gas blocks feature our unique Port Selector Technology (PST), a two-point adjustable gas selector that allows optimum function between suppressed, and unsuppressed operation at the flip of a switch. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24, with an A2-type flash hider attached (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). Internals:The Bolts and Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys. The carrier key contact areas are designed for zero gas leakage. About LaRue Firearm Accuracy: LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results."

This gun has never been a safe queen, but also never been abused. Round count is probably around 1k flawless rounds, never a single failure of any type that I can remember. This is a working mans gun, the reason for the stipple, its not pretty, everythings not perfectly symmetrical, but it works and you will never lose your grip. Trigger is also slightly undercut. Backstrap installed and stippled is new, the reason its still nice and shiney, and is a medium. Its the only backstrap included. Gun has light holster wear, mostly on the controls and not so much on the slide. Overall in really good condition for what it is. Included is the gun, 2 - 17 round mags, and all other factory stuff except the small and large backstrap. Also 3 holsters, a kydex IWB thats pictured that I made myself (adjustable retention and cant), a Foxx Hybrid leather/kydex IWB $40, and a Texas Concealment System kydex OWB $60.Not expecting to get out of it what I have in it, but also not going to give it away, but mainly looking to trade. Great gun for someone who cares more about function than form. Email or text. 205-585-5410."

I bought this for my bench gun because it has the legs that lock at 45 degrees, but i recently upgraaded to an F-class bipod so i dont need this any more. This is not a combo with the typical sling-swivel mount, it is a custom installation by Larue that removes some weight and makes the whole setup a slimmer profile. The mount also tilts and swivels allowing you to get a good neutral preload.Info from Larue's website. The Atlas bipod offers many features that place it in a category of its own. Those features include legs that move independently and can be deployed in a 45 degree position either forwards or backwards, in the traditional 90 degree position, and facing directly to the front or back, locking securely into 5 positions through a 180 degree arc. It provides the shooter with 30 total degrees left to right Pan as well as 30 total degrees of Cant; making it easy to align your cross hairs on the target regardless of the terrain. Offering the strength and stability that shooters demand, the Atlas provides rock solid support while weighing less than 11 ounces.
