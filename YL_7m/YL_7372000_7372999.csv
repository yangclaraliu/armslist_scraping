Each design element was driven by the requirement to create the best shooting platform possible. Exceptional accuracy was one of the key principles during development, with effective engagement ranges of 1500 meters or more, depending on caliber and ammunition. Advanced engineering and uncompromising quality are evident in every facet of design. The Tactical 2 is a bolt action rifle featuring Blaser’s revolutionary straight-pull action. When the bolt is closed, the 360 degree radial collet expands into the locking groove in the barrel – the bolt head is auto-centering and self-headspacing. The straight pull action features no rotating parts and assures rapid reloading with minimum movement. Interchange calibers by replacing the barrel and bolt head, in under a minute, without special tools and no change in accuracy. Barrels are cold hammer forged, fluted and plasma-nitrided to provide maximum resistance against corrosion and abrasion. An M1913 Picatinny rail is fixed to the barrel, ensuring full compatibility with a wide range of optical sighting systems. The muzzle end is threaded for an optional muzzle brake. The receiver is machined from aircraft grade billet aluminum alloy and is the interface for the barrel, bolt assembly, trigger assembly and magazine. A recoil lug of hardened steel is integrated into the receiver. The entire unit is fixed to the stock, eliminating temperature induced distortion. The outer surface is hard anodized.

To be honest with you I thought this was the Model 700VS (Varmint Synthetic), my friend thought it was the Remington Model 700 Sendero, so I called the Factory and after a long time on hold I spoke with two super nice Customer Service experts and I was told that the rifle with my serial number E6556253 was a Model 700 VSF Varmint Special made in 1995. I do know that it has a 26 inch Heavy barrel, a special trigger, and a super stock. The condition is very close to excellent, I do not see any problems, the bore is super, bright and shiny with deep rifling, the stock shows very minor usage marks but it is in great condition, my guess is this one has spent a lot of time in the Gun Safe. If you have ever wanted a 6mm Rem that will be a tack driver, this may be for you, It will ship with a set of high rings and Leupold two piece base, this one has a weight of 9.6 pounds."

It is one of those anomaly revolvers that occasionally show up that has an authentic martial “U.S.” stamped frame, but spent its entire life in the civilian market. It has all matching numbers and is in good physical shape with a few timing mechanical issues that I am sure can be fixed. No Reserve and Free shipping! Please read on. The mystery as to how “U.S.” marked Cavalry revolver frames ended up on “always” civilian revolvers may have been solved, but to my knowledge, there are still only educated opinions as to its actual genesis. This issue is covered by Graham, Kopec, and Moore in chapter 1 of their classic book, A Study of the Colt Single Action Revolver (1976) where two possibilities are proffered. One possibility is that the ordinance inspector at the time (Ainsworth) set aside frames which were already stamped “U.S.” by Colt that did not pass military specification, but were otherwise serviceable, for later use by Colt on civilian models, and the other possibility is that an urgent request for civilian revolvers was honored by Colt which took priority over the military contract and required the use of “U.S.” stamped frames immediately available for assembly. There is evidence that both of these actions actually did take place. Please keep in mind that we are only referring to revolvers that never saw life in the military before entering the civilian market and not revolvers, such as “buy backs”, that were resold as civilian revolvers after a good life in the military (they also will have a “U.S.” stamped frame), and we are certainly not talking about revolvers with forged stamps. This one is genuine! One other possibility is that this revolver is a very early “overrun”, although it does not have the usual ordinance sub-inspector markings that most overruns will have. In his book, Cavalry and Artillery Revolvers, A Continuing Story (1994), Kopec states that early overruns (i.e. pre-1875) will not have any sub-inspector markings. So, this just might be a very rare, early military overrun. Who really knows? In any case, this revolver has quite a story to tell and will make a great addition to any Colt SAA collection! This revolver comes with both a Colt and Kopec letter. I will state though, although I have nothing but respect for the honored Kopec, his letter offers little but added confusion as to the revolver’s actual history. In the letter, Mr. Kopec seemingly contradicts his own research (as stated above) when he states that this revolver “cannot” be an overrun because it does not have the Ainsworth “A” anywhere on it, but yet he is the one that stated in his book that pre-1875 overruns (which this would be) will not have the markings. He also provides a reason for the “U.S.” marking that is little more than circular mumbo-jumbo (sorry, I really do not mean to be disrespectful). The Kopek letter does provide a good rundown of the revolvers shortcomings which I list below: • The ejector tube is a second-style replacement and the ejector head is the later “oval” style. • The base-pin screw is an oversized replacement. • The barrel has been shortened from 7 ½ inches to 4 ¾ inches with the front sight repositioned a half-inch from the muzzle. • The grips are modern manufactured replacement (no timeframe given…they look pretty old). • The mainspring has been lightened with a deeply cut groove. • A tiny slot has been cut into the base of the trigger guard strap in an effort to possibly remove a frozen mainspring screw. And…the timing is off, only three clicks and the cylinder can moved independently. It’s old, not perfect!! One last thing, Kopec makes an entirely unsupported comment in his letter that this revolver may have “served its useful life in Mexico”. This revolver was shipped to New York City on October 7, 1874 (Incidentally, there is a picture of a revolver from this very same shipment in Graham, Kopec, and Moore (1974), p.13). So how did it end up in Mexico? No connection or explanation given by Kopec. Hmmmm, probably not Amigo."

This gun was very well taken care of and remains in high condition and all three bores are bright and shiny with only a hint of pitting. The engraving on this Rifle alone would cost more than my asking price in today's market so this is a very good deal. I have many pictures of this fine piece so please feel free to ask for more photos. Email, call, or text 814-883-2007"

It comes with two CSSPECS 10 round steel magazines and four 5 round standard Vepr mags. In addition, when I bought this rifle I was proactive and bought 2 extra extractors just to have on hand that will go with the Vepr. The CSSPECS magazines are high quality and not cheap, check them out. This carbine is a thunder stick.The Vepr is the Gold standard of AK's and if your looking at this, you probably already know this. Worth noting, the Vepr are no longer imported as they fall under the Kalashnikov umbrella hence Russian sanctions. This means what is on US soil are the only Vepr's available. I also have a bunch of crate ammo available also. $300 for an unopened and banded crate.$1150 OBRO for just the VeprI am NOT interested in trades.Call or text Doug REDACTED"

Pistol is in very good shape and has about 500 rounds through it. It is a BE date code which means it was made in 2014, and as such this means it does not have the maritime finish on it the older models had. Because of this these guns tend to get finish chipping on their barrel hoods (see photo). This is not a defect or damage, it just happens with these guns and it is the paint chipping off the barrel hood exposing the HK hostile environment finish beneath. This gun has been fired both suppressed and unsuppressed and worked flawlessly with zero malfunctions.Pistol comes in original lockable hard case serial numbered to the gun (as well as the original HK manual, fired test casing, HK logo lock and tool), 2 original 12 round HK German magazines, 16x1RH HK thread protector, GG&G Rail adapter and extra barrel O Rings. If the buyer wants it I can include an AAC TiRant 45 16x1RH suppressor piston for an extra $30. This gun was designed to be suppressed but its odd 16x1RH metric thread pattern means only a few suppressors will work with it, and fining a piston can be difficult.These pistols retail for $1800 to $2000 new. Asking $1300 FIRM cash and carry in Chesterfield MO. Not interested in trades, will not ship. If you can see the listing, then it is still for sale. Thanks for looking!"
