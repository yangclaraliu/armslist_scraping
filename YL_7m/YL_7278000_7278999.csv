99,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7278099,For Sale:  .75 caliber German wheel-lock Hunting rifle,"Tucson, Tucson, Arizona","$ 1,150","Listed On: Saturday, September 2, 2017",Antique,Dan Wesson                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is a pretty nice example of what is known as a ""Muller rifle"" which is apparently a sub-dvision of the genre known as German ""Jaeger rifles"". I've done a bit of research in books and on the net and find that this rifle displays several traits which are common to rifles of the Brandenburg region. It dates to the later decades of the era of wheel-locks (1500-1650) It was produced during the time when cheaper and more user-friendly flint-locks were available but the wheel-lock was considered to have superior ignition than flint-locks; flint-locks having about a 20% failure rate to ignite at the first attempt. The nature and function of the wheel-lock mechanism basically almost insured ignition when the action was set and triggered.The precise manufacturer is unknown. Possibly this model was produced in some numbers rather than being a custom made or unique piece. The butt-plate has an inscribed ""No. 38"". Is that a serial number or a rack number? I don't know. There are no other markings visible anywhere else on the outside of the gun. I have not; nor do I intend to dismantle the barrel from the stock. Underneath the barrel there could be a world of info or there could be none at all. I've no idea.The metal is in extremely nice condition with the vas majority of it's surface being polished steel. Very little rust or pitting. The arm folds back over the wheel aperture, the trigger sets properly and the small spring operated door which opens the lock aperture functions correctly. I have not wound the lock and attempted to trigger it. Not intending to shoot the piece, I was told that with ancient mechanical devises such as this; it's best not to tempt fate and ""screw"" with it unless you intend to shoot it.The stock is fairly ornate but lacks the intricate carving and brass, bone or precious metal inlays. I believe it is walnut and remains in sound condition overall. There are a couple of cracks as can be seen in the photos. These could have been repaired at some point as they do not cause any wiggle. The stock appears solid and firm. The patch compartment seals by a carved and dove-tailed wooden slab that closes with a spring latch. All functions correctly and a tight seal is produced when the block is set into the stock and clicked shut.The bore of the weapon is a massive .75 inch caliber and you can see the fascinating method of rifling the bore in an era which pre-dates our American revolution by two centuries. Just looking at this fascinating weapon in this condition; it is difficult to imagine that it was being used to hunt large game in Europe's forests a hundred years before George Washington was even born.Here are some statistics:Overall length 40.25 inchesBarrel length 28.25 inches (including the tang)Ram rod length 26.175 inches (rod protrudes from the barrel by .20 inches when put down the bore)Caliber .75 inchesOverall weight about 8 poundsThis rifle came from an answer to an advertisement for buying old guns and Military items. The man who had it related how his father had brought it home from WW2 in 1946."

I haven't had a chance to fire it yet but the previous owner mentioned that it ran flawlessly. The front sight is canted which is common for these rifles (and AKs in general).  Again, the previous owner stated that he was able to zero it and easily hit 12"" plates (firing offhand) at 100 yards. I thought about having a local gunsmith straighten it but I'm leaning towards selling it since I don't really need it. Mostly looking to sell but I'd consider trades / partial trades plus cash.Buyer must have an NJ FID card and matching driver's license. All proper NJ paperwork will be completed as well.Please feel free to email me regarding any questions or requests for additional pics."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

I never got around to taking her out, so my loss is your gain, and there's none better if you're in the market for a lever-action 45 70. In perfect condition, unfired, includes bore-store velcro rifle pouch & additional carrying bag for extra protection. Not your average lever action, and built  Henry tough, I refer to her as the ""engine block punch.""

With an incredible attention to detail, Springfield Armory® created what’s become one of the most popular polymer pistols on the market. The angle and depth of each contour in the XDM grip has been calculated for maximized control and usability, and the new trigger has the shortest travel of any polymer pistol currently available along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. Your total XD(M)® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. The rugged Multi-Use Carrying Case is as durable as the XD(M)® it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M)® pistols. Springfield XDM Features Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.  (M)ould-Tru Backstraps: With the interchangeable backstraps, Springfield has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit. (M)ulti-Adjust Rail System™: A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter’s hand position. (M)elonite®: Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. (M)atch Grade Barrel: Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

The M2 11038 comes with a matte black pistol grip stock and ghost ring sights.
The Benelli M2 Tactical, like all Benelli semiautomatic shotguns is Inertia Driven, which uses recoil energy to cycle the action. This eliminates all the problems associated with gas-operated systems, such as the necessity of frequent cleaning and the tendency gas-operated systems have for malfunctioning during adverse weather conditions. The M2 Tactical fires all 1 oz. or heavier 2¾"" and 3"" loads.
The Benelli M2 Tactical features a fully adjustable ghost-ring aperture rear sight and military-style fixed-blade front sight. In addition the M2 Tactical comes with either a matte black synthetic stock with tactical pistol grip, or with a ComforTech stock that reduces felt recoil by as much as 48%.

The Halo V Automatic from Microtech is the class of the OTF world and has one of the strongest firing blades we've ever seen. The blade is a whopping 4.6"" tactical awesomeness and is available in a variety of shapes and configurations. The handle is over 6"" in length so it's large enough for any sized hands, yet slim enough to carry with relative ease. The push button fires the blade out lightning fast and it also unlocks the blade so that when you pull the tab at the butt end of the knife, the blade retracts easily into the handle to fire again. It might be a little large to EDC for some but this knife is definitely a head turner and something you will hardly ever stop playing with. Comes complete with a Kydex sheath with Tek-Lok adapter so it can be carried at any angle you see fit on a belt. This is an absolutely amazing knife, one that really gives you an insight into how nice Microtech offerings are.FeaturesAutomatic Opening OTF designAction: Single Action - Auto Fire Pull tab incorporated into the back of the handle to retract bladeNo pocket clipTamper-resistant screwsLarge actuating button to accommodate glovesIncludes Kydex sheath with Tek-Lok adapterSpecificationsBlade Length: 4.6""Closed Length: 6.15""Overall Length: 10.75""Blade Style: Tanto, Satin Finish, Single Edge, Plain EdgeHandle Material: 6061-T6 Aluminum Mil-Spec Hard Coat AnodizedTrigger: 303 Stainless SteelSheath: Kydex with Tek-Lok AttachmentWeight: 5.2 oz.
