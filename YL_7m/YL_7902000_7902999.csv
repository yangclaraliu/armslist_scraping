Includes two 15-round magazines.
Used, good condition.     
The Beretta 92 FS semi-automatic pistol operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, leading to faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. The chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and ease of cleaning, and the deeply-recessed combat muzzle crown protects the rifling. The open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows one cartridge at a time to be loaded should the magazine be lost or damaged. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table or door. Beretta's exclusive Bruniton non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear-resistant finish, and the reversible magazine release is positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. The 92 FS pistol is the most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history, and this model is made in Italy.

The Winchester XPR rifle is a step forward in design and manufacturing, bringing you a high-performance hunting rifle at an extremely affordable price from a name you know and trust. Pairing the performance of the XPR with Kuiu's Vias camouflage pattern is like arming a tiger with teeth, claws, and stripes. The macro pattern of Vias functions like the camouflage of the tiger and other predators, which rely on high contrast patterning to break up their outline and disguise movement. It doesn't hurt to mention that Vias looks pretty good on a rifle stock."

The PPQ M2 has a reversible mag release button and an ambidextrous slide stop. The ‘Quick Defense’ trigger works in conjunction with a fully pre-loaded striker assembly. The trigger pull of 5.6 lbs remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. The PPQ M2 has two drop safeties and a firing pin block for safe carry. Because the firearm is in a constant cocked state, the striker does not protrude from the back of the slide. The polymer frame has interchangeable backstraps and an integral Picatinny Mil-Spec rail. It has low profile, 3-dot sights with a windage adjustable rear. The PPQ M2 has Tenifer-coated slide and 4.6″ threaded barrel.

The SLiM Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. Its long, 15 rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Combined with a mid-length gas system allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16 Government profile barrel and a designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip."

The gun has never been in the field and has been shot maybe 20 times to sight in and practice. Decided to go a different route for whitetails. Included is a Nikon prostaff shotgun hunt 2-7x32 BDC scope, with mounts. Also a Claw sling, and neoprene cheek riser. This will also include about 45 rounds of expensive saboted slugs, most of which is Hornady but there are some Remington copper solids in there too. Gun comes with box and all applicable paperwork. Truely and unbelievable semi-auto slug gun. The action is the smoothest I've ever felt. It's a pretty mind blowing gun, I just decided to switch back to a 7mm rifle because I'm better with it. If you price check me on all of this stuff, you'll see that this is a really good deal.

The last three times I tried selling this the buyer backed out. So hopefully I canprovide information to prevent this crap.1. Rock Island 10mm 1911s are built better than colt delta elites when it comes to handling high power loads. This is because of the recoil spring and the  bull barrel. Your average colta delta elite will need parts change out after 500 rounds of hot real 10mm ammo. A rock island 10mm can literally go 1k plus  rounds and still need no new parts, and no effect on the barrel.2. The two boxes of ammo I am including have unparalleled stopping power. Please check out the wound cavity in this video, the viewer can move his    fist though it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1UBjT4nSzA3. I'm not going to meet in a parking lot,  field, or in the woods. Meet me in my apartment. I'm not a criminal. If I was, I'm not so stupid to rob someone after having an email trace and on arms list. In addition, odds are you are a concealed carrier and I don't want to get shot or go to jail because I'm not a criminal. You can conceal carry when you pick  up the weapon, just take your shoes off so you don't ruin the floor. I don' t want my wife kicking my ass.4. Yes, I'm black, contrary to youtube videos, and world star hip hop shit, I speak proper english and I'm an American first. I don't hate you because you    are white, and i could give a shit as long as the content of your character has integrity. I'm a conservative even though I don't trust any politician.6. This weapon was only fired 20 times. It needs at least 500 rounds of fmj to be broken in. you don't need to use the super hot stuff to break it in.7. You need to have no criminal record, and have a ID and sign a bill of sale/trade. So incase you sell the gun or do something illegal I can show the    authorities that it not my gun anymore.8. I work all the time so I will only be able to answer email once a day, this doesn't mean i'm ignoring you. Just means I prefer not to spend my free time   checking email and using facebook. I will do my best to respond to everyone, if I can't its nothing personal."
