I am selling a 300 Blackout rifle that I don't use. I have run a total of 20 rounds through it. It is very accurate and cycles perfectly. I zeroed it to 100 yards in 6 shots, fired 3 more to confirm, fired a few for fun and had 6 one-shot hog kills. I cleaned it and put it back in the gun cabinet where it has been ever since. It still looks brand new. No scratches or anything. The only reason I don't use it is that I injured myself and can't hunt anymore. I don't care much for range shooting for anything more than zeroing a rifle. It's a Radical Firearms 16"" upper, Anderson Mfg Lower, Spike's Tactical Lower Parts Kit incl. Spike's Battle Trigger. It comes with a standard charging handle, full-auto Bolt Carrier Group and a Red / Green Reflex sight with 4 reticles. I will give you the allen wrenches so you can zero it for the ammo you prefer to shoot. It also comes with 2 300 Blackout-specific (not 5.56mm) magazines and a sling. I added 2 more rails on the left side and bottom. Unlike most of the other rifles I see advertised in the same price range, this one's ready to hunt with as soon as you pick it up. Well, you'll need ammo.."

I also have an extra beavertail backstrap that has matching stippling with the frame. Some very minor slide wear towards the front of the slide, but nothing major and hardly noticeable. Cerakote is still pretty new, as it didn't go all the way into battery when I first had the cerakote done. It still needs that breaking in period so the excess cerakote inside the slide burns off. Since I wanted to sell it, I didn't want to put additional rounds through it, as I wanted to keep the round count low for the next purchaser. It is a real tac driver.*****Newly Included: 5 x Glock 19 OEM Magazines (3 x have +2 Aluminum baseplates by Tactical Edge, and a G-code RTI OSH Holster in Multicam.I can part with just the Glock without the holsters for $875.

I brought 2 higher end Springfields, this gun and a Ruger 1911 as well. I told him to pick up a few boxes of brass ball. He mistakenly picked up steel case. None of the guns would shoot the steel reliably, except for this one. This reminds me of the GI 1911's in that they are loosely fitted and function well regardless of the ammo or situation.
