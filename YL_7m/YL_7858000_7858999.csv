I put this together with the thought of competing in some VPRC long range matches, but I just don't have the time. I've had it out once and put about 40 rounds through it. It was ~.5 MOA with both 147 and 120 gr Hornady ELD Match. It is 12.4lbs with 5 in the mag. The parts list is as follows:
Savage 10T SR 6.5 Creedmoor 26""
KRG 180 Alpha Savage SA
Primary Arms 4-14X Tactical Scope with Front Focal Plane PA4-14XFFP (mil/mil)

Warne Medium Rings
Kahntrol Hexmod CWES Brake Gen II
1 Magpul Pmag5 7.62AC Mag
I'll also include the original Savage accustock and all the extra KRG odds and ends that came with the chassis
I've put, well a lot, into this and I'm not going to get it back, but I'm looking for $1500. This should be a competitive budget setup for someone looking to get into long range shooting. Add your bipod and go. I also have 500 rounds of S&B 140gr that I'd let go with it for an extra $350.
I'm located in Richmond and willing to travel a reasonable distance if you would like to test fire it somewhere."

The M58F: Tumbled Finish - These cracker sized signal salute cannons are milled from solid 416 stainless steel and are capable of handling a compressed (tamped) 50 grain granular Pyrodex charge or a single easy to use Pyrodex 50 grain pellet. GOEX (Black Powder) Fg - FFFg or Cannon can be used as well. 
 
 
Traditional wadding or silicone can be used to seal and create back pressure. Best method with pellets is to insert the fuse, use the tamper to push a single pellet to the bottom of the bore - this will break the pellet and capture the fuse - then simply add a single layer of brown paper to separate the powder from the silicone (fill to the top of the bore) and let this cure overnight. 
 
Ease of use: Just insert a quality cannon fuse (Visco) fuse and add the charge to the top of the bore. the M58 holds a self-measured 50 grain charge. Use the supplied aluminum tapper to tamp the load and wadding.

VIDEO | M50F CRACKER | 50gr Pyrodex Pellet Load https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YtnbaxV_oo
 
The M58F: Tumbled Finish - These cracker sized signal salute cannons are milled from solid 416 stainless steel and are capable of handling a compressed (tamped) 50 grain granular Pyrodex charge or a single easy to use Pyrodex 50 grain pellet. GOEX (Black Powder) Fg - FFFg or Cannon can be used as well. 
 
Traditional wadding or silicone can be used to seal and create back pressure. Best method with pellets is to insert the fuse, use the tamper to push a single pellet to the bottom of the bore - this will break the pellet and capture the fuse - then simply add a single layer of brown paper to separate the powder from the silicone (fill to the top of the bore) and let this cure overnight. 
 
Ease of use: Just insert a quality cannon fuse (American Visco) and add the charge to the top of the bore. the M50 holds a self-measured 50 grain charge. Use the supplied aluminum tapper to tamp the load and wadding.

I lost interest and changed direction. The gun needs trigger work before firing. Needs new hammer and sear and probably both springs according to  a gunsmith who looked at it. All parts are still in original trigger assembly. All numbers match on all parts of the gun. All the blueing is gone on the gun. I was going to have it cerecoated. This would be a good project for someone who has a little more time and patience than me or would be good for someone needing parts. Not sure on date of manufacture or round count and again it’s a project gun not something to take straight to the range.

Double Automatic shotgun, introduced early in 1955, was designed by Val M. Browning, son of firearms inventor John M. Browning. Manufactured by Fabrique Nationale in Belgium, this gun is designated Double Automatic because it will hold only 2 shells and is self-loading (semi-automatic). Unlocking of the breech is accomplished by an inertia block housed in a tube in the stock. Rearward movement of the barrel in recoil is only about Vs"". All types of 2 3/4"" factory loads can be fired without adjustment. Initially the Double Automatic was offered in Standard model weighing 7 E. Wessel lbs. 11 oz. and a lighter Twelvette model weighing 6 lbs. 14 oz. The weight saving in the Twelvette model was obtained through use of an aluminium-alloy receiver. A new version with aluminium alloy receiver, designated Twentyweight, was first offered in 1956. Its name is derived from the fact that its nominal weight of only 6 lbs. with 26 1/2 "" plain barrel is comparable to that of the ordinary 20-ga. shotgun. Anodized aluminium receivers of the Twelvette and Twentyweight models can be had in several color combinations, and all models have decorative hand-engraved panels on sides of the receivers."
