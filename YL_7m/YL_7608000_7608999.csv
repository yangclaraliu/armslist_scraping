The gun has about 50-100 rounds through it—there is absolutely no visible wear on the gun and it has been thouroughly cleaned and lubed. I purchased the gun about a month ago from Buds, but I've decided to sell it as I just purchased another G19 that I think I'll be running a bit more. The gun is absolutely flawless and I personally think this coloration is absolutely amazing. The gun comes with everything that a Glock comes with, 3 mags and the different-sized backstraps. If you're interested in it, please feel free to text/call me at REDACTED. I think the price is extremely fair due to this being an almost brand new gun with absolutely no visible signs of wear, it's about what you can expect from the Glock factory without extra tax and shipping fees."

Leman 1830’s Indian Rifle,"Glen Allen, Richmond, Virginia",$ 0,"Listed On: Monday, February 5, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Henry E. Leman Indian Rifle - Fullstock. Manufacture date is believed to be mid-1830s. Features 1 1/16” x 30” long octagon barrel. .36 caliber. Full maple stock, double-trigger and brass furniture.I was given the Rifle by my uncle’s estate. The gun seems to be in quite good condition for being almost 190 years old. It is missing the ram rod.I had the gun looked at while in VA Beach by an antique gun expert. There does not appear to be any visible external markings on the gun, and he believed that they may be on the underside of the barrel. So without taking it apart there’s no way to confirm. In his opinion based on materials used and styling, he believed it to be a Leman production piece from the mid 1830’s. He valued it around $1,000. Since I have nothing to support it’s authenticity, I’m leaving it open to offers. It is an exceptional piece of history. I cannot make any claims as to whether it is safe to fire but it is solid. It might just be a great wallhanger. It is one of the heaviest rifles I’ve ever held. There are still percussion caps in the storage box in the cheek plate.My uncle has Cherokee heritage. Born in western VA. Not sure when he acquired the rifle. He would always talk about this old percussion gun he had but would never bring it out to show anyone. After his passing, we were going through his belongings and we found the rifle wrapped in a blanket. It was after his estate was settled that I acquired the piece. I’m not an antique gun person. Don’t really have a place to display it and it seems a shame to just keep it in my safe.Reasonable offers considered.Thanks for your interest."

He shot it at Front Sight 2 times, plus maybe a box or two at the range for well under 1000 rounds, probably under 500 total, but certainly under 1000. So very low round count. It has been ceracoted, graphite black, for a very durable finish, looks pretty nice next to a new factory finish gun.Comes with box, papers, 2 mags, factory glow sights, everything you would expect, plus a Blade Tech OWB holster. It shoots and feels like you would expect from an HK. I know everyone has their opinions, but most would all agree that HK is one of the best out there. They stand behind their guns with a lifetime guarentee, even for pre-owned. This is one of the most accurate 9mm handguns I have ever shot.But it is not what my dad wants. So I am open to trades, or cash. I would like to get at least $800 cash, or possible trade."
