People often want to know why a gun is being sold and I can answer this question.  I am selling this Glock 17, Generation 3 because I have two.  My other Glock 17, Generation 3 was customized and equipped with a Vortex Venom 3 MOA dot.  Consequently, I do not need this second Glock 17, Generation 3.  Maximum of 500 rounds have traveled down the stainless barrel and the revolver is in excellent working condition. 
 
 I have a full array of pictures which I will gladly share.  The price may be negotiable, but if you are not serious, do not bother with a ""lowball"" counteroffer.  I fully expect a reasonable offer and I reserve the right to reject any and all counteroffers.  I have a second magazine arriving today and that will be included in the listing.A couple of quick notes . . . 1.  All initial contact is made through the Armslist.  The description is in place to present the terms of the agreement.  As I have already stated, you can either accept the offer or make a counteroffer.  However, I have no intention of contact a potential buyer without either an accept or a counteroffer in place.2.  I am interested in a trade and I am considering ONLY two other handguns.  I will trade, dependent upon terms, for the following in order of preference:a. CZ P10 C which is also in 9mm.b.

The P320 9mm Compact with 2 15-round magazines and BCA OWB Holster for concealment days - as well as the Carry grip module with 4 17-round magazines, Red Hill Tactical Competition holster and Kytex mag carriers for range days. I purchased the firearm and all of the upgrades to have a concealment pistol during the week and a competition rig for the weekend. However, life happens and it is time for me to part ways with this amazing package. I have upgraded the sights and have kept it clean and lubed for its entire life. I am not sure how many rounds are through it, but I would guess several hundred. Meaning, this gun has barely been used. It really is a rockstar. It will knock down steel targets as fast as you can pull the trigger and make clover-leafs in paper all day long. It is currently set up in the ""Carry"" configuration but can be switched into the ""Compact"" configuration in seconds.Please see below all of the items and accessories included (as well as their retail prices). If you were to buy everything on this list it would cost $1,142.60 - plus the shipping, plus the wait times, plus the transfer fee, and plus finding the places that have everything in stock. But, this is a used gun and most of the items have been used (though it will be hard for you to tell), so I am offering it at a substantial savings. If you have any questions, need any further photos, or just want to chat about how awesome this package is, shoot me an email and let's talk.Sig Sauer P320 Nitron Compact 9mm Black w/ 2 15-round magazines = $580 (cash price from Bud's Gun Shop)Sig Sauer P320 Grip Module Assembly, Carry, Medium, 9mm = $45Sig Sauer 17-round magazine x4 = $140Dawson Precision Compact Charger Fixed Sight Set for Sig P320 - Black Rear & Fiber Optic Front = $80Dawson Precision Baseplate for Sig P320 - Extended +.300"" 9mm Black x4 (currently on the 17-round magazines) = $60Bravo Concealment BCA OWB Kydex Gun Holster for Sig P320 Black = $45Red Hill Tactical Competition Holster for Sig P320 Black = $36.75Kytex Mag Carrier for Sig P320 9mm Black x 3 = $56.85Grayguns Curved Practical Enhanced Leverage Trigger for the Sig P320 (not installed) = $99Of course, all NC laws will be followed.

Each pack contains 10 20-round cardboard boxes. $125 per 200-round sealed battlepack.Part of the value of the battlepacks is that they're sealed, protected against aging.

For this price you can certainly just open 'em up and shoot some for cheap, but since they're sealed, they're good items to put away for ""just in case"".I prefer a face-to-face deal for cash in the NW San Antonio / Helotes / Leon Springs area, but I'm willing to ship at buyer's expense though it would be pricey.

This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.     Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.     The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter’s hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.     A set of abbreviated “industry standard” mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines. Available in 9 mm, .40 S&W.   Specifications:  Caliber: 9X19mm Overall Length: 6.40"" Overall Height: 4.55"" Overall Width: 1.27"" Barrel Length: 3.26"" Sight Radius: 5.18"" Weight with Magazine: 24 oz Weight with Empty Magazine: 1.50 lb Magazine Capacity: 10 Rounds Single Action Trigger Pull: 4.50 lbs Double Action Trigger Pull: 11.47 lbs Sights: 3-Dot"
