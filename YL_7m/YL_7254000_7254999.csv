They are curved for front and back and have what is called the shooters cut. Which means the right side is cut for your arm to be able to manipulate a rifle without hindrance. Both of these plates also have the build up coat of bed liner from the factory which stops any fragments from the stopped bullets from ricocheting and hitting the person wearing it. I purchased these plates a few years ago and they just sat in the box.

Designed with safety in mind... the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAMMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAMMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty.DISCLAIMER: Crimson Trace Corporation© DB .380 specific laser mount is not designed for the DB9.
