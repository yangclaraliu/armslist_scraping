You have to feel it to believe it. Very light pull in single action, and very smooth in double action. Included with the sale will be 2 speed loaders with holster for speed loaders, 35 rounds of Magtech 158 grain semi-jacketed soft point, 25 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense 125 grain FTX, and 20 rounds of Fusion semi-jacketed softpoint ( I believe they are 158 grain, but I am not positive), and pistol case. The SP101 is historically a very solid, and well built revolver. I've heard some say they are built like a brick **** house. This one is no exception.Asking $600 which I feel is very fair considering it comes with speed loaders and plenty of defense ammunition, however I will entertain REASONABLE offers. I wouldn't waste your time, so please dont waste mine.Only reason for the sale is I have a new little addition to the family and could use the money in the savings account.Bill of sale and personal information WILL be exchanged at time of sale, if you have a problem with this, please do not contact me.

Aero Precision AR15 M4E1 Stripped Lower Reciever - Black	
The M4E1 Lower Receiver delivers billet aesthetics in a forged package. This custom designed enhanced forging is machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and compatible with all mil-spec AR15 parts. Aside from the visual upgrades this custom engineered design provides that challenge much more expensive billet options, we have added several functional features to the lower receiver to simplify the assembly process for the at home builder.

M4E1 Lower Receiver Improvements:
Threaded Bolt Catch Roll Pin - Allows for simple installation of the bolt catch and virtually eliminates the chance to damage the finish during installation (pin included). 1/16"" Hex Key required for assembly.
Integrated Trigger Guard - Eliminates the possibility of breaking the trigger guard tabs by integrating the trigger guard into the lower, creating a stronger more rigid platform to build upon.
Upper Tension Screw - Allows users to fine tune the fit of the upper and lower receiver using a nylon tipped tensioning set screw inserted in the grip tang of the lower receiver. This provides a tight fit with any standard AR15 upper receiver.
Threaded Takedown Pin Detent Recess - Allows user to easily install the Takedown Pin detent and spring with the use of a 4-40 set screw (no more launching detents across the room).
Increased Magwell Flare - Increased the flare of the magwell to aid in quick and efficient magazine changes.

First of all it really really works.  It's like shooting a .22 now.  But the big boom it growls out with each shot seems to get a few stares.  Like I said, this gun is blast to shoot and by far the most fun gun to run.  I comes with both the original stainless steel (silver color) that it came with and the original ranch model stock.  The wood stock is in excellent condition.  If shipping is necessary, I can only ship directly to an FFL dealer and buyer pays shipping.   I accept cash, USPS money order or a cashier's check.Jeff"

Its superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and astonishing capacity combine to put more into a concealable pistol than you will find anywhere else.
The XD® 3″ Sub-Compact has all the same features found in the standard XD® line, but in a smaller package. The barrel is 3” and the frame is a short, compact size that will let the pistol nearly disappear when you carry it. Like other XD® pistols, the XD® 3” Sub-Compact gives you great versatility when it’s used with X-Tension™ magazines. Enjoy 10+1 rounds of 9mm, (9+1 of .40SW) with standard flush-fitting magazines. Or throw in an X-Tension™ magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 16+1 rounds of 9mm (12+1 of .40SW.) You’ll find everything on the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD®.
If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for an XD® 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range.
