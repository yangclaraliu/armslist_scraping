So, looking to sell this one to fund either a Walther or future purchases.Without taking the gunsmithing labor into account, this is a $1,000 gun. But, it's missing a couple of palm swells (~$10 each to replace) and mounting plates (they're $3 each directly from S&W). Plus, it has been lightly used (200 rounds previous owner, none from me).So let's call it $750 for the whole package. The only trade I am like to consider is a Walther Q5 Match, since that's what this will go to fund, and *maybe* a Walther PPQ 5"" + cash, or PPQ M2 in .45 + cash. But hey, if you want to make me an offer I can't refuse, I'll listen. :) More photos available for serious inquiries.Be over 21 and legally allowed to own a pistol. Bill of Sale required. CHL preferred. LE/Active duty military discount of 10%.Thanks for looking!"

528,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7822528,For Sale:  Thordsen Customs Pistol Cheek Rest kit,"Vacaville, Sacramento, California",$ 40,"Listed On: Saturday, January 13, 2018",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Used in good conditionFor many years AR and AK pistols (among others) were considered to be a novelty by firearms enthusiasts. The weight of the platform and the power of the .223 and 7.62x39 rounds made them impractical to use and achieve repeatable accuracy. That all changed in 2013 with the arrival of several innovative products designed to improve stability and ergonomics. With these simple improvements the platform quickly went mainstream. Among these products is the Thordsen Customs AR/AK Pistol Cheek Rest Kit.This kit is a Hybrid design utilizing either our Standard or Enhanced Buffer Tube Cover kits and the Mission First Tactical EVOLV Battle Stock Attachment. The MFT EVOLV, and Buffer Tube Cover, are now pre-assembled in house, and mounted directly to the buffer tube using a specially designed steel bracket and adapter kit. The result is a rock solid, ergonomic cheek weld that provides stability for accurate, repeatable shooting, and a proper sight line for your favorite optics or sights.7 5/8"" OAL (TC Keyed buffer tube)Mounts directly to any pistol, or pistol adapter, that accepts an AR-15 buffer tube/receiver extension.

It DOES NOT reclassify an AR/AK type ""Pistol"" as a ""short barreled rifle"" under definitions established by the National Firearms Act of 1934 or the Gun Control Act of 1968. However, BATFE does specifically warn that any misuse of, or modification to, this configuration that may cause a firearm to be used outside of its design parameters, such as being shoulder fired, may change its classification and may make a firearm subject to NFA and GCA regulations and/or illegal to possess.
