It is the largest one we have had yet. We want to wish you a Merry Christmas with a Christmas Sale from us and to also thank you for your support and business in the short time we have been open. Around 90% of the firearms are on sale along with all our holsters and many other accessories. These are our Rock Bottom Prices with No Room for negotiating at all on these. Many of these prices are too low to advertise, but give us a call or come by and we will be happy to let you know what we can sell it to you for. These prices are good from 12/11/17 to 12/15/17 in the store and what pistols we bring with us at the C&E Gun show this weekend 12/16/17 and 12/17/18. Many of the new pistols and a few of the used ones we will be able to offer Rain checks and take an order with 15% down if we have sold out of them, but many of them we can't replace or can't replace for the price, so they will be while supplies last. Please take your time to look at the list or come by as it is a very large sale. If a gun says massive sale and doesnâ€™t have a price, it is too low to advertise. However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season. Again, thank you so much for your friendship, your business, and Merry Christmas. Remember, Jesus is the reason for the season and don't forget to give praise to our Lord and Savior. God Bless.

The slide is further accented by polished cocking serrations and a Flat Top which enhances the two-tone aspect of this pistol. The slide is topped off with adjustable combat night sights while the frame is outfitted with a magwell for fast, smooth reloads. The all stainless steel frame and slide of the STX are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance. The frame features 25-line per inch checkering on the front strap – while the mainspring housing has 20-line per inch checkering – and both the frame and slide are de-horned for comfortable full-size carry. Like all SIG SAUER products the 1911 STX pistol contains only premium internal parts including a match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger.

What not everyone knows, however, is that the company at one point tried to move into the actual firearms market and in the 1950s came up with a 22-rimfire pistol that was well received for what it was: the Knocabout. This example proudly made in Racine Wisconsin as printed on pistol .Gun in very good condition. It fires 22 SLLR rimfire, single shot with a safety on side. Looking more like a Flash Gordon Ray gun than a 22 ! These Pistols were built around 1951-1952.

I'm a father to a young son, and I want to be able to protect him, but I also need to be budget conscious. 
I am hoping there is someone out there that has something 9mm, .40, .45 or even .38 that is in great working condition, that they would be able to part with.Please reach out if you have anything of the like. If this doesn't work, I am not totally above purchasing a Hi-Point... but I'd like not to."

This comes with the Leupold Mark 4 4.5-14x50mm LR/T scope and Barrett scope rings as shown. I'll also include 30 rounds of American Eagle XM33C 660 grain FMJ and 10 rounds of Hornady A-MAX 750 grain, all in their original boxes as shown. Ammo will ship separately and the buyer is responsible for both ground shipping charges. Also included will be all the original paperwork for the rifle and the Leupold. I'll include the box for the scope if you want it. The only issues I know with the rifle is that the magazine has a minor scuff mark on right side of the box near the rear. The original Pelican case is included as well. It does have scratches and a few minor cuts on it"

Glock acknowledged that sentiment with the development of the Glock 21. Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the Glock 21 Gen4 delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 Auto round with 10 or 13 round magazine capacity. The modular backstrap design lets the user adapt the grip to hand size, and the frame surface exhibits the scientifically-designed Gen4 rough textured technology. This model features a dual-recoil spring assembly that substantially increases the life of the system, and the enlarged reversible magazine catch easily accommodates left- or right-handed operators. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment. The Gen4 system is the perfect complement to this iconic .45 caliber cartridge: Email: famiarmss@gmail.com TEXT: (903) 354-4681"

I have for sale a Sig Sauer P227 45 acp in excellent condition. The pistol comes with the hard-shell case, 2 10-round magazines, and has the Sig Night sights, which are new from this year because I bought the pistol earlier this year, so lots of life left in them. There  are no scratches or marks on the pistol, as it has only had approximately 200 rounds fired through it, flawless function. There is hardly any wear on the barrel. The gun will come with 2 triggers--the trigger that is currently installed is the Sig Standard trigger which I had installed by a professional gunsmith at my local gun shop. One of the biggest complaints about the Sig series of handguns that I've seen so far is that the short reach trigger that many of the guns come with nowadays pinch the skin of your trigger finger upon firing and break way too far back for people of medium- to large- sized hands. The standard trigger eliminates those issues. However, I also have the short reach trigger that came installed on the gun, so you will receive that as well if you want to put it back in. The trigger cost me $30 additional dollars to buy and $30 to have installed, so you're getting an extra $60 of value over a new gun. Cash only for the pistol, please, I am not interested in any trades at this time. You must have a CPL/PP and a valid driver's license for me to sell you the pistol, all local, state, and federal laws apply. NO out of state sales, I will not reply to messages requesting out of state transactions. Willing to travel reasonable distances, just ask. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask! Thanks"

A late war production Long Branch, the gun was likely delivered too late for British service during the war, and presumably remained untouched in stores until selected for conversion to the NATO standard 7.62 cartridge in 1965. At the time it was hoped to convert most of the remaining No.4 rifles to the new standard chambering for emergency use, but results from the L8 programme were uninspiring and the project was shelved after only a few thousand rifles were produced at the RSAF. At the same time, an unknown quantity were converted at the unit level by armourers using kits manufactured by Sterling in Dagenham. This weapon, with Broad Arrow-mraked components and fitted with a desirable Parker-Hale PH4 adjustable sight, was likely slated for interservice competition shooting. Apparently having a very brief service life following conversion, the weapon lacks post-1968 proof marks, although it does feature the standard 'ENGLAND' export mark on the receiver ring. Undoubtedly a superior shooter, L8's are rarely seen on the collector's market, and this weapon, if left in its presesnt condition, represents a sound investment for the dedicated Enfield enthusiast.

A late war production Long Branch, the gun was likely delivered too late for British service during the war, and presumably remained untouched in stores until selected for conversion to the NATO standard 7.62 cartridge in 1965. At the time it was hoped to convert most of the remaining No.4 rifles to the new standard chambering for emergency use, but results from the L8 programme were uninspiring and the project was shelved after only a few thousand rifles were produced at the RSAF. At the same time, an unknown quantity were converted at the unit level by armourers using kits manufactured by Sterling in Dagenham. This weapon, with Broad Arrow-mraked components and fitted with a desirable Parker-Hale PH4 adjustable sight, was likely slated for interservice competition shooting. Apparently having a very brief service life following conversion, the weapon lacks post-1968 proof marks, although it does feature the standard 'ENGLAND' export mark on the receiver ring. Undoubtedly a superior shooter, L8's are rarely seen on the collector's market, and this weapon, if left in its presesnt condition, represents a sound investment for the dedicated Enfield enthusiast.
