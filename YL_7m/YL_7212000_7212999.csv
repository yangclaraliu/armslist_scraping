It is in good shape for its age. I have shot the rifle and it is a very good shooter. It is missing the sight elevator but no matter it doesn't need it because it is zeroed for 25 yards. If you are worried they are only 3 dollars online at Numrich gun parts. Local sale only. Thanks.

It is a Titleist 917 D3 driver. It is right handed, 10.5 degree, stiff shaft. The shaft is an Aldila Rogue Max 65-S. According to my boss, it was used once or twice. I do not golf, therefore I do not know much about this. Any questions, please feel free to ask, but it might take a little longer to get a response. I would then, have to ask my boss. This driver was purchased for $500 in March 2017. I will trade for a 22 or 9mm pistol, and then just pay my boss the cash that he wants. See below for possible trade items. These are off the top of my head, but there may be others that I'd be interested in. Let me know what you have. I do have several more pictures,  but it's only allowing me to upload one."

It was originally manufactured by J.P. Sauer & Sohn Suhl in 1940. The receiver and stock numbers match, the rest of the numbers do not. The bolt has been electropencilled to match the receiver which is typical of Russian capture guns. It also has the usual Russian ""X"" on the receiver. The bore has no pitting with strong, shiny lands and grooves. It does come with a sling, I have been unable to find any markings on the sling. There is no bayonet or cleaning rod with the rifle. Some of the Nazi Eagles have been peened. Unfortunately, the photos I took exceed the 4 MB limit that Armslist allows. If you would like more photos please send me an email and I will forward them to you. The rifle is import marked. This rifle is C&R eligible. I will ship at buyer's expense.

The Glock 19 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that has found worldwide acclaim with security services both private and public. The modular backstrap design lets the user adapt the grip to hand size, and the frame surface exhibits the scientifically-designed Gen4 rough textured technology. This model features a dual-recoil spring assembly that substantially increases the life of the system, and the enlarged reversible magazine catch easily accommodates left- or right-handed operators. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment. This model has fixed sights and a 15-round capacity."
