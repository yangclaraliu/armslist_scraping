We can go to an MSP barracks or a local FFL, preferably in the Rockville area if you are local to there.I might be inclined to ship to ship to your FFL but you need to pay shipping and I need to process payment first before sending it out. I will probably ship it out UPS. The UPS center I use requires a copy of the receiving FFL's license so I will need that too. Thanks for looking and hope to do business with you."

These are not exactly rare but there are not a ton of them out there and in good shape (they are almost 80 years old!). The kit itself is complete and ready to be built into a post-sample or a semi-auto. The parts are in very good shape and have no pitting at all. This kit is NON-MATCHING, as almost all the kits are these days. The barrel is in pristine shape with crisp rifling, the bolt is in great shape with ZERO pitting or damage, the lower is in great shape (no pitting) and the bakelite is in awesome condition, but the stock is a little wobbly (very common with these guns). Basically all the ""wear and tear"" parts are in very good condition. I also have several magizines that are all Nazi German marked and period. I am asking $3,000 for the kit. I am open to trades for high end-hand guns (Desert Eagle, HK P7, Coonan .357, high end 1911's). I am NOT looking to ship or deal with anyone who is not local (hence me posting here as opposed to Gunbroker, Subguns or Sturmgewehr.com, etc.)If you are a serious buyer, please send me pictures of your trade item and what you are looking to get for them. I am being more than reasonable in terms of price (one kit just sold on GB for $2,700 with no barrel assembly or mags) so please be reasonable with your trade value. IF your gun sells for $1,000 brand new I am not going to value your ""used gun"" at $1,000. Thanks, Chris"

It's very smooth to shoot and fits the hand quite well for a double stack .45. I actually enjoy shooting this pistol more than my USP 45T. I have additional photos available upon request. It seems Armslist won't let me upload more than one high resolution photograph. $350 cash price is firm. These are not as plentiful as they once were.

This is a 1988 Taurus model 66, 4 inch barrel, 6 shot, 357 magnum revolver. This isn’t one of the crappy new ones they are producing. It is a hand cannon. The gun is chambered for 357, so it also shoots 38 special and 38 special +p without any problems. The gun is tight and operationally perfect. I literally picked it up on Friday, September 8th 2017 from the gunsmith where he applied a hot satin blue finish. And before he got it, it had just returned from Taurus were I had them replace all the internals that showed signs of wear, which was the firing pin. So the gun is good to go. It is missing the rear sight however as i just haven’t taken the time to get one for it. I highly encourage you to look it up. I will trade for another handgun only. I would prefer to trade it for a revolver that is smaller and is rated for continuous 38+p. But I will consider other trades as well. Just let me know what you have to offer."
