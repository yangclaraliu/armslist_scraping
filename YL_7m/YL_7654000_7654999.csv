The gun is in near perfect condition having only about 30 rounds fired through it, if that many. I'm only selling because I would like to buy my closest relatives a few gifts for the holidays. If not for that, I'd keep this wonderful arm for myself. I feel that I've priced it accordingly factoring in its condition, being sold with two magazines as most sellers of this particular firearm on Armslist only list one magazine for sale and why I'm selling it in the first place. The price is somewhat negotiable, however. I'm willing to travel about 100 miles or more to make a sale so if you're not close to the Kingsport area then don't feel dissuaded. I love to travel anyway.

Style: CompactCaliber:  9 mm
Springfield compact carry. A practical carry gun upon which you can bet your life.
Built with Springfield’s legendary reliability and workmanship!  Includes heavy plastic case from factory, TWO magazines, paper work it came with, etc.Condition:  EXCELLENT!
 
FEATURES:
Proven 3-dot sights. Fully Supported Ramp sights.  Front and rear sights are dovetailed into the steel of the slide.
 
Springfield’s famous comfortable ergonomics and grip angle.
TWO factory magazines: There is one a finger grip extension that holds 12 rounds. A second mag that holds 9 rounds makes the pistol smaller and is flush with frame.
In the accuracy department, the Springfield Sub-Compact is tremendous!  Many say better that Glock.
Safeties: Grip safety, the gun can only be fired when the hand firmly depresses the safety located at the rear of the handle.  Patented Ultra Safety Assurance trigger system, which guards against accidental discharge. The USA only allows the gun to be fired when direct rearward pressure is applied to the trigger, eliminating the possibility of an accidental discharge if the gun is dropped or bumped. The XD has a striker status indicator that protrudes from the rear of the steel slide when the striker mechanism is cocked. In addition, it has a loaded chamber indicator, which is a thin piece of metal that pops up when a round is in the chamber.
Picatinny rail for mounting a laser, light, and other accessories.
Dual spring and guide rod system - less torque is placed upon the guide rod and spring.
Weighing a little more than the Glock, the Springfield Sub-Compact manages recoil more confidently than the Glock, enabling accurate “follow-up” shots.

I'm certain this bundle will not fit into the smallest USPS flat rate box ($7.15 flat rate) , and I estimate it will fit into the medium size, more-cube-shaped box ($13.25 flat rate).

We at The Modern Patriot believe that it is not only the right of Americans, but also the duty of all able-bodied citizens to maintain the readiness to form a militia and defend this nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic as stated in our constitution. This personal readiness, an act in self-reliance and liberty, is a combination of equipment, training, and mindset. It is our goal to build a community where all three of these things can be improved in every citizen that chooses to do so.
 
A major component of this personal readiness is the possession and maintenance of a semi-automatic battle rifle chambered in a sufficiently powerful round that can be easily found and exchanged with other Patriots. For the American people and our military, this duty has traditionally been placed on Eugene Stoners now infamous design, the AR-15. The rifle is simply a tool, machined metal and components that lie peacefully until picked up by a determined user.
 
The Minuteman Can is a simple ammo can that contains the bare essentials to keep an AR-15 running in tough situations. It can be stashed almost anywhere-behind the truck seat, the top of the closet, in the barn-and remain ready for when you need it. It’s nothing fancy – some industry leading magazines and federal ammunition, a field repair kit in case your rifle breaks down, and a cleaning kit to keep your rifle ready for duty. When your brothers and sisters call on you to stand beside them in battle, be sure that you have the necessary equipment to watch their six. Please recommend this product to your friends and family members; it gets hairy real fast when you’re out on the battlefield alone!

Please use common sense when storing this ammo can. Store in the safest way that your situation dictates in the driest, coolest place possible. Please keep out of reach of children, crazed liberals, and government officials. We cannot guarantee the integrity of this can or the ammunition for any amount of time as storage methods and climates will vary greatly. It is recommended that if you are unsure about the shelf-life of this can in the conditions you chose, replace it periodically to be sure everything is ready if you ever really need it.  Would like to sell FTF in the Hammond area or Northshore Area.  Thanks for reading!

I got her still in cosmoline, fired 40 rounds after cleaning, cleaned her up and now she sits. Very accurate if you do your part. Very collectible, all original, not molested in any way.

We at The Modern Patriot believe that it is not only the right of Americans, but also the duty of all able-bodied citizens to maintain the readiness to form a militia and defend this nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic as stated in our constitution. This personal readiness, an act in self-reliance and liberty, is a combination of equipment, training, and mindset. It is our goal to build a community where all three of these things can be improved in every citizen that chooses to do so.
 
A major component of this personal readiness is the possession and maintenance of a semi-automatic battle rifle chambered in a sufficiently powerful round that can be easily found and exchanged with other Patriots. For the American people and our military, this duty has traditionally been placed on Eugene Stoners now infamous design, the AR-15. The rifle is simply a tool, machined metal and components that lie peacefully until picked up by a determined user.
 
The Minuteman Can is a simple ammo can that contains the bare essentials to keep an AR-15 running in tough situations. It can be stashed almost anywhere-behind the truck seat, the top of the closet, in the barn-and remain ready for when you need it. It’s nothing fancy – some industry leading magazines and federal ammunition, a field repair kit in case your rifle breaks down, and a cleaning kit to keep your rifle ready for duty. When your brothers and sisters call on you to stand beside them in battle, be sure that you have the necessary equipment to watch their six. Please recommend this product to your friends and family members; it gets hairy real fast when you’re out on the battlefield alone!

Please use common sense when storing this ammo can. Store in the safest way that your situation dictates in the driest, coolest place possible. Please keep out of reach of children, crazed liberals, and government officials. We cannot guarantee the integrity of this can or the ammunition for any amount of time as storage methods and climates will vary greatly. It is recommended that if you are unsure about the shelf-life of this can in the conditions you chose, replace it periodically to be sure everything is ready if you ever really need it. FTF to Hammond/Northshore area, cash only.
