It is a detachable clip fed (C) ,left handed rifle (L). Ser# is 102710. These were made between 1957-68. This one was made around 1960 by the low ser# and reasearch of known numbers I have found. So it is C&R eligible. NOTE: If you do research on these, you will find that most everyone removes the unique stock placed magazine latch. The previous owner moved the spring inside (still there) so you can't mistakenly drop the magazine. He chose to leave the escutcheon there and the button, which are often missing on these guns. It functions excellent this way and works like any regular internal magazine rifle. Anyway, the stock, metal barrel and bore are in great shape. The bolt is factory numbered to the rifle. The action is smooth. The stock has beautiful grain and nice checkering. Factory drilled and tapped for a scope. Has very nice iron sights though. Flip down buckhorn rear and bead type front. All in all a great looking left handed rifle. $295 plus actual USPS shipping to an 03 FFL or better. I must collect 6% sales tax if sold in Vermont. TERMS:1. I will accept a USPS Money Order or Paypal as a discreet gift.2. AK and HI whatever extra the post office charges3. CA shipping OK if it's on the list!!! Buyer's responsibility to check!

A durable synthetic stock resists weather and rough use and features removable spacers in the butt of the stock to adjust length of pull. The Pro Hunterâ€™s barrel is available in a 23.6â€ or 20â€ barrel Stainless Steel version or Mountain version with 20â€ barrel. The rifle is chambered in a choice of 7mm-08 Remington, .308 Winchester, .270 Winchester, .30-06 Springfield, .300 Winchester Magnum (available only in a 25.6â€ barrel variant). As in other high-performance long-guns offered by Steyr, the Mannlicher Pro Hunter features the Safe Bolt System (SBS), a unique 2+1 safety function that offers 3 settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The fire mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot; the first level of safe mode disables the firing mechanism and the second level of safe serves to lock the bolt down against the stock and also features a press-to-release tab that locks the SBS switch in the safe position. Another feature is the 2-stage magazine securing mechanism that uses a first stage that locks the magazine in but allows the bolt to be operated while not engaging and chambering the rounds in the magazine, thereby providing the operator with the option of loading individual rounds by hand while maintaining a full magazine at the ready. One more tap to the bottom of the magazine then seats it in the second stage, which is ready for auto-loading.*****SORRY NO TRADES*****Learn more at SteyrArms.com."

I screwed up..I bought this new...decided I wanted flip cap covers. Since the eyepiece end is really short, not much room for a cap to slip on and stay. So I very carefully Superglued a pair of Butler Creek flip caps onto the optic. Did not get any glue onj lenses. Was very careful. I left it to cure overnight. Next day, I found that the SuperGlue had ""out-gassed"" leaving a white residue. I cleaned it off, but then realized the eyepiece lens coating had been affected....still works perfectly, does not obscure vision at all. It's just that the lens coating has kind of a rainbow look to it when viewed at an angle. I'm selling only bceuae I'm mad at myself for using SuperGlue. Front objective lens is fine. By the way, caps stay on strong. Will not pop off and flip caps work great. I just feel like an idiot for what I did. Paid $80 for it...selling for only $35. If it doesn't sell I'll keep it as a backup. One of the photos shows the rear lens discoloration...when viewing through it you can;t tell....only when you look at the lens at an engle do you see the discoloration.By the way...riser in photo is not included..I bought that seperately.Mike at REDACTED"

The Model 10 FCM Scout is one of 10 rifles in Savage's Law Enforcement Series. Savage Arms was founded in 1894, and is headquartered in Westfield, Massachusetts. The Model 10 FCM Scout features a carbon steel barrel and a synthetic stock, both finished in matte black. Additional features include a detachable box magazine, ghost sights, included gun sling, and swivel studs. The Model 10 FCM Scout also utilizes Savage's AccuTrigger system. This inclusion features a dual-stage trigger design in which the first (vented) trigger acts to disengage a safety mechanism. Once this occurs, the second trigger can be depressed in order to activate the firing pin - the trigger assembly is also user-adjustable for weight of pull. The Model 10 FCM Scout also features Savage's patented AccuStock system. The AccuStock utilizes an integral aluminum spine that runs the length of the forearm, resulting in a more rigid stock that allows the barrel to float freely. In addition, the AccuStock is bedded so as to apply both horizontal and vertical (3-dimensional) pressure to the action. This achieves in a tighter fit between stock and action, resulting in increased overall gun accuracy. The Model 10 FCM Scout is drilled and tapped for scope mounts and includes a barrel-mounted scope-mount. Savage recommends the gun for law enforcement applications.*****SORRY NO TRADES*****Description from Guns.com.Learn more at SavageArms.com.SavageArms.com."

The bolt is pretty uniquie; after firing a round, it stays locked to the rear while the trigger is pulled.

Ambiidextrous in design with bottom ejection. It is in excellent shape with an excellent bore and has been taken care of over the years. I took it to the skeet range and fired a box of shells through and she worked perfectly (no surprise there).The model 37 was one of the best pump shotguns ever. This one has a forged steel receiver and is the kind of solid quality one found in good guns of its era. It is a perfect dove gun, especially for a southpaw shooter, as the Model 37 features bottom ejection and a reversible saftey button. Great gun....why pay more for some modern-day stamped out sheet metal plastic thing when you can hunt with this classic? It has a poly-choke, also a vintage item very popular with actual hunters, which still works to immediately adjust one's choke patern to suit the hunt. PERFECT for a left-handed hunter/shooter as it has the bottom ejection and the left-hand safety currently installed (easily converted back to right).FTF deal in the Charleston area."
