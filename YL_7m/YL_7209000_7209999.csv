I’ll pull the ad down when it’s gone. Please note suppressor/sling are not included in the sale. There is over $2k worth of ammo in this deal and another $3300+ in additional items. Taking $1000 off the top means I've priced it at $2,500 for the REPR. You can’t find a repr for less.

If you are looking to do some hog hunting, this is the setup for you. Or if you want to just be the coolest at the range, this setup will also do. I am willing to sell her without the suppressor or the optics  
 
You are looking at an LWRC 20in heavy barrel REPR w 4 position gas block. This is a very hard to find REPR. LWRC changed some things up in an attempt to get a government contract. The best REPR they made was a 20 inch heavy barrel repr with 4 position adjustable gas block. It features closed (for bolt gun action), suppressed (for suppressors), normal (for normal match ammo), and adverse (for low pressure ammo). This is the best setup LWRC had.
 
On top of her sits a Burris Eliminator 4-16x50. This is a range finder, scope and ballistics calculator in one. If you are hunting, this scope is the only way to go. $1350

She is secured with a LaRue Tactical riser. $135

She has an Atlas PSR bipod. $320

Nine 20 round PMAGs and three 25 round PMAGs. $200
 
The final kicker…. 900 rounds of M118LR ammo. This was purchase from LWRC when I visited their facilities in Maryland. This is the exact same ammo they built the REPR to shoot and the ammo they use to test their REPRs. It doesn’t get any better than this. I will also include 300 empty M118LR casings from the container I shot. $1100
 
 
Loading mags is the pits. Included but not pictured is the MagPacker AR10 mag loader. $50
https://www.magpacker.com/product/magpacker-polymer-ar-10-speed-loader/
 
300 rounds of M118LR and 80 rounds of TAP later, this is easily the best semi auto 308 platform and setup you can get. You can do absolutely everything with this setup. Between the prices of everything above, tax, shipping, and gunsmith time, I have almost $10,000 into her. 
 
The bag, all the ammo, and all magazines are not pictured in the ad due to the size of everything and trying to get it all in on 3 photos. But all of the above is included."

Up for trade is my 1939 Mosin Nagant 91/30, shot it a few times and it's a great rifle. Still needs cosmoline cleaning out of the nooks and crannies. This rifles markings were colorfilled by the arsenal, not by me. Few dings on the wood as expected with a rifle this old. No R after the date which is rare. Comes with ammo pouches, tool kit, original grease can, sling and matching bayonet. I'm also willing to throw in a 1997 Mossberg 835 with the original wood stock and pump grip still on there. It's a nice heavy shotgun, built to last, not like the crap you can buy today.

This is what Barrett says about it,""It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. Designed to be used with a suppressor, this rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a weight reduction of 5 pounds.  Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever."" This one has a 29"" fluted barrel, and is a very nice looking tan color. It has a 27 moa 18"" scope rail. It weighs 28.7 pounds. Save some of your money for ammo and buy this lightly used M107a1 much less than a new one."

This rifle was made in the 1970s and kind of ill-conceived as it was far too expensive to compete with the other single shot, the Ruger#1. So today it is a shootable collectable.  It comes with mounts/rings, but NOT the scope.  It is in excellent condition.  You want a rifle that nobody on your range, your town and likely your state has, you are looking at it. I want $2700 for it and will ship for an additional $45 to your FFL and in a hard case.  Listen, I well-appreciate the number of bogus ads that I have found on this site, so if you want additional pics or have any other questions, I welcome them.
