Probably less than 200 arrow impacts total... and this target hardly even noticed that many 'hits'.   Is made with several dozen strips of carpet cut into roughly 4+ foot high by 1 foot deep strips, which are then compressed 'edge-wise' to form a very 'arrow friendly' impact surface.The strips are held together via (4) long threaded rods, which have very large nuts, and fender washers on the ends. The rods are threaded through a husky wood frame of 4 x 4 treated wood that compresses the carpet pieces side-to-side. The frame is located at the the top and bottom of the target area, out of the impact area. The entire target can be 'tension-ed'' (by screwing down the nuts tighter) to adjust for how hard your bow shoots.   THIS THING IS HEAVY! You'll either need 2 strong guys to move it intact, or else you'll need to disassemble it for relocation.   I built this target over 3 years ago... and it's still in great shape. It's been covered with black plastic (see last picture) to keep it from getting wet and 'funky' (though that probably wouldn't make any difference to your arrows).I made this myself, because I wanted a better target (with a much LARGER target area) than anything that was available in the marketplace at anywhere near a reasonable price.If you want this... come get it now. If it's still there in a couple weeks, I'm going to have to disassemble it getting ready for a move... and then I'll just keep it!Cash only please. Respond via the email link if you're interested, and leave me a phone number where I can reach you (my cellphone is finicky on coverage... I'm in the process of changing providers.) Thanks,- Mac"

Does have some signs of use, but is in great shape, if it had more than a box or two of shells through it i'd be amazed.Great for training and practice, this 22 LR conversion kit allows for inexpensive target shooting with your favorite centerfire rifle. Shoots and functions like the regular AR-15, except the bolt doesn't remain locked open after the last shot, with no significant change in weight and balance. Assembly is incredibly simple and only requires replacement of the original bolt carrier assembly with the Ciener version. No permanent modifications are required for use. Includes one 10-Round magazine, and is compatible with Black Dog Machine 10-, 15-, and 25-Round magazines. For Semi-auto AR-15's only, will not work in M-16's.
