The only portion of this gun that makes it 'fair' condition and not 'excellent' is the ramrod, which looks to have been colored in a very half-ass attempt, as well as a break in the wood near the percussion nipple. Happy to send photos, the rest of the gun is pretty much flawless and is even defarbed for the reenactors out there.
 
Asking price is $700 which is $600 off the retail price. More than fair for the slight damage to the stock and the weird coloring on the ramrod."

It didnt have anything for grips and was generally down on its luck. Sine she came to me she has had a fresh coat of nickle. All of the internal parts have been replaced(i was n there replacing other parts why not just go the full job). The new grips feel amazing in your hands. It has a mirror finish you could shave in. without changing the major components this is a like new gun. She will give her new owner a very long life either in a display or as a shooter (still very tight from the nickling process). This si a beautiful handgun now. come by and check it out today.

It replaces the stock Picatinny rail adapter with a low profile mount for KeyMod handguards. The mount is especially useful on handguards that feature 45 degree angle mounting flats, such as the Bravo Company KMR, Knight's Armament URX 4, MI Gen 3 and Mega MKM. This new version is made of 7075 aluminum for superior strength and uses BCM's patented inverted KeyMod screws with twin recoil lugs for easier installation and a solid connection to your handguard.When used on a 45 degree angle mounting flat, the Inline Scout Mount allows the user to position the light closer or farther away from the top 12 o'clock rail to give clearance for front sights or other accessories. Three positions are provided, allowing an offset of 0.12"" to either side of center. The base of the Surefire Scout Light sits only 0.20"" above the KeyMod or M-Lok mounting surface, making it the thinnest inline style mount on the market."

Made in 1915. Receiver retains a lot of original bluing with some bluing loss from handling and light flaking. The LH side of the receiver is stamped with ""503"". I am unsure of what this stamping is - it looks like a rack number typical of police departments or militia. Barrel and mag tube retain much of their original bluing with only minor imperfections from handling. One spot on the RH/top side of the barrel has a spot of bluing missing as shown in the photos. The bore has strong rifling with some even light pitting - it rates 7/10 in my opinion. Gumwood stocks are very good with excellent fit and have never been sanded or repaired. The butt stock does have a gouge on the top of the comb as shown. This gun locks up tight and is very crisp and gun may only be ship to FFL dealers only."

GLOCK's new slimline pistol has taken the single stack 9mm segment by storm, outselling even the most popular contender. The new GLOCK 43 has transformed how shooters thought of single stack carry guns, no longer were they uncomfortable and hard to shoot. Now concealed carriers have the ability to practice with their carry gun without discomfort and an unpleasant shooting experience that some other single stack 9mm pistols offer. Shooters are flocking to the GLOCK 43 thanks to new and refined features like a finger groove-less grip perfect for all hand sizes and a reversible magazine catch coupled with the all too familiar GLOCK feel. Recoil is kept in check with a dual spring recoil system and the ever-present Safe-Action system ensures that the trigger feels just like the GLOCK 43's bigger brother. Thanks to the new one-inch wide design, the GLOCK 43 will disappear under clothing like it isn't even there. Specifications and Features:GLOCK: PI4350201GLOCK 439mm Luger3.39"" Barrel 1:9.84"" Twist Right hand hexagonal rifling6 Rounds Polymer Frame Striker Fired Action 5.5 lb Trigger PullOverall Length 6.26""Overall Height 4.25""Overall Width 1.02""Overall Weight 17.95 oz Unloaded/22.36 oz LoadedBlack Finish"

I am unsure of what this stamping is - it looks like a rack number typical of police departments or militia. Barrel and mag tube retain much of their original bluing with only minor imperfections from handling. One spot on the RH/top side of the barrel has a spot of bluing missing as shown in the photos. The bore has strong rifling with some even light pitting - it rates 7/10 in my opinion. Gumwood stocks are very good with excellent fit and have never been sanded or repaired. The butt stock does have a gouge on the top of the comb as shown. This gun locks up tight and is very crisp and gun may only be ship to FFL dealers only."

Gun is in good to very good overall physical condition. Timing is good with lockup being a bit loose. Primary issue is in when using double action the cylinder stop does not stay down long enough for the hand to begin rotating cylinder. The stop pops back up stopping the cylinder and not allowing you to continue pulling the trigger. Doesn't happen with every pull of the trigger, but does with every two or three. Needs a new cylinder stop to reliably work in double action mode.Single action mode works just fine, however, single action is a very light trigger pull. I would describe it as a hair trigger. Works in single action because the trigger is not pulled away off the cylinder stop allowing it to pop up and stop the rotation of the cylinder.$150.00 bottom dollar.  Open to trades, also.Thanks for looking and feel free to ask questions."

It fires .38 caliber black powder rounds. It predates the heat treating required for it to handle the pressures generated by modern gunpowders. The nickel is worn in a couple of areas, but overall its in great shape. The grips are also in amazing condition. The rifling is sharp and the gun indexes nicely - so I don't think it was fired much. The cylinder is released by removing the pin under the barrel. The only reason I haven't test-fired it is that I don't have the right ammunition. This was produced somewhere between 1888 and 1897."

Two of the mags are 5 round, the 3rd is an extended 7 round mag. I have only fired about 1000 rounds with this gun. No jamming issues and the rifling is mint. 
This is the “P” series, not the economical “C” series. The slide on the P series undergoes more machining, the slide stop is machined instead of metal-injection molded making it stronger, the engraving on the slide is much more detailed, and the front sight is adjustable. But the most important feature on the P series is the match grade polygonal rifling, which makes this tiny powerhouse extremely accurate at longer distances. This is a private sale, and I’m willing to meet at a shooting range if you want to test the gun.

Ready for anything. Kimber Tactical pistols have the performance-enhancing features demanded by law enforcement professionals. Available in a range of configurations, they cover everything from tactical response to concealed carry.
Meprolight night sights are standard. Front strap and trigger guard checkering are standard. Extended ambidextrous thumb safety are standard. Kimber Tactical pistols are no-compromise, purpose-built pistols that leave nothing out, and Kimber quality brings it all together in five different platforms. Three full-size versions exceed all traditional and tactical law enforcement requirements. Compact models cover everything else. Like all Kimber pistols, each has rounded and blended edges to prevent snagging, along with match grade barrels, chambers and triggers. No other pistol design equals the 1911 for true tactical performance.
