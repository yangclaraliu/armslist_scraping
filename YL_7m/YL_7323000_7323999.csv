A precision reflector delivers a smooth, far-reaching beam with a brighter central area and generous peripheral light to help maintain situational awareness. Built for military and law-enforcement professionals, the 1000-lumen output of this palm-sized searchlight — with peak beam level of 22,000 candela — is momentarily activated with a press of the thumb on its tailcap switch. To activate, press for momentary-on, press further to click constant-on. The P3X Fury Tactical’s high-strength aerospace aluminum body is knurled for a comfortable, secure grip in all kinds of weather and is coated with a Mil-Spec hard-anodized finish for extreme resistance to scratches, abrasion, and corrosion in even the harshest environments."

The magazine has a diffrerent shape base plate and a orange follower. the next difference is the slide release on the G5 is now ambidextrious making this pistol more friendly to a left handed shooter. The Slide is now rounded out up front making for easier holster insertion and a slight weight reduction. This is the feature that i like the most. Another new addition is the new ""marksman"" Barrel. Features a new crown and traditional rifling. These barrels are supposed to be more accurate. The rear sight is also a little different.

628,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7323628,For Sale:  Hk USP Match,"Lubbock, Lubbock, Texas","$ 1,500","Listed On: Saturday, January 13, 2018",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,no type,no type,Pistol,"This is one of the baddest USPs you can purchase... It has had slide lightening done on the outer part of the slide . The slide serrations are cut at a 27 degree angle to match the serrations on the reproduction Match compensator. The slide was lightened to compensate for the weight of the Burris Fastfire III that is mounted on the back of the slide now. This keeps the weight of the slide the same as if the slide was never touched, thus, keeps it working in its original perameters that Hk designed the gun for. As you can see, the Fastfire is also recessed into the slide giving the shooter a flatter sight plane. When the machining was first done, the USP was put together and had four mags put through with all different types of ammo to make sure it functioned like a USP should. After the functions testing was done, I took the slide and the slide release, and parkerized them, and then blued over the parkerizing, so, it has two protective layers on it. The barrel, and some of internals in the slide were refinished with hot blue also. The gun has not been fired after the refinishing of the parts. This means that the new front sight was just put on and has not been adjusted, you will have to sight it in. There is a white line on the back of the Fastfire that you line up with the front dot for your basic iron sights. The button on the left hand side of the Fastfire III turns it on, and adjusts the brightness. With it on, you have a second aiming point, or you can line it up exactly with the front sight. As it is right now, the dot sits right above the front sight. With the reproduction Match compensator and the Jarvis National Match barrel, the black USP and my stainless are the most accurate guns I have ever had on a ransom rest, and some of the most fun guns I have ever shot. The USP has a Match trigger installed, and will come with no magazines (all I have are twelve round mags). The reporduction Match weight is made from billet aluiminum and not a three quarter pound piece of steel, making it a very nice, and not so front end heavy, shooting gun. The original Match USP's were disliked by many because of the heavy weight, which the aluminum takes care of. Compared to an actual factory Hk Match USP, this USP with the aluminum reproduction Match weight, and National Match barrel, shoots the same, if not better than my last Hk factory Match gun did. Price wise, this is a better gun than the nose heavy factory Hk USP Match. This USP will be shipped with the Burris Fastfire's box, and all of its original contents. The purchase price is $1500, and shipping will be $30. Not looking to trade it sorry."

The mainspring housing is flat and includes the Springfield Armory® I.L.S.™ The pistol has a Lightweight Delta™ hammer and a beavertail grip safety, which features a raised memory pad for positive engagement. The extended ambidextrous thumb safety and long aluminum match-grade trigger are upgraded features that are standard to the Loaded Series. The fixed combat 3-Dot sights feature tritium inserts. The ejection port is lowered and flared, and the pistol is fitted with a standard guide rod. The MC Operator® comes with G-10 grips held in place with Torx™ head grip screws"

Spray to cool, clean, share, and drink. Ready for GEIGERRIG plug-n-play, on-the-go, in-line filtration. Reversible and dishwasher safe (top shelf). Really, it should be called a Personal Water System rather than a Hydration System. Why? Because a hydration system has come to be known as a plastic bag with a drink tube that can only be used for hydration for one person. The GEIGERRIG system dramatically expands the uses and access to water. BPA FREE – PTHALATE FREE.       Features     1. The Engine: Slide Top, Water Tube, Air Tube, Reservoir, and Power Bulb. (Power bulb has a depressurization button, but you can also depressurize by disconnecting the tube from the bulb. Either way works just fine.)   2. Wide Mouth: The Engine has a large, wide-mouth opening for easy refill with water and ice. It also provide convenience for maintenance, cleaning and drying.   3. Slide Top: The Hydrapak Slide Top provides a very strong seal that is leak free and holds back the pressure of the GEIGERRIG system.   4. Quick Release Valves: The quick release valves allow you to easily disconnect the tubes and leave them positioned in the hydration pack while you remove the reservoir for filling and cleaning.   5. Filter Ready: Ready for plug-and-play, on-the-go, in-line water filtration using a GEIGERRIG filter or other in-line filters. The water found along the trail is now available for your use-ON-THE-GO!   6 and 7. Reversible and Dishwasher Safe: Reach down inside through the large wide-mouth opening, grab the port at the bottom of the Engine, and turn the system inside out for placement in the top shelf of the dishwasher or for easy cleaning in your sink.

I swapped some parts out from a Howa 1500, which is a nearly identical rifle (Howa makes the Vanguard for Weatherby; its the same action). 1. Stock has been swapped out for the Hogue stock pulled from the Howa - unlike the Vanguard stock, this one is free-floated (I can send pictures of that). Has a nice thick recoil pad. 2. Trigger has been swapped out for the Howa H.A.C.T. two-stage trigger. As far as I can tell, this is identical to the Vanguard 2 trigger, but the Howa came with some (removable) goo on it to deter you from adjusting the trigger pull, whereas Weatherby's doesn't have that. Post-adjustment, I'm keeping the Howa, and selling the Weatherby at a loss.I also have 118 rounds of 243 ammo for it - 20 rounds of Winchester Power Point, 19 round of Remington Core Lokt, 79 rounds of PPU soft point. All 100 grain. Selling rifle and ammo for $425 total. Note that the scope is NOT included in that price. I'm not selling that Leupold, but I do have some other scopes for sale, check out my other listings. I also have a set of Talley 30mm scope ring/base combo that fit it (same as the Weathery branded ones), size medium.  Would throw those in for $25 more. Meet at an FFL to transfer; I prefer Denver Bullets near downtown/Mile High, but can be flexible. Buyer pays fees. Can send more pictures on request. Thanks,Shane"
