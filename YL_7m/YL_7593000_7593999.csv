This is 10mm Auto pistol ammunition, like what goes in a Glock 20 pistol. I am able to ship ammunition to freedom states.300 rounds, after being packaged up in cardboard, wrapped in paper, and given a healthy amount of packing tape, fits in a package that roughly measures 12 x 6 x 4 and weighs right around 13 pounds.  Ammunition must be shipped ground via UPS or FedEx.  USPS (United States Postal Service) will not ship ammunition.This is enough information for folks to crunch a shipping estimate.  Short story:  price should still be competitively lower than what one would get ordering from a proven store online, because I am selling this at a loss.As this is pistol ammunition, we need buyer to be 21 years of age or older for this purchase. I purchased these new from CheaperThanDirt.com back in 2014.  I have been the only owner since then. Since then, they have spent the overwhelming majority of their time nestled in an ammo can, out of direct sunlight, in a cool (temperature) environment. Condition: ""unused"" and ""like new"".   None of this ammunition has been loaded into magazines, or chambered in firearms, or toted around in backpacks out in the rain or any such shenanigans.  Caveat: as likely discernible in my photos, there are some spots of wear/abrasion to the cardboard box packaging that is usual from shipping and storage. I purchased these back when I was convinced that somebody who wanted to trample fun and freedom was going to get elected for 2017 and my few favorite toys were going to become very challenging to get supplies for. Whoops, more battle rattle sitting around than I actually have use for now.  Let my mistake be your gain. My price is 70 cents per round, or 14 dollars per 20 round box.  There are 15 boxes packed and ready to ship.  I want to sell this as this package of 300 rounds.   So, price is $195 before shipping.  The dollar bill in the photos is not for sale nor rebate purposes.  It is there for size reference only.   If i’m meeting in person, and not shipping this, I'll exchange for cash, and cash only.For shipping this ammuntion, I can accept USPS money order as well as Square Cash (the Cash App)
I will not ship ammunition to PO Boxes, nor via USPS.  I will not ship ammunition to California, Connecticut, Alaska, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, or Washington D.C.
The Ugly Part: If you buy something from me, you agree that I cannot be held responsible for your use, misuse, application, gifting, regifting, or redistribution of the product.  By purchasing, receiving, or using the product, you agree to indemnify me and hold me harmless should any people, property, firearms, ammunition, magazines, or people's feelings get hurt by the product.  If buying a holster, you agree to check fit and function of the holster(s) with an UNloaded firearm to ensure nothing of the holster, firearm, modifications to either, or external environment factors induce a discharge of the firearm.  If buying ammunition, you agree handle it safely, assume full responsibility for its use and who can access it, and to use it only in appropriately chambered firearms of good working order."

Comes with one 40 round magazine. Instore purchase will require a MN permit to acquire or carry license.$529   Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability, and pairs with the elevation adjustable front sight for a solid, reliable aiming system. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.   Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.     Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.   Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.

Two of the many great features about this optic: (1) it's the EXPS line, which means it sits a little higher on your firearm and has a quick-detach system built into the optic; (2) it has bullet drop technology. You can zero the center dot at one distance, and depending on your caliber and barrel length, the bullet drop second dot will be zeroed at a further distance! (Check out eotech’s website for additional details) The inspection date is 7/11/2016 so it’s a newer unit.  The retail price of this optic is $579 + shipping + taxes; this is a heck of a deal, especially for it being in like-new, barely used condition!  I've attached three pictures, but have more if you'd like. Go ahead and feel free to ask questions, my number is below. The Kriss Vector SBR is not included and any purchase of a class 3 firearm must go through a class 3/SOT dealer.If you need the sight shipped, I will ship it insured FedEx for $10. Will not ship outside the USA, as this is a restricted item.   *I am not interested in trades*  Cam - REDACTED  Description  The EXPS2 offers true 2-eyes-open shooting and provides an unparalleled targeting experience. The all-purpose EXPS2 features easy-to-adjust side buttons and a quick-detach lever. It has a transversely-mounted lithium 123 battery. The increased height of the EXPS provides iron sight co-witness access in the lower third of the viewing window.  Whether you're using the sight for law enforcement or hunting, the EXPS series sights are the premier optics in the line.   Length/Width/Height: 3.8"" x 2.3"" x 2.9"" (96.5 x 58.4 x 73.7 mm)  Weight: 11.2 oz (317.5 g)  Water Resistant: Submersible to 10 ft.

I'm selling 8 new-in-plastic, unused, Magpul PMAG Glock 17 GL9 9mm. These have a 17 round capacity. They fit flush, or thereabouts, in a Glock 17. They function and feed, but hang out past the bottom of the pistol grip, on the Glock 19 and Glock 26. I purchased these new from 44mag.com in late 2015. I have been the only owner since then. Since then, they have been nested together in a cardboard box, doing nothing. I purchased these back when I was convinced that somebody who wanted to trample fun and freedom was going to get elected for 2017 and my few favorite toys were going to become very challenging to get supplies for. Whoops, more battle rattle sitting around than I actually have use for now.Let my mistake be your gain.Condition: ""like new"" to ""new in plastic"". Caveat/ Full Disclosure: as likely discernible in my photos, there are some spots of wear/abrasion to the thin plastic packaging from shipping. I am not selling any ammunition pictured here. Nor is the dollar bill in the photos for sale nor rebate purposes. It is there for size reference only. I'll sell these for $10 per magazine, with a minimum purchase of 3 magazines, to make it worth time and hassle (unless I wind up with only 2 remaining, and then I'll have to adjust that plan). At the time of this posting (November 18) 44mag.com has them for sale for $15.15 per. I'll exchange for cash. No personal identification necessary for this item. Will exchange with buyer at the ""craigslist parking"" area of Greer Police Department at 103 West Poinsett St in Greer, SC.  And I am willing to ship this item (these items), but don't see where to check such a box for the listing to not say, ""shipping: No"" . I would receive and cash USPS money order before getting it boxed and shipping it out via USPS.  I will not ship magazines to California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or New York."
