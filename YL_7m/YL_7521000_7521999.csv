The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges .45 ACP. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."

It is the Springfield XD Mod 2 9mm with threaded barrel and in flat dark earth. I've only shot 250 rounds through it and as a Veteran, I clean my gun regularly and thoroughly.I did install new Truglo sights on the gun and they do glow in the dark. I also have a Tachmayr hand grip on the gun as well. In addition to the original hard case with manual, 2 magazines and the gun, I'm including an additional magazine as well as a Blackhawk serpa holster.  The magazines hold 16 rounds each. There are a few nicks on the gun from when I installed the sights, but nothing too crazy and not noticeable unless you're holding the gun. The gun shoots very well. It also has a threaded barrel, for anyone that has or wants to get a suppressor for the gun.After doing some research, I think $500 or realistic best offer (within the ball park) is reasonable. Considering the cheapest I found a new gun online, plus adding every single item that I'm including would be almost $600. It's actually even more if you purchase the gun from a local gun shop or a retailer like Cabelas ($519.99 retail as of 10/31/17).I'm accepting cash or bank transfer through Zelle (if your bank offers it). Don't waste my time asking to pay by check, money order or shipping the gun without ever meeting you.***Remember, this posting is for the gun plus all of the aftermarket accessories. I'm not going to accept any low ball offers just because you think you know gun costs or you found a gun on Gun Broker (which is an auction site folks) and the gun is listed for $200 with 4 days left on the auction. The cheapest I found the gun online was $409, which didn't include FFL transfer and background check fees. I know when I transferred my last handgun, it cost me $55 (transfer fee plus background check since it was a handgun) and that was the cheapest FFL I could find. Anyone wasting my time sending me low ball offers will immediately be blocked***Since this is a handgun, I require a bill of sale with name, contact information and either your drivers license number or CCW permit number. You will receive a copy at the time of sale, which does include my information as well. There are no exceptions to this. I'm NOT requiring a background check fee, but to at least make sure I'm covering my butt, I need a filled out and signed bill of sale."

These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine will remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.SPECSCALIBER: .45ACPRECOIL SYSTEM: 1 Piece N.M.
