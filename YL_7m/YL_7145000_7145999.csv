Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package."

This is something I took in trade and don't really need. This is a hard to find  NO LOCK model that is cut for moon clips and comes with three of them- you do not have to use them if you don't want to, it works without them. It has a set of Wilson Combat springs to improve the trigger pull- I did this to my other J frame with great results. If you have looked at a J frame and don't like the trigger pull you should try this one to see how nice they can be. The original springs come with it if you want to change them back. I have the original Box and paperwork. ID and Signature on a sales receipt required. Feel free to contact me if any questions.

It has never been dropped or in the dirt, always kept clean in a safe. The only reason I’m selling it is because I’m a woman and it’s too big for my hand. I need a smaller gun that is easier for me to control. I bought it new from Turners here in San Diego for around $1,100 and am asking only $999. Please call or text if interested. Rene REDACTED."

Three pad lengths are available in ½"" increments to provide length of pull adjustment to fit a wide variety of shooters. A ¼"" spacer is included for customizing.Unfortunately, a tiny scratch appeared one day last week on the top of the receiver and I have discounted the gun quite a bit for that issue.  Other than that the gun has been fired only on one occasion for trap shooting approximately 50 rounds (two boxes).  I also have 8 or so boxes of light target loads that we can negotate.  I also have a browning cynergy take down case that we can negotiate as well.  The case cost $189.00 new and I have no room to store it so it will go pretty cheap.  Everything is like new the gun is still very stiff to open and close which indicates it's newness.I hop you like it and let me know if you are interested.  I am going away for the weekend of Aug. 5th and will return on the following Tuesday, FYI."
