This is plug and play. Price is pretty firm as a result. Am I willing to listen to trade offers? Sure, but, again, let's be honest with ourselves. A Raven .25 ($100 mouse gun) is not an even trade. The deal will have to make sense to both parties involved. That's common sense I think.Trades? Canik tp9sfx looks pretty neato. I'll throw cash to the right race gun trade. RPR in 6.5?

USPS Money Order for agreed amount to be received and cleared before any movement of the firearm at all, no exceptions to this (had a few dudes try to give me fraudalent checks in the past that would bounce or be red-flagged without 5 business days; the cool thing about a USPS Money Order is that it's insured by the government and can be contested in a court of law, if the seller tries anything shady).4. Once cleared, my FFL will make contact with your FFL of choice and transfer the firearm to them.The details:About 400 rounds through it, but shoots like a dream. Not one single failure or issue, action is the smoothest of all my AK's.It comes with a Texas Weapons Systems ""Dogleg Rail"" dust cover with a peep hole sight, which is zeroed and maintains zero when the dust cover is removed and put back on. Selling with it because I already have spares. It seriously makes shooting accurately a much easier process vs the factory AK sight, given the enhanced sight radius and peep sight.Rifle also comes with (1) Saiga Factory 10rnd magazine."

Still in the box, with the original hang-tag and manual and whatever came in the box. The single action 22 is several grades above the usual ones from FIE, which are pretty decent. This one is put together much better and has a solid feel and is quite heavy as the barrels on a 22 have a lot of steel. Check the cylinder as the rear has a recessed rim so there is no gap and the rear is what appears to be stainless that was left bare. I am not sure, but going by how it looks the cylinder or part of it is stainless. The button for releasing the cylinder rod and the other screws are gold and the grips wood. The gun has been fired as I see a line on the cylinder from rotation but I did not fire it as it just looks too clean and perfect in its box. The hammer clicks back nicely into the positions, the loading gate lets you drop one in at a time and pop them out with the ejector when finished. It does have a hammer block safety but still, best not to carry with a loaded round under the hammer. I sold the base model single action in so-so shape for $135 and this one is in mint/perfect condition AND has the box and papers AND most importamt.....this is a MUCH nicer gun. While the cheaper ones are great truck, camping or boat guns, this is one you do not want to bang up. These nicer grade FIEs do sell for more. The regular 25acp GT27 is a 100 dollar gun but the Tigress model in a similar box with the papers and upgrades all over is selling for double that. This is still NOT a Smith Wesson or even a Taurus Tracker in 22...but look at the price of those. A used tracker in blue is $375 on Gun Broker and stainless are all over $400MANY MORE PHOTOS AVAILABLE      $185 FIRM.....Has to go for more than the ones without the box and papersLOCAL SALE PREFERRED    Shipping handguns is not so cheap as I ship through my FFL as it is quite a bit less than me shipping as I must use Next Day and FFLs can use Priority Flat RateSHIPPING is $36 to your FFL"

The internal hammer of the 642 eliminates the risk of the hammer getting snagged on clothing, holsters, or purses when drawing the weapon in a self-defense situation. The low profile, ramp front sight and the fixed notch rear sight also aid in snag-free presentation of the weapon. The 642 is double-action only, making it an extremely fast personal-defensive handgun to deploy in stressful situations, as there is nothing to remember to do except point and pull the trigger. The synthetic grips and inherently ergonomic design afford natural pointability. The Model 642 is built on Smith & Wesson's famous J-Frame, it has a 5-shot cylinder rated for +P .38 Special ammunition. Stainless steel and alloy construction resist corrosion caused by humidity and perspiration when the revolver is carried close to the body. The Smith & Wesson 642 Airweight Double-Action Revolver carries easily, deploys rapidly, and has enough firepower to handle any self-defense scenario. Made in USA.
