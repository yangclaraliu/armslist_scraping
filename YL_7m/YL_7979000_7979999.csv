Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis."

MSRP is $1,150 for the rifle with no scope, bipod, or Cerakote. Has a tactical heavy stock, it is the one it came with. I believe they use griffin and Howe stocks for them. It is in .223 Remington. I've taken it out to 200 yds with a 1/2"" group. I don't have access to any ranges longer than that. I have taken a few coyotes with it and it does an amazing job of dropping them in their tracks."

Featuring the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2® .45ACP Sub-Compact is a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry. From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD® Mod.2® .45ACP Sub-Compact is a pistol that squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry’s slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2® .45ACP Sub-Compact offers 9+1 rounds of .45ACP or 13+1 rounds with an X-Tension™ magazine. This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3” barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal. Like all XD®s, the Mod.2® Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol. And of course, GripZone® ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2® apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2® Sub-Compact on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you’ll probably find that you’ve got a new favorite to carry."

The XD(M)® series forever changed the handgun landscape, and set new and higher standards for ergonomic comfort, ease of operation, features and performance. The XD(M)® offers the best ergonomic experience possible in a polymer platform. With multiple interchangeable back straps, the XD(M)® can be perfectly tailored to fit your hand. As it shares the same perfect grip angle as the standard XD® and the 1911, the XD(M)® points effortlessly and naturally. Aggressive mega-lock frame texturing and major grasp slide serrations keep the XD(M)® in your hand and operational under any conditions. The slide and frame feature aesthetically pleasing contours that make it a more concealable pistol. The features available on the XD(M)® will impress even the most demanding shooters. The XD(M)® includes a basic list of safety features shared with its predecessor the XD®. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator give the shooter instant tactile and visual feedback to know if there is a chambered round and if the striker is cocked. Three separate safeties guard against accidental discharges and provide extra peace of mind. The Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ prevents unintentional rearward movement of the trigger. The grip safety keeps the pistol from firing unless the shooter has a firm grasp on it. And an internal firing pin block goes the extra mile to bring you a pistol fully designed with safety in mind. The list of features doesn’t stop there, though. The XD(M)® comes with interchangeable mold-tru back straps, meaning it can be customized to fit your hand. Have a light or laser that you want to mount on your pistol? The XD(M)® comes standard with an accessory rail that has multiple slots for maximum flexibility – even on the compact models. The maximum reach ambidextrous magazine release gives fast reloading access to shooters with any size hands. The low profile combat sights give a clear sight picture. Longevity and reliability are ensured by the fully supported ramped match-grade barrel and rugged Melonite® or stainless steel finish. The Megazines® included with your XD(M)® will ensure you have plenty of ammo available for whatever the job is at hand. And when it’s time to clean your XD(M)®, it can be field stripped without pulling the trigger. The XD(M)® is available in a variety of frame sizes, barrel lengths, finishes and calibers. Pick up an XD(M)® today and see what a polymer pistol can be.
