Comes as seen in pictures with one Mag.Store item#011438501The SAM7UF Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the new addition to the SAM7 family – the SAM7UF rifle. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features expected in the SAM7 Family. From its reinforced under-folding buttstock to its 14x1mm left hand muzzle threads with muzzle nut, every component of the SAM7UF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7UF rifle is bound to become a sought-after and collectible firearm.  The New Reinforced Under-Folding Stock The SAM7UF utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock, which locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle.  In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, this stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces the climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it."

Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole! The Mark 23 is available in .45 ACP Features: Threaded O-ring barrel with polygonal bore profileMatch grade triggerOne piece machined steel slideFrame mounted decocking lever and separate ambidextrous safety leverCan be carried “cocked and locked” in single action mode with the safety lever onPatented HK recoil reduction systemCorrosion resistant blued finishCorrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frameOversized trigger guard for use with glovesUniversal mounting grooves for installing accessoriesAmbidextrous magazine release leverExtended slide releaseExtractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator Patented Lock-Out Safety deviceLimited AvailabilityBuyer will pay $20 for shiping"

The stock does not look sanded and has sharp cartouches. The stock has a coat of something on it that makes it look kind of shiny. The finish actually makes the cartouches stand out a little better in most cases. The stock might have been steel wooled or lightly sanded but they did not remove any markings. Comes with a oily but original looking sling. The bore is bright and shiny but far from perfect. I will give it a 7-8 out of a ten. The bullet test and the muzzle looks like it has strong rifling.
