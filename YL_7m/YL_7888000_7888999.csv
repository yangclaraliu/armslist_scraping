Brand new and still in the box with original paperwork.  If you're looking for a compact rifle and don't want to mess with NFA paperwork this is the way to go.  I bought two of these.  One for me and one for my son.  My son decided he wanted a different rifle and this one has never been fired or even out of the box.  The one I have shoots great and I really like it.  Just don't need two.  I've shot these and the IWI Tavor's.  The Tavor's are nice as well but the advantage to Kel-Tec is it is truly ambidextrous.  No switching ejection ports or controls if you or someone else starts shooting left handed.  The downward eject with these work flawlessly in my experience.  They also have an adjustable gas block if you plan on shooting suppressed.  I prefer straight sell and not trades.  I can meet anywhere in OKC Metro area."

Designed for concealed carry may be the best of both worlds when it comes to muzzle controllability and magazine capacity in a 1911. The T4 contains some of the most evolutionary features offered by the company. The T4 resembles the popular T3, but on a 3.8"" barrel platform. Reliability was the most important consideration when plans for the new pistol began, hence the 3.8"" Nighthawk match grade barrel over the more popular but less reliable 3.5"" or shorter barrel. Additionally, the Nighthawk Everlast Recoil System was modified to fit into the smaller T4 frame, thus reducing felt recoil and decreasing recovery time between shots. The frame is thinned just like Nighthawk's popular Lady Hawk. The proprietary barrel is crowned and recessed with the slide. On the outside, the front of the slide has cuts designed to reduce weight. They taper in towards the crowned barrel, giving a unique look to the T4 like no other handgun produced by Nighthawk. Grips are like the T3 and are thinned for less bulk.

I'm selling it because I don't need two Arsenals. I'm the original purchaser, and this has been with me for two years. This rifle is priced to sell. However, I'm in no rush to sell it. Asking price is firm, since this is a ~$1,200 dollar rifle, and imports aren't that easy to come by, I expect value for this rifle to go up over the coming years. Also, I'm not looking for trades.  No sling, or magazines included. FFL transfer fee to be paid by the buyer.  Performance of this rifle, as you might expect from an Arsenal, has been flawless. With only 1,615 rounds fired, I don't consider this weapon even broken in yet. No failures to feed, eject, etc., no rust or corrosion; no modifications have been made apart from what I installed, listed below. All parts are original, all serial numbers matching. Bore is clean, all parts work perfectly and show only the slightest wear. The exterior shows very, very minor wear markings (see pictures). The underfolding stock locks firmly and positively with a loud click, with no wobble. The rifle has been cleaned and oiled, and is ready for a new home. I've installed a few items on the rifle, and they come with it:   1. Tapco AK-74-style muzzle brake  2. U-notch peep sight  3. Samson cheek rest
I'll also include an Atlantic Firearms rifle case with this sale.
Questions or requests for additional pictures welcome."

The Ag M/42B was designed by Erik Eklund of the AB C.J. Ljungmans Verkstäder company, which is why it’s referred to as the “Ljungman Rifle”. It was manufactured by Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori, but was never used in large numbers, so only about 30,000 rifles were made.The left side of the receiver is marked with the serial number, “crown / C” (a Carl Gustafs mark), “1945” (the date of manufacture) and “B” (noting the rifle has been upgraded to a Model B). The left side of the safety lever, buttplate, bottom metal, barrel band, barrel band retainer, nose cap and nose cap retainer are all marked with a “crown”. The left side of the bolt is etched with the serial number.

Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor.The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold.Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability.Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side.The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor.The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold.Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability.Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side.The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.
