May be an opportunity for the right property owner to pick up some extra income. Here's what I'm proposing. - Looking for property that is already legal and safe to shoot guns.(Far enough from houses, road, proper backstop, etc)- Willing to pay $100/ month to shoot on property twice a month. (Ex. Every other Thursday Noon-4pm) - Totally flexible with days/ times. - Would bring my own professional steel targets. Willing to invest into other range accessories, berms, etc if property owner is interested. - Willing to sign any waivers if needed. I assure you, I practice safe shooting, have proper training and a CPL. - Within an hour of the South Lyon area would be optimum. Simply put, I just want the ability to safely train with rifle slings, holsters and steel targets. There's very few areas where this can be done with freedom. Before I buy a piece of land up north, thought I'd explore this first. Just reply to this email if you're interested."

(Ex. Every other Thursday Noon-4pm) - Totally flexible with days/ times. - Would bring my own professional steel targets. Willing to invest into other range accessories, berms, etc if property owner is interested. - Willing to sign any waivers if needed. I assure you, I practice safe shooting, have proper training and a CPL. - Within an hour of the South Lyon area would be optimum. Simply put, I just want the ability to safely train with rifle slings, holsters and steel targets.

(Ex. Every other Thursday Noon-4pm) - Totally flexible with days/ times. - Would bring my own professional steel targets. Willing to invest into other range accessories, berms, etc if property owner is interested. - Willing to sign any waivers if needed. I assure you, I practice safe shooting, have proper training and a CPL. - Within an hour of the South Lyon area would be optimum. Simply put, I just want the ability to safely train with rifle slings, holsters and steel targets. There's very few areas where this can be done with freedom. Before I buy a piece of land up north, thought I'd explore this first. Just reply to this email if you're interested."

I received it in a trade and then sent it off to ATN to get it checked out to make sure everything worked perfectly and to their factory standards. While the product is discontinued, i was happy to know that they were still able to check it out for me and even do all the tests they do before sending out brand new scopes. It is amazing, especially as a Gen2+ HPT scope. So it is barely below a Gen3. I can ship it once payment has gone through or id be happy to meet up once a price has been agreed on. It retailed for $1800 and i just put $150 into it to get it tuned up by the ATN Factory. Looking for best offer. If you are interested, please make one because i need to sell it... but don’t make some absurd one 1/2 my asking price. May consider trade for high end guns or for gun+cash. Ideal trade would be a Martin or Taylor acoustic guitar!"

Pistol fires perfectly, never a single failure of any sort. Gun has been custom cerakoted in burnt bronze on the slide, one back strap, and the bottom of the flush magazine. The cerakote work is impeccable; I've shown the gun to numerous gun shops and they all asked the name of the gunsmith so they could use him in the future. This is a custom paint job you won't see anywhere else, making this gun truly unique and eye-catching. The FNS9C has the best out of the box trigger of any production handgun and she shoots straight and true every single time. The gun comes with one 12 round flush mount magazine, one 12 round magazine with a pinky extension, and one 17 round extended magazine. Also included is the extra back strap the pistol came with when I purchased it new late last year. The original case is also included in the sale. I am only selling this gun because I am getting into competition shooting and need the money for a long barrel handgun. I live in Winona, MN but am willing to meet the buyer at a gun shop in the Rochester, La Crosse, or Twin Cities areas. I've never sold a gun on here before, so forgive my ignorance, I'm not sure if this is commonplace or not but I will only be willing to make the deal through an FFL dealer who can run proper background checks. I will pay the transfer fee. If you have any questions please feel free to let me know. This is an amazing pistol from one of the most respected firearms manufacturers in the world. It is great for home defense, range time, and I used it as my every day carry gun. Thank you!"
