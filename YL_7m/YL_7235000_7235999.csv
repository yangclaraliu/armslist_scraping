If you're not familiar with 10mm, it's an incredibly capable round, suitable for self defense and hunting. As a sub-compact, the Glock 29 is small, but due to its width and weight, the recoil is not bad at all. In addition to this premium firearm, it comes with a Raven Concealment Vanguard 2 Holster System, an excellent option for concealed carry. I love this gun, but I have too many, and need the money for a business I'm starting. TAGS: Concealed Carry, deep conceal, deep carry, mini gun, small gun, pocket gun, handgun"

All have their original boxes, there is a ding on one side of the frame of the CZ, purely cosmetic.I'm interested in a USP Tactical V1(threaded polygonal barrel, match trigger, suppressor height match sights, saftey/decocker on the left side of the frame) in .45ACP with some specifics to it. I want one with the 'HK USP' and 'Pat. Pend.' on the frame, import marked with an Eagle over N, no DE mark , and marked 'Heckler & Koch GmbH'. If it's import marked CIP over N, with a DE on the slide, it's not what I'm looking for. KI, KK, AA, AB, AC, AD date codes are what I am looking for. I'd prefer it to be complete, but I'm more interested in the gun than any extras. I'm looking for Very Good or better in condition. Yes, I know it's specific, but if you're looking for a couple of the guns I'm offering, hopefully we can come to an agreement. Use the photo above as a reference.This is for a straight trade, face to face, between two FOID card holders, no cash involved. The ONLY way I'd do cash is if your gun is a safe queen that's got less than 50 rounds through it, complete with ALL paperwork, the fancy soft case, and several boxes of .45, and even then it would be less than $100.I'm offering about $1000 worth of guns for one that I believe is worth about $1000. If you're interested, please get in touch with me. I'm not interested in going out of state or driving hours to meet up. I'm REALLY not interested in going back and forth and then having you drop off the face of the earth, so if that's your style, please don't waste time for either of us. All Illinois State laws apply, I'll have paperwork ready.I will be adding a few pictures later, asking prices for cash(really prefer to just do a straight trade) are as follows:GP100 - $500CZ PCR - $650P320 - $475"

6-shot revolver.
.357 Magnum/.38 special
K Frame
Round butt
Weight: 27oz
2.5 inch barrel
Double/Single action.
Up for sale is a classic pre-lock Smith and Wesson Model 19-5 six-shot revolver chambered in .357 Magnum. This is a K frame with a 2.5 inch barrel, round butt and adjustable rear sight. This firearm was manufactured in the 1980’s. The bore is still nice and shiny and the rifling looks pristine. I just fired a box of .357 magnum out of it on Saturday morning and its as accurate as can be, and I had no light primer strikes or malfunctions. There is a little bit of holster wear, and the trigger and hammer have some coloring. The right side of the frame has some light surface rust, but it’s not out of control. The gun comes with Pachmayr rubber “Gripper” grips and a Cabela’s carry case, since I don’t have the original box. Overall, I would say that this firearm is in good – excellent condition.
This is a private sale, and I’m willing to meet at a shooting range if you want to inspect and test the gun. Please include your phone number when replying to this ad and I will get back to you same day. I am selling this for dirt cheap already so please don’t lowball.
Willing to trade for other handguns, especially Glocks, preferably Glock 19 Gen 4. Thanks for looking."

The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. An anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the textured magazine body and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt with a full 30 rounds, unlike standard magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The snap-on Impact Cover protects the feed lips from impacts and debris while in storage or during transport, and allows fully loaded magazines to be stored long-term (over 1 year) without compromising the integrity of their feed lips.

The tilt-breech system works to dissipate the recoil in the web of the hand and reduce muzzle rise. The PX4 Sub-Compact semi-automatic pistol shoots in either double or single action mode, and is equally suited for concealed carry, home defense, and recreational shooting. The Sub-Compact PX4 Storm features a lightweight, corrosion resistant, fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame that includes an integral Picatinny rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser sights. Interchange backstraps allow a perfect fit to any sized hand; the PX4 Storm has an ambidextrous slide lock and safety, and the magazine release is reversible. The slide has a durable Bruniton™ non-reflective black finish that provides superior corrosion resistance, ideal for concealed carry use where the firearm can be exposed to perspiration on a daily basis. The gun's stainless steel barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance. 3-dot sights provide quick target acquisition, and both front and rear sights are dovetailed into the slide, allowing user to easily change them with after market night sights. The Beretta PX4 Storm Sub-Compact Semi-Auto Pistol uses a double-stacked magazine with a hinged baseplate for the pinky, if needed. Full-sized PX4 Storm magazines can also be used with the sub-compact model. Comes with 2 magazines. Like New, Looks unfired."

Here's your chance to get your hands on a truly unique gun while saving some $$$. Will come with the original hard case, manual, lock, and the soft Legion Case. ****************************************** The Legion P229 is finished in a proprietary Legion gray PVD coating, custom G-10 grips with a Legion medallion, the new SIG SAUER Electro-Optics X-RAY high visibility day/night sights and will ship with three magazines. The P229 in DA/SA include a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The pistol is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG and also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc., P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most."

They are chambered in .223 Wylde, which means they can fire both .223 Rem. ammunition and 5.56x45 NATO Ammunition.Both the upper and lower are made from Mil-Spec 7075 T6 Forgings with Type 3 hard coat anodized finished, the same quality you see on Colt, LWRC, and top dollar rifles. The rifle features a M4 feed ramp and flat top picatinny rail on the upper receiver for mounting sights/optics.The bolt carrier group and gas key are also mil-spec and are MPI tested to ensure flawlessness. The rifles feature a mil-spec 6 position adjustable stock.What sets this rifle apart from others is the fact that it has a 10” free float M-Lok handguard manufactured from a CNC machined forged aluminum extrusion which is hard anodized. The barrel nut is made from forged steel with several hardened bolts securing the rail.Other rifles with these features and specifications go for $900+ on the marketCALL REDACTED ANY TIME BETWEEN 9A.M.

Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor.
The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twist gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability. The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones."
