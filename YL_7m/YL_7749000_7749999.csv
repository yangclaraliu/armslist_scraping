Research Beretta J92M9A3M for exact features.Based on military feedback, Beretta has designed another member of the M9 family, the M9A3 9mm pistol. The M9A3 delivers all of the critical features that today's combat professionals require in demanding environments.The redesigned pistol features a reduced-circumference grip, universal slide design with a universal sadfety decocker , an extended threaded barrel, a beveled magazine well, oversize mag-release button, a 3-slot Picatinny rail, front and back strap checkering, reduced circumference grip with thin grip panels as well as a wrap-around backstrap grip (included, not installed), and 3- sand-resistant magazine for maximum firepower.The M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law enforcement and consumers demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to perform exceptionally in any tactical or home defense situation. Proudly made in the U.S.A.M9A3: Evolution of the Tactical-Pistol ConceptWith the M9A3 semiauto pistol, Beretta has created a coming-together of all the tactical and functional features that today’s combat professionals may require. From Vertec-style thin grip to universal slide design, from a beveled magazine well to oversize mag-release button, from a 3-slot built-in Picatinny rail to high-capacity capability for maximum firepower, the M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law-enforcement and VIP-protection professionals demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to be perfect for any tactical use, including home- and personal defense, tactical competitions as well as duty carry in any condition. Vertec-Style Thin Grip for Instinctive PointabilityThe Vertec-style vertical grip of the M9A3 offers two very important benefits. Its vertical configuration makes it easy to point the handgun to where one would normally point the index finger of the dominant hand. This instinctive pointing is highly prized by tactical shooters and makes for consistent--and consistently-accurate--target acquisition. Also, the grips are thin in spite of being able to accommodate a double-stack, high-capacity magazine. This makes trigger-reach simple even for those with smaller hands, besides offering a more compact profile for those carrying the M9A3 concealed. All this, plus the crisp checkering on the front- and backstrap as well as removable wraparound grip, make any combat hold simple and consistent. Versatility and easy AccessorizationrEasy to Use and MaintainThe M9A3 was designed to be used in the heat of combat. For this reason, Beretta has put a generous bevel at the magazine well, so that tactical magazine changes may be performed quickly and easily with one hand, regardless of lighting conditions. Along the same lines, the magazine-release button is oversized, making it simple to use when seconds count even while wearing gloves. And the M9A3 is low-maintenance thanks to its hyper-resistant FDE finish that is practically impervious to the elements, sand-resistant magazines in 15 or 17 rounds, and intuitive tool-free disassembly. Whether it’s on duty, at home, for concealed carry or at the range, the M9A3 will always give you the absolute best of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and long history serving the needs of professionals the world over.Caliber: 9mm Luger -Barrel: 5.2"" threaded -Tan Slide & Frame -Polymer Grip -3-slot picatinny rail -Beveled magazine well -Removable fixed night sights -Three, sand-resistant 17-round magazines -Overall Weight: 35.2 oz.UNIVERSAL SAFETY DECOCK LEVERS"

I paid a premium just to get that particular Barreled Action, which was blue printed at the Savage factory and not offered in any of their other current rifles! Though this chassis is Really Cool, and I just about talked myself into keeping it, ultimately I decided to stick to my original plan to build a dedicated, heavy, bench gun. My loss is your gain. (?) If you have a Savage short action with a Stock mounting screw spacing of 4.400"" (just over 4-3/8”), then your action should work! All aluminum, modular design allows you to customize the chassis to your needs (see links below). The included front-end is a very lightweight surround with M-Lok slots machined in it, for the most flexible mounting of accessories possible! The rear-end is Foldable and equipped with an AR Buffer Tube, so you can choose between any Mil-Spec Buttstock available (comes with a Magpul CTR buttstock)! And maybe the Coolest feature of all...you can slide the grip module to get the correct distance for your trigger finger length!!! The chassis accepts magazines Compatible with short action AICS (Accuracy International Chassis Systems) pattern bottom metal. I have a brand new, 5 round Magazine that I would sell with the chassis for an additional $30. (Accepts cartridges built on a 0.470"" case head such as 7.62x51/.308 Winchester, 7mm-08 Remington, 6.5mm Creedmoor, .260 Remington, .243 Winchester, and others).

..From the book ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN GUN DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE L.R. Wallack (i will include a copy) ""The story of modern rifle accuracy is the story of benchrest shooting and that story has been told by Warren Page in a book entitled The Accurate Rifle also published by Winchester Press. We started the game of modern benchrest shooting in a big way over Labor Day weekend in 1947 in John- stown, New York. Actually, the first man long ago who laid down behind a log and rested his rifle over that log was the first benchrest shooter. There was a flurry of that sort of shooting in the days when Harry Pope and George Schoyen and others made those wonderful barrels back in the 1890s and early 1900s. But, by and large, the game was ignored un- til the late Harvey Donaldson invited a number of shooters to a match that Labor Day weekend. I was one of those honored by the invitation and the late A1 Marciante and Nick Papernek accompanied me."""

Believe it's a 43 or 44. Has been converted to .308 with a chamber adaptor, barrel is stamped 7.62 NATO. Rear sights were milled off and the receiver was drilled for a scope mount. Currently has a Williams peep sight mounted for a rear sight. I don't know anything about the history of this rifle, all the modifications were done before I got it. Needs a little tuning, after shooting a few clips the brass will start sticking in the chamber. THIS RIFLE IS NOT READY FOR THE SHOOTING RANGE. It is a decent project for somebody with some gunsmithing skills. Not much of a collector piece due to receiver mods."

The rifle is in excellent shape and although it's been hunted, taking deer, hog and bear, it likely has no more than 100 or so rounds total through it. The rifle comes with the original SS Ruger rings.There is a scope mounted and bore-sighted on it now available at extra cost. The scope is a like new Burris FFII in 2-7x35 with the hard to find German #4 reticle. The reticle is excellent and much better in low light than a standard duplex type. Rifle as is, minus scope is $575 (firm). The scope can be included for $125 more. I will also switch out the burris scope for a mint Leupold VXI 1-4x20 with Heavy Duplex reticle for the same price. I will discuss the switching of the Boyds stock to the original synthetic to those interested. Best I can recall is it shoots the same in both.

This rifle is factory built in Romania and was imported for just a few years. Import year on this one is 2000. My favorite thing about this rifle other than the fact that it shoots an extremely common and inherently accurate 223/556 round is that i don’t have to worry about cheap steel cased ammo that i wouldn’t run in my ar. I really like this rifle, however my uncle invited me down to the valley to go hunting with him for New Years. I’m not a rich person by any means so that means when it’s time for a new firearm one has to go first. Mainly looking for cash right now as I’m already pretty set on a rifle that i want. Rifle will come with 4 very hard to find German weiger mags. Three of the mags are still wrapped up. Taking this add down Friday if it doesn’t sell."

I purchased this from a distributor with some residual cosmoline for $170 about 6 months ago. It's in tough cosmetic shape and is likely one of the thousands from the SAMCO auction. Athough it looks beat up, after I decosmolined and oiled it up, it shot a box of soft-tip PPU 158gr flawlessly with little recoil. It had zero failures to feed or fire, and the trigger is crisp. The rifling is clear and in great shape. The bolt is in pristine condition. The only con to this rifle is one of the trigger housing group screws doesn't want to break free and could probably use some help from a drill press to crack it loose. This was going to be a winter scout rifle project but unfortunately plans have changed and she's gotta go! Mass EFA-10 or I can also ship to a C&R FFL or regular FFL, so long as the buyer picks up the shipping cost. I have additional photos I can provide also. Thanks and ask away!"
