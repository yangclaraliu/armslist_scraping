This is an early gen 4. The new parkerized finish they went to is junk and scratch’s extremely easy. The gun is mint. Has 2 backstraps and 3 mags. I’m pretty firm on the price at 500$. It took me a year to find a 19 gen 4 with this finish. They are rare. No trades. Text REDACTED

I bought it a few years ago, and it has sat in my safe unfired. I finally put 60 rounds through it the other day, and at 50 yards it makes nice groups. The internals of the Mk22 rifles are the same as the GSG-522 MP5 style .22's. So the tricks and mods for those work on these. I was all in the tacti-cool 22 thing at one point, but that was then and this is now. The stock folds too, and is adjustable. These type rifles like high or hyper velocity ammo. You can shoot the standard velocity bulk stuff in it, but you may get a few FTF or FTE if you go that route. I shot one mag of SV and it did fine except for one FTF. With HV not one problem.You can get mags and parts easily. I have already done the screw upgrade kit for the bolt assembly. The optic is a Firefield brand and works well for plinking at the range. I moved here a few months ago, and I don't shoot as much as anymore since I don't have property like before. Cash is nice, or if you have a bolt action 22 in good condition or a bolt action centerfire that is functional but may need some clean-up an even trade works too. I'm in Moses Lake, but travel to Kennewick. I can also do Wenatchee or Spokane."

Selling an excellent condition, lightly used Smith and Wesson M&P 40 compact pistol with factory installed Crimson Trace laser grips.  Gun has about 500 rounds through it and other than some very light holster wear, is in perfect working condition; laser is great and responsive too.  Comes with a case, orginal manuals/paperwork, first round fired through it from the factory (still sealed), and 3 interchangeable palm swells/grips.  I also have a Storm Lake 9mm conversion barrel so that you get two calibers for the price of one.  Pistol comes with (2) ten-round capacity 40cal compact magazines (one with pinky extension) and one full size 9mm magazine (17 round capacity).  
Also included is an in-the-waistband Comp Tac hybrid leather/kydex Minotaur holster specifically made for the S&W M&P 40c.  It comes with velcro clips but if you want, additional holster clips can be bought directly from Comp Tac. for pretty cheap  Lastly, for an additional $115 ($600+$115 = $715), I've got over 400 40 S&W Ball rounds (180gr Winchester White Box and 165 gr Federal American Eagle) as well as over 20 hollow points (mostly hydra-shock).  
Great gun that has never been abused and I'm only selling because I decided to go with an M&P Shield.  Asking $600 for the pistol package and $115 for the ~430 rounds of ball/hollowpoint ammo.
If you would like to purchase this M&P 40c, you must be legally able to own a firearm and have a valid Florida's drivers license, and we'll need to fill out a bill of sale. Cash Only. No trades. I'm up near River City Market place and the airport, but am also willing to meet you someplace reasonable.  
Feel free to text me anytime with questions at seven five 7 8 nine seven six 4l8. 
Thanks for looking.

The size is comparable to a Ruger LCP, S&W M&P Bodyguard 380, Taurus Curve, Beretta Pico, Sig Sauer P238, and other .380 single stack sub compact pistols.
