The shotgun was made in 1985 and is in excellent mechanical condition, with some finish wear to be expected in a firearm of its age. Comes with a cheap nylon QD sling that holds 10 shells on it, as well as a SideSaddle 6-shell holder on the receiver. I don’t know who made the barrel shroud, but it’s definitely a reproduction, and it came with the gun. It fits very tightly on the barrel, so it won’t come off during firing. It’s funky, but I can guarantee you won’t see another one like it around here. It looks like a 1907 bayonet would fit on the lug, if you have one to try. $225 cash takes it home."

It’s made of steel, is brown color and has two locks. It’s not fire rated but helps keep your guns safer, away from kids and protected. Can be screwed to studs through back wall, holes already at 16” on center. Selling for $205 at Walmart, mine is in nice shape for $100.EDIT: This gun safe is a turd. I now remember why all my rifles and shotguns were sitting in the bedroom closet - The top shelf in this safe does not move and therefore you can NOT fit standard length shotguns and rifles in it! The shelf appears to be tack welded in, so unless I can bang it out with a hammer, or maybe take a torch to it, I'll likely set it to the curb. Oh, and those red AkroBins? They stick so far into the safe that you can't have any guns in the middle area of the safe. Out of all my weapns the only thing I can fit in it are the 44 magnum carbine and my old Winchester Model 61."

Well here it is. This is a 9 shot Hi Standard R-109  22 caliber (Short, Long, Long Rifle) revolver with a 3 inch barrel. The finish is bad and the right grip is cracked and chipped. However, it shoots good, locks up tight and timing is correct. So if you're looking for a Beater Gun, here's your chance. (Besides the parts alone are worth this price.) More photos availabe upon request."

It uses any and all AK-47 mags. Comes with the: “UltiMAK Vepr II” Optic mount from Primary Arms: http://www.primaryarms.com/ultimak-vepr-ii-vepr-k-scout-mount-m3-bupper for mounting any and all optics. Using a quality Red Dot Optics allows you to co-witness with your manual sights. It has a beautiful sporter wooden stock with matching forearm, that can be easily converted to a folding or slide out stock or any other stock configuration you like. Russian Molot manufactured, and imported by FIME in Las Vegas. FIME has been importing the Arsenal rifles. All Molot VEPR made 7.62x39 AK variants are now banned on import to the USA. Only reason I'm selling this one, is I have two that are just alike. Both are “LNIB” and a coin toss picked this one to sell. The 16.5” chromed lined and Russian machine gun barrel is extremely well balanced, and shoulder's to sight level instinctively, like an extremely well balanced hunting rifle. The VEPR 7.62x39 was the base gun used in the very expensive Krebs Custom AK. I use to own that model Krebs, until I got my Molot VEPRS's. I have had them all, including Arsenal's, Krebs, etc. and these VEPR rifles are more accurate, and higher quality in build than any other AK platform that I have seen. The Molot VEPR is made from the Russian RPK machine gun, and has the RPK-style hammer forged chrome lined barrel and the RPK-style 1.5mm heavy stamped receiver. It gives the VEPR extra strength, without the extra weight of a milled receiver. You also have to consider that it has the RPKstyle reinforced trunnion block. These guns were made to shoot thousands of rounds. Seek out on the internet, the youtube video of one of these rifles in full auto, shooting so many rounds, one after another, that the front wooden forearm stock catches fire from it getting so hot, but still shooting. My price is $1100. Comes with original box and two mags. Original Red Russian mag in pic does not go with gun. Don't buy an overpriced Saiga converted AK or any lower end Romanian Wasp AK's, they will not have the quality, accuracy, built in toughness or re-sale of this VEPR rifle, and you will pay as much or more for them, and very rarely will you know the person or persons that did their conversions or head spaced the gun properly. Russians know how to make AK's they invented them. Stick with a Russian made AK- 47 or one of their variants. I am a private gun owner, and just selling off a few guns. (No Fire Sale Here, but you will save some money.) I only own and have purchased quality firearms. Because of arthritis many of my guns have never been fired. I Will require a “Bill Of Sale” and proof of Alabama residency (AL. DL) to anyone of legal age, on all firearms that I sell. Will only consider pistols as trades. TEXT will not be answered."

This was my dream gun for a very long time, however I need money for a 3D printer and for some of my other projects.

If you think that my rifle is to expensive than please go to Gun Broker, there you will find SVT-40’s for about $1600 which you can pay to have shipped to a store, and then you can pay the stores fee to hold the firearm and tax on the rifle. I know this because that is what I had to go through to get it.
