Has a medium profile 1:7 twist to stabilize the heaviest of bullets. 69 or 77 grain do great, though stabilizes lighter bullets to MOA just fine. I have tested dozens of muzzle brakes and this style has the least recoil (shoot it and see).. It also has an Armaspec 2 spring buffering system to kill whats left of recoil. The flip up sights co-witness with the faux Trijicon MRO red dot perfectly. Just a few shots through it for deer season. Many expensive extras. The BCM handguard is nice for transitioning the Magpul MS4 sling from single point to two point when carrying on the back. This is a lightweight setup perfect for any .223 or 5.56 ammo you can feed it. You wont flinch firing this.  Added an Odin Works Extended Mag Release 2 since taking pics.  Selling all my guns."

Bead front sight. The bluing on the receiver and barrel has worn off in some areas but there is no visible rust. This shotgun has seen some use but has been well taken care of. No major scratches, dents or dings. Original wood. The stock has some hairline cracks and a repair has been attempted but it looks like the repair was never finished. It also comes with a spare wood stock that has some cracks in it but it appears no repairs have been attempted on that spare stock. Forend is original and in very good condition. The action is extremely smooth. The Wingmasters were the best made 870's and made Remington famous in the shotgun world. This is a true work horse of a shotgun. Newer post 2007 Freedom Group 870's cant come near to the quality of these older shotguns. This would made a great candidate for a hungting shotgun with some attention to the buttstock. Also great for cerakote or even a short-barrel shotgun project using a 870 action without worries about new Remington quality control. I havent payed any special attention to the finish on this shotgun and it has held up great over the past year. I know two people with NEW 870's that cant keep the rust away. One of them was rusted when they picked it up at the dealer. New walnut stocks can be found on gunbroker or Ebay readily available. Or try your hand at repairing one of the two stocks that come with the shotgun.I also have a Choate +5 mag tube extension in original packaging. These retail for about $45. I will include for an extra $15 or will sell outright for $35.Serious inquiries only."

Been offered one for $400 & I have no problem with that but there seems to be a quality control problem with butt-stocks. I don't want one where the butt-plate sticks out past the wood or fit is so bad that you see daylight between the plate & the wood or where the stock fails to fit the receiver. The one that I have in 44 mag. has none of those issues. I just want another one in 357/38. I will travel for an hour from Hernando county for a face to face meet provided we have each other's phone #. Will require good photos. Registered user this site since 2012 with CWP. Thanks"
