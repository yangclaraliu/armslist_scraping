Originally contracted by Winchester, the deal was for Kodensha to manufacture export firearms exclusively for Winchester, and only for the Japanese market under any other trade names. By the mid-1960s the Kodensha facility was running smoothly and no longer needed Winchester expertise very badly, while Winchester needed shotguns from Kodensha. Kodensha began exporting firearms under the Nikko trade name and other brand names (e.g. Golden Eagle, Shadow, Miida). The shotgun’s finish on the metal parts is at least 95% with very little visible signs of wear. The checkering on the stock and fore-end is still well defined and there is a minimal amount of scuffs and dings that show. The barrel is 30” in length with a vent rib and chokes are Mod/Full. Everything fits up nice and tight. A exceptional gun for the price. We have additional higher resolution pictures of this item available upon request.
