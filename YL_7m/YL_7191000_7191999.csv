I am the second owner and the first owner (a friend of mine) never shot it. This rifle was purchased around the late 90's early 2000's and has literally 3 rounds down the barrel. If you know anything about Cetmes, they are the father of the H&K G3. They are not easy to obtain, especially an older one like this is in the condition its in.The barrel looks like a mirror and the rifling is very strong. Finish is around 99%. This is an older version so it does not have a pictinny rail on it. It is missing the bird cage flash hider. As i stated before the previous owner never shot it so when i took it out to fire the loose barrel device flew off and i could never find it hahaha. With that said the threads look great! She just needs a muzzle device. The original brakes are pretty cheap and can be bought on clear view investments for $7. The reason for me parting ways with this amazing firearms is due to me focusing more on kalishnikov platforms instead of the G3 style. I need the safe space and this rifle (while very collectible and reliable) doesnt fit my current interests. It comes with a mag holder and 2 mags. Mags for the cetme run around $4 and this cetme will take HK mags but they are a little higher in price. Not in a hurry to sell, price is firm."

I bought it a couple of years ago and it is in great shape and has not been used much at all.  It might have been shot a couple of dozen times at most.  The crossbow comes with cocking rope, an extra quiver with 3 Luminok arrows and field tips as well as a 4x32 Barnett scope. What attracted me to this bow was that it only had a 16” power stroke and still produces speeds close to 375 FPS.
This bow is incredibly accurate and ready to hunt and has more than enough power to take down large game! Due to the small limbs, it is very easy to hunt out of a blind with it.

I can ship a few boxes per sale or sell by the case. I can take a credit card! Shipping fee is included in price, credit card fee included in price. Exact final details, total price, shipping info, etc., to be agreed upon by email and/or preferably a phone call to me at cell phone REDACTED.  I can't look at my email every single day, so please call me. I'll be happy to respond through Armslist, or directly at REDACTED.This is the very dense 15 gram/cc premium ammo that has been discontinued for several years, more dense than lead or Hevishot. This ammo holds very tight patterns and is great for long range/pass shooting. Tight patterns, the density, the number 2 shot size, and 1450 muzzlevelocity all make this a heavy hitting load at 45-75 yards. And good loadsat long ranges will kill at shorter ranges. This is ideal for pass-shooting geese, coyote blasting, and probably large ducks at 30-50 yards. The #2 pellets have a very high retained down range energy, similar to a 1300-speed BB Wingmaster HD load, and are superior to any steel or half-steel load at long range. Downrange ballistics is an area where facts are hard to come by, but I expect Heavyweight will hold a tighter pattern and greater pellet energy at longer ranges compared to any other product, especially steel.These loads are comparable to the Hevishot Goose loads (blue box) in 3"", 1350 speed, 1-1/2 ounce, B shot size, very good high density ammo sold currently. Muzzle energy is comparable, lighter by 4%, but Heavyweight shot is very much more dense. The 3"" Federal shot charge is lighter but faster. Heavyweight is significantly more dense than even Hevishot and will probably hold a tighter pattern with better retained energy at long ranges.  The Hevishot B load would have more pellets (around 82) and less energy per pellet.The Federal muzzle energy and pellet energy is very similar to old Remington Wingmaster HD loads in 3"" / 1300 speed / 1.5 ounce / BB shot size = ~69 pellets. Federal muzzle energy is 3.6% greater. The faster #2 Heavyweight pellet energy is most comparable to these 1300speed BB's. You're getting something extra for your money with the very high density load. You're getting a little more effective range, near the maximum for any 3"" goose load. These should not be considered as identical to the Hevishot B. A tighter pattern and higher pellet energy make for a longer range load. These work great in my SBE2 with a factory full choke; the pattern seems tight enough. They will probably work great for you.I've shot a lot of Heavyweight in 3 and 3.5"" at paper with a Browning Gold and a SBE2 with different chokes and at different ranges. I've shot a lot of #2, #4 and the #6 turkey loads and recorded the patterns. My personal opinion based on all of this is is that the Heavyweight does pattern tighter than Hevishot or lead BECAUSE it is more dense, and that this is generally true. This is some of the best and most expensive factory ammo ever made to kill large ducks out to 50 yards and geese out to 75 yards. In spring '15 I shot a 3-year old gobbler from about 68 yards away, both of us standing out in the open, in a field with no cover. The shot put it down and I had plenty of time to ""run"" up to it and finish it off with a 2nd shot. And this was the #6 1300 speed Heavyweight turkey load, SBE2, factory full choke.HD ammo is now $4 to $5 per shell plus shipping from the larger online retailers. The only HD ammo widely available is Hevishot Goose in the blue box, at around $45-50 per box of 10.  Similar (100% HD) coyote and turkey shells are $5 too. The older HD waterfowl loads are long discontinued, and only HeviMetal is available at a nice price, but these are 1/2 steel.  Heavyweight is some really nice ammo and is still available! I wanted the buyer to be able to use a credit card so I arranged for credit card processing.  With the credit card info over the phone we can skip mailing a check, skip Paypal (which disallows ammo purchases like this), and the buyer is protected in the normal way from fraud by Visa/Mastercard. I've bought many things online and always felt comfortable when usinga credit card. I've bought firearms a few times where I had to mail away a postal money order to some dummy a thousand miles away and justhope it works out okay. I believe I can take a debit card. Shipping will be UPS Ground."

I am the second owner and the first owner (a friend of mine) never shot it. This rifle was purchased around the late 90's early 2000's and has literally 3 rounds down the barrel. If you know anything about Cetmes, they are the father of the H&K G3. They are not easy to obtain, especially an older one like this is in the condition its in.The barrel looks like a mirror and the rifling is very strong. Finish is around 99%. This is an older version so it does not have a pictinny rail on it. It is missing the bird cage flash hider. As i stated before the previous owner never shot it so when i took it out to fire the loose barrel device flew off and i could never find it hahaha. With that said the threads look great! She just needs a muzzle device. The original brakes are pretty cheap and can be bought on clear view investments for $7. The reason for me parting ways with this amazing firearms is due to me focusing more on kalishnikov platforms instead of the G3 style. I need the safe space and this rifle (while very collectible and reliable) doesnt fit my current interests. It comes with a mag holder and 2 mags. Mags for the cetme run around $4 and this cetme will take HK mags but they are a little higher in price. Not in a hurry to sell, price is firm."
