It comes in the original case with the wrapping plastic, price tag, warning tag, manual, SIG sticker, cable lock and two eight round magazines. Perfect all around 9mm for EDC but I usually prefer a revolver for that role so I'm just listing it to change it up since I don't use it but I would definitely have no complaints about holding on to it either if nothing else comes along. All Federal and MA laws will be followed. If you have any questions just ask. Thanks."

Pick your Model 94 and pick out your target.Generations of performance. It was a Model 94 just like this one that many of your grandfathers and great grandfathers first hunted with. Starting at the turn of the last century it was THE Whitetail gun for decades -- and remains as proficient today as ever. With today's superior ammunition -- designed specifically for lever actions -- the Model 94 is as relevant as any bolt action for many hunting situations. When speed and natural pointing is the priority no rifle beats the Model 94 Carbine.Call or text anytime: REDACTED"
