I use to carry my paintball gear in this thing, which worked amazing and then some, but I sold most of my gear and haven't played in years. Bag is in great condition, all zippers work, buckles work, NO rips or tears...bag is built like a tank. These things retail for about $330, I am asking for $120. I am willing to ship but there will be shipping cost and with it's size it will not be cheap (if supplied with a zipcode I can get a shipping quote).Here are some specs on the bag:   - 40”X15.5”X13.5”   - 40” main compartment   - 1600 Denier   - Heavy duty oversized wheels and bottom skids   - Rugged corner guards on all corners   - Double self retracting handles at each end   - Light colored interior for better visibility   - MOLLE/ALICE-compatible interior panel   - Adjustable inside loop-sided dividers   - Replaceable fiberglass laminate frame   - Reinforced, rigid ends and bottom   - Lockable YKK® zippers   - Name tape and flag holders   - Markable name strips   - Business card holder and document pocketMessage me with any questions! thank you!"

It has been lightly sanded at some point but the boxed FJA, proof P, and sub-inspection cartouches are all still intact. The ordnance wheel was either not applied or was so lightly struck that it is no longer present. Stock has cross-bolts rather than reinforcing pins which is correct for the rifle's serial number. Metal parts are also correct in manufacturer and correct and original in finish (i.e. parkerizing and bluing are original and correct for each respective metal part). Rifle will include a Seaville manufactured front sight cover (correct cover for SC rifle).Can provide 23 quality full resolution photos via email or text message upon request. Asking $950.00"

It is a Yugo capture Mauser M98, which as you may know, was what all modern bolt action rifles were modeled from. The rifle itself has seen better days, the bore is dark and there is some barrel bulge around the 16” mark, could it be cut down, yes, but a 16” barrel for the 8mm round seems less than desirable. Because of the barrel condition I have included a brand new blued military stepped barrel in 30.06. Also included are a Mauser scope mount and rings. Plus I am tossing in a box of 30.06 ammo and an extra ejector… why, because I can. This is a project that will need to be worked by a capable person/smith before it is fire worthy. I am getting a fair amount of interest in this, but let me say this, no I won't sell it for $75 ""because it needs work"", project would imply that and the new barrel alone was $150 so keep that in mind."
