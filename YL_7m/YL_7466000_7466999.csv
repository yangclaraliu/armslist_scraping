Compact, accurate and completely trustworthy, the REC7 is designed specifically for situations in which there’s no room for error. Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life.
This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine.
The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance.
The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.
The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance.
At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance.
The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 Class 2 hardcoat anodized and Cerakote finished. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension."

Built entirely of aluminum, the fully enclosed magazine allows for no separation of ammunition during function to easily handle firing rates of up to 1100 rounds per minute. Due to the side-by-side staging of single stack ammo, the magazine profile is four to five inches shorter than a standard 30-round magazine, making the rifle easier to maneuver.  The patented tension relief technology prevents malfunctions and allows for a virtually unlimited number of spring loads. In addition, the Cerakote coating allows for friction reduction and proven reliability without lubrication. User friendly ergonomics and the ability to use your sling makes this the choice magazine for 3 gun competitors.  X-Products is an innovator in the AR-platform, especially with the creation of their high quality, high capacity drum magazines. This manufacturer also produces uppers and accessories that are tough, compact and sharp-looking.

Lee Hardness tester. $66.0023. (3 of these) Lee mold handles $15.00 ea x 3/$45.00Total value $1711.00 in equipment.......BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!!599.5 pounds lead that I mined off of the pistol berms at Cascade Shooting Facility in Ravensdale. This lead is what I was using to cast bullets, and it runs a consistent 12.5 hardness by the Lee hardness tester listed above. 12.5 is the hardness Elmer Keith used to make his reputation over 5 decades of shooting. It runs just fine with that lube and any fouling comes right out of the barrel with just a few brush strokes and a good bore jag, unlike so-called ""hardcast"" which can take severe measures to get out. This lead has been smelted down into biscuits (cupcake size), that run 2 pounds or a little more each. Photo is the one with six buckets.196.5 pounds pure lead. This is lead I got from job sites that came in sheets. We were putting up lead backed drywall for x-ray rooms. Would be great for muzzleloaders or cap and ball pistols. It's also in biscuits. Photo is the one with two buckets.27.5 pounds pure Linotype. I got this in a big bar like they used in newspaper printing years ago. I broke up the bar and poured it into biscuits running about 1 pound each. Photo is the one with the single white bucket.Total amount of lead 824 pounds. That's 5,768,000 grains of lead, or enough to cast 46,516 (124 grain) 9mm bullets, 32,044 (180 grain) 40 S&W bullets, or 23,072 (250 grain) 44 magnum Keith bullets. Just to give you an idea.....Lead runs $2 a pound. $1648.00 value. Total for all this at any store that had it all would be $3,359.00 and that's BEFORE tax. I'll let it all go for $2,400.00. That's a $950 dollar discount, even before they tax the piss out of you and slap on the extra $350 bucks in this commie state. I would consider selling all the lead in one shot for $1250.00, or all the gear for $1300.00. I might do a partial deal on lead or gear, I just don't want to be selling 10 pound here and thirty pounds there. I'm getting rid of this stuff because I flat don't have time for it, so I don't have time to be trucking small batches of stuff all over bejesus either, you guys understand I'm sure. Also have a bunch of cast bullets (from these molds) in 9mm, 38/357, 44, and 45-70 and a bunch of casting safety gear (gloves, face shield, leather apron, arm sleeves) that I'll throw in for free, along with a Lyman Cast Bullet Handbook (4th edition), and a copy of ""From Ingot to Target"" by Glen Fryxell (best casting manual there is)."

Mixing and matching optional buttstocks, forends, recoil pads, and barrels let's you customize your Model 500 receiver into a specialized slug gun, waterfowl gun, home defense shotgun; and also change the LOP for varying statures. The FLEX 500 uses any standard Mossberg 500 barrel, giving you an endless choice of lengths, chokes, and sights. FLEX?TLS components mount and remove from the gun in seconds—without tools. The Mossberg FLEX 500 All-Purpose comes with a vent-ribbed, ported barrel with twin beads and 3 Accu Set screw-in choke tubes (F, M, IC). A straight synthetic butt stock with stout recoil pad reduces recoil, and the textured synthetic forend provides a secure hold when cycling the action. The ultra reliable Model 500 pump-action shotgun uses dual action bars, dual extractors, an anti-jam shell elevator, and a large locking lug for a solid steel-to-steel, bolt-to-barrel connection. Shooters can reach the top-mounted safety quickly with the thumb of either hand, making it naturally ambidextrous.

One is flush to the grip as in the photos and the other has the finger extension. Aslo incuded in the original back plastic Walther pistol case is a gun lock, Walther PPK/S Safety and Instruction Manaual, Crimson Trace Laser Grips Onwers handbook and Installation Handbook...  all in like new condition. There is also a factory fired casing still in the sealed envelop. The deal lslo includes 125 rounds of ammo...  One box (50) of PMC 90 gr, full metal jacket (FMJ); one box of Magtech 95 gr. jacketed hollow points (JHP); and one box (25) Hornady Critical Defense.Additional photos available."

Comes with factory box, factory reading material, factory lock, etc.  Also comes with 100 rounds of various .308 Winchester / 7.62 NATO loads (will NOT sell seperate).  Majority of ammunition is brass case - reloadable, soft point.  
 
Rifle also includes aftermarket sling, along with factory 3x9 optics (was told by several sources was manufactured by Bushnell for Remington, but no brand name listed).  Rifle does NOT include buttstock ammo holder as pictured, as it was sold.  
 
This is a clean, newer rifle that has been used for strictly range duty and lives the majority of its life as a safe queen.  It has not been scuffed up or beaten up by the woods -- as it hasn't been a hunting rifle.  This will make a fine platform for a hunting rifle though.  
 
Price is relatively firm, as I do not need to sell -- only selling due to change of interest for projects.  Will only trade towards Springfield M1A or M1 Garand."

Absolutely beautiful condition besides one scratch that can be seen in the photos. I would love to trade but I'm in need of the cash. Maybe if someone was to offer a lot of cash + something I really like? Price is relatively firm. We can meet at an FFL and transfer the rifle as it isnt an AR/AK platform but it accepts AR mags and another model accepts AK mags. Comes with one Pre-Ban 30 rounder and that it. It does have a flash hider but it will be removed prior to transfer but we can always work something out. Any questions or concerns let me know and we can talk. REDACTEDI will not be able to meet until this upcoming monday 10/23 but if we come to a deal I'll stay true to it regardless of other offers.Thanks for your time
