I'm not a complete idiot and understand some of the requested items are worth more than mine, I can add cash on my end but don't expect to get full retail for your trade as I don't either. If you are going to value your trade at full retail pricing then i will do the same so don't ask me to add $200-$300 on top of mine for your used firearm with a real trade in value at 60% of retail pricing (I challenge you to find a better trade in value at any shop right now). If I am paying full retail then I'll just go get it at the shop, lets all be realistic here people, this is the craigslist site for guns afterall. All my prices are marked below retail and above LGS trade in value (thats how private sales work, I dont understand how people can ask for more than retail on this site for their USED firearm) and I don't believe they are WAY out of the spectrum. As I said before I'm trying to trade instead of sell. I frequent Issaquah, Bellevue, Oak Harbor so any ffl you want to meet at in those locations let me know. Willing to travel elsewhere/meet halfway if very far.Will supply more pics on request. Please respond with the same."

A right-handed shooter that had never fired this rifle hit the 10 ring @ 1000yds on his third shot, prone, off bi-pod. This is an excellent setup to get started in long distance shooting.

I actually own this same model pistol. Next to my vintage Star, Super B, the JA32 is my favorite pistol to shoot. Look all you want, but I am the only dealer selling this model brand new with these custom grips.  The sights are extremely simple and basic, but they work well. Very easy to keep on targe. recoil is more controled than a .380acp. Still a big enough round for self defense. Until the late 1980's, most European law enforcement used the .32acp round for their primary hand guns. Time tested design, which is basically the same as the old Jennings, Lorcin, and Bryco guns, but finished better. Comes with two 6 round mags.  Very hard to find, as the factory seldom makes this model."

If you aren't familiar with the P250, it's Sig's modular handgun. This means the only part that's a registered firearm is the trigger module, meaning the frames, barrels, etc. can be shipped without an FFL and interchanged easily (i.e., changing the color/size of the frame is easy and inexpensive!). This is an excellent system if you want one to carry and one for the range, or maybe a couple with different sized hands both want to shoot. I'd prefer a cash sale but will reply to all trade offers as well. Please contact me with any more questions. Thanks!"

It is basically a new rifle but with a better grip and trigger. Comes with the factory box/receipt and I will throw in the ammo that is in the mags(80rds).  The Scar 17s is a highly sought after weapon. All trade offers must be in my favor. Face to face only.

The sights are original and period correct as are all of the other components. Condition is excellent, refinished to like new condition. The blue finish was nicely accomplished and matches Winchester blue perfectly. There is no rust or any pitting and all markings are clearly legible. There are only a few very minor handling marks and I'd grade the blue finish at better than 98%. The stocks are also excellent, free of any cracks or chips, and with the excellent wood-to-metal fit. The buttstock shows a couple of very tiny handling marks while the 12-groove forend is free of any wear. I'd grade the wood about 97% overall. This rifle functions well and locks up tight. The bore (which is not relined and has the correct 1-16 twist found only on the .22LR) is in excellent condition too...sharp with bright rifling and free of any pitting or erosion.The Model 90 variation was manufactured between 1919 and 1940. The serial number of this rifle places production in 1923. If you've ever wanted an super nice Winchester .22LR pump to shoot then you've found a nice one here!"
