The rifles are really nice and actually exceeded our expectations. This rifle came to us from the Slovenian Arsenals where they were evidently assigned after the dissolution of Yugoslavia.Yugoslavian SKS rifle, semi-automatic, manufactured in the famous Zastava Plant - 7.62x39 caliber Yugoslavian PAP M59/66: Produced between 1967 and 1989. Added 22 mm rifle grenade launcher which appears visually like a flash suppressor or muzzle brake on the end of the barrel. Front sight has a fold-up ""ladder"" for use in grenade sighting. When the grenade sight is raised, the gas system is automatically blocked and the action must be manually cycled—rifle grenades must be fired with special blank cartridges, and this feature helps ensure that the gas pressure is not wasted on cycling the action. The gas system is not automatically unblocked when the sight is folded, however, and must be manually opened to again allow semi-automatic operation.[15] Barrel was not chrome-lined. Both the grenade launcher and grenade sight are NATO spec. Stock is typically made from beech wood."

I've decided to sell it to fund a custom build in the same caliber. I listed as Remington because bergara wasn't and option under manufacture.  This rifle started as a Bergara B14 hmr. The only change I made to it was adding the KRG Xray chassis. I've shot exactly 300 rounds through the barrel. The rifle is sub moa and very capable of hits out to 1000 yards. My friend has already purchased the factory stock from me so that is not available. I had better accuracy with the xray chassis anyway. The xray chassis by KRG is a complete aluminum v block bedding system with polymer attributes and is compatible with aci-s magazines it has adjustable length of pull and adjustable cheek piece. if your not familiar with KRG (kinetic research group) Check them out online.  I've included the extra length of pull adjustment pieces that came with the chassis and also the included moe picatinny rail pieces and hardware for attaching other accessories. This rifle comes with a leupold mark 4 er/t scope 4.5-14x50mm with the TMR reticle and M5 MRAD 0.1adjustments TURRETS. It's mounted on night force rings.  it also comes with a Harris bipod, and a atlas mono pod. General info about the rifle is- 6.5 creedmoor 22inch hand lapped button rifled barrel with 1 in 8'' twist. Action, barrel and trigger all manufactured by bergara of Spain. The barrel is threaded to accept a suppressor or brake. If you want all the details on  this rifle check out bergara rifles online  and they list all the rifle info under the B-14 hmr rifle. The bolt on this rifle is fantastic. Very smooth and comparable to a Tika action. Only match grade ammo has been fired through the gun and I've had my best luck with Hornady match 140gr ELD. May get better with handloads but I didn't try any. Same hole at 100yards with factory ammo is hard to beat IMO. I'm not trying to beat anyone up on the price of this rifle but I'd also like a fair shake on  it. 'm listing it for $1850.00  OBO which I think is plenty fair. This isn't a crap rifle by any means and wouldn't even consider selling it if I wasn't so tight on cash at the moment. If you have any more questions about the gun or are interested shoot me an email. No trades and not willing to ship. Cash  sight on scene deals only.

The pistol lacks a manual safety; instead a de-cocking button is placed on the top rear section of the slide, which when actuated, places the firearm into double-action mode. The SW99 features several safety features including a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide, a protruding, red-painted cocking indicator, and a drop safety. As with the P99, the cocking indicator does not protrude from the slide of the QA variant unless the weapon is fired, as it is in a constant partially cocked state. The SW99 also features a fully supported chamber design, which leaves no portion of the chambered round exposed.  If you see this posting the Firearm is still for sale.Sale includes:-SW99 9MM PISTOL-IWB Hybrid holster-2 10RD MAGs-Hard plastic pistol case.Sale For: $320.00NO TRADES: Cash Only.All applicable laws will be observed in the sale of this firearm.

Shoots beautifully! It comes with 4 magazines: two 30 round, one 10 round, and one 5 round. I’ve also got a 50 round box of ammo to go with it. I’m asking a rehoming fee of $400 (open to other offers), to make sure it goes to a caring home. It’s just been sitting in a safe, in my closet, and I feel like it would be in better hands, with someone who could use it more often."
