The Sa vz. 61 was designed for reconnaissance units, tank crews, Special Forces, and for security forces of the Ministry of Interior. The Sa vz. 61 was developed to fulfill a specific need: a firearm that could be worn like a pistol (in a holster) and capable of full automatic fire. The design of the Sa vz. 61 was unique in its time. It uses the following common operational features found on a submachine gun: an unlocked bolt, magazine inserted into the bottom of the receiver (outside of the pistol grip) and a folding stock. These common features are combined with the following characteristics not usually found in submachine guns: extraordinary small size, fires from a closed bolt, and uses a rate reducer to slow full automatic fire. The Sa vz. 61 offered by CzechPoint is the semi-automatic version of the original military issued firearm - it is as close as one can get to owning the legendary vz. 61 submachine gun. Except for removal of the full-auto parts and rate reducer, and three modified parts with new safety, this firearm is like those used by Military and Paramilitary units in nearly 20 countries around the world.  As shown in the photo, the Sa vz. 61 finish is comprised of a blued lower receiver with a black paint upper receiver (paint cured at 300 degrees fahrenheit)."

This gun comes with a standard and pistol grip stock. It has a barrel brake for reducing recoil which can also be used as a weapon (check out the thick, jagged teeth in the picture). It has a barrel shroud to protect the shooter from a heated barrel. It also has a picatinny mount on the receiver on which you can attach any type of scope to it make it an excellent deer hunter. Very accurate slug shooter (again, Youtube).  Imagine the stopping power of a 437 grain slug moving at 1500 FPS. You can customize this gun with many available options, such as a 6 shell saddlebag that attaches to receiver and/or a magazine tube extension to load more shells at one time. These are a couple options I was consiidering. So, if you're interested in a versitle home protection weapon, please send me an email and I'lll let you see it."

Looks like some terrible cerakote job or black paint was applied to the frame. Slide was cerakoted or spray painted gold, but I was able to get it all off. Home polished internals. I've put some rounds down range and despite the home upgrade shenanigans this pistol runs good. Zero malfunctions for me. Looking to trade for something prettier. Thanks for looking."

'E2' (pronounced 'E-squared'), or otherwise known as ""Enhanced Ergonomics"", is SIG Sauer's attempt to make the large frame gun more ergonomic for persons with small and medium-sized hands. A reduced grip size and reduced reach trigger bring the trigger face back more than 13 mm (0.5 in), thus potentially allowing better trigger manipulation and control for a greater number of shooters. Other standard features include the Short Reset Trigger, aggressive grip finish texture, and a new wrap-around, one-piece grip panel configuration.[20] The gun was discontinued from the P226 model lineup at the end of 2010 but the E2-style grip system has been adopted on and carried over to other P226 variants.Email or Text REDACTED"

The superior craftsmanship and accuracy of the model 70 rifle prior to 1964 (when they made a huge price cut in the Assembly of the rifles and started cutting corners and assembling them in a new factory) is what is making them so popular today.  This rifle was produced in early 1954 and overall is in superb condition. The bore is bright and clean showing little use, and the original finish on the gun is at a rating of 95-98%. This gun is cartridged in .270 WCF making it a very early .270 cal Rifle. Original 1950s leather sling, Bushnell Scope Chief 4X scope, and Redfield mounts.  **Serious inquiries only** **extensive pictures of rifle can be provided** **original firearm owners manual and scope recipt/manual intact with rifle**"

In response to the need for a variety of light and small handguns, Smith & Wesson began revisiting the 642 eventually landing on the 642 Airweight. Due to the gun being constructed of scandium, the firearm weighs less than a pound when unloaded! This particular firearm is in excellent condition."

Need cash asap, hopefully today... It is in very good condition & hasn't been fired yet, so its pretty much like new. It is pretty nice and put together great. It also has a chrome  bolt which is better from what ive heard. It would come with two 30 round P Mags and a steel 20 round mag. Ive bought a decent amount of custom parts so it has a Magpul handgaurd with rails on it, basic Magpul buttstock, and the nicer upgraded Mapgul handle that has adjustable back straps and the front part is adjustable to. I have a Magpul flip sight for the rear sight, and the handle looking type rear sight that takes up the rail, but i have a rail that attaches to the handle also. It is real nice and the condition of the gun is like new. It doesn't have any cheap parts on it either, Id honestly prefer it over any of the lower priced popular brand ARs without hesitation. If interested or have any questions or an offer please get ahold of me asap. Thanks!"

The safety/decocking lever, located on the rear of the slide, must be pushed forward to disengage the safety. The 7-round magazine capacity (effectively 7+1 in practise) is much lower than many newer service pistol designs. Due to its lighter-weight alloy construction, the PA-63 handgun produces more noticeable recoil than the similarly sized, all steel Makarov PM, and some shooters may note an increased tendency toward muzzle flip with each shot. This tendency can be reduced by replacing the stock recoil spring with a stronger one, readily available as an aftermarket item. Many of the objections raised to the PA-63 have to do with its perception as a military service pistol in the tradition of the American M1911A1, the Russian Tokarev, the German Walther P38 and P-08 Luger, or the Browning High-Power. As its design can be traced back to a German pocket pistol intended for a weapon to be carried a pocket or under a coat rather than in a holster on the battlefield, these objections are perhaps understandable. After the fall of communism in 1990, the Hungarian army and police units initiated a program to replace the PA-63 with pistols using the NATO-standard 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, first the imported Jericho 941, followed by the domestically produced P9RC, but the PA-63 is still in service in Hungarian law enforcement. It has been largely phased out in Hungary, but due to the large number produced, they are a popular and affordable surplus firearm since they have begun to be imported to the west, namely the United States."
