Ammunition is loaded using .356 diameter “TMJ” copper plated ultra-hard lead-antimony core projectiles, which are swaged, plated, and re-struck. TMJ bullets have no exposed lead, therefore avoiding lead exposure upon firing. They are individually sorted by weight to the nearest 0.2 grains to ensure highest accuracy.Only once-fired military and police brass is used in loading, which is acid washed / processed to SAAMI specifications and electromagnetically inspected for thin walls and defects, to ensure safe internal tolerances.In our loading process we only use the top quality powders and primers. Powder is dropped to +/- 0.1 grain accuracy to ensure the highest accuracy.Velocity/ Pressure: 1,215 FPS (SAAMI pressure)Note: This ammunition is visually inspected in bulk and packaged by weight. This ammunition defers from our other auctions as it’s not case gauged and individually inspected by piece. A small count of these rounds may deviate slightly from our typical specifications and may (or may not) contain slightly off-seated projectiles or similar minor functional defects. You will receive more rounds than ordered for the chance you find an unsatisfactory round.These are professionally loaded by a bonded / insured type 7 FFL."

Ammunition is loaded using .356 diameter “TMJ” copper plated ultra-hard lead-antimony core projectiles, which are swaged, plated, and re-struck. TMJ bullets have no exposed lead, therefore avoiding lead exposure upon firing. They are individually sorted by weight to the nearest 0.2 grains to ensure highest accuracy.Only once-fired military and police brass is used in loading, which is acid washed / processed to SAAMI specifications and electromagnetically inspected for thin walls and defects, to ensure safe internal tolerances.In our loading process we only use the top quality powders and primers. Powder is dropped to +/- 0.1 grain accuracy to ensure the highest accuracy.Velocity/ Pressure: 1,215 FPS (SAAMI pressure)Note: This ammunition is visually inspected in bulk and packaged by weight. This ammunition defers from our other auctions as it’s not case gauged and individually inspected by piece. A small count of these rounds may deviate slightly from our typical specifications and may (or may not) contain slightly off-seated projectiles or similar minor functional defects. You will receive more rounds than ordered for the chance you find an unsatisfactory round.These are professionally loaded by a bonded / insured type 7 FFL."

These 5.56 bolts will drop in any AR 5.56 platform. You simply remove your exsiting Bolt Carrier and replace it with the UTM. For more information, please check out their website. These bolts are very hard to find and ordering through UTM can take many weeks and special certification.Another important detail to consider, UTM offers two different kinds of AR platform rifle conversions.  One of these is capable of fully automatic fire and the other in a semi-auto only. These bolts are not fully auto capable.  With that being said, there is no other differences in the bolts, only price.  These bolts can be purchased new between $200-$269.  These bolts are a steal at $125.00.  I am also willing to include SOME or all 350 rounds depending on quantity of bolts purchased. 11 Bolts available      $125/bolt350 MMR rounds availableTags: simunition, paintball, airsoft, force on force"

About Advanced Triple Curve armor: with Advanced Triple Curve, instead of bending formed plates in 2 different locations they have custom tooling to give the plates a nice curvature to best conform to the side of your torso. Spartan Armor Systems is the FIRST in the industry to commercially offer triple-curved Spartan Omega AR500 Body Armor. Spartan Armor Systems’ ATC body armor allows the operator to shoulder their weapon with the most freedom and limited discomfort. The ATC armor better “hugs” the operator’s body, resulting in a significant increase in comfort.

Overall, the rifle is in good condition, but it is visibly used, but functions flawlessly and all internals are very clean and unworn. Like most of these classic lever guns, it obviously hasn't had many rounds through it.  Other than a patch of thinning bluing on the top of barrel, the blued finish is very nice, but the stock looks like it spent a little time in the sun in a truck's gun rack. It isn't trashed or anything, so I never felt it warranted going to the trouble of doing a refinish job (and I actually like refinishing gun stocks). You can see the yellowing and worn spots in the varnish in the 2nd photo, that's about the extent of it.I pulled the scope and rings off a while back, it's back to it's scope-less ""natural state"" now, and I've since dialed in the iron sights (and I'll still include the scope and see-thru rings).  I'm placing this at a $450 trade valuation, which is a great price for these uncommon ""Texan"" variants, with the straight stock and lever. Buyer must be legal to own firearms, and be a legal Georgia resident with valid ID. As always, I'll show my ga DL and carry permit. Prefer meeting just north of town at the Chevron on exit 19 (Mulberry Grove), or north Columbus around Williams rd/N veterans pkwy, on days I'm in town.If the ad is still up, I still have the rifle!! Sorry, I don't text, or even call, until I'm sure I'm dealing with a legitimate local buyer !!! (And again....IF THE AD IS STILL UP, THEN I STILL HAVE THE RIFLE!!)Thanks for looking....."

This revolver comes with the folding grip with pocket clip and a 22lr cylinder. When folded the grip coversion the trigger and reduces the overall size of the gun. This revolver has notches in between each chamber in the cylinder so that you carry with all 5 rounds in the cylinder. The hammer rests in between rounds and does not sit on a live round.The folding grip makes the gun a pleasure to shoot. You can handle the magnums well with the grip. Anone who has shot the magnums with the original grips knows that the gun shifts upwards/backwards in your hand after you fire it. I have probably shot at most 30 22 magnums and 100 22lrs through the gun. This is a great gun for snakes. The 22lr shotshells leave much to be desired in terms of performance. The 22 magnum shotshells are a totally different story. At 5ft they penetrated the target paper and both sides of a cardboard box. The gun is tiny and very light. You will forget it is in your pocket or clipped on your belt.This gun is in perfect mechanical condition. It has no rust, dings, or scratches anywhere I can see. The only so called ""blemish"" is some slight ""wear"" in the finish where the grip slides into place (shown in pics).Mechanical 10/10Cosmetic 9.9/10Included is the revolver, extra cylinder, padded case, owners manual, and warranty cardPrice $240 shipped to FFL or local pickup.

These are NOT entry-level rifles, and are guaranteed to shoot better than 1 MOA groups.
Our rifles feature mil-spec upper receivers and forged billet lower receivers with permanently affixed 10-round magazines. 
The heart of any AR-style rifle is the Bolt Carrier Group (BCG), and for this, we made NO compromises.  Ours is a premium quality, Made-in-the-USA BCG that features a Carpenter 158 bolt (properly heat-treated and MPI tested), a chrome lined, 8620, M16-profile bolt carrier with a chrome lined gas key that features properly-staked Grade 8 bolts.
The next most important part of the rifle is the barrel.  We selected a 16” US-made match-grade,  1:8 heavy barrel with a Wylde chamber and carbine-length gas system.  The versatile 1:8 twist enables you to shoot 40gr to 77gr bullets, while the Wylde chamber and 11° target crown ensure top accuracy with either 5.56 or .223 ammo.
This rifle has a 15” Key-mod, free-float, full-length rail handguard.  Also included are two separate 3” Picatinny rail sections that you can use to mount whatever ridiculous accessories you think belong on an already perfect rifle.
The rifles feature black or OD green Magpul fixed carbine stocks, Magpul MOE grips, Trinity Force extended takedown pins (with a ring-pull rear pin), and YHM HD extended charging handle latches.  The magazine is stainless steel (not plastic).
Each rifle comes with a soft case.MassReloading is an 07 FFL (manufacturer) and appointment-only firearms dealer located in Littleton, MA.  Our rifles are built with the highest quality US-made components to ensure reliability and superb accuracy."
