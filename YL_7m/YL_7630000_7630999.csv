Beautiful gun, shoots better than I do. Comes with extra mags and original box. Slight ""idiot"" mark (I didn't do it I swear!) but I've read that can be buffed out on the stainless portion.This is a pretty gun but I prefer all stainless or all black, not really into the two tone theme. (That's why I'm also trading my Sig P226 Combat TB in another post) Also, I just like trading guns and playing with new toys. Current interests in trade include Sig Legion P229 in 9mm or Legion P220 in .45, anything Dan Wesson or other high end 1911s (I want to shoot them all!), Wilson Combat 92G. No striker fired pistols, I am not a fan of guns without safeties. Open to any offer but I have no interest in cheap guns, no interest in trading down in quality, I can add cash as necessary for the right deal."

Caliber is .38-40 Winchester. The 1892 is a lever action rifle with a 24"" round barrel and a full length magazine tube. The S/N is 348618 indicating that it was made in 1905. The overall condition is good. The rifle retains most of a blued finish, it is hard for me to tell if it is original. The markings are nice and sharp, the metal does not appear to have been buffed at all. The finish shows some high edge wear, some dings and light scratching. The plain walnut forearm and matching butt stock are in good condition, there is a slight crack where the butt meets the frame on the right side. One of the upper tang screws has been replaced by what looks like an 1873 lever lock. The smooth metal crescent butt plate is worn with a grayish brown patina. The bore is very good, clean and shiny for the most part. The action seems to function fine. Overall, a very nice Winchester 1892 rifle that will make a fine shooter. I can ship."

We cannot see any signs of being fired whatsoever. We are listing this piece as Used because it obviously had at least one owner and since it was sold to the initial consumer we cannot legally call it Factory New. HOWEVER as far as the condition status it is what we believe to be in 100% FLAWLESS CONDITION with no signs of ever being fired nor ""used"" in any way. It comes with a Colt Blue Box and Papers. Absolutely Stunning Condition! A must have for any collector! Do not let this prime investment pass you by. These Colt Python Models keep going up in value it seems like literally every day!

We cannot see any signs of being fired whatsoever. We are listing this piece as Used because it obviously had at least one owner and since it was sold to the initial consumer we cannot legally call it Factory New. HOWEVER as far as the condition status it is what we believe to be in 100% FLAWLESS CONDITION with no signs of ever being fired nor ""used"" in any way. It comes with a Colt Blue Box and Papers. Absolutely Stunning Condition! A must have for any collector! Do not let this prime investment pass you by. These Colt Python Models keep going up in value it seems like literally every day!
