What's great, is these are 100% completely built in the Zastava factory right next to their machine gun-counterparts. These particular AKs are built to last! The action is buttery smooth!There are (literally) a couple minor scuffs here and there that are hard to see. You're more than welcome to inspect it prior to purchase (assuming it's understood you're going to buy it as long as it's everything you expected it to be). **Update** I put 60 rounds through this at a 100 yards a week ago. This bad boy is spot on, and shoots amazingly. I used steel case non-corrosive wolf ammo. I am the second owner, with the prior owner stating he fired approximately 100 rounds through it. There is some very slight cant, which I can send a picture of, but the prior owner grouped it perfectly fine at 100 yards with no major adjustment needed out of the box. Accuracy was on-par with other quality AK variants. Cant in these particular models is common, and purely aesthetic. Does not affect function or accuracy (in this case) in anyway. Will include a polymer magazine. Call or text at REDACTED. Meet in East TacomaNO TRADES, CASH ONLY GENTLEMAN"

The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.
Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.
With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 - 8.5 pounds (27.5 - 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7N).
The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.
Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation �?"" one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol."

Backstrap installed and stippled is new, the reason its still nice and shiney, and is a medium. Its the only backstrap included. Gun has very light holster wear, mostly on the controls and not so much on the slide. Overall in really good condition for what it is. Included is the gun, 2 - 17 round mags, and all other factory stuff except the small and large backstrap. A gently used Streamlight TLR-3 with new battery $70. Also 3 holsters, a kydex IWB that I made myself (adjustable retention and cant), a Foxx Hybrid leather/kydex IWB $40, and a Texas Concealment System kydex OWB $60.

These were the Czech flavor of the WW2 bolt action combat rifle. It is chambered in 8mm Mauser and includes the historical bayonet. All metal parts of the rifle including the bayonet are black coated steel.The Czech vz.24 was produced in Brno, Czechslovakia ramping up to WW2. When Czechslovakia was annexed by Germany in 1938 production continued for a while before the plant was eventually converted to producing the similar, but coincidently more German, k98.Judging from the serial number it is likely this particular rifle was produced not long before annexation. Like most things in the region it eventually was captured by the Soviet army who then re-matched parts and electrostenciled their own serial to the bolt. Eventually it made its way out of siezed stock and found their way to the US. Despite what seems to have been quite the journey the current rifle is in great condition with a clean shiny bore. Stock looks great and is not cracked, but looks like it may have been fixed up somewhat by the military arsenals.This rifle has character, but still well built and shoots accurately. This is a great rifle to own for history, hunting, plinking, or collection."

Just about everything on it has been touched and it runs fast, precise, and flawlessly. It has a full wrap stipple job(Including thumb rest and front strap) with sunburst on the back strap and tree bark on the rest.  The trigger guard has a very nice undercut for a high purchase and confidence inspiring grip and is stippled on the front if you want to wrap a finger around. The magwell has also been recontoured and flared to allow for more efficient reloads. The barrel is oversized to create smaller tolerances between the frame and the slide. It is also chemically coated in titanium nitride and functions flawlessly. The DP Custom Works slide milling took a significant amount of weight off the slide and aids in quicker cycling. The added slide serations aid in chambering rounds from any angle. DP Custom Works did a factory finish on the gun that has proven excellent! Trijicon HD night sights have a crazy lume at night and are quick to aquire in the day. Every trigger component has been hand finished and polished and the sear has been milled taking the trigger pull down a bit. A full Apex kit has been added with the flat face aluminum trigger to top it off. I have 5 magazines in total. 1 is flush, 2 have extended baseplates that have been stippled to match, and 2 have a +2 HYVE kit on them. Look around. You will never find a shield with this much work for this price. I have around countless rounds through this machine and it runs flawlessly while feeding every type of ammo. It comes with 2 holsters- an IWB bladetech and a very, very nice Raptor Concealment Systems IWB or Apendix carry holster. Origional Box and papers. This gun is sweet and I will be sad to see it go but it's onto the next. I'm interested in trade for other way cool guns-CC preferibly but I'll look at anything you got!"
