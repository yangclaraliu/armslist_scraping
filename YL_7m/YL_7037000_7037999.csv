List price includes 240rds of 308 brass ammo, one (1) 10rd mag and one (1) 25rd mag, magpul angled foregrip, and bipod. Asking $1100 cash or for an additional $300 you can add a brand new Vortex 3-9x40 diamondback scope, viper rings, and offset flip up iron sights. No trades and prices are firm.I’m also looking to sell my custom Glock 30s in a hard to find FDE to fund another project.

Like new with a low round count (less than 200) and very light holster wear. I also installed Talon grips over the stipple for a more confortable concealed carry (I don't wear a t-shirt underneath and move around a lot) but that can easily be taken off if you prefer. I personally think that it gives it more character plus the stipple/talon combo has a very nice feel to it. Its valued at $950+ new with the upgrades and accessories.

What I've upgraded with this rifle:

*ProMag Archangel adjustable gooseneck stock.
*20"" Green Mountain blued .920"" heavy bull barrel.
*Volquartsen exact edge extractor
*Volquartsen Sure strike firing pin
*Power custom firing pin spring
*Power custom 10/22 ejector
*Ruger BX drop in trigger w/2.5-3lb pull
*Tactical Solutions barrel retainer Stainless Steel V-Block
*Stainless Steel V-Block screws
*Ruger 10/22 blued-matte round oversized bolt handle
*Leapers UTG tactical picatinny mount system. 

A fair warning, this is not a light gun(I measured 9lbs) but also don't feel it's overly heavy either. It's definitely a tack driver(very accurate with almost no recoil.) I'm also including with the purchase the original barrel, trigger assembly, stock, barrel band, weaver railing, firing pin, v-block, bolt handle, ejector, and mag release (can't find original extractor.) I also have a BSA 3x-12x scope w/rings I'll throw for nothing extra. 

Both the original and bull barrel went through the recommended break in procedures. Gun was purchased September 2016. Has about 350 rounds through the old barrel. New barrel was bought in May, has about 450-500 rounds through it and has never been stored for long periods of time(only owned 10 months.) Gun is in great shape, I'm just looking for an AR style .22lr. I purchased the gun for $300 and have about $450 invested into it. I'm only asking $400, firm."

Accutrigger works great as well.  Will include a 0 MOA railed base but no rings or optics.  Stock has some rust on the rear most slign stud but is currently the only cosmetic issue.  It shoots 1/2 to 3/4 MOA with 168gr and 175gr loads in factory condition.  This would be a great intro or production PRS donor gun given the ease of barrel swaps up to 6.5 creedmoor and availability of chassis and bottom metal kits.Price is $300 OBO. Cash, Money Order or Cashier's Check only. Will not take personal checks or PayPal.  Prefence to local deals first, but will ship to your FFL at buyer's cost."

For sale is a NEW Dan Wesson 715 6"" 357MAG Revolver.   PRODUCT DESCRIPTION The 715 is as it was before – designed and built to be the most accurate, rugged and versatile revolver on the market. Shipped with a 6″ barrel, the new shroud is designated the HV6, a heavy vent shroud profile that tames the .357’s recoil very well. The double action trigger is short and relatively light, while the single action is light and crisp. The target-like SA trigger pull made the Dan Wesson revolver a favorite among competitors and hunters, and the tradition continues in the 715. Barrel assemblies and grips are easily swapped by the shooter, and the 715 accepts grips and barrel/shroud assemblies from 15-2 model and newer revolvers. The original Dan Wesson revolver improved on the accuracy and service life of the traditional double action revolver design in a few ways. The tensioned barrel of the DW interchangeable barrel system enhances accuracy, pulling the barrel tight like a guitar string, enabling it to vibrate at the same frequency every time. The forward crane latch, located in front of the cylinder and paired with a rear ball detent helps to ensure proper cylinder/barrel alignment during firing. Superior to the rear locking designs of other revolvers, it adds to the accuracy of the 715. While the tensioned barrel definitely improves accuracy above other revolvers, it’s the consistent cylinder/barrel alignment that contributes most to the accuracy of the design. Additionally, the clockwise-rotating cylinder reduces stress on the crane, since it turns in the same direction the crane locks, prolonging service life and keeping everything tight. The 715’s frame is robust, built to handle the heaviest of factory loads. We will ship this revolver anywhere in the ConUSA for $30.  You must be legally permitted to own this revolver and are responsible for knowing your own local laws and regulations.  Feel free to stop by the store to check it out or give us a call for more information.  Thanks for looking!!!"
