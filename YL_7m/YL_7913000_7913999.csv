It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

It is in Amazing condition, with a deep blue that helped make early Colt Pythons legendary. This revolver spent the vast majority of its life in a dresser drawer. I see no handeling marks or loss of blue. The only thing I see worth mentioning is a slight mark on the bottom of the wooden grip that is not through the clear. This revolver locks up tight and the trigger pull and timing are superlative. I can see little to no signs of use. Hardley a ghost of a turn line.  You do not see these vintage Colts in this shape everyday. I have included pics, but due to the shiny bluing, it is hard to photograph. The last pic of the barrel roll mark appears to be chrome, but that is because the light reflecting off the brilliant bluing makes this revolver glow. *****I've had a few people ask if it is a hollow lug barrel. It is. This makes it a premium example for collectors.What I thought was the original box is included, but it seems to have gotten mixed up with another over the years. the hand written serial # on the bottom does not match,  it is  not in great shape, it is flat and is missing a couple flaps, but an original shipping label is present. I am looking for $3,000. I will accept partial trades for other firearms. I like Smith and Wesson revolvers, from the 70's and newer. I like most hand guns and rifles, so don't be afraid to ask. I would prefer a face to face transaction, but if you're viewing this from a state other than Ohio, I may consider shipping, but payment must be through US postal Money Order and we can discuss shipping cost."

The only reason I havent shot it in a while is because I simply cannot afford the ammo and have had alot of other expenses to take care of. I have put under 200 rounds through it and have religiously cleaned it after each time. If there werent any other things that I need to spend my money on I would keep this rifle probably forever since I love it that much.I am asking $1000 for it and will include everything that came with it as well as an extra p-mag and a CQB strap.I DO NOT want to trade for anything and will not accept lowball offers.

I received these when I purchased a small gun collection in Wilmington recently and used them to drive from the ocean to the foot hills, other than that they are completely brand new and look it too. Selling in two groups of 7 and not wanting to sell one at a time.These sell for $40 each at the stores. I had my price at $120, now I've lowered it to $70. Any less I just toss them in the trash. This is the LAST CALL, if they are not sold over the next 24 hours they are gone. This means I'm not going to hold them until the weekend, it means in 24 hours if I don't have cash in hand I'm tossing them in the trash after breaking them beyond use. Tired of dealing with tire kickers, do not message me unless you plan to show up.Columbus NC"
