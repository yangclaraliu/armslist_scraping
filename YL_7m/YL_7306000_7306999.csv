People didn't understand they were getting a genuine Swiss Hammerli pistol. Since then the plain Jane 4"" with black grips still only sells for $4-$600 on the usual gun auction sites. The 6"" version tends to sell for twice. Dozens of 4"" models. Not one 6"" for sale nationwide? Also the 6"" came in a regular version which this one is not. This is the factory ""competition version. With LPA sights, dovetailed and threaded counterweights, Swiss match barrel and Swiss Xesse fully adjustable Olympic grips. Not a swap out! This is what came with the comp version in the early 2000's. Some of these guns were marked New Hampshire back when they for sale. Even though they were all Swiss, some folks didn't care for that marking. This was a special order gun and is ONLY marked Made In Switzerland. Accurate as a laser as one might expect. But the tightness and smoothness of the action is what is the most impressive. Silky like an early Sig P210.

The barrels on these blowback uppers are simply threaded in with loctite. They do not require the specialized tools of a standard AR upper to be rebarrelled. Exactly 50 rounds have been put through this upper. It includes two 50 round magazines, one of them fully loaded. I will also include a 30 round 5.56 magazine that has had the feed lips removed.
