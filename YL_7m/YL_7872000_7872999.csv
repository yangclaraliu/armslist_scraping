Serial #:218137. Manufactured in 1916. Condition Very Good/95%+. I am Tom Klein, a former Curios & Relics licensee who has enjoyed seriously collecting quality firearms for over 40 years. When I reached retirement age with my passion for guns unabated, instead of sitting back in my rocking chair I upgraded to full blown FFL and established Heritage Arms LLC, located at 68 N. Main St., Sparta, NC., 28675. Heritage Arms specializes in Collectible and high quality pre-owned firearms. I purchase 1 gun or 100+ guns. Private and estate collections large and small. This Colt Model 1903 and a Colt Model 1908 (auctioning simultaneously) came to me this past week from an 80 year old gentleman who is gradually liquidating his father’s collection he inherited some 25 years ago. I have acquired severaI fine firearms from him over the past year and a half and have yet to receive one from that collection that was in less than 95% condition. The detailed photos speak for themselves. His father knew a fine gun. The only real flaw of any concern I can point out is a crack in the right hand grip that probably occurred by over tightening the screw. I have not removed the grips. However it does not appear to have cracked through into two pieces since it is not loose. In fact, it took me awhile before I even noticed it. This Colt has been in one family for two generations and I am pleased to be able to pass a classic along, perhaps to a younger generation collector who will also enjoy and care for it for many years to come. During the auction this Colt will be available for purchase in my Heritage Arms Store. If it sells the auction will be immediately terminated."

But hey, if you can get $5 for your not so rare $2 bill, more power to you and we can thank Reagan for Free Enterprise. Anywho, rant over. I have many overpriced firearms to look at!

The ability to store 2900mAh of energy and a max output of 8A (ampere hours) makes it ideal for NITECORE’s TM28, EC23 and Concept 1 flashlights and the HC33 headlamp. Specially designed for freezing temperatures, it’s able to power electronic devices at temperatures down to -40F, making it perfect for severe cold weather applications like mountain climbing, deep sea diving, arctic exploration and more. The battery is equipped with multiple internal safety mechanisms including a pressure relief valve to protect from rapid temperature increases, a microporous barrier to protect internal components and a high performance circuit that automatically protects from overcharge, over discharge and short-circuiting. An external nickel-plated stainless steel protector ensures resistance from impacts, good electrical conductivity and oxidation resistance. The combination of these internal and external safety mechanisms help to prevent battery damage and prolong battery life. The battery can be recharged over 500 times and provides a low cost and environmentally friendly power option that’s equivalent to 500 pairs of CR123A, making them a great choice to reduce power costs over time.

It does not have a rear sight, I dont see a place for one. Has a front sight bead. Does not have trigger assy. has trigger guard,buttplate,and bolt, light brown fore arm stock and butt all one piece no altering. Has some corrosion but still shoots great, Pull the firing pin back and let it go and boom. No safety switch except for pulling the bolt back and turn to the right to lock into position (temp) Note:If loaded do not let the butt hit the ground hard, It will set it off, very dangerous. Has holes for over the shoulder sling. I think the first owner put them there. It was given to me back in the 80's as payment for work done. Did'nt have trigger then either. It has lasted this long and will prob last forever! (not a gun for young Kids) Would be great for restoration for persons who collect old firearms. I was afraid to do any work to it. but it has been kept indoors and could be cleaned up to look pretty. Also on stamped on barrel it has what looks like (OP Mossbers and Sons inc). and 410ga,3 IN, Proof Tested. No73. I dont know what the value is for this gun, missing trigger assy. Could someone please E-mail me with info. And if the price is right I might just sell it. pluse shipping, wieghs less than 10lbs. My guess about 5-6lbs. Send me a note with your e-mail address and I will reply. Thankyou."

Unfortunately I do not have a case for this one except one that works for transport. Last time I had it out a few months ago it was definitely shooting like a dream, but with expensive repairs and no membership to a range long enough to let it purr it's on the block.I'm at least the second owner on this beauty, but the bore looks good, and there don't appear to be any condition issues outside of the pictured wear on the cheek rest.If you don't want the bipod, the price will be $825. Note: I will sell the bipod separate for $100 but only if the rifle sells without it first.More Pictures available at https://imgur.com/a/vNEsN"

A primary CREE XP-G2 S3 LED emits up to 360 lumens of light with up to 88 yards throw which can be used for running, cycling, setting up camp and so much more. For up close tasks, reading and photography, there is a secondary high CRI LED which produces a warm 20-lumen beam and renders colors and details better than cool white outputs. Last but not least, the NU25 also features a secondary red LED for preserving night vision, map reading and hunting. There are even three special modes (red caution/SOS/Beacon) for emergencies and signaling! Easy Dual Switch Controls Dual switch controls located conveniently on the top of the headlamp control white and red outputs separately and make it easy to switch between all three outputs so you always know what light you’re accessing. The NU25 also features a lockout mode to prevent accidental button presses while stored in tight spaces. Built-in Battery & Charging The NU25 comes with a built-in 610mAh li-ion battery that offers 30 minutes of runtime on Turbo and up to 160 hours on the lowest setting. Keeping the NU25 is super simple with a built-in micro-USB charging port located on the underside of the unit. Use the included charging cable to plug the light into any USB source and a red indicator light under the control buttons will illuminate. Upon completion, the light will turn green. There’s even a battery power indicator so you’ll never be caught with low battery again. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlhDMf3yfdk&feature=youtu.be  TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS    LED CREE XP-G2 S3 LED   Peak Beam Distance 88 yds (81 m)   Peak Beam Intensity 1650cd   IP Rating IP66   Impact Resistance 1.5m   Dimensions L-2.19″xW-1.36″xH-0.19″ (55.5mmx34.6mm23.2mm)   Weight 0.99 oz (28 g)(battery included)    BRIGHTNESS OUTPUTS    MODE OUTPUT RUNTIME   Turbo 360 lumen 30 min   High 190 lumen 5 hr   Mid 38 lumen 8 hr   Low 1 lumen 160 hr   Aux High CRI 20 lumen 6 hr 15 min   Aux Red (High) 13 lumen 7 hr 25 min   Aux Red (Low) 0.9 lumen 68 hr   Red Caution Light 13 lumen 13 hr   SOS 360 lumen —   Beacon 360 lumen —"
