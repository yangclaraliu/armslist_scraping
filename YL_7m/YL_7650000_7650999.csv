Its comfortable ergonomics, sleek profile, and rugged reliability are available to you at a price you can afford. Precision manufactured and engineered for endurance the Super X4 will continue to excel shot after shot, round after round. Featuring a 28"" chrome-plated barrel, a fiber optic front sight, and Active Valve gas system, the SX4 provides exceptional accuracy. The Active Valve gas operating system automatically adjusts to allow the exact gas pressure necessary to fire a wide range of loads, giving you a greater versatility on the range and in the fields. Improvements over the SX3 include an oversized bolt handle, bolt release, and trigger guard for easier access and operation with gloved hands in cold weather.The Inflex Technology recoil pad has been widened and thickened to further minimize felt recoil, making the SX4 even more comfortable to shoot all day long. A most noticeable change from the SX3 is the reduced weight and ideal placement of the balance point with a narrower pistol grip. These seemingly small changes greatly improve the swing and point of the shotgun, enabling you to get on target faster and more accurately. Lighting-fast operation, lightweight design, and proven reliability, makes the Winchester SX4 a great choice for both the hunter and sporting clay shooter. Includes:- Three Invector Plus Chokes: Full, Modified, and Improved Cylinder Features:- Hard Chrome Plated Chamber and Bore with Back Bored Technology - Aluminum Alloy Receiver- Fiber Optic Front Sight- Invector-Plus Choke System- Gas Operated Active Valve - Self Adjusting Gas System- Inflex Technology Recoil Pad- Black Synthetic Composite Stock- Textured Grip PanelsSpecifications:- Type: Semi-Automatic- Gauge: 12- Chamber: 3""- Barrel Length: 28""- Capacity: 4 Rounds- Length of Pull: 14.25""- Drop at Comb: 1.75""- Drop at Heel: 2""- Length: 49"" - Weight: 7 lbs - Fiish: Synthetic Black Stock CASH PRCE LISTED.

The pistol comes with only what is seen in the photos, the pistol and one magazine. For Armslist I’m only able to post one photograph at a time due to resolution / file size. Please contact me for the rest of the photos – I have a bunch. I’m happy to meet at any FFL within sixty miles of Scranton to do the transfer. I also find myself down in Philadelphia once a week.

As the title states this is a Marlin model 917V .17HMR rimfire rifle with a bull barrel. Rifle comes with one 7 rnd magazine. Scope is a Bushnell 3-9 and can be included for an addition $30. I purchased this rifle used and it has had many rounds fired through it. I started having trouble with misfires so I took it to a gunsmith. He told me the bullet was seating too deep in the chamber and installed a spacer. The spacer did help but the gun does still misfire some. You can see that the firing pin hits the rim, but the bullet does not discharge. I image this can be fixed, but I don't use the gun much anymore and don't want to mess with it. This is half of what the rifle lists for MSRP on marlin's website, however I am willing to negotiate. I was also informed there was some trigger work done previous to my ownership."
