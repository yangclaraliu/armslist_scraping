The ambidextrous mag release was a design feature unique to this model. . The Glock 21SF is a version of the .45acp Glock 21 that utilizes the Short Frame (SF) which is based on the standard G21 frame (same width), but reduces the trigger reach from the back of the grip by 2.5 mm (0.098 in) and the heel of the pistol is shortened by 4 mm (0.16 in) so the trigger can be reached and operated better by users with relatively small hands.

ZEV's Fulcrum is the best on the market and currently holds several world records. The Professional Trigger bar assembly greatly enhances the feel of trigger pull through the built in adjustments. One of the first things a Glock; owner should consider is upgrading the stock trigger. The Fulcrum PRO Trigger Bar Assembly only requires one tool (a standard 3/32nd punch), and 15 minutes of your time.You will immediately notice the difference in your guns performance after installation:The trigger face is flatter and the trigger safety is three times wider than a stock trigger; this is ideal for quickly placing your finger in the optimal firing position.The trigger shape will also help build proper muscle memory for improving consistent accuracy.Because of ZEV's Proprietary trigger bar refinements ensure trigger operates smoothly through the entire length of pull.The pre- and over-travel are non adjustable and pre set for a shorter pull and faster reset.Trigger adjustments will give the benefit of short take up, post break travel and will result in a shorter reset.Note: The difference between the Trigger Bar assembly and one of ZEV's Trigger kits is that the trigger kits allows the user to fully adjust the trigger pull weight which requires a different connector and spring combination. If you want to adjust the trigger pull weight please see one of ZEV's Trigger kits (Fulcrum Drop in or Ultimate Kit).ZEV parts always incorporate design, feel and performance. A Fulcrum Trigger will upgrade the look of your gun as our triggers comes in a selection of color combinations.Finally, ZEV Trigger components are designed to last, Replacing plastic stock parts with aluminum assemblies.

In USPSA Production Division, CZ pistols are now used by twice as many top-level competitors than any other maker. Given that popularity, it was high time to up the ante. Starting from scratch, CZUB engineers took the best features of the original Shadow and improved upon them. More than two years later, we’re seeing the fruits of their efforts. With a higher beavertail and undercut trigger guard, the shooter’s hand is able to be as close to the bore axis as possible. With a contoured slide, the majority of the reciprocating mass is also centered on the bore, equating to less muzzle flip. Increased weight at the dust cover/rail also helps keep the muzzle down. The Shadow 2’s swappable mag release has an adjustable, extended button with three settings to allow shooters to set it in the spot most comfortable for them. Best of all, new trigger components give smooth DA and crisp, clean SA while drastically reducing trigger reset. A hardy nitride finish coats the entire pistol, leaving it nearly impervious to corrosion. Thin black aluminum grips have healthy checkering to match the fine front and backstrap checkering of the pistol itself. Sitting atop the slide are a set of target sights — fiber optic on front and a serrated, black HAJO rear (click adjustable for elevation, drift adjustable for windage).

It is the largest one we have had yet. We want to wish you a Merry Christmas with a Christmas Sale from us and to also thank you for your support and business in the short time we have been open. Around 90% of the firearms are on sale along with all our holsters and many other accessories. These are our Rock Bottom Prices with No Room for negotiating at all on these. Many of these prices are too low to advertise, but give us a call or come by and we will be happy to let you know what we can sell it to you for. These prices are good from 12/11/17 to 12/15/17 in the store and what pistols we bring with us at the C&E Gun show this weekend 12/16/17 and 12/17/18. Many of the new pistols and a few of the used ones we will be able to offer Rain checks and take an order with 15% down if we have sold out of them, but many of them we can't replace or can't replace for the price, so they will be while supplies last. Please take your time to look at the list or come by as it is a very large sale. If a gun says massive sale and doesn't have a price, it is too low to advertise. However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season. Again, thank you so much for your friendship, your business, and Merry Christmas. Remember, Jesus is the reason for the season and don't forget to give praise to our Lord and Savior.

Para Ordnance built much of their sucess on this gun design and decided to take it one step further to accomodate operators in law enforcement, military service, and competition shooters. One of the inherent flaws of the 1911 design is the woefully small capacity, usually stopping at 7-8 rounds. The 14.45 boasts a double-stacked magazine at 14 rounds of .45 ACP making it vastly superior to other alternatives. This particular firearm is in excellent condition."

It is the largest one we have had yet. We want to wish you a Merry Christmas with a Christmas Sale from us and to also thank you for your support and business in the short time we have been open. Around 90% of the firearms are on sale along with all our holsters and many other accessories. These are our Rock Bottom Prices with No Room for negotiating at all on these. Many of these prices are too low to advertise, but give us a call or come by and we will be happy to let you know what we can sell it to you for. These prices are good from 12/11/17 to 12/15/17 in the store and what pistols we bring with us at the C&E Gun show this weekend 12/16/17 and 12/17/18. Many of the new pistols and a few of the used ones we will be able to offer Rain checks and take an order with 15% down if we have sold out of them, but many of them we can't replace or can't replace for the price, so they will be while supplies last. Please take your time to look at the list or come by as it is a very large sale. If a gun says massive sale and doesn't have a price, it is too low to advertise. However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season. Again, thank you so much for your friendship, your business, and Merry Christmas. Remember, Jesus is the reason for the season and don't forget to give praise to our Lord and Savior. God Bless.

It is the largest one we have had yet. We want to wish you a Merry Christmas with a Christmas Sale from us and to also thank you for your support and business in the short time we have been open. Around 90% of the firearms are on sale along with all our holsters and many other accessories. These are our Rock Bottom Prices with No Room for negotiating at all on these. Many of these prices are too low to advertise, but give us a call or come by and we will be happy to let you know what we can sell it to you for. These prices are good from 12/11/17 to 12/15/17 in the store and what pistols we bring with us at the C&E Gun show this weekend 12/16/17 and 12/17/18. Many of the new pistols and a few of the used ones we will be able to offer Rain checks and take an order with 15% down if we have sold out of them, but many of them we can't replace or can't replace for the price, so they will be while supplies last. Please take your time to look at the list or come by as it is a very large sale. If a gun says massive sale and doesnt have a price, it is too low to advertise. However if it sales massive sale and has a price, it is below MAP pricing but the manufacturer has been nice enough to remove their MAP on it for the Christmas season. Again, thank you so much for your friendship, your business, and Merry Christmas. Remember, Jesus is the reason for the season and don't forget to give praise to our Lord and Savior. God Bless.All SCCY Firearms are on sale this week for just $195. Many colors in CPX1 and CPX2. 9mm with 2 mags and trigger lock. Great customer service with this company. All $195 each plus tax.
