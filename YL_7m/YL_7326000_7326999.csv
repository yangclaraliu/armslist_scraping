Got on a trade. Never shot. Seems to be a Ithaca replica and comes with both a field smith bore barrel and a security barrel. Don't shoot it and thought I'd see what I could do with it. Has some wear on it but would make a solid truck gun. Not looking for trades but open to listen.

Being old its worn but I dont want the antique anymore now and dont want to put more into fixing it up but I assure you its functional even in its age.Has a few issues outside wear such as the trigger return spring is finally giving out but it works fine in single action as is. Other issue is that in a move the nut for the frame's retaining screw got lost. Could be jury rigged but as is its more a parts gun. Or at least I'd secure the screw first but thats the only issue firing this in single. This is a smokeless and not a blackpowder rated one from the 19th century too.

LCP NIB for $200 and the II for not much more. Check out gun.deals or reddit's gundeals subreddit. I only say that to, I guess, justify my asking price, because I've been seeing a lot of relatively recent listings from people asking full price for their used LCPs. If it's too low for you, then I'll just wait until I can drop a few extra dollars when the LCPs are on sale again. I just figured I'd give this a shot, because I wouldn't mind saving a bit of money by getting a used one.Located in Mason City, IA."

If you are unfamiliar Night Hawk Custom Their motto is ""one gun, one gunsmith"", here is a brief description from their website:""Bob worked with several of our Master Gunsmiths to build one of his most popular custom models. This literally involved months of training and preparation. The time was well spent, and has produced what we consider to be one of the finest and most unique models we have offered to date. This model incorporates several features that are new to the 1911 market, one of which is the new Nighthawk Everlast™ Recoil System™. This new recoil system allows a shooter to go at least 5,000 rounds before a spring change is necessary. Felt recoil and muzzle flip are also dramatically reduced. The proprietary barrel system is unique to any we have ever produced. The groups at 50 yards are beyond the capabilities of the average shooter.""The pistol will come with everything it did from the factory, 2 magazines, and it will include 2 holsters, one kydex and on Galco leather.Transactions will be conducted face to face only, I will not ship, they will be done at my local gun store unless otherwise discussed.Please feel free to ask me any questions.Thanks for looking."

We'd go shooting when there was open desert, With a heavy heart, the time has passed for enjoyment of these valuables . I truly hope the new owner enjoys them. This Weatherby has, imo, a stunning stock, let me mention, I have not cleaned these guns. No touching whatsoever. I don't think their fouled to any extent, I'm just pointing it out. For reference , I have a Bighorn Horn Armory 500 that I paid a premium price to have the upgraded wood. It doesn't look nearly as figured as this stock. And the bluing is just as stunning, it reminds me of the carbona bluing of the past or by Turnbull Restoration, the finish is pristine . Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with shotgun particulars. Confirmed the side of the barrel clearly indicates 3"" , as well as other markings. There are what i believe to be chokes and snap caps."

Included are the original case, paper work, holster, two keys to the mainspring housing lock and three Wilson Combat 47D 8 round magazines. I can only sell a handgun face to face with a Tennessee resident by law (for those that know please excuse that declaration. Though I have been asked repeatedly to be lax on the Federal law). All residence from other states will have to have it transfered via FFL. All FTF buyers I need a valid TN carry permit or other creditals I will also consider. I set the price at what I feel is a very fair price so list is not a ""OBO"" listing. Please message me is you would like more photos as I have quite a few or have any questions.
