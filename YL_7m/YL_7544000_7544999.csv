It is 7 months old. I bought two at the time and I love these guns. Say what you may about Canik but these guns are unbelievably smooth and fast and accurate shooters right out of the box. As well built as any of my Glocks. Easy take down for cleaning. The pistol comes with all the original factory stuff except holster. I am keeping it for my other one. I have to date 5000+ rounds through my OD Canik and the only issue I have is heavy slide wear on barrel. I promise you this. Try one and you will see how amazing they are. The FDE is a favorite color of mine. This one is very different then others I have. It is the 9x19mm and holds 18+1 and comes with 2 mags. Again this pistol is new and unshot. No flaws or scratches anywhere. I am looking for a FDE color first to trade for in a SUB compact. 9mm preferred or a .45 XDs is fine. Please note this. I am NOT trading a new gun for a used one. Don’t even bother offering. I am NOT selling, I don’t need your money. Laugh if you will but there are guys out there just like me that buy two and three guns at a time to play with and collect and shoot. I like to trade every now and then for a current need or whim. I don’t need or have to trade it at all. After 45 years of collecting and shooting I am in it for fun now. I will look at all offers of NEW gun trades. Pistol for Pistol, face to face, written bill of trade and ID ‘s on both parties. I am a current CWP holder and very proud of it. I am NOT wanting any .22, .40, .38/357 stuff. I have a safe full of those. I love Bird head revolvers in the 3.75” length fron Ruger, Cimmeron, Uberti, etc. .45ACP but will consider a .357, .45 LC, .44. I like Glocks, XDs, M&P in FDE only, and the only .22 WMR is the Keltec PMR 30 in any color but black. If you have a compact to offer I will look at it. Please send pictures with the trade offer of you want a response from me. You see my gun so let me see yours. I am in Winfield, Kansas. If this ad is still up it is still for trade only. Trade value depends on where you shop. $375-$450 is where they are right now and the more people find out how great they are. It will only go up."

Original barrel has been shortened and a front rifle sight added. Includes a B-Square scout mount at the rear mount. I'd consider the condition fair. The stock has a few bumps and bruises. The barrel has some minor pitting the full length but nothing that would hurt functionality and it may clean up. Everything seems to function well. I bought this about 10 years ago in the exact condition it is now, it is time to pass it on to someone else. These were some well-made mauser rifles and I would not hesitate to shoot it on a regular basis. With an IER or red dot scope added it should make a nice handling woods gun.

Overall Length: 16” Stock: None Features:   Finally available for public consumption is the much anticipated Scorpion sub-gun. Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 model year SKUs (91351/01351 and 91352/01352) feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.   Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.   Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.   The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. Starting at just $849, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck."

Also has dual weaver bases added for mounting a scope. I had a nice vintage scope on it (not included) until just before these pictures were taken. Has a nice walnut stock with white spacers and black butt plate and grip cap. Stock is in excellent shape. It has a nice custom bolt handle that is relieved to clear a scope that shows some beautiful craftsmanship. I suspect this custom was converted in the 70s or 80s based on the materials and style. I'd consider the condition to be Good+. This is a really nice example of a vintage custom that I have held on to for the past 10 years or so and it is time to pass on for someone else to enjoy.I will include an unopened box of 20 Prvi Partisan 7.65x53 Argentine Mauser rounds.

Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count. Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, the P224 will be available in a number of configurations. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same. The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns. As part of the Extreme family of handguns, the P224 will feature the distinctive black and grey Hogue Piranha grips, SIGLITE Night Sights and the SRT (in the DA/SA version).Specifications:Caliber: 9mmAction Type: Semi-automatic DA/SAMagazine Capacity: 12 rounds Barrel Length: 3.5""Weight: 29 oz"
