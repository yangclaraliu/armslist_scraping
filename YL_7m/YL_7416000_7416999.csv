The magazines hold 6 rounds and you can load one in the chamber.  It has a safety.  This is a great first time users gun or for self defense for someone who wants a low  recoil gun or doesn't like pulling slides back as it is not necessary with this pistol.   It is incredibly easy to conceal as a backup gun.  I am selling it as I have recently purchased another .22lr handgun and have no use for it any longer.  It was cleaned and lubricated after every outing by me.  I meticulously take care of my firearms.  It likes hot ammo like CCI Minimags, Velocitors and Stingers.  I am including 3 extra Beretta 6 round magazines, two Desantis holsters, (A Desantis Superfly pocket holster and a Desantis, leather Soft tuck IWB holster which was never used)  I am also including an additional nylon carry holster.  (Great for taking the gun to the range)  I am pricing this well below what I paid for everything.  The gun's serial number is DAA051705  The gun alone new retails for over $400.  The included extra magazines were $22.00 each.  The Desantis Superfly holster was $40 and the Desantis Soft tuck IWB holster was $25.00.  I am only selling it as a package deal.  Proof of Florida residence and age is required.     The price is firm.  Cash only or Paypal please.  Call REDACTED and ask for Dave for additional information."

I won this rifle in a raffle thrown by the Friends of the NRA (which is the only reson why that is engraved on the blank side of the reciever). The only reason why I am putting this up for sale is because I am a left handed shooter, and I get nasty burns on my right arm and neck every time I shoot it. Outside of that there is nothing wrong with the rifle at all.If you want more photos just ask, I several but only alowed to post 3.About the Rifle:This is chambered in 7.62x51 / .308. However, it is very picky on what type of ammo it will except. brass cases work best of course but do not even try steel cased ammo. steel case will not chamber easy or eject very well so I only used about 10 rounds of that and threw the rest out. soft points have a chance of getting hung up before chambering. This is the takedown model. I do have the soft wrap case and tool box that it fitts in after takedown. the tool box is falling apart though, so if you don't want it thats fine. The only tool needed is the barrel nut wrench, which is included.The rifle was sighted in with the shown Nightforce scope at 100 yards by the Friends of the NRA, Ive been accurate with it up to 250 yards at tacoma sportsmans club. I will consider selling both with or without the scope if you want it or don't want it.comes with two Larue 20 round magazines. Both feed without an issue (outside above ammo isssues)Gas block is adjustible for suppresed or unsuppresed fire with a tip of a bullet. the handgaurd is engraved with lables indicating which side is which gas setting. 18 inch pantent pending ""hardend steel"" barrel. Not sure on the twist rate.Two stage stainless steel trigger. Very light and easy to mannage.BCG is also patent pending.Bipod is a no brand one I ordered off amazon for about $60 as soon as I picked up the rifle from the FFL. No more then 200 round total have been through it. one box of 20 American Eagle 7.62 FMJs included.Trades:Everyone asks so I should think of something.M1a possiblyFFL transfer is not negotiable. someone shady always asks to avoid it and I won't budge, sorry.otherwise Ill take best cash offer.Thanks!"

The least that will happen is I might say no thanks. Just keep in mind this is basically brand new and only shot once (other than OEM factory spent case) so I feel like it's an awesome savings considering the upgrades I have done. Included:Glock 22 w/ 1 magazineBoxThe ONLY trade I would consider is a 9mm AR lower.P.S.- If you would prefer stippling the lower frame instead of the Hogue grip, I would be more than happy to do this work for a small charge. I can show pictures of previous work if you would like to see the difference it makes...I personally love the textured grip. I also always shoot with gloves so keep in mind it is very rough, think of very course sandpaper for feel."

Has only been shot once to test upgrades but cleaned once and every month just because I'm OCD hahaPlease make me an offer if the price isn't right for you! The least that will happen is I might say no thanks. Just keep in mind this is basically brand new and only shot once (other than OEM factory spent case) so I feel like it's an awesome savings considering the upgrades I have done. Included:Glock 22 w/ 1 magazineBoxThe ONLY trade I would consider is a 9mm AR lower.P.S.- If you would prefer stippling the lower frame instead of the Hogue grip, I would be more than happy to do this work for a small charge. I can show pictures of previous work if you would like to see the difference it makes...I personally love the textured grip. I also always shoot with gloves so keep in mind it is very rough, think of very course sandpaper for feel."

I am the original owner of the rifle and hand selected this particulair example from 11 of the same model for the outstanding grade of walnut used for the stock, including full side grain with the cross wave banding. I have fired less than 100 rounds through this weapon. This has always been kept in ideal conditions. I maintained it at very low humidity with bags of desiccant in a padded case (included) and always meticulously cleaned and oiled after use, which isn't very many times. The gun is very accurate. The last time I hunted with it, I took a mule deer with a shot through the heart at about 120 yards.The rifle comes with the padded soft case, padded leather sling, a pair of 1"" scope rings, 60 rounds of ammo and the original owners manual.You can buy a cheaper M77 .270, but not a very near perfect, meticulously maintained example, with an American Walnut stock you would be more than proud to hang on your wall, case, sling, 60 rounds and manual, all for a reasonable price. By the way, Ruger currently lists this model w/ the walnut stock for $979, without the case, sling, ammo (~$150) OR TAX.No trades at this time. Purchase must be facilitated through an FFL, buyer pays for transfer.  Thank you for your consideration and taking the time to review my posting.ScottCall or text: REDACTED"

This sight has a built in IR laser designator with a pressure switch that is built into the handguard. No visible wires. The optic is mounted semi-permanately directly to the barrel. The optic was used in combat before it came into my possession. Rifle has been professionally cerakoted half gray. Other upgrades include:-Geissele Trigger Pack-Folding Charging Handle-Upgraded Brass Deflector-Gasketed Chamber Port Door (prevents gas leak into your face)-Professionally stippled grip and bolt release-Metal safety switch-VTAC sling with QD mounts-3 PMAGs-Picatinny magnifier QD mount. -Iron sights are built in and the front flip up sight has a tritium post in it. Sight cowitness perfectly with the optic. I am a certified gunsmith and have babied this rifle. It is in excellent condition and is a ton of fun to shoot! Very reliable long stroke piston design. Id mostly like to trade this for an HK SP5K or similar pistol, but an open to considering anything. If you have a gun in the rough price range of this, please offer it up. Worst I can do is say no. Depending on your trade, you may need to add cash. I am willing to ship to your local FFL."
