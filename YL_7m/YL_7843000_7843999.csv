The macro pattern of Vias functions like the camouflage of the tiger and other predators, which rely on high contrast patterning to break up their outline and disguise movement. It doesn't hurt to mention that Vias looks pretty good on a rifle stock.

I have an all matching Yugo M48 Mauser with a great bore. Rifle is in great shape but you can tell it was issued at one point. I have put 20 round through it and it’s dead accurate, makes for a great shooter. I value this one at $350. Next is a Hungarian PA63 in 9 Makarov. It is all matching except the magazine. I’ve put maybe 200 rounds though it, they have a bite to them! This one I value around $275. I am looking to TRADE ONLY, I am not selling them. Only reason why is I have multiple of both and am just seeing what’s out there. I am looking for military surplus rifles and pistols mainly WW2 era but will consider others. No commercial firearms. Together trade value I see $625. I am interested in a German K98, M1 carbine in particular, open to others. Also would consider a Russian SKS or even an AK 47/74.

384,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7843384,For Sale:  Pattern Luger DWM 9mm Parabellum 1920,"Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee","$ 1,200","Listed On: Wednesday, January 17, 2018",Handguns,no type,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,no type,Pistol,"Near-excellent and desirably unit/precinct-marked DWM 1920 Luger...this Luger was reworked by DWM in the early 1920's for service with a German police agency. Constrained by the Treaty of Versailles, DWM was largely restricted from producing new weapons chambered in 9mm and, prior to Simson & Co. being contracted, these wartime reworks represented the bulk of interwar, 9mm Luger production. A handsome example, the pistol is identified as a police arm by the presence of a sear safety, commercial proofs, blank chamber and 'S.D.IV' on the front of the grip strap. A police property stamp, this marks the pistol as having served with the Schuzpolizei arm of the Dusseldorf police. Of interest to the collector-while the pistol appears nearly all correct, the thumb safety is numbered on the bottom in contrast to standard practice of putting the numbers on top. Likely a simple factory error, this may be a variant unknown to this writer. Otherwise properly marked, with matching numbers on all components, to include the grip panels, this non-import or export marked Weimar Police Luger is a fine candidate for having been brought back by a GI serving during the Second World War. With such examples becoming scarce on the market, this weapon would be a fine addition to the advanced or dedicated Luger collection. Near excellent, the pistol has seen no post-service refinish, restoration or refurbishment, with rust blue at better than 83% and strawed components right around 50% trending to a pewter patina. Most wear may be attributed to holstering and operation, with no rust or pitting present on any metal surface. Markinngs are both correct and legible, with the numbers matching as outlined above, and proper proofing. Importantly, the DWM script logo shows no sign of buffing. Wood grips are near excellent in line with the gun-showing only light wear to the checkering, they have no cracks, chips, repairs or other blemishes. Mechanical function is flawless, the action is strong, and the bore rates as excellent-bright with strong, sharp rifling beneath lint, there is little sign of use and no trace of wear. The pistol is neither import nor export marked. Includes one, wartime aluminum-based magazine."

Smith & Wesson's criteria for the shotgun were: 12 Gauge, pump-action, less than 30"" overall length, and 13-round minimum capacity.   The following features are standard on all UTS-15 models:   Bullpup design: pistol grip and trigger are located forward of the barrel breech and action assembly. This allows for the same barrel length as a traditional shotgun but shortens the overall length of the weapon.   Top mounted picatinny rail: allows for the mounting of a wide variety of iron and optical sights.   Twin magazine tubes: set above the barrel to allow for easy access to the loading ports.   Alternating or select tube feed: a selector switch located on the top of the tube/barrel assembly allows for use of multiple ammo types (i.e.: buckshot and birdshot; buckshot and rubber pellets; etc.).   Built-in laser/light controls: the right side of the grip is reserved for controls (a button) for controlling the optional light and laser assembly.   Threaded barrel: Beretta-style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to be adapted for any situation and a range of attachments."

This gun was purchased by me brand new a few years ago at a cost of just over 600.00. The Pro Series features factory night sights and has passed through S&W Performance Center which replaces the factory trigger with a beautiful enhanced trigger assembly. It has been carried very little and the slide factory finish shows no wear. The frame has been cerakoted in Tungsten which compliments the black controls and grips very well. I do cerakoting and I own a automotive paint repair business so I know my way around a paint booth and this job was done right. I used oven cure H series and the frame was cleaned and etched correctly. The coating is flawless. Gun includes 2 mags, 2 holsters,( a hard serpa holster and a soft leather holster, both made for this particular pistol). Also has a anodized slide plate but the factory one is included. Includes 3 palm swell backstraps as well as all factory papers, box, factory casing, etc.Edit: Almost forgot, includes a radetec LED ammo advisor grip. Ingenious grip that takes the place of the factory palm swells and tells you when you are running low on ammo. Has a mulitcolor LED that faces the shooter and will flash blue at 3 rounds, green at 2 rounds, red at one round, and rapid flash at empty. It's not pictured but included and that kit has one M&P magazine too so yo get 3 mags total. You can search youtube or Google for M&P Radetec LED for more info. This is big package for the money."

The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. The P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date. Note- Some CZ-USA dealers order special versions that vary from the standard configuration. This might be a difference in sights, safety mechanisms, finish or accessory package. From time to time you may find a P-07 with an extended barrel, tactical light, tritium sights or safety levers only. There are a number of special versions we ship throughout the year. May ship with or without a lanyard loop."

The 770 gets a lot of hate because its doesn't have the quality of the 700, even though it isn't a 700. I have had 0 issues with this gun, I get 2-3 inch groups at 100 yds off hand with Remington Core-Lokts, and can tighten up to MOA sized groups with pricery ammo and a rest. Now, is this the gun to take on your prized elk hunt or your $15,000 African saffari? Absolutely not, but you already knew that. Do you need a less expensive gun to beat around with or to hunt Tennessee deer with? This is your gun. Scope is a Sightron 4-16x42, I had it on an AR and it would put holes in holes all day long. Optics planet has it for $360, Midway has the same model, newer generation for $625, its a pretty good scope, at least as far as deer rifles are concerned.Would trade for handguns or other rifles.

Will need to be towed unless you live right in brainerd. $2,000 trade value.the boxes sitting on the front are brand new never installed fenders. I believe front and rear. I’ve never opened the boxes to find out. Has brand new plugs and wires, all fluids are good. It doesn’t leak anything at all. Distributor timing was set at a local shop last summer. The tires are still like new plus I have 3 of the original rims and tires. Brand new fuel pump, fuel pump filter and I replaced fuel pump housing with a used one. Yes the cheat hole is cut... tons of money into this car with little things like hood latch and things like that. I love the car but I’m more into the firearm hobby at the moment. THE VEHICLE RUNS BUT IS A PROJECT VEHICLE!!!!"

Price is $850.00 NO SCOPE INCLUDED for this sale. If you do not know the model it is the sporting version of SAKO's TRG sniper rifle. It has a 3 lug long Magnum action that shows very little bolt wear, no rings, fireing pin and ejector perfect. Rifle weight is 7.75 pounds, 24.5"" blued barrel with 11"" twist. I have been able to achieve sub 1/2 MOA 3 shot groups with 165 grains Hornady Interbond and IMR 4831 and similar with IMR 4350 while working up loads. I recently took the rifle into a local gunshop that has an experienced gunsmith/appraiser and his comment was ""Except for the dovetail ring mounts  where someone tightend down the old SAKO rings, and the few minor marks this rifle is every bit of 95% and I would feel comfortable sayin it is 98% excluding the minior issues noted. There is nothing wrong with this rifle I can see except these few minor cosmetic issues."" The rifle has two very lite 1/4 scratch (do not go through bluing) on left side by the front doevetail ( I imagine it happend when someone mounted scope rings) and minimal  wear on top of the action from taking out of the case and the minor issues on the dovetail rail mounts, which should be covered by rings. Over all I would agree witht the gunsmith that the blue is 98% with no hint rust, flecking, pitting, etc. It is darn close to as new. The crown and bore are pristine, barrel grooves are sharp and bore bright.  The stock has 1x 1/6"" indentation on the left side of the stock by the butt plate, the rest looks new, the original black butt plate too looks almost new with little or no wear. The origial clip/magazine holds 4 and shows as new. The rifle will need a good cleaning as I have her oiled her up pretty well for winter storage. More pics available on demand. Price of rifle is $850 plus actual shipping costs to your FFL from 04860 area code. Please don't try and lowball I won't sell for less, would rather keep it or give to a friend. I will consider partial trade of a Ruger 10/22 action in good condition (I can buy a used Ruger OME complete action for $100 locally so can't give more credit than that for a complete OME Ruger action) or possibley an upgraded action like Tactical Solutions or Volquartsen (but will not pay market price) or a decent bolt action 22 in good condition. I'm not willing to credit more than $300 on the partial trade.   Also available for an exgtra $100 (in seperate package) you can get:1-Newer (only about 50 reloads went through it) a RCBS 300 WM Neck sizing and seater die setAproximately 180 (or more close two two boxes)  .308 Speer SPBT bullets 180 grain2-boxes (90-95) Of .308 Nosler Accubond 125 grain bullets1 half box (40-50) Hornady .308 165 grain interbond1 .308 Tub Final finish bore polishing kit. I used 5 each of #4 and #5 compond which is the least course grit to polish the bore. 3 Dewy Jags and 1 nylon brush (.308) If you pick up locally will through in about 25-30 or my handloaded cartriges of 165 Interbonds. Buyer responsible for actual shipping USPS to your FFL and insurance cost (about $35-$50 for rifle and $15 for bullets, etc)   3 day inspection period from reciept of FFL, with gun back in as-is condition you cover shipping costs. This is my second M995. My first in 338 WM would shoot hole for hole at 100 yrds with 215 Accubonds when I was in Alaska. There is no reason that this one will not do it too. I did not spend a lot of time to perfect loads as I was in the process of moving when working up loads. I did have one 3 shot group that was just over 1/2"" at 100 yards (To be honest it was a 4 shot group, the last shot was a flier but it was my fault, I flinched on the trigger pull, but it was only 1.25"" off) This gun with a perfected load and a good shooter I suspect will shoot 1 ragged hole at 100 yards. I am aware that the market on these guns are down now. 10 years ago if you bought one for $1100 in this condition you would have been lucky. Say what you will but price any SAKO online and this rifle will be a good price an I know that this rifle shoot as good or better than any of them."
