Only shot to sight in. **Local pickup only**  *  Accepts and feeds from AR-style magazine   *  Features a fiber optic front and ghost ring rear sight  *  16.25"" medium bull barrel, threaded with flash suppressor  *  Top extended picatinny rail, plus 2 side-mount rails  *  Compatible with AR as well as LR308 / SR25 and M14 / M1A-style magazinesThe sope is a Nikon Force XR BDC which has a very nice 9-11"" eye relief. It has a Ultra clear coat optical system providing up to 95% light transmission. The scope is waterproof, fog proof, shockproof and holds up the strongest recoil since it was made to withstand the recoil of magnum pistols.The rings are Leupold PRW low rings.My Take: This is an ""all access"" type of rifle that has everything one needs to cover all their bases.  Great sights for quick target acquisition, smooth action for quick reloads, and a comfortable stock for a ""carbine"" style rifle. I'm impress with the weight and size and the trigger is crisp and light to shoot.  I used my M14 magazine to sight in and at 25 yards I put 10 rounds into a 1 inch circle. Mossberg did a fine job with this product.**Won't Ship, Local pick-up only**"

I have shot exactly 90 rounds thru it never malfunctioned once. I bought brand new for 649.99 added a Barska Illuminated Scope 1-4 ($150.00 bought from opticsplanet.com and is a great scope for the price read the reviews.) I also added a BCM Charging Handle ($50.00 bought from primaryarms.com) There is also a Magpul CTR stock ($50.00 bought from primaryarms.com) Also added a 7"" Quad Rail ($30.00 bought used from armslist.com) That's a total of over $925.00 I have in this rifle. It's in great shape and have all the original furniture that originally came with it. It's been kept in a BluGuard VCI vacuum sealed firearm bag. I'm not expecting to get what I got in it out of it just a fair trade both ways.         The second rifle I'm wanting to throw in on the trade is a brand new PSA. Its pretty much a factory asssembled rifle I bought a completed lower and a upper minus BCG and charging handle. This upper and lower fit very tight and is absolutely no play. The lower was $149.99 from PSA the upper was $299.99. Then we come to the charging handle and BCG. The charging handle was $30.00 from PSA and the BCG is the only thing that has been slightly used. It is a Daniel Defense BCG that I bought years ago that came in the paper tube with no engraving im pretty much shit out of luck on that so we will call it $75.00 lol fair enough. That's a total of 575.00 and is a brand new rifle besides the BCG.    I have over $1500.00 between both of the rifles. I'd love for you to feel free to ask any questions work out a deal come shoot them and tear them apart and go over them with a fine tooth comb if you like. I'm looking for a SIG, BCM or Daniel Defense but will consider and entertain any and all offers. Must come to me.

The light pipe is green, which will appear the brightest to your eyes. The reticule is a graduated crosshair, with rough range-finding and ballistic drop help out to 800. The body of this ACOG is anodized in a bronze-ish color, not Ceracoated. The color is absolutely stunning! I think the picture makes it look great, but is even better in person.The RMR on top is an RM01 with a 3.25MOA red dot. The RMR automatically adjusts it brightness with a forward-looking sensor.The ECOS also features an ARMS #19 quick-detach base also in anodized bronze color. There are also ""tertiary"" iron sights offset to the left-side of the ECOS.One addition that is not part of the normal ECOS package is the inclusion of the Trijicon TA91 killflash ARD (anti-reflection device).This sight is in 99.8% condition. It is almost FLAWLESS, with the exception of one tiny scratch measuring about 0.5x1mm at the 2 o'clock position on the eyepiece (you can see it in the pic). Apart from that, there is not any other mark or blemish to be found, no matter how small.I can email you more and higher resolution images if you like."

It is the upgrade of the SR models. Some people did not like the large loaded indicator bar that sticks up on the top of the slide as well as the squared slide so the 9E doesnt have the indicator on the slide and has the rounded slide for easy holster draw. Also the 9E has the better trigger. It is the same as the SR models. Comes with orange Novak 3 dot sights. It has very low round count, i have polished the barrel and feed ramp broke it completely down to get the factory gunk out and cleaned very well. Oil used is CLP and silicon oil. This pistol is very accurate and will react as fast as you can pull a trigger.  Contact me anytime at REDACTED. Thank you."

It also increases the back pressure which in turn can increase the reliability in a short barrel application where dwell time has been sacrificed for barrel length or the increased pressure is needed for sub sonic or weak ammo. The Barking Spider can be used on any barrel length but it really shines in short barrel applications.The Barking Spider is Modular in that it can accept multiple different end caps, attachments, and thread protectors. The Modularity allows the operator to tailor the weapon system for a specific application. The front end of the Barking Spider has an integrated striking device or glass breaker with 1 1/8"" wrench slots for easy disassembly making cleaning and maintenance a breeze. The internals come out the front leaving the body attached to the barrel. This allows you to pin (perm attach) the body to the barrel to meet 16"" OAL requirements yet still be able to disassemble the muzzle device from the front.The Barking Spider was specifically designed to handle full auto and high volume fire. The Barking Spider features a cutting edge blast cone design which is supported in both the front AND the rear. This feature not found on any other Krinkov muzzle brake eliminates the cone from sagging in extremely high temperatures.The Barking Spider is CNC machined on state of the art equipment using the highest quality materials available. The Barking Spider, patent pending, is 100% Made in the USA and features a Lifetime Warranty!---------------------------------------------------DynaComp End CapMaterial: Billet 4140 Chromoly Bar StockFinish: Heat Treated Black NitrideFeatures:Ball Dimpled Expansion PortsWeight: 2ozNOTE: Specifically for use with the Spike's Tactical Barking Spider 2 muzzle brakeThis particular Dynacomp end cap was specifically developed for the Spike's Tactical Barking Spider 2 muzzle brake. The Dynacomp end cap's design and construction is based off of our original and very effective Dynacomp compensator. Just like the original barrel mounted Dynacomp, the Dynacomp end cap drastically reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise allowing you to put more shots on target in a shorter period of time. It's threaded modular design allows you to quickly install and remove the end cap for different uses and applications."
