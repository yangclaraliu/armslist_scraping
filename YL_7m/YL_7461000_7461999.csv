This stock is so beautiful and comfortable that you will want to keep it on AR all the time.  Make sure to check out the pictures.  Can ship for an extra $25, but would rather meet face to face."

Rifle comes with Vortex Viper optics; this scope has a transferable lifetime warranty and is very clear, especially here in Arizona with the mirage we constantly get from the heat. Scope has Vortex rings and added sunshade. Adjustable Timney trigger set to right at 2.4 pounds, has a very clean break - not at all like the dirty trigger often associated with Remington stock triggers. Bell and Carlson stock with (1) AICS magazine included, barrel is free floating and doesn't rub anywhere on the stock. Harris adjustable bi-pod. Custom oversize bolt knob, extremely smooth action and draw. Cheek pad with storage. This is the part where I tell you how accurate the rifle is and just how “sniper” it will make you…the simple truth is most of you reading this will never be able to shoot the rifle close to its limits. On the other hand you will look Tacti-cool as hell at the range and we all know that’s half the battle of being accurate. This rifle is not entry level but neither is it ready for F class shooting. The glass, however, is entry level but very clear and capable of reaching out to 800 yards with the right operator and very little effort; the optic I had on the rifle is staying in the gun safe unless you want to add another 2700.00 to the asking price. Rifle being sold by member of law enforcement who supports Second Amendment - therefore all I require is proof of legal status in America - drivers license will do fine. If you have any questions let me know. Only trades I am considering at this time are non-franken build AR platorms in .223/5.56 or apple laptop/desktop.  Cash is king."

Buy these new for 300 and some tax or buy them from me for 210. These are crazy sweet and incredibly accurate. The laser turnes on automatically when you hold the gun, then turns off when you release your grip on the gun. The grips are in immaculate shape and feel natural in the hand. I took these off my Kimber which is no loner my bed side gun, so I have no need for a laser. They come with everything including the back plates for the grips and goos batterys. All you need to do is bolt them on and shoot! Feel free to ask away but I'm already giving these away so no offers, unless it is for more :) - I would also be willing to trade for $240.00 worth of rounds of 45/308/.306/40/10/9mm. Thanks All!!

Please do your homework and make a reasonable cash offer or firearm + cash offer. (These optics cost $1,500 new). The optic has some minor blemishes that do not affect its function. If the AD is up the optic is available. I’ll trade for firearms and not for your electronics, gold, jewelry, golf clubs or other non-gun thingns. I’m not desperate so please no lowballs. My number is 83o-221-o417. I prefer texts and I can send additional pictures on request.  I’m willing to meet halfway within reason that means no Dallas, Laredo or Houston or some other nonsense (I’m in Schertz)! That means in a public area (Wal-Mart, Academy, HEB etc.…) between San Antonio and Cabela’s in Buda (No I won’t deliver it to your home get a car its Texas).  If you want to look at it first I’ll be more then glad to show it to you at the Wal-Mart in Schertz and not half-way.  I don’t ship so don’t ask and we meet face to face Cash no checks during daylight hours. If you want paperwork I’ll be glad to meet at an FFL and do the transfer on your dime. Please ask your mom, boyfriend or wife if it’s ok for you to make the purchase before making an offer… (Ask me why) If you make a jackass offer you will get a jackass response. If you are a banger or thug don’t even bother (If you are not sure if you are you are). All pertinent laws will be followed and you will need a TX ID, CHL or LTC is preferred for firearm swaps. I’ve met some great folks who have even become my friends here but unfortunately there are a bunch of wackos, chiselers, thugs and even one idiot who threatened me here as well (You know who you are don’t make me call you out again…..). 5.56, .223, 7.62x39, 7.62x51, .357"

This optic is very clear in like new condition. The M145 Telescope is a fixed 3.4 power, 28mm optical sight that has been designed to engage targets accurately out to 1200m range. The optical sight weighs 24 oz. (681 gr) and is extremely rugged for rough field conditions. The sight has an 8.2mm diameter exit pupil, which provides excellent vision in low light levels, i.e. dawn and dusk, and also for rapid target acquisition. The zeroing adjustment increments in both windage and elevation are 2.5 mm at 10 meters range for each detent (click of movement) and 5 inches at 500 meter range. The mount is designed to fit to the Picatinny rail MIL.Std. 1913. The optical sight has an eye relief of approximately 3 inches (70mm). Eye relief is the distance between the eye and the sight’s rear eyepiece lens. The reticle pattern has built-in trajectory compensation from 300m to 1200m range. The reticle is illuminated, by a battery. It has been used in conflicts around the world and is rated for the heaviest of machineguns, such as the M249, 240G, and MINIMI and of course M16 type rifles. This optic compares favorably against anything Leupold, Aimpoint, ACOG, or EO Tech puts out!
Please do your homework and make a reasonable cash offer or firearm + cash offer. (These optics cost $1,500 new). The optic has some minor blemishes that do not affect its function. If the AD is up the optic is available. I’ll trade for firearms and not for your electronics, gold, jewelry, golf clubs or other non-gun thingns. I’m not desperate so please no lowballs.

If you want paperwork I’ll be glad to meet at an FFL and do the transfer on your dime. Please ask your mom, boyfriend or wife if it’s ok for you to make the purchase before making an offer… (Ask me why) If you make a jackass offer you will get a jackass response.
