It is a purpose-built ground operations binocular night vision device and is currently issued to members of USSOCOM. The AN/PVS-15 is self-contained, relatively lightweight unit that provides the operator with much-improved depth perception over single tube devices. The housing is engineered to be more rugged, yet still retain the same level of performance as aviation night vision goggles such as the ANVIS-9/6. The AN/PVS-15 is made by L3 Communications as a standard Gen3 Autogated configuration.
The AN/PVS-15 has been made famous by photos of USSOCOM operators wearing them in the Global War on Terror. They far surpass single tube systems when used in a land navigation or vehicle operation role. The human brain requires both eyes to determine depth. Using dual tubes, the brain can quickly and naturally resolve images.
The AN/PVS-15’s body housing is self contained and rugged. The battery compartment is part of the actual device, so there is no need to run a remote cable. Diopter and ocular adjustments are easy and familiar to anyone with NV experience. The tube housings are easily adjusted to fit the operator. The built-in IR Illuminator does a good job of lighting up close-in areas as well. Overall, the AN/PVS-15 is a very good piece of kit. In use with U.S. Military Tier1 groups, it sets the bar for binocular night vision devices."

I've only put through it about 200 rounds of FMJ, to break in the barrel. It's been my primary conceal carry handgun and I thoroughly enjoyed shooting it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the handgun and it actually looks brand new. I've maintained and cleaned the firearm regularly. I actually don't want to sell it, but I'm purchasing a new rifle and due to tight finances, I'm having to offload one of my guns to help pay for it.Here is some information from Springfield regarding the gun:When you need a concealed carry pistol that offers excellent capacity and the ultimate in shootability, check out the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in 45acp. You’ll find yourself astonished at how easy it is to shoot this small pistol. You’ll be even more impressed with how well it carries.Choosing a multi-purpose handgun doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack 45ACP is a pistol that does not compromise in any department. Whether you are looking for capacity, concealability or shootability, you’ll find it in the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack ACP. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™What it comes with:The handgun comes in the original Springfield Armory hard case with manual, gun lock, 5 round magazine and 6 round extended magazine. I'm also including a Pachmayr handgrip, Springfield Armory serpa holster, Blackhawk inside the pants holster with backstrap and a Blackhawk Serpa Sportser Holster. That's a total of $60 worth of extras I'm including free of charge.What is Required for Sale:Since I am not a FFL dealer and I don't have the means to run a background check, I am not requiring a background check. However, since I don't require the check I am making it a requirement that a bill of sale be written with your name, drivers license number to protect myself. Also, the sale must take place in a very public location in a safe part of town. These are not negotiable terms.Price: I'm asking $450 firm and in cash. I will accept credit cards if you want to pay the extra $14.25 in processing fee. The gun retails for $529.99 plus background check fee at your local retailers and don't waste your time trying to talk down the price from online retailers because you still have to pay for shipping, background check and FFL transfer fees. Don't forget the extra $60 in free gear that I'm including. That would bring your total to $589.99 plus tax and background check fee, so a total of over $600. I used to sell firearms and I know the market values of firearms and at $450 with the free extras, this gun is a great buy."

In 1959, the US military adopted the resultant M14. The rugged reliability of the M14 coupled with its formidable 7.62×51 NATO cartridge left an enduring impression on America’s fighting forces despite its relatively short tenure. When it was replaced in 1970, the stage was set for the next step in its history. In 1974, the Reese family ensured that the legacy of the M14 would live on. Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, Illinois began offering a civilian legal semi-automatic version known as the M1A™. Powerful, accurate and reliable, M1A’s™ were soon found dominating the National Matches at Camp Perry. Shooters across the country discovered the versatility and enjoyable satisfaction of owning an M1A™. Every accessory you need is included in this quality build!
