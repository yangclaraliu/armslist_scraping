Only hole in it seems to have been .30 cal AP, my AK barely dings it. Could be cut into 2 or 3 plates but a wet drop saw or similar would be best. Hot abbrasive cutting won't work well since the plate is 304L stainless. Super hard. About 50lbs.

Everything is in like new condition the gun has had one box of ammo through it (20 rounds) but if I didn't tell you you would think it's brand new. Not a single sign of wear on the gun and was methodicly cleaned after shooting. I bought the gun on impulse, as my wife also has one ( she loves it). While it's a beautiful gun I just wasn't a fan of having a safety to remember. If your looking for a great quality, soft shooting gun, that would make an excellent gift for the holidays, look no further. This package comes with everything you need and then some. At $650 this is an excellent value.

I bought this from another collector and he could not tell me if it had been shot. I honestly can not see that it has. It looks new with no obvious scratches or abnormalities. It is absolutely beautiful. It comes as I got it in a blue clamshell box with booklet as seen in the photos. It has beautiful Elite wood grips as seen in the photos. This is the Python that has become famous from the ""Walking Dead"" series. In fact, these Pythons have skyrocketed since. This is a great investment. You won't be disappointed.
Again, the box has no label. It was sold to me this way. It was sold as used to me because the prior collector got it this way. I am also selling it as used because of this, but I sure can't tell that it has been shot. It does have the ""S"" stamp that I tried to include in a prior picture. When I bought this gun, I put it in my safe. I have done nothing to this gun. It is truly beautiful. Hope this helps. Thanks!"

I bought this from another collector and he could not tell me if it had been shot. I honestly can not see that it has. It looks new with no obvious scratches or abnormalities. It is absolutely beautiful. It comes as I got it in a blue clamshell box with booklet as seen in the photos. It has beautiful Elite wood grips as seen in the photos. This is the Python that has become famous from the ""Walking Dead"" series. In fact, these Pythons have skyrocketed since. This is a great investment. You won't be disappointed.
Again, the box has no label. It was sold to me this way. It was sold as used to me because the prior collector got it this way. I am also selling it as used because of this, but I sure can't tell that it has been shot. It does have the ""S"" stamp that I tried to include in a prior picture. When I bought this gun, I put it in my safe. I have done nothing to this gun. It is truly beautiful. Hope this helps. Thanks!"
