Excellent condition not a scratch. Blueing is perfect and looks like it was done last week. All parts # to the gun all the way down to the gas tube. No wear at all on internals. Barrel is spotless and shiny. FSB has been replaced with a original Chinese imported poly tech spiker assembly. Not the US made one sold by poly tech today.  The Chinese did not drill out the hole for the detent pin on there export spikers. They also used more sand in there castings resulting in a grainy final product. Dont think you can find one. The stock set is original Chinese Chu-Wood poly tech set which would have been on the 56 spiker with correct lower handguard cutout. There's not a scratch or ding on it. The hand grip is checkered. The muzzle nut is correct poly tech for the spiker. The barrel has not been turned down like on many MAKs. Just threaded for the poly tech proper muzzle nut. Comes with two Chinese stamped made in china magazines and one NOS Polytech chrome follower 3 witness hole poly China stamed magazine. Also one NOS 40 round stamped made in China magazine. Also included is a rare Norince /66\ Baklite magazine in NOS condition. If you know anything about AK mags you know what these go for. Also correct sling oil bottle and manual. If you want to try it out before you buy/trade no problem just bring your own ammo and have at it. You will not find a nicer MAK 90 or a 56 conversion that's been done with all the correct parts. Please take a look at my other listings for 2 other nice AKs. Thanks for looking.

I like the rifle just don’t use it as much as the others I have. I would like to trade it for something else. I don’t have a particular item in mind so I’m open to all offers. Some things I would be interested in would be- CVA single shot with a interchangeable deer caliber barrel and muzzleloader, automatic shotgun preferable inertia operated, browning BAR in 25-06,30-06,7mm-08, or 308 preferably, or I’d trade for a full size M77 in 25-06,30-06, 308. Feel free to offer away my gun has been used but is still in really good shape. I can send more pics on request I can be reached easiest by text at REDACTED. Call if you must just leave a message. Thanks"

The gun was made in early 2015 and was purchased as new by me. The gun hasn't been shot more than 100x. I had to scratch that SAA itch and after I did, realized SAs just aren't for me.This gun exhibits the good quality Colt is putting out nowadays with their SAA. Excellent fit and finish, except for some very minor factory things, all of which have been corrected. The gun has had the most amazing action job you will feel on a SAA. The entire inside has been hand tuned, and it delivers a crisp 3# pull. The gun shoots to point of aim with moderate magnum loads, and there are no issues with oversize chamber throats like the 45 version. Overall, a very nice gun.These guns now MSRP for $1799, up from $1599, and cannot really be found NIB. Therefore they hold value.This gun will make a fine grade shooter. Despite the low round count, it does have some minor handling marks on the cylinder from removal and installation, it also has a partial turn ring due to a factory sharp bolt edge and careless handling before my taking possession of it. The bolt head has since been dressed. The only other tiny blem is a small nick in the bottom grip strap. Full disclosure. Now those things may sound terrible, but honestly you don't even notice stuff like that on such a fine six gun. Especially one built and tuned to shoot. $1350 takes it home. You pay transfer, and shipping if really needed. Prefer meeting at an FFL local to me.Pictures can be found by copying and pasting the link below into your browser. Pics show gun with custom ebony stocks, gun will come with the original eagle grips, that are serialized to the gun. Also, it has the box, sleeve/label, and all papers a gun purchased ""new"" came with.http://s1127.photobucket.com/user/bsmalley23/library/2015%20Single%20Action%20Army?sort=9&page=1"

This Walther PPK was manufactured later during WWII and is unique in that it utilizes a lightweight ""Dural"" aluminum alloy frame. Chambered for the 7,65mm (.32 ACP), this pistol is properly matching, and is NOT import marked. The right side of the slide, chamber and tip of barrel have the Nazi Eagle/N test proofs. Overall condition is very good with the usual fading of the anodized finish on the frame. The slide shows general thinning and some fine pitting near the muzzle and left rear. The original black 1-piece grips are in good condition but do have one crack at the top of the back strap and a small chip beneath the safety lever. The mechanics are in good working order and the bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling. A popular and reliable pistol, this PPK would be especially easy to carry weighing in at less than 17-ounces. Also comes with a free pocket holder only to the lucky buyer.Thanks"
