I have here an upgraded Cold Hammer Forged F&H chrome Barrel on a PSA lower as well as what you see in the picture. This is better than the budget Freedom Rifles from PSA that have gone through 5,000 rounds like a breeze and those are a lower specs than this one. The stocks are one magpull and a FN M4 style stock with MFS cheek piece, the hand gaurds are also by FN and are dual heat sheild, lastly the pistol grip is made by FN. The BCG is slick as can be and I have had ZERO issues with all ammo including steel this this is a lead thrower. Also I've noticed less heat from this rifle compared to others like it when shooting. The barrel is a dream and is at about 1000 rounds so just broke in the barrel, the ""Machine Gun Steel"" is no kidding. Come with a flashlight mount and Faux suppressour is mainly for looks , unused gun lock and manual, no mags will come with this package. These rifles are hard to come by when rarely available, they are comprable if not more reliable than higher end more costly AR15. These ussauly go for around 900. With that being siad I have to let go due to life. I have a FN 16 so I can get rid of one 556 AR 15. So I'm open to some trades of equal or lower + cash as well as OBO (I'm pretty resonable) Looking for a springfeild 1911, glock 19 or 17 gen 5 or baby glock 9mm. or maybe shotguns.

One of the best examples I have seen, as close to a pre ban Chinese rifle as you can get without being an actual pre ban. This was caught in customs at the time the 1989 Ban went into effect. At the first of the ban there was not a proper way of debanning and different importers did different things. This one does not have Mak90, SP or Sporter electo penned or stamped, the only things that makes this not a pre ban is a number of importers were struck out as some importers didn't want to deal with the ban and the bayonet lugs have been ground off. This rifle was originally meant to have a Chinese Type 2 bayonet, but the fangs were left remaining and a Chinese Type 1 bayonet will lock up tight. Original Chinese furniture and the bluing is excellent, no rust or pitting except a small spot on the butt plate. A very, very nice rifle. May also call or text REDACTED. Thanks"
