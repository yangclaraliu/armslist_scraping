This is a fine specimen and would make for a wonderful winter restoration project. The barrel is a full 30 inches with orginal sights. The stock however has been cut to carbine length, or ""sporterized"" as was very common in yesteryear. Everything works as it should, but the magazine hinge pin is slightly bent. The bore still has rifling but has some pitting in the groves, the rifling lands are bright with no gaps from chamber to muzzle. The outside finish is very worn and bluing is missing with some patina and surface rust showing. I would guess the stock was refinished or at least a gloss something or another put on it. The stock is 30 1/2 inches long and the LOP is 14inches. Inclueded but not pictured is a used steel butt plate with screws and the front barrel band cap and screw. I have shot this rifle and it shot well for how old it is. Study the photos and ask your questions before bidding as all sales are final.

This CAN NOT be made to fire live ammunition under any circumstance. Loading or attempting to load live ammunition will result in catastrophic damage to the gun and injury or death. DO NOT attempt to load live ammunition! This is a fully automatic blank fire only gun. It is ATF approved as a non-gun. It fires 9.3 BFONG blanks which can be found at either Atlantic Wall Blanks or Swanson Blanks. It is used for WW2 reenacting but also can be used for many time periods where this weapon was present. It is in good condition and functions the last time I have fired it. It could use a little tuning. (Done with a hex-wrench) But functions very well. As with any and all full auto blank guns, it can sometimes be finicky and require adjusting and tuning depending on weather/temp and the blanks you are using. These are forward firing BFONGs unlike the SSRoom ones which fire backward. There for you can use standard PPSH-41 mags and drums (some fitting with drums may be required). Included is a sling, PPSH41 mag pouch that is missing one of it's wood toggles - an easy fix, and 4 magazines that are in good but military surplus condition. I also have a bag of blanks included...I am unsure how many blanks are in the bag. Approx 250 or more would be my best guess. I may be open to some partial trades. But be warned - I am a bit picky. Perfect for Soviet WW2 Reenacting, Vietnam Era reenacting, or if you do German WW2 - as a captured weapon for the Eastern Front!I am looking to get rid of the whole package for 2000 + shipping and insurance. I take PayPal as a primary form of payment. PP fee will be added into shipping cost. Thanks!"

There is no evidence of it ever being fired and still has factory grease in the cylinder lockup. However, since I can not prove it I am selling it as used at 400 dollars.

I have ownded this little pistol for a few years and love it. The trigger sucks. It is horrible. That said, it is a very accurate pistol and it is a carry gun, not a range gun. I have carried dozens of pistols over the years but this is by far the easiest to hide due to its weight and size. Look it up if you don't know it. This gun is not for sale but I am willing to include it in a the right trade deal with the snubby for the right AR15 or 1911. A complete XD package, Sig or possibly a Glock but the value has to be there. I still have the price tag for this pistol. It was 329. I paid extra for the extra mag, pinky extension and holster.           Anyway, the Bodyguard is as new and in perfect condition. Let me know what you are thinking."

I spoke with Robert and his wife Joann, only 3 months prior to him passing away, to get a Letter of Authenticity for this Beretta, Lucky enough to have a copy of that letter. Check out some of the other special features: Chambered in the Popular .9mm cartridge, this Striking, heavily engraved 2-tone gun has a polished Bright Silver Nickel frame with a 24k Gold plated slide and it comes with Custom made 24k Gold plated Grips and with the bonded Ivory set of grips.
