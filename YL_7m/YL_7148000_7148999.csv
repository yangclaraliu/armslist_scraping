It breaks down easier than any other handgun and is super easy to clean I have not had a single misfeed mainly because I have had extensive training from my 10 years in the army I also have a Berretta 92 a1 which I happen to like more even though that one is only a 9 mm the frame and set up are exactly the same the only difference is the size of the bullet and I don't really need both of them so I am choosing to sellthe 96 I am open to calls and text at just about anytime at 260_366-3291 my name is Josh and yes I am a veteran but more importantly I am a Berretta expert so no games or low balls hit me up if Interested also I will refuse a sell to anyone who u get an uneasy feeling with as most of you should understand being it a 3rd party sale so keep that in mind and yes I'll let you know exactly why I choose to not sell to that person if I feel it is not in my best interest I am not shy lol
