This gun comes with all the best parts installed. The machine work was done by Doug at ATEI in Michigan who has been building the baddest work horse pistols for all the top tier instructors for years now. Seriously google him, the work he does is simply the best. He takes the time to machine each RMR specifically to that gun, allowing for the most robust platform on the market today.I am selling everything listed below including a brand new XC1 weapons light as well as 5 mags, holster, multiple mag pouches, 1k rounds of brand new ammo and all the stock parts (barrel as well). This is a rare chance to buy a truly professionally built RMR Glock in great condition for a deep discount. Gun is about 3 years old and only shows the most minor of wear. Comes with the factory hard cases for both the gun and red dot.I am not looking to part out anything at this time, so please do not ask. Below is a detailed list of what has been added/performed, as well as the approximate prices paid at the time of purchase. The asking price for everything is going to reflect both natural depreciation as well as the fact some of these items such as the WML can now be had for less.

72,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7579072,For Sale/Trade:  Afghan Jezail flintlock set  OBO,"Mt Pleasant, Charleston, South Carolina","$ 2,500","Listed On: Sunday, January 28, 2018",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"I have a very unique and original matching Afghan flintlock rifle and handgun set. The rifle is 5ft 5 inches inlayed with mother of Pearl and I think brass; this is as much a work of art as it is a rifle, it is so heavy that the original owner had to build a bipod just to shoot it. The lock is from Britan and is from 1815 but like most jezails it's a Frankenstein gun so there is no way of telling when this rifle was built in Afghanistan. It is in excellent condition and still fires. The pistol is more of a mystery and a bit more beat up but will still shoot. The lock has a symbol on it but I can't tell what it is and the wood towards the muzzle has been cracked. Serious inquiry only but feel free to ask more questions or ask for more photos."

Firearm is in like new condition and is a shooter. My brother and I had a little contest of who could shoot better at 10 yards. He had a 9mm with a 6 inch barrel against my 2 inch snub nose. The Rhino shot just as good if not better. These firearms are becoming harder and harder to find. Also being the first revolver that shoots out the bottom chamber, I'm pretty sure they will be collectibles down the road. Do your research. This is a fantastic firearm. I'm asking $850 cash only. No low ball offers. There is not much wiggle room in price. If you have something to trade send it my way. I am looking for a sig P238  or any of the other sub compact sigs. Also interested in a single stack glock in .380 9mm and .40 s&w. Also interested in some of the sub compact rugers. Basically anything of equal or less value for concealed carry. I'm also a collector of bolt guns. Depending on firearm, might require a little cash on your side. If you have something of interest, send it my way.

History: 32 and 38 Safety Hammerless models The Smith & Wesson 32 and 38 Safety Hammerless models were produced from 1887 (1888 for the 32) to just before World War 2. They were chambered in either .32 S&W or .38 S&W with a five-shot cylinder. They were most often produced with a 2-inch, 3-inch, or 3.5-inch barrels; but some 6"" barrelled versions are known to exist. These top-break revolvers were designed for fast reloading and concealed carry as the hammer was internal and would not snag when dragging the revolver from a pocket. They were known as ""The New Departure"" to reflect the company's new approach to designing revolvers. Minor design changes were made to these revolvers over the years, resulting in several different design models, as termed by collectors. The first model was manufactured between 1887-1902."

I haven't been able to give it the time or attention it deserves and I feel bad about such a beautiful rifle gathering dust in the back of my safe. I hate to let it go, but the time has come, unfortunately. The rifle is built on a Palmetto receiver set with a PSA BCG and basic charging handle. It is equipped with an 18"" Rainier 1x11 stainless steel barrel, an ODIN Works freefloat keymod handguard, a Magpul rubberized grip, and a PSA single stage trigger. Additionally, it has a great-fitting B5 SOPMOD stock, which has no wobble whatsoever. 

The rifle is extremely solid from muzzle to buttpad with no wobble to speak of. It does, however, have a small amount of minor surface rust on the exterior of the barrel near the muzzle. The bore is sparkly clean and sharp with fewer than 100 rounds through it. Included with the rifle will be one empty and one loaded 20-round steel magazine, as well as one loaded 20-round PMAG. Additionally, the rifle will come with roughly 35 PPU match cartridges. Also available are the pictured Primary Arms ACSS HUD DMR scope calibrated for .223/.308, a cantilever scope mount, and a flip-down bipod with a picatinny rail mount for an additional $200.For trades, I am open to all reasonable, non-AR offers. Seriously, please don't offer me your AR-15. Please."

After having consistent extraction issues with the rifle, a gunsmith was able to diagnose that the factory barrel has a machining defect which allows an area of the case near the base to expand during firing and essentially create a ridge or donut which is larger than the diameter of the barrel immediately behind it.  This prevents easy extraction.  Aside from this issue the rifle is in great condition.  I'm selling the rifle because I've had enough issues returning the rifle to Remington and don't really feel I have the time to deal with it.  This rifle would be great for anyone who wants a custom rifle and would rebarrel to get rid of the factory barrel anyway.  Rifle will come with Nightforce LA 20 MOA base and KRG Bolt Lift KnobSale will not include:- Scope- Rings- Bipod"

Everyone I have put behind this rifle is able to hit steel out to 400yrds all day long. Again, not a terribly hard shot, but the rifle makes it very easy. I built his gun to be a nice, longer range (for 5.56) coyote/target rifle that didn't absolutely suck to carry around in the field.
