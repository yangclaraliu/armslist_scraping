It's a Grade II model, which means it has the engravings on the blued receiver. It was built in Belgium, and I believe it was made in 1967. It has a XXXX8M71 serial number, which you can decode off the Browning website. The overall condition is very good. It has a Bushnell Banner 3-9X50 scope, which was mounted by the last owner. There is no rear sight, but that can be easily replaced if necessary. There are a few dings in the stock, and a crack in the fore end that has been repaired and is solid. The bluing is in great shape with only a few blemishes and absolutely no rust. The condition is great for a 1967 rifle. It went bang every time I fired it, and it ejects strong without jamming. I don't hunt and this one is a safe queen.$950 obo. I will include a vintage leather sling, and whatever 30-06 ammo I have (maybe 20 something rounds). You must be willing to show good guy IDs and complete a bill of sale. FTF in Northern Virginia (Fairfax, Arlington, Prince William, Alexandria). Get it in time for deer season!"

Shown with 2x10 round pre-ban legal mags and optics which are not included. VEPR 12's are still legal to own but have recently been banned from import by the US Congress with the newly enacted Russian Sanctions. The VEPR 12's are just going up in value and this one is an exceptional example. The original cost of this particular VEPR 12 was $1799 just before the election. The hand polish work would cost over $250 if you could find a qualified gunsmith to do the job. The hand built prototype and legal rapid fire mechanism would run over $300. The ad on Hk rails took about 4 hours to do right plus cost of rails. So this VEPR 12 is priced at more than fair value and represents a good investment. Buyer pays BC."

I don't need to get rid of this gun I just don't use it that often besides maybe for a turkey hunt in which I have other turkey guns so I am interested in other autoloaders in 12 gauge preferably a Browning, Beretta, or Benelli but don't necessarily need a gun geared so much towards waterfowl as I'm not a big waterfowl Upland game bird Hunter. I feel like someone else could put this gun to use. **serious inquiries only** no low-ball offers as I said I'm not desperate to sell or trade."

Please examine all pictures carefully and ask questions if you have any. More pictures available upon request. I bought this because I wanted a nearly perfect early Cobra to be part of my small Colt collection. I have never fired it during my ownership but I have tested the function with snap caps and it works perfect. I have no reason to think it would not function as intended, I simply did not want to take the chance of additional wear or damage. Every part of the action is incredibly smooth and tight with a crisp clean break. Timing is right on, lockup is tight as new, and no slop or play in anything. It's as if it just came out of the box...which I unfortunately do not have. The original plastic grips are perfect and there is only very minor high spot wear near the front of the cylinder crane. The finish is original. There is the typical Cobra paint flake between the frame face and rear of the cylinder as shown in the 3rd picture. I've seen many this way and I believe it has to do with the aluminum frame. Any speckling or irregular gloss/flat coloring on the finish is lint or oil that was not wiped off completely. The frame and crane serial numbers match. I've cleaned, examined, and re-lubed the internals as I have done with every firearm I've owned and this is just as mint on the inside as it is on the outside. I was interested in this because of the exceptional condition and the low serial number. The most famous Cobra in history is serial #2744LW. This one is #2338LW. It's interesting to me to know only about 400 units separate the two...a fun fact for my own amusement. $1000, no trades. MN permit to purchase/carry and valid driver's license required. A bill of sale will be signed. I will ship to an FFL, shipping rates would apply."

The original grips are in perfect condition and they are numbered to the pistol. All the serial numbers match. I believe the finish is completely original. All the roll marks and the Colt insignias are clean and crisp. Any speckling or irregular gloss/flat coloring on the finish is lint or oil that was not wiped off completely. I've cleaned, examined, and re-lubed the internals as I have done with every firearm I've owned and this is just as mint on the inside as it is on the outside.

More pictures available upon request. The walnut grips are original and in very nice condition. The internals are clean and free of damage and the frame and slide serial numbers match. Both magazines function correctly and have the Colt 32 ACP stamp. The better magazine of the two I believe is the original to the pistol. The second magazine has corrosion wear on the sides, a v-groove filed in the heel of the base (?), and a serial number with the initials RFK scribed into the sides. This is a fun one to shoot. I've been to the range with it and had no problems...it shoots fast and accurate. A nice plinker from the gangster era. Slips in and out of a coat pocket smoothly without snagging, as it was intended. I will include 450 rounds (9 boxes) of Fiocchi 73gr FMJ red box. MN permit to purchase/carry and a valid MN ID required. A bill of sale will be signed. I also accept a C&R license since this qualifies and can ship the pistol USPS flat rate within the lower 48 states, the ammo would ship UPS. Shipping rates would apply. $625 firm, no trades."
