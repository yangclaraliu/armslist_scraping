Literally one of a kind. Mossberg 590, 12 gauge. Bought New in July I think. - Custom built wood furniture for it (it actually got slightly longer then how it came from the factory, so is still well over 26""). Hand fit and finished. leather hand strap, with brass hardware. - Modified a blued heat-shield from a Mossberg 500 to fit the 590 barrel, as they don't make a blued one for the 590's, and blued is way more classy. Brass hardware and it has a set screw where the original bead was that helps secure the heat shield.- Installed an oversized bead on the heat shield.- Swapped in a vintage engraved bolt and elevator, from an older Mossberg 500. - Installed a hi-visibility orange aluminum magazine follower. - Includes all original parts if you decide to go back to stock. - includes original box and paperwork. - DOES NOT INCLUDE THE SLING that is seen in some pictures.There isn't another one like this out there. I dumped a ton of time and money into making it this cool, but I have found something else that caught my eye. I have had people offer me $200 to make them a set of this wood furniture and have declined numerous times. Functions perfectly. No issues. I have run about 200 rounds of target load, and probably 25 rounds of buck through it. $550. Face to face. Typical rules apply."

There are two parts to the TTI – an outer dark circle and an inner light circle. As long as the inner circle is still lighter than the outside circle, the MREs are good.  Shown here is a picture of the actual TTI from one of the cases (and they all look like this).  As you can see, the center is much lighter than the Reference Ring, indicating that these case still have a lot of life left in them.  $55 per case or only $50 per case if you buy two or more cases.THESE ARE LEGAL TO OWN, so please don't be an internet lawyer and try to enforce a law that doesn't exist."

It is new in the original tube. It has never been fire or installed. This will not make your rifle full auto. It will still be semi auto with this BCG installed. TO make your gun full auto you need this and an auto sear. The reason to have a full auto bolt is to slow the rediculously fast cycle rate of the AR-15 because the full auto BCG has more mass. This makes the gun much more manageable by decreasing perceived recoil allowing much more successful follow up shots. It also helps to reduce wear caused by the bolt slamming against the upper receiver and other parts. This will make your gun fire much smoother but it will NOT reduce it's rate of fire. It will fire just as fast as it always has it will just be smoother. These Palmetto BCG's are very high quality and certainly equal or better than any other mil-spec bolt carrier available. This has the Palmetto Arms crest laser engraved in the bolt carrier. See Pictures. I will ship this to anywhere in the USA where it is legal. It is up to you to find out if you local laws allow AR-15 parts. I personally don't know of any area where this would not be legal but there might be one or two places. This BCG has the following features and more:    Milspec Carpenter No. 158® steel bolt    Shot Peened Bolt    High pressure tested    Mag particle inspected    Chrome Lined Carrier (AUTO)    Chrome Lined Gas Key    Chrome finish firing pin    Gas Key Hardened to USGI Specifications    Gas Key Grade 8 Hardened Fasteners    Gas Key Staked Per Mil-Spec    Tool Steel Extractor    Extractor Spring    Extractor O-ring InsertThese sell for 169.00 normally, I am asking 79.00 shipped to CONUS.Contact Paul via email."

The heavy flash hider makes it more accurate than what it is...maybe dampening barrel vibration? I sprayed tough weatherproofing ""Krylon"" years ago- now its all black. This is meant to be an affordable fun plinker and small game sniper. Because of its lighter weight than a 10/22, lugging it around the woods to hunt varmints is a breeze!FFL transfer only - I recommend Sportsmen Supply in Campbell - PPT is $35.

This is the up grade and super tough HELL'S CANYON Edition rifle, super nice!!! This gun has a detachable mag that I believe holds 4 rounds. THIS GUN IS LIKE NEW BUT I WILL CALL IT USED SINCE IT WAS OWNED BY ONE OF MY GOOD CUSTOMERS. He never sot the rifle. The rifle will come with a scope rail already installed and that saves you a couple bucks! Here is some information that I found on the Hell's Canyon Rifle: The best factory bolt-action hunting rifle just got better. The X-Bolt Hell's Canyon Speed rifle is built to exceed your accuracy expectations, straight from the box. The action and stiff, fluted barrel are bedded and free floated to ensure straight shooting. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and is easily removed and replaced with a thread protector that is included in the box with this rifle. In place of traditional bluing, a Cerakote Burnt Bronze finish was chosen. Not only does it look great, the flat finish aids in concealment. Cerakote is also tougher than other firearm finishes to keep this rifle looking its best for years to come. Very light to carry yet with heavyweight performance. The lightweight composite stock makes this rifle easy to carry; and the A-TACS AU camo is versatile enough to blend into nearly every background. An Inflex recoil pad tames the recoil of even the most savage magnums by redirecting recoil down and away from your cheek. The features just keep coming. The RECEIVER is Steel and has Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish; Glass bedded; Drilled and tapped for scope mounts. The BARREL is a Heavy Sporter with deep fluting and the barrel has the same Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish. The barrel is Free-floating and Hand chambered and has a Target Crown. The Bolt-action has a 60° bolt lift. Adjustable Feather Trigger and Detachable Rotary magazine. Top-tang safety for easy on/off use and a Bolt Unlock Button. Composite Textured gripping surfaces and Right-hand palm swell and can insure shipment on request for $50."

THIS GUN IS LIKE NEW BUT I WILL CALL IT USED SINCE IT WAS OWNED BY ONE OF MY GOOD CUSTOMERS. He never sot the rifle. The rifle will come with a scope rail already installed and that saves you a couple bucks! Here is some information that I found on the Hell's Canyon Rifle: The best factory bolt-action hunting rifle just got better. The X-Bolt Hell's Canyon Speed rifle is built to exceed your accuracy expectations, straight from the box. The action and stiff, fluted barrel are bedded and free floated to ensure straight shooting. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and is easily removed and replaced with a thread protector that is included in the box with this rifle. In place of traditional bluing, a Cerakote Burnt Bronze finish was chosen. Not only does it look great, the flat finish aids in concealment. Cerakote is also tougher than other firearm finishes to keep this rifle looking its best for years to come. Very light to carry yet with heavyweight performance. The lightweight composite stock makes this rifle easy to carry; and the A-TACS AU camo is versatile enough to blend into nearly every background. An Inflex recoil pad tames the recoil of even the most savage magnums by redirecting recoil down and away from your cheek. The features just keep coming. The RECEIVER is Steel and has Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish; Glass bedded; Drilled and tapped for scope mounts. The BARREL is a Heavy Sporter with deep fluting and the barrel has the same Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish. The barrel is Free-floating and Hand chambered and has a Target Crown. The Bolt-action has a 60° bolt lift. Adjustable Feather Trigger and Detachable Rotary magazine. Top-tang safety for easy on/off use and a Bolt Unlock Button. Composite Textured gripping surfaces and Right-hand palm swell and can insure shipment on request for $50."

Mott by C.H. Colt (Samuel Colt's son) on March 9th 1889.  There is also an initial medallion on the bottom of the stock with the engraved initials A.W.M..  Included is the factory letter stating this gun was shipped to C.H.

THIS GUN IS LIKE NEW BUT I WILL CALL IT USED SINCE IT WAS OWNED BY ONE OF MY GOOD CUSTOMERS. He never sot the rifle. The rifle will come with a scope rail already installed and that saves you a couple bucks! Here is some information that I found on the Hell's Canyon Rifle: The best factory bolt-action hunting rifle just got better. The X-Bolt Hell's Canyon Speed rifle is built to exceed your accuracy expectations, straight from the box. The action and stiff, fluted barrel are bedded and free floated to ensure straight shooting. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and is easily removed and replaced with a thread protector that is included in the box with this rifle. In place of traditional bluing, a Cerakote Burnt Bronze finish was chosen. Not only does it look great, the flat finish aids in concealment. Cerakote is also tougher than other firearm finishes to keep this rifle looking its best for years to come. Very light to carry yet with heavyweight performance. The lightweight composite stock makes this rifle easy to carry; and the A-TACS AU camo is versatile enough to blend into nearly every background. An Inflex recoil pad tames the recoil of even the most savage magnums by redirecting recoil down and away from your cheek. The features just keep coming. The RECEIVER is Steel and has Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish; Glass bedded; Drilled and tapped for scope mounts. The BARREL is a Heavy Sporter with deep fluting and the barrel has the same Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish. The barrel is Free-floating and Hand chambered and has a Target Crown. The Bolt-action has a 60° bolt lift. Adjustable Feather Trigger and Detachable Rotary magazine. Top-tang safety for easy on/off use and a Bolt Unlock Button.

The full-size frame and the compact slide have joined forces to produce the ideal pistol for all conditions and all situations. “The G19X was developed for the military and is a practical everyday pistol that will do what you need it to do, when you need it to; every time, in every condition,” says GLOCK VP Josh Dorsey. “The pistol was developed for the military using GLOCK’s combat proven experience with consideration to efficiency, dependability and durability. Through rigorous testing, the G19X stands out above the competition and has the ability to function in all situations with ultimate reliability and accuracy. Our goal was to meet the demanding needs of the military while maintaining our standard of perfection. With proven results, the G19X delivers maximum efficiency and trustworthiness.” Confidence now comes in the coyote color with the first-ever factory colored slide. The nPVD slide coating of the GLOCK 19X prevents corrosion, resists chemicals, and stands up against the elements. Additional design features of the G19X include the GLOCK Marksman Barrel (GMB) with enhanced polygonal rifling and an improved barrel crown for increased accuracy, ambidextrous slide stop levers and no finger grooves for better versatility, and a lanyard loop for retention. The pistol includes a standard 17-round magazine and two 17+2-round extended magazines along with a coyote-colored pistol case. The aggregate effect of all the G19X design enhancements gives any user the assurance to succeed and survive in all situations. A perfect “Crossover to Confidence”."

Both are decent cheap cars. The metro has a blown rear brake line. That's the only problem with the car. It has new brakes. Fresh oil change and new front tires. The eagle needs front wheel bearings and tie rod ends. It also leaks oil.
