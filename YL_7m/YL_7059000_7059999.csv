Have factory box, all paperwork, warranty hasn't even been filled out! 2 16 round stainless mags, they still have the factory grease mark S&W puts on the follower.Bought it the end of June to use for my ccw when I get my license in a few weeks but went with a slimmer single action 9mm instead.

This is a good thing, because steel outlasts nylon by many decades. Other than that necessary upgrade, the gun, finish, & plastic grips are all excellent. It's also the short barreled 'snubby' version of this gun which makes it handy take along gun for camping, fishing, etc... It's got a short barrel but it's still plenty accurate, reliable with all ammo, & just plain simple without a lot to go wrong. You load it by removing the cylinder pin (like a North American Arms Mini) but you have nine shots instead of five. This is not a modern competer made 'gingerbread, cookie cutter' pistols either but a solid, & well made, all steel piece fitted by actual humans from one of America's historical arms makers, H&R. Most of these guns are 'well used' (to put it charitably) by now- but this one is a really fresh example with a long future ahead of it- with a little reasonable care, of course. Might make a good 'nightstand gun' too for those who can't operate the slides of automatics or handle the recoil of larger calibers. Asking $225 with a nice vintage leather holster."

We've seen 9 round mags, 10 rnd. mags, tapered barrels, target barrels, bull barrels, 'slabsides', blued steel, stainless steel, plus plastic, wood, metal, & rubber grips of all descriptions. Heck; lately we've been exposed to all kinds & colors of aluminum & composite thingys that don't even say 'Ruger' on 'em! Put 'em all together, & they don't weigh nuthin' neither. I'm not quite sure what to make of all of this; but one thing it proves is that Ruger's Mark Series is a damn popular line of pistols. But out of all these guns, (as far as I know) one version stands out amongst the rest, because it was only made 'temporarily'....like for a few years back in the 1990s. That version was the Ruger Mark II with a 10 inch bull barrel, which was offered in both blued & stainless steel. Of all the Ruger .22 Marks, this one is sorta harder to locate than most versions.  But, hey- is it 'better'?Absolutely! Does it take more metal to make one? Yes; it does. And shipping costs go up because ya can't fit near as many in the ship (or truck) so you better be glad they exist at all. It's a lot heavier than other Mks. too, so it'll probably still be there after a hurricane blows away all that other stuff that don't weigh nuthin'. Plus it has near optimum ballistics for it's calliber (look it up). As previously mentioned; not all of these are stainless, but this one IS (so you can fully expect it to stain LESS). It also has the longest sight radius of any of the rest of the millions of Marks, so that's groovy- plus if you run out of ammo, it's the best barrel length to pistol whip 'bad guys' (which is a relative term, so be careful). The 10""ers are rapidly becoming very collectble too, & besides...chicks dig 'em. So yeah, they're 'better'. It's a lot of fun to rapid fire a whole mag into a paper plate sized target at distance as fast as you can pull the trigger too, 'cuz that heavy barrel just sits there. And long, slow shots are a breeze.About this'n in partikler-  I replaced the slide release with an after market version. along with an extended magazine release...mostly to fit around the big rubber Hogue target grip with the thumbrest that aids immensely to keep the muzzle from diving....'cuz those 10 inch bull barrels get kinda weighty out there. I also added a Volquartsen extractor & spring. So the gun's even better now, thanks. But don't worry: all the original collectible parts are still in original collectible condition (including the like new grips) & will come with purchase.

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).75 Urban Grey Suppressor Ready   Part of the 2016 Urban Grey Suppressor-Ready Series, this pistol is clad in urban grey (a mix of grey and FDE). With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options.
A further evolution of the 75 B Ω, the new Convertible version allows users to swap from decocker to safety operation in the same manner as the popular P-07/P-09 pistols. Using the same simplified, more robust variation of the 75’s trigger system as the previous Omega, trigger parts use an interlocking design that allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools. Not only does this simplify maintenance, the trigger parts themselves are made of different materials to enhance durability, operation life and reliabilityThis is an excellent price for the 2 pistols so it is firm. The only trade considered would be a nice acog. Face to face local sale or trade only."

Model #06803, Matter Blue. This is a gently used rifle. It was purchased early after the model was introduced. I am a 65 year old enthusist who abhors rifles shooting less than an inch at 100 yds. This one does not disappoint me. The first rounds out of it were 3/4"" and thereafter they ran no more that and 1 1/2"" with all I shot though it. However, I did not shoot much through it. I recorded only four different rounds through it. It has seen no more than 50-60 rounds in total, and I think that may be more than it has actually digested. It has exceeded my expectations for it. It seems to be a great rifle. However, my interest have taken me to a different place and I want to let it go for a different rifle. As soon as I got it I saw the fallacy of the rail system they employed on the rifle. Ruger, for whatever reason, decided to employ a short rail for a ""scout scope"" and keep their proprietary scope rings attached where the rear peep sight must be attached, and removed when one mounts the scope ring. STUPID!!!! I bought a XS Sight Systems full length rail system with the peep sight as a part of that unit so that I could mount any scope at any position along the rail. As you can see in the pictures it is much improved over the original concept. With quick detach scope rings you can mount the scope anywhere along the rail and quickly detach to use the peep sight and later remount the scope. Serious inquiries only please!! I am willing to ship if you are willing to pay $25.00 shipping fee."

RARE SS192 “Green Ammo” was produced for ONLY 3 months before FN turned to the SS195LF. The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

I'm 99% sure the gun has been refinished. It's the cleanest refinish I've ever seen. At first I thought it was all original because it looks like new and becuase the colt logo and almost all of the lettering is super crisp. The main indication of a refinish is some light rippling in between the grooves on the rear of the slide. The parkerization matches in color, finish, and thickness on the slide and the receiver. The grips appear to be reaplacements that are accurate to this gun and particular time frame. There is one ding in the rear sight. There is no pitting anywhere on the exterior of the gun. There is light pitting inside the barrel and the rifling has gotten thin. There is one very small ding on the front left corner of the slide (shown in pics). The clip that comes with it is not original to the gun.

It's a smooth shooting pistol and the only significant wear is on the sharp edges of the aluminum frame. The other does not have the Hex pin and has a mismatched slide and frame. The frame seems to be dated 69, but it has an upgraded ""Fat Slide"" dated 81.
