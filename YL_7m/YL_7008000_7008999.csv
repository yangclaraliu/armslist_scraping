This large training aid was originally used by the military to teach the inner workings of the normal sized M1 Garand to new recruits. This is not a firing model and cannot be converted to fire ammunition. It measures 7ft. 2.5 in long and has a ""US"" Navy marking on the left side of the receiver. A brass plate with the manufacturer's name ""National"" is mounted inside the rifle. The operating rod, spring, bolt, and follower assembly all function just like the real version of the rifle when the action is cycled. The gas cylinder lock on the end of the barrel is removeable. There are several cutaway sections in the rifle to show how different parts operate. There is wear on the stock, which is also removeable and is held in place by three screws. The rifle is missing the trigger assembly, which is common with a military item of this age. These cutaway rifles are rare and don't come up for sale very often. This would make a great addition to anyone's military collection, man cave, or gun shop. It always draws a crowd and complete versions of these training rifles typically sell for around $1,500.00. I'm asking $500.00 OBO for the rifle as is. I can e-mail any additional pictures if needed. Thanks"

This gun feels great in the hand and shoots very well.The Px4 is built around a modular concept so these pistols can be adapted to different needs. The Px4 features an exclusive, Beretta-designed locked breech with rotating barrel system, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning and feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. The light frame employs a durable fiberglass-reinforced polymer with a milstd-1913 picatinny rail and a modular grip system for a custom fit. The manual lever safety and slide stop lever are both ambidextrous while the magazine release button is reversible.Know your state law!!!"

I haven't been able to get out to the range as much as I would like and priorities are taking more precedent. Only about 100 rounds have been fired through it. With the PMAG, the total weight of the rifle comes out to approximately 7-7.5lbs! Great for the range, for use as a ranch rifle or even competition if precision shooting is your fancy. Rifle Components are as follows:
 
Upper Components:
- Aero Precision upper assembly- Ballistic Advantage 18"" Hansen performance series barrel (Made from 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel and comes with a Nickel Boron coated M4 feed ramp extension with a twist rate of 1:7). Comes with a .625 low pro gas block, gas tube and an A2 flash hider- GuntecUSA 12"" Ultra lightweight thin M-LOK rail- Nickel Boron (NiB) Bolt Carrier Group- Bravo Company Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle
Lower Components:
- JigSaw Weaponry Billet Lower (stronger at weak points compared to normal lowers and comes with a flared magwell). Positions for Safe/Fire/Auto say ""Good, Bad, Ugly""- Aero Precision parts kit (JP Enterprises enhanced trigger spring added for a 4-4.5lb trigger pull. Will include previous springs)- Mil-Spec collapsible buffer tube assembly with Magpul MOE Stock (Black)- Magpul MOE Grip (Black)- 30 Round PMAG will be included

I've replaced the plastic windowed slide cap with the solid black metal one from HKparts.net, and the firing pin support sleeve has been replaced by the aluminum one, also by HKparts.net. I'm asking  $550. -PENDINGI also have a stock lug ground off, heavily polished and reblued Simson and Co. Luger P08 that I inherited available for $900. It's a slide plate mismatch that other than the finish and stock lug, is a good shooter. I'll take offers on the Luger, but everything else is pretty firm. I'm willing to ship for an additional $70. Face to face, all local laws apply and I'll need a FOID card. Please don't waste my time with low ball offers or inquiries that are not serious. Most of my dealings here on armslist have been very solid, but sifting through the fakes and the garbage and the folks who like to blow smoke about how great their no name shop is and then disappear just to get to those solid deals is very tiresome.I'm only looking for cash.

It comes with standard two piece scope mounts. The bolt has been jeweled. The barrel and brake have been ""gone over"" with an orbital sander to give it a matte finish.The sum of all the parts is well over $1500 not including machining and gunsmithing fees. 
I'm selling it because I'm trying to condense the the number of cartridges that I have to reload for.Remington offers a 700 factory new with magpul hunter stock MSRP $1145. And that doesn't include a Douglas barrel or Timney trigger or muzzle break.

Making the pistol even more user friendly, GLOCK has introduced a reversible magazine catch on the Gen4 pistols, now right and left-hand shooters can enjoy the pistol as Gaston Glock envisioned. To tame the recoil of the 9mm cartridge, GLOCK has introduced a dual recoil spring system that not only makes the GLOCK 19 a soft shooting pistol but also significantly increases the service life of the pistol. The GLOCK 19 has changed the semi-auto pistol market as we know it thanks to innovative design, space-age materials and reliability that has defined the GLOCK name. Embraced worldwide by shooters in both professional and civilian circles, the GLOCK 19 has gained worldwide acceptance.Police and military turn to the Glock 19 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments. Featuring a large 15 round magazine capacity that rivals even the full-size service pistols, the GLOCK 19 has more than enough firepower to be used as a standard sidearm while retaining a compact and concealable form factor for plain clothes officers. Civilian shooters embrace the GLOCK 19 for many of the same reasons as militaries all over the world, but the customizability of the pistol also helps find a home for the compact Austrian pistol in competition circles as well as in the hands of concealed carriers and homeowners looking for a cost effective firearm to defend their families.

I love it, and it's made me become greatly interested in .45 but the only problem is this gun is seriously large, and I don't have very big hands. I'm thinking I want to trade it for a .45 1911 so I can get a smaller grip and keep experimenting with my new love of the .45 caliber.So here's what I have to offer and the general price the stuff goes for. I'm going to list the online prices which are much better than local stores:- FNX-45 ($700+)- 3 mags that came from the factory- One extra factory mag ($45)- TLR-1 ($105)- Bravo OWB holster w/TLR-1 compatibility ($55)- Bravo double mag carrier ($45)- Factory boxI don't really have a set trade value, I'm open to all respectful offers.I'd LIKE it to be a Bobtail/Fastback but it's not completely necessary, I'm still totally fine with a regular grip.What I do NOT want: Taurus, Remington, Para, Auto Ordinance, other companies that make low quality weapons. Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time.I'm located in Northville, willing to travel a bit but nothing too far.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

Nothing active, I scrubbed and cleaned in years ago when I got it and haven't done anything with it since. (was originally for spare parts)  Mechanically however this gun shoots decently well.  Bore is shiny, Carrier, receiver and trigger pack all match numbers. No bayonet. Most of the parts are still gunked up with cosmoline.  This is perfect for a refinish job or to throw into an aftermarket build.  Price is $325. Prefer cash on this one. I need a plow.

It has a BCM lower (BCM4, factory built) with a 16"" Aero Precision upper with MLOK handguard (factory built). This rifle has the Fostech Echo Trigger installed. For those unfamiliar, it fires a round on the pull and a round on the release. I have only fired the rifle on one occasion with the Echo trigger, as I just installed it recently. I put 120 rounds through it, and it was incredible. Basically full auto. Well worth the $500 I paid and the year I waited for it to arrive. The rifle has a Magpul STR buttstock and MOE+ pistol grip. Magpul MBUS flip up sights and BCM Gunfighter charging handle. The muzzle device is a Lantac Dragon break. It has a Troy vertical grip and rail cover. The optic is an Eotech 512 (with original box). Comes with 1 Gen 3 windowed PMAG. The rifle comes as pictured. It's in excellent condition. It has basically been a safe queen. I am very reluctantly selling this rifle due to an emergency that requires funds I don't currently have. My price is absolutely firm. The Eotech was over $400. The trigger was $500. The BCM lower was over $400. The Aero Precision upper was over $450. The Lantac Dragon muzzle break was over $100. The MBUS sights were around $100. The charging handle was $50. Buttstock was $80. Please don't try to haggle with me. I will not take a penny less than $1,800."
