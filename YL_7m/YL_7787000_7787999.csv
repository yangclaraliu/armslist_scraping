Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18 model to be only 26.1 long, or as much as 14 shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work drop free and do not need to be tilted in. Six 20 round magazines included. Barrels on current models are 18 long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with Kel-Tec`s A2-style Flash Hider. Kel-Tec kydex cheek rest and 3"" Quad-Rail included. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user`s preference."

This rifle is a reproduction of the M14 rifle in a semi-auto version, The barrel, the receiver, bolt, operating rod, gas cylinder and trigger group are all brand new Bula manufactured. Importantly, the receiver, bolt, operating rod and the gas cylinder are all FORGED steel. Bula builds some of the finest M14s in the world and they are a contractor to the military providing modern M14 platform rifles for DMR applications and for Special Forces units. This is a superior M14 to the Springfield M1A most notably because the Springfield M1A uses a cast receiver among other cast parts rather than forged. The stock on this rifle is absolutely beautiful and the finest example I have seen of these Bula/ JRA M14s. The rifle has had 2 magazines though it so it is in excellent condition with no flaws to report. Included are the original hard case, 1 original 20 round magazine, owner's manual and an M1907 pattern leather sling. I am not interested in any trades and the price is firm. If you see the listing, it IS still available."

GLOCK, Inc. introduces their first ever “Crossover” pistol, the GLOCK 19X, which combines the best features of two of its most popular and most trusted field-tested platforms. The full-size frame and the compact slide have joined forces to produce the ideal pistol for all conditions and all situations. “The G19X was developed for the military and is a practical everyday pistol that will do what you need it to do, when you need it to; every time, in every condition,” says GLOCK VP Josh Dorsey. “The pistol was developed for the military using GLOCK’s combat proven experience with consideration to efficiency, dependability and durability. Through rigorous testing, the G19X stands out above the competition and has the ability to function in all situations with ultimate reliability and accuracy. Our goal was to meet the demanding needs of the military while maintaining our standard of perfection. With proven results, the G19X delivers maximum efficiency and trustworthiness.” Confidence now comes in the coyote color with the first-ever factory colored slide. The nPVD slide coating of the GLOCK 19X prevents corrosion, resists chemicals, and stands up against the elements. Additional design features of the G19X include the GLOCK Marksman Barrel (GMB) with enhanced polygonal rifling and an improved barrel crown for increased accuracy, ambidextrous slide stop levers and no finger grooves for better versatility, and a lanyard loop for retention. The pistol includes a standard 17-round magazine and two 17+2-round extended magazines along with a coyote-colored pistol case. The aggregate effect of all the G19X design enhancements gives any user the assurance to succeed and survive in all situations. A perfect “Crossover to Confidence”."
