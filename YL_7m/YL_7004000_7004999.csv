Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16’s unique design.
The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory®’s forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect.
If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won’t let you sacrifice power, you need the SOCOM 16. Bring Enough Gun™."

Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.
The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.
This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.
The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system.
The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled.
The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems.
Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life.
But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore.
Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy.
The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy.
A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance.
Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition.
The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.
The MR556A1 rifle is priced at $3,295 (includes rifle, HK 30-round steel magazine, set of Troy Industries Micro mechanical sights, HK multi-tool,lock, and case). An accessory MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit is also available for $2,195 and allows most high quality AR rifles to be converted to the HK piston-driven operating system.*THE RIFLE WE SELL IS BUILT TO CALIFORNIA STANDARD, THEREFORE DOES NOT LOOK THE SAME AS IN THE PICTURE."

Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance.   Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.   Also includes: One 10-round metal magazine."

The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each R.E.P.R. rifle comes with one barreled upper, but extra uppers are available in light contour  16.1” and heavy contour 20” configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications.New for 2012, we are offering the 16” R.E.P.R. with a spiral fluted barrel. The spiral fluting shaves weight while relieving longitudinal stresses that can cause ‘stringing’ in barrels with conventional linear fluting. The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

And if you pay cash the listed price is what you pay out the door. No I don't work for MY gun CO. I'm just fed up with the insane over pricing of used guns on this site. And rather than google the gun the jack asses are trying to sell to see what they actually sell for they just over post so we have to see and scroll thru their over priced used guns that can be bought new for less.

The only documentation I have on this are the markings on the rifle itself. That said the rifle is in very good condition! A new stock, caliber rechamber to .308 and a refinishing was done by a local gunsmith back in 1997. He used a plank of black cherry cut from a tree at the base of Ramshead Ski lift in Killington VT in 1961, the wood was oiled regularly and kept until 1997 when the stock was made. I have since in an effort to keep the cherry stock as like new as possible, the Mauser has been put in an Archangle stock, installed Bipod, and a nice Trinity Force long range scope. It does now take a removable magazine. This rifle is in very good quality (appears to have been refinished) and still drives nails as these rifles have been known for, for many years. Both stocks included. Looking for cash or trade. Willing to hear offers. 1911's, Snub Revolvers, 10/22 Take Down, Pistol caliber carbines.Thanks,"

These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class. TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine will remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission. Sometimes performance isn’t optional.

The ergonomic design of Springfield XD pistols optimizes pointability and shooting control to get you on target quickly and stay on target during rapid fire. The Bi-Tone XD has a durable polymer frame and a forged stainless steel slide. Checkering on the frame provides a solid grip to keep the pistol in place when shooting, and dual slide serrations provide a secure hold when loading or clearing the weapon. A grip safety (similar to a 1911) blocks the weapon from firing unless the safety is depressed, which happens naturally when the pistol is held correctly, but automatically goes ""on safe"" when the shooter's hold is released. An articulated safety lever built into the trigger blade backs up the grip safety. A loaded chamber indicator and striker status indicator give both visual and tactile indication whether the gun is loaded and ready to fire in any lighting condition. 3-dot, steel sights on this semi-automatic pistol provide rapid sight acquisition, and are dovetailed into the slide for easy replacement with after market night sights; and, an integral rail on the frame allows the attachment of aftermarket tactical sights and lights. An ambidextrous magazine release accommodates either hand. The Springfield Armory XD Semi-Auto Pistol fieldstrips easily without tools for cleaning and maintenance. Comes with 2 magazines. Made in USA.  Ergonomically designed for shooting control Forged stainless steel slide Durable polymer frame Dual external safeties Loaded chamber indicator Striker status indicator 3-dot steel sights Integral rail"

Its superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and astonishing capacity combine to put more into a concealable pistol than you will find anywhere else.
The XD® 3″ Sub-Compact has all the same features found in the standard XD® line, but in a smaller package. The barrel is 3” and the frame is a short, compact size that will let the pistol nearly disappear when you carry it. Like other XD® pistols, the XD® 3” Sub-Compact gives you great versatility when it’s used with X-Tension™ magazines. Enjoy 13+1 rounds of 9mm, (9+1 of .40SW) with standard flush-fitting magazines. Or throw in an X-Tension™ magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 16+1 rounds of 9mm (12+1 of .40SW.) You’ll find everything on the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD®.
If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for an XD® 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range."

Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip. The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands.  The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.

Pictures do not do this one justice. It appears to have not been fired much, but is a gently used Python. Asking $3,500. I have a way to accept credit cards at a 3.5% fee. Please email or text only. Do to my schedule I rarely answer phone calls. REDACTED. I am located close to the Food Lion at 3416 Poole Road in Raleigh, but can get to Knightdale and Cabelas in Garner pretty easy as well. Thank you and have a good day. I do have other hard to find guns that are not listed. For example I have many colt guns such as an unfired and uncarried nickel 1976 Colt Detective in 38 special and a 1980 collector grade blue Detective Special in 38 Special. Snake guns such as unfired enhanced drilled tapped 4 inch Colt King Cobra , unfired 4 inch drilled tapped Colt Anaconda (extremely rare year of 2000) , stainless 4 inch Python (shot 6 times), 4 inch Blue Colt Python, 6 inch nickel python, and 4 inch nickel Python (shot 6 times, amazing looking).Have a nice unfired factory engraved Smith and Wesson model 29-10 with factory wooden display box and a Walther PPK/s with 2 mags and matching box (smith and wesson).Have a rare unfired Remington R1 1911 Pearl Harbor edition, only 300 ever made, still has factory preserve oil on it.I may accept trades toward other guns and/ or ammo if at a really good deal. Trades would need to be in my favor or something rare that I am looking for. Multiple gun trades are welcome (low or high end guns). I prefer pistols though.If you live out of state, purchase will have to be through squaretrade or venmo to protect us both. If you have to send payment any other way, it has to go through gunbroker. We will have to do the transfer through an ffl and you will be responsible for the transfer. All state laws will be followed."
