Since then, they have been nested together in a cardboard box, doing nothing. I have been the only owner. I was pleased to discover, upon purchase and receipt, that each magazine comes in a thin layer of light oil, wrapped in plastic, and then placed into yet another, larger layer of plastic that bears barcode labeling and hole for hanging on store shelving. Thus, they stored fabulously and rust/corrosion has not been a concern. Condition: ""like new"" to ""new in plastic"". Caveat: as likely discernible in my photos, there are some spots of wear/abrasion to the thin plastic packaging from shipping.I purchased these back when I was convinced that somebody who wanted to trample fun and freedom was going to get elected for 2017 and my few favorite toys were going to become very challenging to get supplies for. Whoops, more battle rattle sitting around than I really want now.Let my mistake be your gain.At the time of this writing (13 November 2017), Aimsurplus.com, PalmettoStateArmory.com, and 44mag.com are all out of stock for these; natchezss.com wants $40.99 for an 8 Round OEM Sig P220 magazine, and sigsauer.com wants $44 for either an 8 Round or 10 round OEM Sig P220 magazine!I'll sell mine for $30 per, such that you can get Sig OEM magazines at around Glock prices.-------------Update December 1:Of these 10 round magazines, I have only 4 left remaining.  Folks have been pouncing on this bargain.  I have found that 3 of the 10 round magazines fit into the smallest USPS flate-rate box (that costs $7.15 to mail USPS priority) after I bundle them with somme padding. So, 3 of the 10 round magazines, well padded, cost you $97.15 after shipping. End of Update---------------(I've got the 8 round magazines in a separate listing).I'll exchange for cash. No personal identification necessary for this item. Will exchange with buyer at the ""craigslist parking"" area of Greer Police Department at 103 West Poinsett St in Greer, SC.    And I am willing to ship this item, but don't see where to check such a box for the listing to not say, ""shipping: No"" .   I would receive and cash USPS money order, or would receive payment via the Square Cash ""Cash App"" before getting it well padded and boxed and shipping it out via USPS. And buyer would need to pay for shipping.I will not ship magazines to California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or New York."

This pistol has been the apple of my eye and has it's own shelf strictly dedicated to it alone in my safe. I'm just curious to see what someone would offer for it. About the gun; it's a FN Five-seveN mkII manufactured in June of 2015 (verified by contacting FN America). I am the first owner. It has a round count below 500. I ordered a purpose built RMR mount from fivesevenreddot.com and run a Burris fastfire3 8moa red dot, also it has a Streamlight TLR-1 in FDE and a minor at home trigger polish job. It comes with 3 20 round mags and a hard case. Throw me offers, but be aware though that it would have to be a VERY lucrative offer to get me to give up my baby.

I replaced the upper hand guard with a  Yankee Hill slanted low profile hand guard that feels very nice while shooting. The muzzle brake is custom. It has 1 inch 14 threads on the outside for suppressor mount. That paired with the side charging upper makes this gun ready to go quiet. It has a sig brace with an adjustable length buffertube and pistol buffer spring that has proven very reliable for a variety of loads. I can also throw in some extra magazines and I'll leave all optics on the gun. The big selling point in this gun is the binary fire trigger that I have in it. I can negotiate on price slightly but I'm selling this one so I can buy another gun. So no trades. Feel free to message me with any questions and thanks for looking!
