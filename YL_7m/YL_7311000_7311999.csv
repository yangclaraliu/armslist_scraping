If you're reading this ad, the gun is still available. I will remove the ad immediately after the shotgun is sold. I respond to all emails so don't forget to check your spam folder.

The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions.
