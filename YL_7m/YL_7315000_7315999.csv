It features a high-performance LED whose light output is shaped by a special multifaceted reflector into a wide, smooth 200-lumen MaxVision Beam perfect for maintaining situational awareness and identifying threats at close range. The XC1’s evenly distributed beam pattern—with no bright center—was optimized for human vision. The XC1’s robust, compact body is constructed of lightweight but strong aerospace aluminum that’s hard anodized with a tough Mil-Spec finish, making the XC1 rugged enough for everyday carry. And measuring less than 2.5 inches long and weighing under two ounces, the AAA-powered XC1 won’t weigh down your handgun. The XC1 also features ambidextrous switching that provides both momentary- and constant-on activation options: Momentary-on activation is achieved by placing your support hand thumb on top of either of the two rear downward-activated switches and pushing down. Or you can position your support thumb against the same switch and push forward until the switch toggles down. Simply remove pressure and the light will turn off. NOTE: To avoid unintended activation, the light will not activate when the rear switches are pushed up or side-to-side. Constant-on activation is achieved by using your support hand to push the center crossbar switch from left to right. To turn the light off, simply press the switch right to left. The crossbar switch is countersunk to prevent inadvertent activation. The XC1’s incomparable beam pattern, military-grade quality, intuitive switching, and highly concealable size put it in a class all by itself. There is nothing else like it. Accept no substitutes. Features: – Lightweight and ultra-compact; ideal for concealed-carry use– High-performance LED generates 200 lumens of tactical-level light– Multifaceted reflector creates broad, smooth MaxVision Beam for close-quarter applications; beam pattern optimized for the human eye– Integrated ambidextrous momentary- and constant-on switching– High-strength aerospace aluminum body is hard anodized with a Mil-Spec finish for extreme durability– Easily and securely attaches to most Universal-rail-equipped handguns– AAA lithium battery (included); accessed from front-facing battery compartment– Gasket sealed; weatherproof Specifications: – Max Output — White Light:200.0 lumens– Tactical Runtime**:1.5 hours– Length:2.375 inches– Bezel Diameter:.375 inches– Weight w/Batteries:1.6 ounces– Batteries:1 AAA"

Hydro tested to 600 psi and normally fired at 250 psi. This cannon utilizes pilot pressure operation and is very efficient at lower pressures. This cannon was a labor of love and involved many hours of lathe and mill machining time. The end caps thread on and everything disassembles down to the componet level. At 250 psi the cannon shoots a sabot golfball at just over 1100 Ft/ Sec. You dont see the ball but the sabot is recoverable and reusable.

Built with a high-strength, compact, and lightweight polymer frame, this model also wears post-modern angled serrated G-10 grips which look amazing but also provide outstanding traction between your hand and the gun, even when wet. You'll appreciate the three-dot combat sights as well; durable and highly visible for quick target acquisition. The skeletonized trigger and commander hammer provide a custom look and feel, and compliment the beavertail grip safety and extended ambidextrous thumb safety. The 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover is placed for the addition of a light or laser aiming device, rounding out all the features you would expect from a custom 1911, but available in a factory gun. Built to 85% of the scale of the original model 1911, Browning has engineered the 1911-22 to be purpose designed for a unique purpose as a rimfire handgun instead of yet another barrel conversion kit gun.

Built around our newest 18” Strength to Weight, Cold Hammer Forged barrel, this platform delivers the speed, controllability, and precision required to engage the most difficult multi-gun stages. The V7 Pro comes standard with the new MFR XS 15.0 M-LOK® rail, which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. An uninterrupted Picatinny rail on top and M-LOK attachment points ensure plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allow for the maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The long 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and it prevents over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnified optics. The newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb. A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset. Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle-length gas system, this allows for shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue. The rifle is finished off with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip."
