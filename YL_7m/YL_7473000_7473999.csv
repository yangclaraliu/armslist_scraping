For more than a decade, the Mossberg 500 pump-action shotgun has served as one of the most practical starter shotguns ever made. Now, with the same standards of quality, dependability, and safety in mind, shooters and hunters will find the 500 Super Bantam truly remarkable.  Unequalled in practicality and loaded with custom-like features, these new pump-action shotguns provide an affordable opportunity for beginning and growing shooters to get started with a safe and reliable shotgun. The Mossberg 500 Bantam is the choice of youngsters and smaller stature adults - from beginners to seasoned shooters alike. With the same standards of dependability and safety in mind, Mossberg now offers the 500 Super Bantam 20-gauge pump. Like the 500 Bantam it is geared for young sportsmen and smaller framed shooters. Its superior versatility however, is what makes this gun truly ""super.""  Here's how it works: The Super Bantam features a standard 12"" length of pull (one full inch shorter than the standard Bantam) and it comes with an innovative stock spacer and extra rubber recoil pad to bring the synthetic stock to 13"" overall. When the shooter is ready for a full-sized length of pull, (14""+) just turn in the certificate that came in the box, for a full 50% off the price of the full-sized stock.  Comes with a 22"" Field Barrel and a 24"" Rifled Slug Barrel No Costly Credit Card UP Charges!!

The Remington I have for trade is in good working order and shoots e'm as fast as you can pull the trigger hi brass and low brass the reason I'm trading this shotgun is because I have two of them and I really want another Winchester again.

From the website:The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the USMC's M16A4 weapon system (20” barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.
Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.
No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO features external adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without the caps. Mounting bosses are integrated into the housing by the eyepiece to allow the easy addition of a Trijicon RMR® (not included).

The right-handed selector paddle will be on the left side of the rifle.  The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™'s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight. *Comes with Right Handed Selector Product Code: 3MRRH5102Also comes with ATF authorization/legal verification cardThis trigger was installed in my AR but I never got to the range to shoot with it.  I sold my AR15 so I dont have a need for the trigger."
