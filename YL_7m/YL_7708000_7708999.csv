The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitride finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

Let's play ""Who is the moron"".  Here are your options:1. the idiot that lists on Armslist a used version of this firearm for $$$$ more than what I am asking for BNIB;2. the guy that pays that for the used one; or3. me for selling brand new fireams at such incredibly low prices.My wife picks #3 (but for totally unrelated reasons). This model is in stock.  Very hard to find.  The factory makes them once and a while, and when they do I get as many as I can.  Basically the same gun as the extremely popular 9mm J.A.9 full size pistol, but chambered in .380acp.  380acp is better for home defense as the .380acp round is less likely to over-penertrate.  The bullet (part that comes out the front of the barrel) in a 380acp round is the same size as a 9mm bullet.  American made with manufacter's lifetime warranty.  Includes two 13 round magazines.  Unless you weigh 400lbs, this model is probably to big and heavy for conceal carry, but it's great for home defense, and as a truck gun.  Has great sights, with the rear being adjustable.Model: J.A. LC380 Height: 4.75 inches Thickness: 1.25 inches Weight: 30 Ounces Length: 6.625 inches Barrel Length: 3.75 inchesThe flagship feature of the Jimenez Arms LC380 is its easy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern. These features coupled with a last round slide hold open makes this pistol uncommonly accurate and a delight at the range."

Serial # is 302,562 as marked on both the barrel and frame, with an R above the number on the frame.  It was manufactured in 1949.
The barrel has a solid full length rib and has an overall length of 27"" to the end of the poly-choke.  The poly-choke itself is about 3.5"".  The barrel is marked 20 GA, FULL and 2 3/4 CHAMBER.
The front sight is a gold bead on the Poly-choke and a small ivory mid bead is on the rib.
The left side of the receiver has 3 ducks flying low over water.  The right side has a dog in the field with two pheasants flying.
Stock length of pull is 14"" and has the original plastic butt plate. Stock has a checkered pistol grip wrist and a smooth beavertail forearm that has finger grooves.
The trigger is crisp at about 5.5 pounds.
Bluing is good and only showing some minor wear.
The stock and forearm are solid with normal dings and scrapes from years of hunting carry. There is also a minor crack on the wrist which is only surface.

Comes with 3 Magazines and Night Sights.
The eagerly anticipated subcompact model of the acclaimed Heckler & Koch VP Series handgun, VP9SK (in 9 mm) has all of the sought-after characteristics of larger frame VP pistols but in a more concealable design.
The highly-rated HK VP precision strike trigger is also found on the VPSK. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The net result is trigger quality unmatched in production striker fired pistols.
A small-scale interpretation of the completely adjustable VP grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the compact grip frame of the VP9SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit any individual user and is a feature found only on Heckler & Koch handguns. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting.
The VPSK has the features of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.
HK’s patented charging supports, found on full size VP pistols, are also present on the VPSK. The charging supports are simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength.
VPSK pistols can use a variety of proven HK magazines, including compact double stack 10-round and 13-round with either flat or extended floorplates for a more ergonomic grip. The VPSK can also use the same high capacity 15-round magazine used by the full size VP and P30 handguns. Magazine sleeves that replicate the grip profile of the VP handgun are also available."

After each range visit the firearm has been cleaned.  The firearm has not seen any use in the last three years and I have been focusing on other projects, for these reasons I am looking to sell it.The mag release is a little lose, likely from when I disembled it during a thorough clean. Because of this, magazines can pop out of the magwell unlessed fastened (usually with the hand). I have not taken this to a gunsmith or looked online for fixes as I don't have the time to justify it. For this reason, I am offering this great deal at a signifcantly cheaper price and including a bunch of accessories that will start you off.Please email me any questions you have, thanks for looking."
