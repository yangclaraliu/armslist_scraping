Now we are lucky to see only a few pieces that hit the USA market at this time again (you can see a few other sellers selling this model for more). These pistols that are currently showing on the market are a very limited run that was originally slotted for Australia. However, due to the general shortage of CZ firearms in the USA - CZ USA was able to source a few of these Shadow Orange pistols - making this a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for U.S CZ collectors to get the last of Sp-01 Shadow Orange pistols. Since Shadow 2 is now in production - when these Original Shadow Orange models are gone - they are gone forever as there will not be made anymore. Any questions?

For $150 this bow is priced to sell. Therefore there will be NO negotiation on the price. About the bow: I received the bow as a gift back in 2013. I shot the bow possibly 200 or 300 times before I started working and going to college which ultimately took up the majority of my time. At that point the bow was stored away in it's hard case where it's been ever since. Considering how little I used the bow, it's in near perfect condition. I never had any issues with it or modified it in any way besides the initial adjustments made to it at Cabela's when I first received it. It was fun to shoot for how little time I spent with it. EXTRAS:In addition to the bow, I'll be throwing in the hard case I got for it (a simple but effective one from Cabela's), around 15 practice arrows, a wrist release, and a large green bow target."

Never fired, only dry fired. I guess I've come to the conclusion that I'm just too used to Glocks. Only cosmetic blemishes are: 1. Finish wear on the pins (from installing DCAEK) 2. Tiny dent on the side of the rear sight (brass punches wouldn't do the trick, didn't care anyway as I planned to install night sights. Does not affect sight picture whatsoever) The Apex DCAEK with Aluminum trigger (100-179, $155 value!) is installed. Stock parts are included. This turns a mediocre trigger into the best striker fired trigger available.Asking $475 face-to-face. Add 30 for shipping from my FFL to your FFL.I also have... 2x M&P9FS 17 round mags that are BNIB (add $30) Bravo Concealment DOS Torsion holster for the 4.25 M2.0 (add $30) For face-to-face, FOID, ISP background check, and 72 hr wait apply.Only trade I'd be willing to consider is a like new GEN 5 G19 (don't offer me other gens, as I already have them)."
