Wonderful gun!2. I bought it b/c of the great price, the extra mags enhancing that.3. This was the cleanest used gun I've ever bought: pristine condition.4.

I had a chance to buy this full size 9 gun at a great price and since it was a S/W (and I own 3 in different calibers) I thought I'd give it a chance to see if I had to have it for the range or when I wanted a larger gun for CC.6. It was great, but I like my SW MP Shield .45mm better, and since I already had a SW MP Shield 9mm,     I decided if I was going to have a bigger range 9mm I'd get a 1911-style.     I did not care about the 16 shot magazine capacity, which most would.7. I thought I might keep it when I first bought it since I liked the idea of a bigger capacity and bigger size, and the price was so good.8. I only put about 45 rounds through it (3 magazines) at the range b/c I was shooting other guns to compare with it (as I've mentioned).    To me, it didn't seem any much different to this novice to the other Smiths.9.

Unfortunately its just taking up safe space for me.  Asking price Is $800 for the rifle along with 780 rounds of Wolf 124 gr. FMJ that I have left and all magazines pictured. Everything you could need for your first AK47 or a nice addition to your existing collection.  I don't need to keep any of this stuff.  If you price out the individual pieces you'll see that I'm selling this at a significant discount because I want to get rid of it, so please don't send rediculous offers.  Not interested in trades at this time unless you have something very interesting. Also, Google search The Truth About Gun's M10-762 Rifle Review for an unbiased review of how good these are.  Text me at 407-808-4475 if you want to buy.  Thanks!"

This is a drop-in trigger that can be installed in less than 5 minutes and will give you a consistent 3.5 pound trigger pull with no creep or over travel. I am also including a set of KNS anti-rotation pins which are reccomened by RA to be used with their triggers. If you buy the trigger and pins, I'll even throw in a Magpul SL hand guard, a S&W stock, and a standard plastic handguard as well. The trigger has seen about 200 rounds and it works great. It would be fantastic on a target gun, match gun, or hunting rifle, but for my purposes it's a little lighter than I'd prefer. 
 
RA-140's typically go for about $120, the KNS pins usually go for about $30, the Magpul SL handguard goes for about $30, and I'm not sure about the value of the S&W stock/handguard. I'll let it all go for $100.
