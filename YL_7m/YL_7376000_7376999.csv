Colt Detective Special is one of famous Colt six-guns. Very popular among plain-cloth cops, security men and others, who needed a compact, reliable handgun. Colt Detective Special was introduced in 1927 and manufactured until 1936.

These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you'll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class. TRP level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20 LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5-5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine will remind you that the TRP was designed for use in high stress places-where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP so it's ready for the next mission. Sometimes performance isn't optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol. Specifications:  Caliber: .45 ACP Recoil System: 1 Piece N.M.

While a normal, all steel 1911 can weigh over two and a half pounds empty, the 9mm Champion tops the scales at just 31.5 ounces. The .45ACP model weighs in even less at just 30 ounces, thanks to the bigger hole in the barrel. That's quite a difference when it's on the hip all day. While the overall height is the same as that of the Range Officer Operator, the Champion includes a four inch stainless steel match grade barrel as opposed to the Government size five inch barrel. In the Champion, they use a bull barrel fitted to the slide that houses a supported ramp to save wear and tear on the frame over time. As a result, they can user lighter forged aluminum for the frame. That helps them shave weight for its intended carry mission. The sights are all buisness, with a fiber optic up front and a low profile combat sight in the rear that won't snag during the draw. For a recoil control and function, they use a dual-spring assembly that allows us to control precisely the recoil impulse in this smaller package, thereby ensuring reliable function with a minimum of fuss to the shooter. The Range Officer Champion is availalbe in 9mm and .45 ACP. Both models ship with two magazines, seven rounds each for the .45 ACP and nine rounds for the 9mm. Even though the Range Officer Champion is smaller and lighter, you won't have to scarifice capacity for carry convenience.

You will need a remington  870, mine is hopefully shooting mallards and teal. When you install this stock it makes adding a red dot, Laser, tactical light or any AR type sights easy with the 4 picatinny rails that you will have.

It was built from an 80% lower, and this was my first one so the machining is anything but perfect.

Here's the build:tactical sh*t forged lower, anderson lower parts kit, tiger rock stock and buffer kit, anderson upper, anderson 18"" stainless .223 Wylde barrel (no comp, just a thread protector I already had), radical gas block and tube, radical BCG. There is a cheap barrel nut on it to hold it in place while I was trying to decide on a handguard. No sights, one hexmag I bought to test the function of the mag release. I have a little less than $550 in it so far.As far as I can tell everything should work the way it should, some of the controls are a little rough but should smooth out with use. The lower receiver is also ""unfinished"" at this point. The black on there is just a rattle can job to test out different colors and will come off easily. I was going to cerakote it. I have not tried firing this gun yet. I know this is a weird post, but like I said, I lost interest and was just trying to see what was out there to trade for. I'd be interested in a nice bolt rifle or shotgun, but I'll consider anything. Not for sale, trade only"

Their first long-slide 1911, the Bruin was born to hunt. The long slide means a long sight radius and the 6.3"" barrel within allows full-power 10mm loads as much time as possible to use thier powder charge. Fully adjustable tritium sights ensure when shooting hours arrive, you'll be able to see the sights. Not only that, but they're using a tritium/fiber optic combo front sight to make sure the front glows day or night. Features:  Adjustable Night Sights: Fully adjustable for windage and elevation, these night sights have two tritium vials as well as rear serrations to knock down glare. Ball End Mill Cut: This cut accentuates the carry cut and slightly modifies the appearance. Front Serrations: Forward cocking serrations give solid purchase for press-checks. Frontstrap 25LPI Checkering: Sharp, 25 LPI checkering, giving plenty of grip without being too aggressive. Long Solid Trigger: A long solid trigger was used to give a traditional look and incorporate a serrated face. Mainspring Housing Checkering: Their 25 LPI checkering on the flat mainspring housing provides the means for a superb grip. Rounded Butt Profile: With a rounded butt profile, those with larger hands tend to find greater shooting comfort as well as less printing while carrying concealed. Square Hammer: This is their spin on an edgier, tactical, Commander hammer. Top Rib: A Clark-style rib on the top of the slide helps knock down glare. Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight: Made to glow day or night, this front sight has combo fiber optic/tritium insert to ensure that it's always illuminated.

They've been working hard to make the best 1911s ever since. Making them perform on a consistent basis is part of the mission, but identifying the needs and wants of shooters makes up the rest. For that reason, they offer a broad array of models for just about any application. The Range Officer Compact models offer similar benefits to the Range Officer Full-size line, but in a smaller package. Whatever your reason for want a smaller, lighter and easier to handle 1911, the Range Officer Compact might be right for you. Like it's big brother, they make the Compact in both 9x19mm and .45 ACP. Even with its half-inch reduced height, you can still fit eight rounds of 9x19mm in the magazine plus one in the chamber. The .45 ACP version holds six rounds in each of its two included magazines. While smaller on the outside, the Range Officer Compact is all business on the inside. The Range Officer Compact has the same quality forged national match frame and slide as the TRP 1911s and gets the same amount of attention when it comes to precision fitting slide, frame, and barrel. The four-inch stainless steel ramped bull barrel locks up exactly as intended - everytime - because accuracy counts. The Parkerized finish will stand up to daily carry or training days at the range. The sights are sleek and fast, with fiber optic up front and a low profile combat sight in the rear that won't snag during the draw. Specifications:  Caliber: .45 ACP Recoil System: Dual Spring with Full Length Guide Rod Sights: Fiber Optic Front & Low-Profile Combat Rear Weight (with Empty Magazine): 28.5 ozs Height: 5"" Slide: Forged Carbon Steel, Parkerized Barrel: 4"" Stainless Steel Match Grade, Fully Supported Ramp, Bull Length: 7.6"" Grip Type: Compact RO Double Diamond Thin Line Rosewood Frame: Forged Aluminum Alloy Black Hardcoat Anodized Magazines: 2-6 Round, Blued Steel"

Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.   Variants with a conventional double-action/single-action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK's enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.   The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation - one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.   P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single-action trigger mode-and have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame-in addition to the two safety levers.   A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tacticle and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.   Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.   During a 2010 endurance test, a randomly selected P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.   Key Features:    Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life Multiple trigger firing modes available Patented HK recoil reduction system One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel Corrosion resistant ""hostile environment"" blued finish Ambidextgrous slide levers and Ambidextrous magazine release Patented lock-out safety device Spurred hammer Automatic hammer and firing pin safeties    Technology:    During the 1960s, Heckler & Koch perfected the famous polygonal profile barrel technology. Conventional lands-and-grooves rifling allow propellant gasses to escape around the front of the bullet as it is fired from the barrel muzzle. A polygonal bore profile effectively seals propellant gases behind the bullet-increasing bullet velocity. An added benefit of a polygonal barrel is its resistance to wear. A polygonal barrel will normally outlast a conventional ""lands-and-grooves"" barrel by thousands of rounds. Polygonal barrels were one of the many radical design elements used on the HK P7 series pistol and this same breakthrough technology is present on all curret HK handguns.    Reinforced Polyamide (Polymer) Frame:    A radical new material used on the P9S pistol in the late 1960s, advanced polymers were soon used as major components and assemblies on a variety of HK products - including the receviers of MP5s in the 1960s. HK polymer molding technology led to the introduction of another led to the introduction of another synthetic framed HK handgun, the futuristic-looking VP70. Heckler & Koch pioneered the use of polymers more than fifteen years before competing firms. Today, HK remains a technology leader in the use of innovative and high-strength polyamides.

But even essential tools can be refined and improved. That's the principle behind the new XD-E: the best elements of the world-renowned XD Series, condensed into a weapon so intuitive, comfortable and accurate, you can't imagine being without it. The XD-E sculpts unmatched Point and Shoot Ergonomics into a sleek frame just an inch wide, for hand and holster fit so satisfying you'll take it everywhere. The low-effort slide practically racks itself, so handling's a pleasure. The exposed hammer clearly shows gun mode, and the single/double action trigger shows respect for your shooting style, unlike other compacts. Then there's the grip: GripZone provides active texture that matches your grasph like a handshake, improves stability, and feels incredible. Three magazine options let you personalize concealability and capacity. Impeccable feel, weight and balance launch the XD-E from invisible to impactful in an instant, for go-anywhere confidence unlike any you've felt. New shooter or skilled gunner, wrap your mitt around the new XD-E and you'll know. This is more than a hammer. It redefines what your hammer should be. The hammer-the most important tool in the toolbox.

Other than shooting it, i have ran snap caps through it on occasion (no dry firing). The trigger is crisp and smooth and it shoots like no other AR/M4 I have ever fired. I have never had a malfunction with this rifle, which is to be expected with a company like H&K. I have never seen another AR/M4 with this exact fit and finish. The tolerances are exact and it easily shoots sub MOA."
