Springfield Armory® XD-S Bi-Tone Semi-Auto Pistol Essentials Package is a slim, trim, ergonomically designed semi-auto pistol meant for concealed carry use. The XD-S utilizes a single-stack magazine that dramatically increases the concealability of the pistol by decreasing the width of the grip frame. Two interchangeable backstraps allow the shooter to find the correct fit according to personal preference. The Bi-Tone XD-S has a durable polymer frame and a forged stainless steel slide. Aggressive checkering on the frame provides a solid grip to keep the pistol in place during rapid fire. As with standard models of Springfield XD pistols, a grip safety blocks the weapon from firing unless the safety is depressed, which happens naturally when the pistol is held properly, but automatically goes ""on safe"" when the shooter's hold is released. An articulated safety lever built into the trigger blade backs up the grip safety. A loaded chamber indicator and striker status indicator give both visual and tactile indication whether the gun is loaded and ready to fire in any lighting condition. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight provide rapid sight acquisition in dim or bright lighting. The Springfield Armory XD-S Bi-Tone Semi-Auto Pistol fieldstrips easily without tools for cleaning and maintenance. The Essentials Package includes: 1 flush fitting magazine and 1 Mid-Mag X-Tension™, 2 interchangeable backstraps, a bore brush, cable lock, all neatly organized in a lockable poly case.Slim, trim concealed carry pistolSingle-stack magazine2 interchangeable backstrapsStainless steel slideGrip safety and trigger safetyLoaded chamber indicatorFiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sightIncludes 2 magazinesComes with Essentials Pack"

This is a true PU Sniper and not a built one.The date on the scope is 1943. The stock has obviously been refinished and I had considered putting an original finish back on it but changed my mind. The finish feels great and it doesn't change the value of the gun. I had intended to shoot a deer with it before I sold it but never did.  I can send more photos to your email on request.You may contact me through this ad or you can call or text REDACTED.Thanks!

This is a 1988 Taurus model 66, 4 inch barrel, 6 shot, 357 magnum revolver. This isn’t one of the crappy new ones they are producing. It is a hand cannon. The gun is chambered for 357, so it also shoots 38 special and 38 special +p without any problems. The gun is tight and operationally perfect. I literally picked it up on Friday, September 8th 2017 from the gunsmith where he applied a hot satin blue finish and installed a new firing pin. So the gun is good to go. It is missing the rear sight however as i just haven’t taken the time to get one for it. This gun does come with a Folbus paddle holster as well. This particular gun is very well known as one of Taurus best revolvers. I highly encourage you to look it up for yourself. I am in Maryville and will only meet in Maryville due to transportation complications. Thank you."

An unusually styled example, the gun has been finished with rarely-seen border engraving, fitted with Grade-A, flamed English Walnut furniture that has been capped with an engraved metal buttplate, capped with a silver monogram shield escutcheon, and painstakingly hand-checkered. Chambered in the military-standard .303 British, these weapons were marketed to officers who were, at the time, expected to furnish their own service arms. For most, this meant the simple acquisition of a handgun, but officers in the cavalry, as well as others with duties requiring a shoulder arm, tended to favor the Metford-rifled Lee-Speed carbine, which was an ideal choice for both combat, and hunting exotic game in locales that may have included India, Africa and the Middle East. As such, the Lee-Speed was really a dual-usage rifle, serving as both a martial and sporting arm. Rarely encountered by collectors on the North American market, this Boer War-era Lee-Speed carbine would be an outstanding addition to any advanced Victorian or Colonial arms collection.Condition:Very fine with the gun showing no evidence of refinish. Metal surfaces retain better than 85% bluing overall, with old grease, carbon spotting, and a dash or two of light surface pitting, but no deep pitting or rust present. The bulk of finish loss is in the form of high edge wear and flaking along the dust cover. Markings are correct, well struck and, apart from the service-replacement, 10-round magazine, the gun appears composed of original, matching components, with the only apparent serial number being on the buttstock(the number on the bolt handle is a retailer register number). Engraving is nicely executed vine/scroll that rims the border of nearly the entire receiver, and extends to the dust cover, pistol grip cap, and buttplate. The furniture rates as fine in line with the gun, displaying pressure dents, handling marks, dings and wear to the checkering, but no cracks, chips or repairs. Mechanically excellent, with smooth, fluid action, the bore rates as good with strong, evident Metford rifling as well as light wear and moderate frost running the length. A post-1968 export from the UK, the importer mark is discretely placed under the barrel(pictured). Original Magazine Cutoff is in place."

With an incredible attention to detail, Springfield Armory created what's become one of the most popular polymer pistols on the market. The angle and depth of each contour in the XDM grip has been calculated for maximized control and usability, and the new trigger has the shortest travel of any polymer pistol currently available along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. Your total XD(M)Â® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. The rugged Multi-Use Carrying Case is as durable as the XD(M)Â® it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M)Â® pistols. Springfield XDM Features Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)Â®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.  (M)ould-Tru Backstraps: With the interchangeable backstraps, Springfield has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit. (M)ulti-Adjust Rail Systemâ„¢: A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooterâ€™s hand position. (M)eloniteÂ®: Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged MeloniteÂ® finish on the XD(M)Â® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.
