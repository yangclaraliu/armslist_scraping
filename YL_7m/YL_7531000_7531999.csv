Took this gun in around 5 years ago on a multi-gun deal, before I became a FFL.  Never shot it, although I plan on doing so later today.  I'm not really into target pistols and the wierd bird Ruger Mark models.  About a year ago I decided to take my brother-in law to the range, and figured it was time to try the Ruger out.  Came to dissemble and oil it, and found out part was busted.  Gun is probably over 60 years old, and I am probably the 5th or sixth owner, but I figured I'd send it back to Ruger to see what they would charge to fix it.  What a pleasant suprise, they sent it back, with no charge, in a new factory box, with a note indicating parts replaced and that they fired 50 round CCI through it without any malfunctions.  See pics.  Finish is zg  best 50%.  Mechanically very good.  Includes 1 original mag, and two brand new later model mags that hold an extra round, and have been changed around to work well  in this model.  Mags in pics are loaded in prep for a trip to the range.  I keep going back and forth on selling it.    Since I'm not commited to selling it, price is super firm.  Serial number approx 66000"

The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match. It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Although it’s easy to make and replace. There was a repair to a small crack by the lock at some point before I owned it. Although it’s VERY solid and was never an issue. It’s 160-170 years old. I Wanted to leave in orginal state. History- This gun was HAND made. All the screws, pins, locks, hammer, barrel, and stock. Nipple is original and wide open to the breach. All screws are original and locktite down. It was originally made as a target bench rifle with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes and mount holder on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very very accurate rifle, Bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1850-1860.. The lock is marked R & W.C. Biddle & Co. Philadelphia. This firm was a hardware store and was noted for importing or making hardware, gun locks, and barrels. Barrel is marked with T + F, in German script, believed to be Thomas Fenner, he was a gun maker from Philidephia Penn. 1829-1860 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel (under the rear sight). Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. I am willing to part with the old dog for the right deal. I have seen these priced 700-3500$ Im not wanting to break the bank just a fair trade and hoping to send to a good home. I am open to trades for other firearms. I am looking for a Glock 19 gen 4/5, Browning Hi-power, or a decent 1911. email or text 918-4o2-o854"

This gun is highly sought after in this barrel length, and scarce. Mine is in great shape, having been factory serviced (receipt included) by Smith and Wesson in October of 2016. This fine revolver wears its original wood grips and comes in a Smith and Wesson repair box with the appropriate serial number label on it. This revolver has a single action trigger pull of 3.75 pounds, and a smooth double action pull set by the factory at 10.5 pounds. This gun has been shot very little, as evidenced by the third photo of the gun's forcing cone.Smith and Wesson has re-introduced this gun recently, but don't be fooled. The new one has a sleeved barrel rather than solid, and uses MIM and plastic parts. Unlike this classic revolver, the new one also has the ridiculous internal gun lock feature that collectors hate, and refer to as the ""Hillary Hole"". No such nonsense here.Please be aware that I have another Model 66 listed here that belongs to my friend. They are NOT the same gun. Both guns may be seen by appointment at my office just outside of Homestead. On this one, since I own it, I will consider trades and listen to best offers. But I know exactly what this firearm is worth, having researched it extensively this past week. So if you are one of those clowns who wants to write to me and tell me you can get this revolver for $450-500 elsewhere, my advice to you is to stop wasting other people's time and go buy it wherever you saw it at that price. On the other hand, if you are prepared to pay a fair price for a fine revolver, let me hear from you. Cash always speaks loudest.Face to face transactions in my office only, NO shipping. All laws complied with. Thanks for looking at my listing.Trades that interest me include CZ Metal Framed Pistols +cash, AMERICAN MADE 1911s, especially in .38 Super, but other calibers welcome, HK hammer fired pistols, and Ruger Single Actions+ cash"

This rifle comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It does have an average amount of minor wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that the rifle was previously owned, and saw a normal amount of usage. There are no major flaws/defects to be found, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, staining, rusting, or discoloration. There are a handful of minor nicks and cuts, as well as some minor scratches and scrapes throughout the rifle's black synthetic stock. This rifle also features a safety switch set on the side of the receiver, directly above the trigger assembly. The receiver is in good shape, though it does show some minor rusting and pitting, as well as some scratches and scrapes inside the chamber. This rifle DOES NOT come with a scope attached, though it does still have its original iron sights. This rifle also comes with its original 5-round clip. This is a great rifle for someone just starting out, or looking for another addition for their collection.

The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match. It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Wanted to leave in orginal state. This gun was oringinally setup as a bench rifle with with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes for the mounts on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina around the holes) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very accurate rifle, bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1840-1861. Barrel is marked with J - F, believed to be Jacob Fordeny, he was a gun maker from Lancaster Penn. 1837-1857 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field)  The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel, under the rear sight. Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. I am willing to part with the old dog for the right deal.

This is a real bummer to sell, but realistically I just don't get out to shoot rifles much anymore (wife had a baby, and he's keeping us quite busy).This rifle is beautiful, the action is slick, and it shoots great. I've got the original box and everything, but the only flaw is a slight ding or scratch on the front forearm stock. Henry is such a solid company that they sent me a brand new forearm piece! I just haven't installed it yet. Figured I'd wait until the front forearm was even worse for wear after more use.Not interested in trades, cash only. Price is somewhat negotiable, but I won't respond to random low-ball offers shot off through email. If you want to give me a call and we can discuss a fair price, I'm game. Will go through a local FFL dealer that we agree upon (probably a $20-30 fee for background check and fee). The background check is non-negotiable. Thanks."

You simply won't find a well-made AR-15 upper at this price. The DPMS Lo-Pro upper receiver is a great bargain for a bull barrel and nicely finished upper receiver, that has the fit, finish, and performance equal to that of many much higher priced uppers. It fits snugly (correctly tight, but not too tight) on my DPMS lower receiver, and many reviews indicate the same with others (even RRA which are notorious for an overkill of a tight fit--though it will be a very tight fit).
The receiver is slick-sided with no forward-assist (which some may argue is really unnecessary, unless it is a LE ""work"" gun), shell deflector, or dust cover. The stiff bull barrel is sweet. This upper makes for an excellent varmint rifle, target AR, or zombie picker, it can shoot under 1/2 MOA with match-grade ammo and a decent optic. 
Attached Pics of actual receiver.  This upper has had less than 20 rounds through it. It is a tack driver with PPU 223 Match Remington HP BT 69grn ammo. Complete Upper with bolt carrier group and charging handle. Will not ship. $275"
