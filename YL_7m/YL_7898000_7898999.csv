The box holds the pistol (with any sized mag loaded-up) plus two (2) extra (9 or 12 round) mags.  This gun includes FIVE (5) magazines (total):  Three with the pistol in the box as it came new: (one extended mag plus two standard mags), and... I bought an ""XD Gear"" belt holster that carries two (2) additional (9 rd. standard) mags.  The XD gear holster (and two extra mags) do NOT fit in the box.  It was all bought with the gun, but the XD Gear mag holster and 2 extra mags were ""add-on"" items at the time.This gun hasn't a scratch on it anywhere- it literally looks (and basically is) new.  The only wear is on the barrel chamber's top (""factory wear"" from being test-fired before shipping), and barrel end (again, factory fired- it comes this way).  So side-by-side to a new gun... you won't see a difference.  They don't come any cleaner than this gun.  $380 is for everything listed here- no ammo (shot the last of the box last weekend).  We are selling it simply because we never used it and we decided last weekend at the range to sell it to someone who might be looking for a great C&C pistol.Cash, face-to-face meet-up (with sober, non-felon buyer please) in the Emporia, KS area; or possible meet-up on a weekend around NE Kansas (Topeka, Lawrence, KC).  Prefer to sell for cash, but would trade for higher value (like the $700 paid for this when new in 2014) if you want to propose something like an AR (better upper), full sized pistol, or hunting gun.  Thanks Armslist!"

I'm not sure if the Germans mixed parts or the Russians, but the gun is not matching serial numbers. That adds a pretty neat component to this gun becasue at some point in the war it was taken from a Nazi solder either dead or alive and repurposed for the Russian war effort. My guess is if a Russian was taking your gun, you're dead, but who knows. The Waffenampts and Nazi Eagle are stamped on various parts of the gun.

Perfect for us who prefer hammer fired for safety the cocked and locked carry option. Comes lightly used as stated above, with two mags,case, backstraps and all paperwork. Including the registration and warranty paperwork. Also included will be box of factory target ammo and a box of Hornady Critical defense ammo, combined about $40 value thrown in. You can go online and activate the warranty in your name.Would make a great carry option or just a reliable defense weapon. Easy to rack the slide. And the take down is about 1/2 the effort of other guns. Plenty of videos online that will attest to this fact. Face to face public meet with Ohio ID. I am CCW and prefer the same.

If you are looking for fair pricing without taxes and transfer fees, then here's your chance at some very nice guns (several of them BNIB). I will include all of the factory packaging and documentation for these guns, but I can't spare any ammo at this time. Sorry!One thing, though - I won't sell anything without a signed Firearms Bill of Sale (I will supply). So, that's going to mean providing some ID (preferably a CWP) during an in-person transfer in a public place. If you're good with that, then feel free to contact me via reply to this ad and I'll provide any additional information on any of the pieces I am selling. I haven't included pictures in this ad because there isn't really anything special to show - if you know your guns, you already know what I'm selling anyway. However, I will certainly be glad to provide photos through email if you'd like to see specifics.Here's the list of everything I'm letting go:CORE15 TAC ULII 5.56 (Quad-Rail) <200 round count 550.00Glock 35 Gen4 (non-MOS) <50 round count 550.00Kahr CW40 (Bronze Cerakote) BNIB 380.00ISSC M22 Threaded Barrel (Two-Tone) BNIB 320.00IAC Hawk 982 12ga BNIB 220.00All of the firearms are being sold in their 'factory' state, but I do have several firearm accessories and other odds and ends that I am planning to sell separately on auction sites.

If you are looking for fair pricing without taxes and transfer fees, then here's your chance at some very nice guns (several of them BNIB). I will include all of the factory packaging and documentation for these guns, but I can't spare any ammo at this time. Sorry!One thing, though - I won't sell anything without a signed Firearms Bill of Sale (I will supply). So, that's going to mean providing some ID (preferably a CWP) during an in-person transfer in a public place. If you're good with that, then feel free to contact me via reply to this ad and I'll provide any additional information on any of the pieces I am selling. I haven't included pictures in this ad because there isn't really anything special to show - if you know your guns, you already know what I'm selling anyway. However, I will certainly be glad to provide photos through email if you'd like to see specifics.Here's the list of everything I'm letting go:Glock 35 Gen4 (non-MOS) <50 round count 550.00CORE15 TAC ULII 5.56 (Quad-Rail) <200 round count 550.00Kahr CW40 (Bronze Cerakote) BNIB 380.00ISSC M22 Threaded Barrel (Two-Tone) BNIB 320.00IAC Hawk 982 12ga BNIB 220.00All of the firearms are being sold in their 'factory' state, but I do have several firearm accessories and other odds and ends that I am planning to sell separately on auction sites. If you have any interest in accessories, feel free to inquire as to what you're looking for and I'll see if I have anything you're interested in."

There is absolutely nothing wrong with any of my guns, and I'm really in no desperate need to let them go. I'm an honest, private seller who wouldn't advertise anything I would turn my nose up at buying again myself. If you are looking for fair pricing without taxes and transfer fees, then here's your chance at some very nice guns (several of them BNIB). I will include all of the factory packaging and documentation for these guns, but I can't spare any ammo at this time. Sorry!One thing, though - I won't sell anything without a signed Firearms Bill of Sale (I will supply). So, that's going to mean providing some ID (preferably a CWP) during an in-person transfer in a public place. If you're good with that, then feel free to contact me via reply to this ad and I'll provide any additional information on any of the pieces I am selling. I haven't included pictures in this ad because there isn't really anything special to show - if you know your guns, you already know what I'm selling anyway. However, I will certainly be glad to provide photos through email if you'd like to see specifics.Here's the list of everything I'm letting go:IAC Hawk 982 12ga BNIB 220.00CORE15 TAC ULII 5.56 (Quad-Rail) <200 round count 550.00Glock 35 Gen4 (non-MOS) <50 round count 550.00Kahr CW40 (Bronze Cerakote) BNIB 380.00ISSC M22 Threaded Barrel (Two-Tone) BNIB 320.00All of the firearms are being sold in their 'factory' state, but I do have several firearm accessories and other odds and ends that I am planning to sell separately on auction sites. If you have any interest in accessories, feel free to inquire as to what you're looking for and I'll see if I have anything you're interested in."
