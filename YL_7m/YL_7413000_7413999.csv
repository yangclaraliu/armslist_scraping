I shot it at 1000 yards and had no issue hitting 1.5 moa. It definitely reaches out and touches your target with no problem. I just bought the new Nikon BDC P223 Drop in scope  to put on my other rifle but I can leave it on this one for the right price which it will come with ammo, magazines that have a 20 round capacity, and so forth. Fall is right around the corner and this rifle is ideal to hunt anything grazing North America/ pig, elk, deer,moose, you name it.

I shot it at 1000 yards and had no issue hitting 1.5 moa. It definitely reaches out and touches your target with no problem. I just bought the new Nikon BDC P223 Drop in scope  to put on my other rifle but I can leave it on this one for the right price which it will come with ammo, magazines that have a 20 round capacity, and so forth. Fall is right around the corner and this rifle is ideal to hunt anything grazing North America/ pig, elk, deer,moose, you name it. I have always admired the 308 caliber because of its power and punch. I am looking to sell cash by tomorrow if offered the right price.

I bought the complete upper/lower, BCG, and charging handle all around labor day and still have the reciepts to show it.Every part of this rifle was manufactured by Aero Precision, which is much more important for building ARs in .308 versus 5.56/.223. I will provide links below to the online site where I bought each part. Online retail price of this package comes out to around 1300 not including additonal costs associate with building such as FFL transfer fees, shipping, and assembly. Aero Precision lists this exact complete rifle for 1700, and various gun sale sights show a price ranging from 1400-2000. With all this being said, I am asking $900 (just dropped the price for last minute Christmas) for this complete AR-10 rifle and the various additional parts listed. Follow the links below for more specifics and information. If you are interested, I would be happy to provide you with much more detail and potentially make deal.
