This is a PTR G.I. R model not to be confused with the plain G.I. model which has no rail and sells for about $100 less. The rifle is chambered in the hard hitting 7.62 NATO or .308. PTR built these with H&K trigger housings, trigger groups and sites. All metal is parkerized and matching- same as the original HK military finish. The R designates that it has the factory installed steel (not aluminum) picatinny rail which is the absolute best optic foundation ever conceived on these HK G3/91 type rifles and serves to add an extra measure of rigidity to the receiver. The rifle has had 60 rounds fired through it and is in essentially new condition. I added the HK handguard ($80) designed to attach the genuine HK tripod ($125.00) that is also included in the sale along with a genuine HK G3 leather sling ($25.00). I also bought a stock extender $60.00) made specifically for the HK G3 / 91 buttstock which is adjustable in length of pull. The original butt cap will be included too. Finally, I will include 4 HK aluminum 20 rd. magazines ($25.00) in very good condition. 1 last thing, I also bought and installed an HK PRECISION CROSSHAIR front site insert by KNS ($30.00). All of these extras add up to a lot and make this package deal I am offering a great deal for the right person who would do these upgrades anyway. This rifle is in flawless condition and is the closest thing you can get to a %100 HK G3 or 91 without spending thousands more. I am not interested in any trades. Cash sale only. Price is FIRM. If you see the ad listed it is still available and emails asking if it is still available will be ignored."

This gun was recently purchased directly from the family of Daniel Waters in Massachusetts and has never previously been offered for sale. Daniel Austin Waters was born in 1840 and resided in Lowell, Massachusetts. At the outbreak of the Civil War on April 12th, 1861, Waters was working as a clerk for Burbank Chase & Co., a clothing store in Lowell. Almost immediately an independent infantry company was organized in Lowell called ""Richardson's Light Infantry"". Waters enlisted with the unit as a private on May 21st, 1861. Apparently Daniel Waters was well favored by his female co-workers as the ladies of Burbank Chase & Co. pitched in together and purchased him a brand new 1849 Colt revolver which was presented to him as a going away gift.

This rifle is in VG+ condition, and is complete with all of its parts. It is C&R and comes with a period correct leather sling.After World War II, Fabrique Nationale de Herstal of Belgium introduced a then very modern self-loading military battle rifle. Designated as the SAFN or FN49, over 175,000 were produced during the 1950s; the majority in .30-06. It operated using a tilting bolt system and short stroke gas piston. These features FNH would later carry over to its hugely successful FAL series. This is why some call the FN49 the Father to the FAL.The rifle up for auction here was originally part of the Egyptian contract, which was made up of roughly 38,000 rifles in total. It fires 8mm Mauser, has a full length 23"" barrel, parkerized finish on the metal, wooden furniture, and Arabic writing on several parts. It features a threaded barrel with muzzle nut, bayonet lug (takes most standard Mauser type bayonets) windage and elevation adjustable rear sights, and a fixed 10 round box magazine. Also somewhat uniquely, it has a small sliding dustcover to protect the action from dust and dirt, and a cocked action indicator at the front of the trigger guard. It uses a simple and effective thumb safety too. It has the Egyptian Eagle crest on its receiver, and the side is rollmarked Fabrique Nationale de Herstal.Rifle is in overall VG+ condition. It has a nice even finish, without any rust or real pitting visible. The bore is nice, with strong rifling and still pretty shiny; not at all shot out. The stock is smooth and is basically new. It has finger grooves and a plastic buttplate, so it is one of the replacement stocks put on by the importer. I believe these were made in Italy? Either way it is a nice looking and solid feeling stock.Mechanically, everything seems to work 100%. The bolt cycles, the trigger releases the hammer, the safety blocks the hammer, the magazine has a good spring and holds the bolt back when empty as it should, the dustcover slides as it should, the rear sight adjusts, and the gas valve rotates easily so it isn't stuck/rusted in place.

Only trade interests would be CZ 452/455 .22LR bolt action rifles with threaded barrels, or a Ruger Bearcat .22LR revolver (specifically a Shopkeeper).I'm located in East Central Indiana (New Castle). Email me for questions/offers. More pictures available at: https://postimg.org/gallery/1mzc31vq6/Here's the parts list and what all is included:American Tactical Omni Hybrid Polymer/Metal Stripped Upper and Lower Receivers.CMMG 4.5"" .22LR 4140CM barrel with 1/2x28"" threaded muzzle and collar adaptor.CMMG Stainless Steel ""BRAVO"" 22ARC Bolt Carrier Conversion.(A collar/chamber adaptor for use in a standard 5.56/.223 AR barrel is also included, in case you wish to drop this kit into your favorite AR-15.CMMG 22ARC Charging Handle for enhanced reliability.This handle doesn't have a channel in it to accommodate an standard AR's gas tube and carrier gas key, since this pistol doesn't have either one. This helps prevent spent 22 shells that don't eject properly from hard-jamming between the handle and bolt.CMMG 22ARC Forward Assist Adaptor and anti-bounce weight.Anderson Lower Parts Kit.Spikes Tactical ST22 Pistol Plug with QD Slot - Since this pistol didn't need a buffer tube, I instead plugged that hole with this Quick-Detach Sling slot adaptor.Brownells Forward Assist Assembly, Ejection Port Cover Assembly, and receiver end plate.Doublestar Pistol Length Free-Float Handguard.Lakeside/BlackDog Spring Tuning Kit - You can use this kit to fine-tune your setup for subsonic ammo or other considerations.2 original strength recoil springs2 extra strength recoil springs85% hammer spring (installed)33% hammer spring (for tuning for subsonic ammo)Light disconnector springA cheap pair of chinese flip-up iron sights.Five CMMG 25rd magazines, and one S&W 15-22 25rd magazine (it wobbles but it works.)I'm also including a surplus GI magazine carrier, and a Plano foam-lined case to carry everything in.This pistol runs great with bulk pack high velocity ammo! The threaded barrel would allow you to attach a suppressor if you wanted. And with the included spring kit, you should be able to make it cycle reliably with subsonic ammo too.Since this stripped lower receiver was first built into a handgun, it is my understanding that you can legally change this into a long-gun configuration, as long as you FIRST attach a 16"" or longer barrel, and ONLY THEN attach a buffer tube with shoulder stock.Of course you could also just file the paperwork and make it a Short Barreled Rifle. Or you could cheat and put an ""Arm Brace"" on it...You can also pull the CMMG bolt out, swap out it's collar with the 5.56 chamber adaptor, and drop it into your favorite 5.56/.223 AR-15 and blast away with .22LR and the included magazines. Be aware that firing .22LR out of a 5.56 barrel may cause lead build-up, and you won't get the same level of accuracy that a true .22LR barrel affords.Thanks for looking!"

They all exhibit the early Colt parts and markings as follows; the left side of the frame has the small ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY"". Directly above the magazine catch release button is marked with the circled intertwined ""WGP"" of Major Walter G. Penfield the US Ordnance inspector at Colt. The right side frame is marked with the serial number and the top of the frame has the early acceptance proofs of the letter ""H"" and ""T"". The left side of the slide is marked with the very early Colt two-line patent/ address markings of ""PATENTED APR 20 1897/SEPT. 9 1902, DEC 19 1905, FEB 14,1911"",and ""COLT'S PT. F.A. MFG CO./HARTFORD. CT. U.S.A."" with the Rampant Colt behind the serrations. It also has the early round top rear sight and narrow front sight. The various parts and components are all the early versions such as; blue Colt barrel with the single ""P and H"" on top, early 1911 checkered slide stop, thin thumb piece, short grip safety, flat mainspring housing and the early short Colt hammer with the wide checkered spur. Two tone magazine with lanyard ring on the base and fitted with checkered walnut grips with a diamond around the screws and lanyard ring on the heel. But we must remember as these Colts 103 years old where disassembled for cleaning , many parts were picked up my mistake during reassembly serial Number: 84109, this was the third contract in 1914. The pistol shows mostly an artificial dark plum brown finish on the slide and frame with light wear through turning a gray patina on the front edges of the slide and the front grip strap. Condition 100% original parts ,with 50-60% finish , The grips are very good with a few minor dings and wear, and very crisp checkering. Most of these USMC 1911's saw heavy use and went through many rebuilds. very few Marine Corps 1911’s remain as most were lost in battle during WWI,the Banna wars and WWII To find one in any condition is difficult .All FFL fees apply when required, C&R License accepted Colt letter included.

Facing restrictions placed on the German arms industry following the Second World War, main production of the PP and PPK was undertaken in France, with the resulting product considered by many enthusiasts to be the finest of all pistols to bear the Walther name very good to near excellent, the pistol retains its original Manurhin finish, with wear from holstering and flaking of finish on the grip straps. Bluing is overall better than 90%, and no rust or pitting are present on the metal.

It utilizes the same design principles as the Walther P38 pistol of World War II fame. the P5 was a more in depth version of the famous Walther P38 and P1 series. Development on the P5 resulted in requests by German police and federal agencies for a new sidearm. Walther engineers decided to use the P1 model as the basis of the P5 and gave it a similar locking system, reinforced frame, and dual recoil springs. In addition, the Walther improved the extractor, shortened the barrel, and increased the slide length. The trigger is a standard double-action/single-action trigger. The slide lock also doubles as the decocker and is located on the left side of the frame. engaging it once will release the slide, a second time will drop the hammer without firing the gun. The Walther P5 Compact is used and comes with original box and papers, two magazines, and the gun comes with the original test target. No trades but will ship"

The AR-50A1 is a highly refined rifle which is a stark and refreshing difference that maintains its superiority over its competition.

During filming, the Seattle Police Department officer assigned to the Department's Industrial Relations Division responsible for coordination between the Department and Batjac Productions became acquainted with the Duke. They met socially on several occasions and had many interactions during the shoot. At the end of the shoot, the Duke presented this gun to that police officer, Vince. It was eventually handed down to another family member who is the owner of this consignment. Shown in the photo is the Duke with members of the Seattle PD used as extras in the movie and Officer Vince (in civilian clothes). The photo is also stamped on the back by the official photographer. Also included is the Colt factory letter showing the gun shipped to the Salton Sea Armament Company in 1968.

The photos show a good depiction of overall condition and only a very small mark is seen on the cylinder. It can be fired and is about 99%.

It has very minor holster wear around front of slide but that's about it. I believe it was made in 2002-2003 and looks to have only had 200-300 rounds put through it. It has old glock style glow sights that don't really glow by themselves but can be quickly charged to glow with a light source (flashlight etc) and will grow pretty bright for about 4-5 minutes at a time. I'm mainly looking for trades for nicer revolvers in 357 or 44mag or an entry level ar15 but I am open to all firearms offers and would also accept gun plus cash.

Price is firm and very competitive, looking for a semi-local sale. Not wanting to ship. 
 
Brand new Mossberg 590 Shockwave, never fired. Intended for a birthday gift for my father, turns out he already bought one. 

Included is 10 Jungle Juice Junior shells, very impressive ballistics (look up if you don't know the brand), perfect for home defense, normally 11 dollars for 5. 

Also included is OPSols mini feed ramp, which lets you shoot any mini-shells through it. 

Box not included, tossed it when I purchased since it was a very cheap cardboard. 

 

Trades I'm particularly looking for, but will consider any firearm you want to throw my way, worst I can say is no. 

-Any older model 870, police magnum, wingmaster with wood furniture, you likely add some.

-Any wood furniture Ruger Mini 14, I likely add some unless its a beater. 

-Any non-IO AK47, I'll likely be very picky here, medium interest at best, will add depending on model.

-Any non-Taurus model revolver will be considered.

Manufacture date is 1997 so it was manufactured Pre-Remmington.Overall its in great shape. A couple small marks on the bottom of the stock are the only blemishes.The gun has a Bushnell Banner Dusk to Dawn  1.5 - 4.5 Scope with Weaver look under scope mounts.Again, excellent for Northern Wisconsin deer hunting.Also included are 26 Remington 405 Grain rounds and a soft case.
