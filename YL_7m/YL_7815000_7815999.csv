Just like the 75, the RAMI is double action/single action, allowing it to be carried in different conditions depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety. Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI ships with a 10 round flush-mount magazine and 14 round extended magazine, and a low capacity-compliant version is available with two 10 round magazines. With a 3” barrel and an unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the black polycoat, alloy-framed RAMI is ideal for concealed carry.

Comes with ARD. I will ship, CONUS only, contact me.ACOG:The Trijicon ACOG ECOS is the ultimate sight for both Close Quarter Battle (CQB) situations and longer distance shooting where accuracy and pinpoint bullet placement are required. This dual-sighting system gives the shooter a distinct tactical advantage with the option of either the Trijicon ACOG or RMR sight. With the quick target acquisition of the RMR Sight or the precise aiming capabilities provided by the magnified 4 power Trijicon ACOG— the shooter has the ability to select the proper aiming solution for the situation at hand—truly the best of both worlds. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the ECOS also features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps.RMR:Developed to improve precision and accuracy with any style or caliber of weapon, the Trijicon RMR (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) is designed to be as durable as the legendary ACOG. The RM04 is a battery free sight, featuring Trijicon fiber optics and tritium. Housed in rugged forged aluminum, the RMR is extremely tough yet lightweight. New easy-to-use adjusters with audible clicks allow for quick windage and elevation adjustments. The new Trijicon RMR is tougher than any alternative and suitable for military, law enforcement and hunting applications."

Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.. GEN 4 Features: The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested ""Safe Action"" system, Durable exterior finish, Cold hammer forged barrel, Durability, Reliability, Light weight, ....that make GLOCK firearms famous! The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin. The grip angle of the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol. The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts. Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps. Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol. THE PEARCE FRAME CAVITY INSERT FITS BOTH ADJUSTABLE BACKSTRAPS. Features: Gen4 G23, (2) 13rd Magazines, Reversible magazine catch, Rough Textured Frame, 2 Back Straps, Revolutionary ""Safe Action"" Design."

Totally reliable pistol. If you could figure out how to load their mags with beer cans, I bet  they would feed them with no problems  Super smooth and light trigger.   Very managable recoil. Traditional double and single action locked breech semi automatic pistol. Construction is steel barrel, slide assembly, internal parts, sights, trigger, hammer, levers, magazine body and innards, all built into a lightweight alloy frame. Only the grips, Mag safety plunger bushing, and magazine floorplate and follower are polymer. Barrel is 3 1/2 inch Devel type with ball joint muzzle collar that ensures accuracy and facilitates disassembly. Rifling is five groove right hand 1:18.75. Slide is serrated rear, .925 wide at the port; with ambidextrous safety levers that also decock the pistol. Slide also houses the firing pin and magazine safeties: the 6906 will not fire without magazine. Sights are matte blue steel dovetailed front and rear; dot front  These came from the factory with 12 round magazines.  My supplier didn't supply any magazines for them, but each will come with one brand new flush fitting 10 round magazine,  or a nice used 12 round flush fitting mag. 15 round mags are available for only $20, which seat well and are for the same 59 S&W series, but extend somewhat past the body of the pistol. I suggest getting it with the one flush fitting  mag, and getting the 15 round mag for $20 more. Its nice to have a 15 rounder for range time anyway.  I will not sell magazines separately without pistol purchase. While polymer frame pistols have their place  there is something to be said for a classic American made fully metal service quality pistol.  This baby eats Glocks for lunch.  This is the type of gun that you could pass on to your great grand kids after 5g rounds and it still will look and function great.   Super fantastic conceal carry pistol.  Smith & Wesson stands by its firearms, so buy with confidence."

I know it was from WW II but don't know if it was before or after. I've searched around and i see lots of these guns but not in the Chrome finish, if that' is indeed what it is. The chrome has pitting on it so i don't think it's stainless steel but could be. Collectors out there will know what this gun is. It comes with one magazine. It has not been fired in a long time and needs to be cleaned. One of the grips has a crack in it but i was told to leave it original and not try to do anything with it. The crack isnt bad and the grip is not loose at all. We ran a few rounds thru it about 30 yrs ago but hasnt been shot since then. I believe you can run .32 bullets thru it if i have that right. The serial numbers on it is wore off but you can see part of it. The end of it has a K on it and that would probably help someone to know the age of the gun. This gun was found in a field years ago and was taken to the police dept. and checked out and returned to us."
