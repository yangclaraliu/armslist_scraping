This was purchased in 2005. I set it up with an Eotech and the Rock River Arms Dominator 2 Eotech Mount. They are a perfect match. You can use either the iron sights or the Eotech without having to remove anything at all. Take a look at the specs on the Rock River Arms site. If you have been AR shopping or looked around at quality you know RRA is one of the higher quality builders of non-custom ARs out there.The original box, paperwork, the additional Dominator mount, the sling, and one 30 round Magpul mag are included.The round count is 20. About 8 years ago I took it to the range and sighted it in, cleaned it up, and then put it in the safe 'just in case'.THE Eotech scope is NOT included in the purchase. You'll need to supply your own. It can be added to the deal for $250 (not sold seperately).The price at this time is firm. If you have a real hankerin' for a gun like this and have something to trade never hurts to ask. I'll either politely decline or we can talk through some options.PRICE $700.00YOU MUST BE WILLING TO PROVIDE ID, SIGN A RECEIPT STAGING IT IS LEGAL FOR YOU TO POSSESS THIS WEAPON IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. NO EXCEPTIONS. I will sign it as well."
