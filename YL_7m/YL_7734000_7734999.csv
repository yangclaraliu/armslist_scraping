This “Pre-Supermatch” came from the estate of a former USMC “Distinguished High Master” marksman. You can look him up on the CMP website where it indicates he earned his “Distinguished “ status in 1976. Judging from the correspondence, the former owner shot this rifle while in the Marine Corps at Quantico, VA in 1976 – the same year he earned “Distinguished High Master” . The rifle began life as a National Match grade M1A, built in 1976 from the Springfield Armory. In 1997 the owner shipped the rifle off to Roland Beaver of “Old Corps Armory” where the rifle had extensive accurizing, modifying and upgrading. The rifle will come along with all of the correspondence to, and from Mr. Beaver. Some of the modifications include: McMilan M3A stock with saddle cheekpiece in olive /black cammo Obermeyer stainless match barrel with 11” twist and 5R contour (black finish) Front and rear Receiver lugs manufactured and installed along with glass bed with pillars Modify scope mount to 3rd generation Black finish barrel and barrel/receiver cryotreated It comes with the Turner Saddlery military-type 1907 sling. Additional work is documented on, and on as indicated on the armorer’s invoice… I took this rifle out and shot it from the bench using HSM 168 gn match ammo at 100 yards. The three shot group could be covered by a dime. This rifle has been well cared for. I do not have a total round count, but it has sat idle for at least ten years and obviously has always been meticulously maintained. No trades but will ship"

Its a very unique gun, and has been my favorite piece that ive owned. It is a lever action with a magazine, the first of its kind I do believe. After research ive deteremind that the gun itself is an american variant that was made somewhere around 1904-1905. There is a chance it could even be a pinkerton gun, but there are not many records from back then, so its really a guessing game. It shoots amazing and feeds like it should. I have never encountered a problem with it, pretty impressive for a 100+ year old gun. This was Teddy Roosevelts favorite model gun, which makes its DOB even cooler (made the same time he was in office). These guns go anywhere from $6k to $500.

A scarce find on the collector's market, the Gyrojet is a true oddity that, while well-hyped and innovative, was made for too brief a period to be properly refined. Made of Zamak, the pistol was a light, 7-round, smoothbore launchpad that ignited the solid rocket fuel of a .49(12mm), brass, bullet-shaped cartridge(today rarer than the gun itself). Although considered for development by the military-the Gyrojet functioned quite well under water-the gun was never used in any official capacity. Despite claims of its service with Special Forces in Vietnam, no known, documented incidents of the Gyrojet being used in combat exist, but the gun is familiar to James Bond fans, having played a prominent role in 1967's ""You Only Live Twice"".

The barrel is a fluted 28"" Pro-Hunter with EABCO scope base. The bore is bright and shiny with crisp rifling. The trigger has been professionally worked and breaks cleanly at 1lbs-10oz according to my trigger scale. I cannot recall the name of the gentleman from out East who did the work, but the name Mike Shirk keeps coming to mind. The wood is absolutely gorgeous with a high-gloss finish. There are several shallow dings and one tiny chip in the edge of the cheekpiece, but nothing significant. The forend has two extra holes -- the one at the tip is for a sling stud. The other is from a different mounting system. I think it could be easily filled or simply ignored. I bought this rifle about 10 years ago; used it a little then sold it to my brother about 6-7 years ago. I don't know that he ever fired it. Now it's back in my hands. Overall a beautiful rifle that has not be shot much. I have numerous photos that I can email or text to those interested -- PM me your info."
