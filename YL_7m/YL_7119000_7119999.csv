The sights are right on the money.

While the 6304 employs the SLS (Self Locking System) as the primary security system; it also includes the ALS internal locking device that retains the weapon in all directions when the primary device is open. The Model 6304 Tactical Holster design provides three key design elements different than previous models. Once the weapon is holstered, it ""locks"" into place , providing an extra measure of security for the weapon. The holster is completely operable with the thumb, making it very instinctive to use. Once these retention devices are released, the weapon can be drawn straight out of the holster with no twisting or other motion required. The inclusion of the rotating hood system is ideal for the tactical situations encountered today. With no snap, the SLS system allows a smoother single motion draw and greater protection against attempted takeaways and provides reliability in the unpredictable conditions that occur during tactical operations. The hood can only be released by simultaneously being pushed down and rotated forward; it actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. The Tactcial finish protects the gun in scape, scatch and dent incidents. The Thermall molded SafariLaminate protects the gun and the soft SafariSuede helps protects the sight and the finish. A key component of the comfort and stability of the 6304 is the double leg strap and the leg shroud. The leg harness is lightweight and simple to adjust.
