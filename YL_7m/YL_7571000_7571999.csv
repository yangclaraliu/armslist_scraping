For over 100 years, the 1911 pistol design has earned high praise for its near-perfect ergonomics, reliability, and effectiveness.
Springfield Armory engineered the original EMP with an all-new patented short action. Seventeen re-designed parts later, the EMP came out a smaller, more comfortable, and more concealable package optimized for the smaller 9MM and .40SW calibers. Among the community of those who know, it has earned a reputation as one of the most shootable compact pistols ever.
The all-new 4"" Lightweight Champion offers a longer four-inch barrel that presents increased sight radius and more practical accuracy. Let's not forget the extra velocity the longer barrel adds to any given cartridge."

The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly.

Please click link below. http://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/spyderco-techno-titanium-xhp-plainedge-knife-c158tip/ Description Polish knifemaker Marcin Slysz marks his Techno folder with a progressive European appearance. The Techno falls into Spyderco’s “Little Big Knives” category; meaning it has a smaller blade and handle, paired with a hard-duty locking mechanism, exotic blade steel and vault-like construction found primarily on hard-use, larger knives.  Spyderco’s first collaboration with Mr. Slysz, the Techno is also the first main-line production Spyderco CLIPIT to use Carpenter’s Steel CTS-XHP. Knife steel metallurgists refer to CTS-XHP as having the steel properties and hardness of D2 carbon tool steel but with the added advantage of chromium to classify it as a powdered stainless steel. Ground fully flat, the blade has an oversized Spyderco Round Hole and slide-resistant jimping perched on the spine. The handle is titanium with contrasting blue handle spacers leaving the handle open and exposing the inner workings for ease of cleaning.  A Chris Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L.) incorporates the handle’s back scale as the lock.  With the handle’s back side doubling as both handle and lock, the need for internal liners is dispensed with, and the knife can be manufactured lighter and slimmer while retaining greater strength.  A deep pocket wire clip can be positioned for left-hand or right –hand use with the blade tip positioned with the tip upward in the pocket.

It has some dents and dings as you would expect from a gun of this age. The metal finish in original and has that nice patinated browning color. It is thin in some areas, especially on the sides of the barrel and magazine tube. The bore has some pitting as you would expect, but it isn't too deep and the rifling is still fairly strong. The gun is in good mechanical order and everything works as it should. The action functions smoothly. The rear sight is original and still flips and functions properly.

FSB has been replaced with a NOS imported Chinese poly tech spiker assembly. This is NOT the made in USA poly tech sales today. The Chinese did not drill out the detent pin hole on there export spiker assemblies. They also used a lot more sand in there castings resulting in a grainer final product.  Dont think you will find another one. Stock set is NOS Chinese Chu Wood. Not a ding or scratch. The muzzle nut is poly tech correct for the 56 spiker. The barrel was not turned down like on many 90s but threaded for correct spiker muzzle nut.  Have correct sling manual and oil bottle. Comes with two 30 round stamped made in china magazines and one poly tech 30 round chrome follower 3 witness hole poly china stamped magazine. It has never been inseted in the rifle. Just like the day it left the factory. If you looking for a $800 run of the mill mak that's had a dozen different owners and run through the ringer this is not for you. However if you want a mint condition mak that's only had two owners since new and has been converted to 56 spiker with all the correct parts this maybe for you as long as you have one of the trade items listed below plus cash where needed. Thanks for looking and happy holidays. If you want to try it before you trade no problem. Just bring your own ammo and have at it.

This is argurably one of the best extremely small conceal carry guns.  Pretty hard to find model.  While the general rule is the bigger the caliber the better to stop a bad guy, what good is having a cannon for personal carry if its so big and heavy that you end up leaving it at home?  This pistol is EXTREMELY small and light for an all stainless steel gun.  Truly a pocket carry pistol.  Very well made.  Has some minor handling/carrying marks. For years .32acp was the caliber of choice for most European law enforcement.  Much easier to keep on target than the .380acp, or 9mm rounds.  Includes 3 factory mags.  Don't waste your time considering this model if you have large hands, or can't deal with a heavy trigger pull.   The heavy, but smooth trigger pull is the only ""safety"". 6+1 capacity.  Easiet take down of any firearm I've come across.  Stainless steel construction means great for carry in Florida heat (sweat won't damage the firearm)."
