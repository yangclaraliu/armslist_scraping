To my knowledge they made 5 of these and they only got out due to a mistake. In 2012 Magpul commissioned Nighthawk to build them a few 9mm 1911's, but when they rec'd them they did not have rails like they had wanted. So Magpul sent them back to Nighthawk and Nighthawk decided to offer each gun up to every top dealer. So I just happened to be in the right place/right time with a dealer that was slated to receive one.So as you can see it’s a 5"" 1911 chambered in 9mm with the Magpul logo on the side of the slide. It’s also got the ambi safety, serrated rear of the slide, beveled slide stop, one piece magwell, and black finished barrel. It came with the flat face trigger and Henie sights but I sent it back to Nighthawk and had them fit and install a round solid trigger, 10-8 sights, and my favorite VZ grips (original parts included). As far as condition it has approx. 300 rds thru it and isn't even broken in (hasn't been cleaned yet per NH guidelines). Very slight wear on the hood of the barrel and the barrel itself as consistent with a few hundred rounds. Cosmetically it is near perfect. Overall it is in excellent – like new condition. It will come with everything pictured including the bag, all documents including test targets & certificate, original parts removed, 5ea Wilson etm magazines, and the other little items it comes with from Nighthawk."

Generous amounts of eye relief have been designed in to allow the scopes to point quickly and to keep your face well away from the potentially abusive recoil of heavy magnums. A matte finish adds stealth to the equation.

The outcome is a firearm with superior suppression capability and enhanced reliability with both supersonic and subsonic loads A two-position gas block makes the transition from subsonic to supersonic as fast as flipping the lever. Changing between 300BLK and 5.56 NATO is as simple as swapping barrels and magazines in a matter of minutes. Converting to 7.62x39mm simply requires barrel, magazine, as well as an additional bolt change. Each SIG MCX features an aluminum KeyMod handguard, AR-style lower controls and utilizes polymer magazines. A revolutionary recoil system does not require a buffer tube, allowing for side-folding stocks. A picatinny top rail allows for the mounting of lights or optics. The aluminum forend allows for rail sections to be added where they are needed, permitting the attachment of accessories. The lower receiver offers familiar AR-style controls. Completely ambidextrous controls include the safety."
