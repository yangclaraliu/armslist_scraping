Along with the elctrical tape around the grip (to stop further cracking of stock) it really gives this gun an old farmouse/grandpa's shotgun kind of look. It's actually why I bought it in the first place. It's also unique because the shells eject out of the bottom instead of the side like usual. This thing is rock solid and works great.

I have 5 firearms that I would like to trade, would prefer to do as a package deal but willing to separate and honestly not sure even if I want to get rid of anything but I figure it wouldn't hurt to see what's out there. The list will be of the main picture in order.  1. I have a chinese type 53 mosin nagant with bayonet, this rifle is a non numbers matching (most weren't), it will need cleaned up some surface rust in bore, but I think it could be cleaned up.  2. I have an Italian Vetrreli M70/87/15 chambered in 6.5x52 carcano, this rifle I personally would not consider a shooter just based on the research that I have done. It would be more of a collectors rifle or great wall hanger.   3. I have an argentino 1891 Mauser- really nice shape all numbers matching the strap is not original.   4. I have another argentino 1891 Mauser- this one is even better shape than the one above and this one is also an all numbers matching rifle. The strap is not original.   5.

It is sighted in at 100 yards and is a lot of fun to shoot with just irons or with a co-witnessed red dot. Both outings it functioned flawlessly. IT IS PICTURED WITH A TRIJICON RMR SIGHT WHICH DOES NOT COME WITH GUN. It does however show how easy it is to co-witness a red dot optic with the iron sights. Reasonable trades are welome, however, my interests are fairly limited to American made firearms ie. big bore revolvers, big bore lever guns, mossberg 590A1, mossberg 930 spx, or a 1911 chambered in 10 mm. Im open to many cool guns but preferrably something I can hand load easily for (ie. 44 mag, 45/70, .357)"

It is my understanding that in addition to the M/1896 rifle, this pattern bayonet was issued with the M/38 short rifle as well as the AG42b Ljungmann self-loader. It should have full compatability with any of these rifles.The numbers on the bayonet and sheath do not match, however interestingly enough they are only 3 apart (462 and 465 respectively). This strikes me as an unlikely coincedence, however ultimately that is for the buyer to judge. Both the bayonet and sheath are in excellent condition, as the pictures should show.The markings on the sheath, to the best of my understanding, indicate that this bayonet was manufactured by Eskiltuna Jernmanufaktur, and assigned to rifle 1191, 9th Company, 18th Infantry Division. The ""D"" stamped over the Company marker probably indicates that the bayonet was removed from the 9th company, however remained assigned to the 18th Infantry division.The markings on the blade reveal the same manufacturer as the sheath, Eskiltuna Jernmanufaktur. Not pictured is the marking ""A3"", the meaning of which I do not know. Often, the Swedish ""A"" stands for ""Artilleriet"" (artillery), however whether that is what this particular ""A"" stands for is purely speculation.The leather bayonet frog is highly functional and an aesthetic match to the bayonet and sheath, however is not original to this model of bayonet.This set is a cool collector set on its own, or a fully functional complement to your Swedish Military surplus rifle. Again, the blade and bayonet are truly in excellent condition, and I am happy to provide higher res images on request. I will be happy to ship this item anywhere in the United States."

The gun shows virtually no signs of handling wear at all. Although I haven't tracked the rounds count, the gun is barely broken in with no more than 500 rounds through it and has not had a single issue throughout all of them. The gun shoots very well with the excellent fiber optic front sight, great trigger, and managable recoil. The only reason I am parting with it is that I have found that I am not carrying much at all and would rather use its spot in the safe for something else.Included with the gun is everything you would need for either concealed carry or even IDPA competition. The gun comes with all of the ""XD Gear"" including hard case, trigger lock, paddle holster, double magazine carrier, and owners manual. The package originally included two magazines (one flush 7 rounder and one extended 9 rounder), but I will be throwing in the additional 7 round mag plus 2 9 round mags that I purchased for a total of 2, 7-round mags and 3 9-round mags. The 9 round mags also come with interchangable grip extension sleaves for slightly different grip thickness. The 9 round mags can also be used without the sleeve for a thinner carry profile (my preference). In addition to all of this, I will also include my Crossbreed Minituck hybrid, inside-the-waistband holser made with the nice horsehide material. I have found this to be the most comfortable/best concealing holster for carrying the XDs and this holster alone is worth ~$75. I am only interested in selling everything all at once, so please don't ask for only certain items.Obviously since this is a handgun, I can only sell to those currently living in AL and, although this is not necessary, I would also prefer to see a copy of your AL ""Pistol Permit"" before completing the transaction. If you have any other questions or would like additonal photos, feel free to let me know.Asking $450"
