(Scope, Rings, and Bipod not included)This is a custom LR-308 built from the highest quality components for bolt gun like accuracy out of a gas gun. It is comprised primarily of JP components, proven to be top performing in various rifle competition venues. It has a heavier profile and higher performing Bartlein barrel in order to gain as much accuracy as possible in an AR platform. It is priced far below even the cost of the parts it took to build it. Round count is fairly low, and it has been meticulously maintained. If you’re in the market for a high end LR308, here is your chance at a great deal. Below is a list of components, let me know if you have any questions.The rifle is mostly built off of JP parts as you can see. The equivalent rifle (per JP rifle builder) would be 4084.95 new. I have roughly 3400.00 in parts plus labor costs for barrel work into the gun. I know I'm not going to get what I have into it but won't entertain lowball offers. Price is firm, do the math on the parts and realize I’m getting rid of this at a big loss so please don’t try to haggle on cash price, I won’t respond. I am willing to entertain cash plus trade offers, and we can negotiate a little bit on that end depending on what you are bringing to the table.Component list:JP PSC-12 Upper (Dual charging system) ReceiverBartlein SS 1:9.5” 18” BarrelJP Low Mass BCGJP CompensatorJP Adjustable Gas BlockJP Modular Handguard with a bipod stud, full-length top rail, QD flush mount cup, and one 2"" accessory rail.POF USA Lower Receiver (P-308)JP EZ TriggerJP Silent Captured SpringMagpul CTR StockMagpul Pistol GripI’ll also include the upper rail riser accessory (PRI 30MOA biased rail) if you want it."

I am selling a Mosin Nagant M38 rifle with a few extras (This is not a 1891/30, this is the shorter carbine commonly used by rear echelon/tankers). This rifle was manufactured in 1943 at Izhevsk. It is stamped numbers matching in its original war-time stock and sling (actual M38 stock, no M44 bayonet groove re-arsenal). Many inspection stamps and cartouche marks are still visible on the stock also. The overall condition of the rifle is great, including the non-counter-bored barrel with strong rifling. Has import markings on barrel, but stamped small and not obnoxious.
I am including a soft case, plastic ammo can, and 10 rounds of silver tip 7.62x54r.

If you don't know much about these guns, they are some of the better AKs ever imported into America. Thicker receiver and barrel means more accuracy and better sustained fire, along with generally being more robust and harder to break. The gun has had about 1000 rounds down the barrel; nothing corrosive and a vast majority of it being Golden Tiger. All parts on the gun are original and all serial numbers are matching. Bolt, Bolt carrier, and piston are all in the white, as factory. This gun was imported with a 20 inch RPK profile barrel, Chrome lined and cold hammer forged. I'm not sure 7.62 x 39 benefits tons from the extra barrel length, however if you were looking to build this into an RPK or other DMR roll AK, the longer barrel will be critical- if not, there is some velocity gained by the extra 4 inches. Or cut it down and make it 16, who the hell cares. It's your gun!Right now the gun is sporting a set of Bulgarian furniture, minus the handguard which is a Romanian dong. I planned on keeping the dong and selling with a regular Bulgy hand guard... unless otherwise per$uaded. Original furniture and sling will be included, as will a 30 round surplus Euro magazine. These guns are phenomenal collector pieces; assuming you were the kind Collector who also enjoys shooting their hardware ;D i'm looking to either get cash plus a trade or a straight across trade (any gun valued ~950.) I can make up the difference should you want to trade something worth more as well. I'm open to literally ANY fire arms trades, rifle, pistol, multi gun, etc. I'm not an asshole so don't be one either! Thank you!!"

797,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7402797,"For Sale:  Sig P320C 9mm 3.9"" 15rds with Apex+","James Island, Charleston, South Carolina",$ 475,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 18, 2017",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,no type,Pistol,"For Sale - Very very good condition Sig P320C 9mm 3.9"" with Apex trigger DA/SA Black with Contrast Sights and ""M"" Lower. Comes with 6, 15rd Sig OEM magazines, original case (matching serial), Apex light weight flat trigger, original trigger with Sig OEM replaccment spring, gun lacok, and Sig OEM OWB holster. I would say like new, but when you look on the inside upper part of the slide, you will notice where the factory black has worn. While this is completely normal and expected, I do believe it makes it less than ""like new"". The rails and barrel are still shiny black and show no signs of wear at all - I'm a fan of grease even on poly pistols. According to the case, it was made on Oct 18, 2016 and of course, made in the USA. The P320C is the Compact - not the Carry. The Carry and the Compact vary by the number of rounds for the OEM magazines - 17 vs 15 and the Compact, the weight - the Compact is slightly lighter weight than the Carry when empty, and the height - the Compact is shorter than the Carry.This is a Gen 2 P320C 9mm. The main noticible difference is the slide catch is completely enclosed versus the Gen 1 where there was only a small 'slash' below the slide catch - a huge improvement over the Gen 1 IMO. I call them Gen 1 and Gen 2, not Sig. Sig Sauer makes no mention of the lower differences at all, so be aware if you're buying an X-Change Kit or want a different size lower. The FCU is not any different from what I can tell. Use = about 750 rounds of Speer Lawman and Gold Dot 124 are the only rounds ever used on this pistol. The 124 seems to be the sweet spot for the 9mm P320 and I’ve owned/own the Full-size, Carry, Compact, and Sub Compact. The pistol will sell with 6 - 15rd Sig magazines. Yes 6 and not knock-offs, but Sig brand magazines. If you see the orange dot on the front blade, that is NOT an updated sight. I used epoxy day glow orange paint on the standard factory sights. It make target acquisition much faster but it’s only paint and not an upgraded sight. This is a very well taken care of firearm, which you will realize as soon as you see it. Also comes with an updated flat Apex trigger and spring. I also have the original trigger as well as another new in bag Sig factory trigger spring, in case you want to send it back for repair etc. it’s a Sig so Lifetine Warranty! Includes the P320C 9mm 2nd Gen pistol, original case, owners manual, OEM trigger with new OEM trigger srping, 6 15rd Sig magazines, and gun lock. Price is rock solid $475. I don’t like negotiating price and this is by far a very fair price for this setup. No trades, no shipping, cash only, in person only.So so why am I selling? I bought a P226 Legion. I still have my P320CA (Carry) 9mm Carry that I use for EDC - it also has the Apex flar trigger. I live on James Island and prefer you come to my house for sale. I can also meet at my work in Mount Pleasant. You will need to bring your current CWP or a valid SC Drivers License."
