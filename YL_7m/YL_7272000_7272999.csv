THIS IS NOT THE SPAS 12 or LAW 12 SHOTGUN! Gun history: This shotgun was purchased from a storage unit. It would appear as though the owner has had the weapon stored since the 80s. I have fired the weapon for a total of two boxes of shells. Previous owner as well as myself have used this weapon very lightly. Included with this package is 7 Mags, 6 of which are un-fired and 5 of which are still in wrappers. The Spas 12/15 Shot Diverter is included. Spare o-ring for the gas plug is located in the pistol grip. This shotgun is fully functional and is not a parts weapon.The original manual as well as an ""import manual"" are included. As far as I can tell the military manual is all you will need but the copied version is more civilian friendly. LOW DIGIT SERIAL NUMBER 000XXX I have taken several pictures and more are available upon request! Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.I understand that I am a new seller to armslist, and am more than happy to communicate with any potential buyer!I will not ship the weapon until after it is fully paid for. I will ship the shotgun and its magazines in a locked gun case. I will only ship to an FFL. Will not ship to any state where a shotgun like this is illegal. (Sorry California... Hawaii... etc) I will cover the cost of the case."

That’s why Nikon has a comprehensive line-up of rimfire riflescopes. The new PROSTAFF RIMFIRE II is the perfect optic for long range guns and combines Nikon’s Fully Multicoated optical system with the rimfire-specific BDC 150 reticle.    Nikon’s BDC 150 Reticle Designed specifically for rimfire, the BDC 150 reticle allows shooters to compensate for bullet drop at extended shooting distances. The BDC reticle’s unique see-through ballistic circles offer an incredible advantage for long range shooting, yet still allow a normal sight picture for shorter-range shots where the crosshair itself is the aiming point. Fully Multicoated Optical System Multiple layers of anti-reflective compounds on every glass surface provide bright, vivid pictures and optimum light transmission from dawn to dusk.    Spring Loaded Instant Zero-Reset Turrets To simplify field adjustments, Nikon has integrated this feature into the riflescope. Just sight-in as usual, then lift the spring-loaded adjustment knob, rotate to your “zero”, and re-engage. Field adjustments are now as simple as dialing-in your subsequent ranges. Spot On Ballistic Match Technology The PROSTAFF RIMFIRE II, like all of Nikon’s riflescopes, is optimized for use with Nikon Spot On™ Ballistic Match Technology. Spot On allows you to discover all of the exact aiming points on your scope’s reticle at various yardages for your specific ammunition and load.

Authorized Spyderco dealer, Full factory warranty offered by Spyderco on this fine knife. Why change something if it works? Because, at Spyderco, we practice the principle of C.Q.I. – Constant Quality Improvement. If we can refine and improve the ergonomics or cutting performance of an established model, we do it. Our Para-Military2 has several changes over the classic version. The G-10 handle is narrowed at the end improving the ergonomics. The handle and blade have been profiled thinner; removing uncomfortable angles when in the closed position. It features a Compression Lock and an ambidextrous-friendly four way clip which carries tip-up/tip-down, left/right-hand, and rests deeper in the pocket. This Paramilitary2 exclusive run features a Crucible, inc. powdered technology CPM-S35VN steel blade that is ground full-flat with a thin edge for optimal cutting performance — and it WILL shave hair off your arm right out of the box. CPM-S35VN is structured similar to CPM-S30V but with the addition of niobium (columbium) carbides along with vanadium and chromium carbides. Niobium makes the steel tougher while enhancing resistance to wear and chipping and improves edge retention over basic smelted high-chromium steels. Paired with brown G-10 handle scales, this model offers fine-tuned handling ergonomics and an over-sized piped lanyard hole. The knife comes with Spyderco’s patented Compression Lock and a four-way, hour-glass pocket clip allowing the folder to carry tip-up or tip-down, and be adjusted for left- or right-handed use. This knife is made right here in the USA in Golden, Colorado. The overall length is 8 1/4″, blade length is 3 1/2″, blade steel is CPM S35VN, closed length is 4 13/16″, cutting edge is just a hair over 3″, weight is 3.8 ounces, blade thickness is 1/8″, and handle material is G-10. This knife is made in Golden, Colorado, USA!"

The basis of many of Kel-Tec's current offerings were first produced there under George Kellgren. The SRT-20F was produced in the 80's, and production ceased in the 1990's. They use a Sako A2 action and reciever, Douglas match barrel and specially made muzzle brake. The rifle has a capacity of 9 + 1 and feeds from a fixed internal box magazine. The stock is the most unique feature of the gun, and is capable of folding under the trigger group similar to the Kel-Tec SU-16 series of rifles. The sling swivel is specifically made so the once standard USGI M16 clip-on bipod can be attatched. The gun weighs just 6.7 lbs yet is extremely comfortable to shoot.This particular rifle is outfitted with an older Weaver Tactical 3x9 MilDot scope, sun shade, and nylon sling. This rifle is extremely fun to shoot and has spent most of it's years sitting in a gun safe. I prefer cash, but any interesting and fair trades will be acceptable as well."

Simply put, TriNyte delivers scratch and corrosion resistance dramatically superior to standard stainless steel as well as any protective coating by any other manufacturer. The Accuracy International Chassis System (AICS) presents Remington 700 owners with an advanced chassis system that is not only superbly functional but ergonomically inclined as well. The rugged platform of the AICS combines the leading characteristics of steel and polymer. Featuring a full-length, aluminum, self-aligning, self-bedding vee block this system more than supersedes traditional bedding practices. Technical Information: Full Length Aluminum Chassis: Attached to the action via two bolts, features a self-aligning vee block bedding system. Folding Chassis: The 2.0 AICS features a rapid deployment folding feature which is actuated by pulling the stock in the rearward position. When folded, the overall length of the 2.0 is reduced by 8"". Stocksides: Polymer stock sides encapsulate the aluminum chassis. The polymer sides provide for a secure grip, are impervious to regular cleaners/lubricants and are in black. Adjustable Cheekpiece: Ambidextrous for right or left hand shooters. Adjustable for height as well as windage (left and right), this cheekpiece optimizes cheek weld for a superior shooting experience. Sling Attachment Points: Four sling swivel attachment points (two per side) allow for multiple sling mounting positions. Magazine: Included with the AICS is a flush fitting 5-round detachable magazine manufactured from industry-leading corrosion resistant steel. Weight: The 2.0 Long ActionFolding Chassis AICS weights 6.15 lbs Barrel: 24"" coated stainless threaded barrel with brake. Bipod: Harris bipod included with scope."
