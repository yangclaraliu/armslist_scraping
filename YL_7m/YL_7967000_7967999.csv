Bad life choices...anyway...Up for sale I have a Ruger Mark IV 22/45 Lite. It functions flawlessly, has a great trigger, and is very accurate. I have about 3 magazines worth of rounds through this gun.DISCLOSURE: The sight screw for the front sight won't come out. Pretty sure whatever it's threaded into on the inside of the reciever tube is stripped, as it just kinda spins. The sight is still completely secure, but I'm throwing this out there because I don't want to be ""that guy"". It's under warranty from Ruger I just haven't had the time or interest to send it in.Gun is in near mint condition, but there is a small mark on the rail section where I used the wrong screws for my Vortex and it dented the rail a bit from being too tight. There is a picture of this in the album.Comes With $115+ worth of extras listed below:Tandem Cross ""Game Changer"" Compensator.Tandem Cross ""Halo"" Charging Handle.Tandem Cross ""Titan"" mag release. (I only have the large paddle, don't have the smaller one, or the factory mag release, sorry!""Also comes with 2 magazines, the original muzzle device/thread protector, and the box with the original lock and paperwork.Considering the issue with the front sight, the slight rail damage, and the extras I have in it, I'm asking $400 local. I believe that is more than fair for a firearm that only has a few mags through it.Not interested in trades.Located in Northville, willing to travel a bit but nothing crazy.

There is way too much to list, but everything is either new or refurbished. Most everything was kept stock/original with the exception of some practical upgrades Every line on the car was replaced with stainless steel (brake lines, trans lines, fuel lines, choke tubes, etc) The entire heater box was rebuilt with all new seals, heater core, A/C evaporator core, vacuum hoses, etc. Every single part of the A/C system is new (Compressor, condenser, hoses, fittings, expansion valve, receiver/dryer, etc.) Much of the body has new sheet metal (all 4 inner fender structural panels, radiator support, entire cowl assembly, fenders, valances, quarters, trunk floor, taillight panel, decklid, front floors, rear floors, bottoms of doors, etc) The engine and trans have been completely refreshed/refurbished (not rebuilt), all new gaskets, filters, freeze plugs, fluids, belts, hoses, paint, etc. Most electrical components are new (deep cycle battery, alternator, starter, solenoid, voltage regulator, ignition switch, plugs, wires, cap, rotor, coil, electronic ignition (eliminates points and condenser), wiper motor, LED dash light bulbs, printed dash circuit, headlights, parking/turn signal lights, marker and taillight bulb sockets and wiring, dome light, etc., etc. The original exhaust manifolds have been blasted and coated with high temp silver ceramic header paint, along with the entire new dual exhaust system with chrome Mach1 tips Every part of the front suspension is new including the coil springs, upper control arms, lower arms, all ball joints, tie rods, links, shocks, bushings, etc. The rear suspension is all new (leaf springs, shackles, air shocks) The entire chassis, axle, etc has been cleaned and painted black, with the entire undercarriage truck bed lined and undercoated The whole engine compartment, trunk, and interior floors have been truck bed lined, along with the inside of the doors Most of the chrome is all new (front bumper, rear bumper, grille molding, fender moldings, rocker moldings, wheel opening moldings, door handles, mirrors, antenna, emblems, etc The vinyl top moldings, front and rear window moldings, taillight panel moldings are being professionally polished  The car is currently in gray primer, but needs some finishing body work to make it perfect, then proper epoxy primer/sealer Since it is not yet painted, you can pick any color you want and customize it to your liking.  If I end up finishing it, it will be the original Bright Lime color with white vinyl top and I planned to add white Mach1 stripes and white Sprint hood stripes (I have the new vinyl top and all of the stripes already)  All of the windows, windshields, glass is out of the car, along with most of the interior. I have everything except for a new windshield. I started buying new interior components and still have all of the original except for the carpet.  I have many boxes of new and old parts, piles of receipts, a good bit of literature/shop manuals I have an Elite Marti report (16x20 framed) that displays a copy of the original window sticker/price sheet, VIN door decal, and a statistical breakdown of options and rarity. This took 6 months to process and cost $250 I have color copies of the original 1972 Maryland title (it is currently a PA title in my name)(I am the second owner) The car sat for many (20+) years before I got it with 53,000 original miles on it. Before I brought it in for the full restoration, I did the mechanical and suspension parts and enjoyed driving it for over 8000 miles.  Aside from there being no windshield in the car, it is completely drive-able. It starts right up, sounds great, and every light is hooked up and working.  I would love to finish it and keep it, but unfortunately I could use the money more right now.  Not counting my own seemingly endless amount of hours of labor, I am just looking to get back the money I put out in parts and labor to other people.  Please - only serious buyers and inquiries $17,500 is the asking price That is less than what I have into it at this point. Don't expect me to come down much in price. I would rather keep it. I'm already taking a loss at this price. I am not desperate to sell it, so PLEASE - NO ridiculous, lowball offers or any negative/rude commentsI may consider a partial trade for firearm(s), but with mostly cash to go with it.Trade interests would be: Colt Pythons, Diamodback, Nice S&W revolvers (357mag, 38spcl and 22lr), Minty older Remington rifles (308win and 22lr mainly), and Wingmaster's (12gauge), Maybe a nice Norinco Hunter or CZ527 in 7.62x39  This can be completed as a very nice restoration to drive or show and well worth the investment.I can deliver the truckload of parts if need be within a reasonable distance."

825,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7967825,For Sale:  Princeton Tec Charge Helmet Light in IR and White LED,"South Philly/ South Jersey, Southeastern, PA, Pennsylvania",$ 40,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 13, 2018",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,This is a Princeton Tec charge infrared with two levels a low and a high and a 50 lumen White LED light. It slides perfectly on helmet rails without the need of any adapters and included or a bunch of different adapters such as for a Molle vest or a full tan helmet mount and others. It's only a month old and never actually used. These sell for $100 and I'm letting this one go for $40 shipped. And face-to-face in South Philly or South Jersey area is also $40 and if it needs to be shipped payment is accepted through PayPal and shipment right away by USPS with tracking provided. The light body is in tan and uses a single double A battery. If you have night vision and used a helmet with rails this is the very best light that you can buy. It does work much better with generation 2 and Generation 3 night vision but it does also work fine with Generation 1. The great thing about this infrared light is it doesn't have that red glow signature that most infrared lights have it's so very faint that it's almost non visible.

Higgins model 20 12 ga. shotgun.  As far as I can tell, it was produced for Sears by High Standard and is just like the High Standard 200. This one was branded and sold by sears and has the cool Power Pac Choke on it and the medium range choke installed. there were 3 choke tubes for this, small, medium, and long range interchangeable. Sears sold all 3 with a wrench to change out. Sadly, this gun only has the one tube. They can be found on Ebay from time to time.   This is a very well made gun and in really good working condition. Barrel is very clean. Wood is in great condition."
