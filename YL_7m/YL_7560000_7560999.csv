This pistol is original, in very nice condition & looks far better than my photographs. I would say very easily a 95% gun with a little wear on the sharp edges (especially around the muzzle, face of muzzle doesn't have much finish) & on the front of the grip strap. Grips are obviously vintage aftermarket & have a large chip out of the front left side (see photos). The magazine is an original Colt Woodsman magazine. It is 2 line on the bottom, not 3 line, & is not ""two tone"". It may or may not be original to the pistol, but it is an original Colt & it functions perfectly. A lot of collectors claim that this pistol came with a case hardened two tone magazine & that it had a 3 line ""address"" on the bottom. I have a Sutherland Colt book & it suggests that it could have come either way. There are 3 initials, CLB, engraved on the left side of the frame which are well done & I feel do not detract from the pistol. I have a factory letter that shows this pistol being shipped to a sporting goods in San Francisco, California in 1941 in a shipment of 10 similar pistols. Pistol is very nice & shoots extremely well.

Of all the rifles produced in an era often called 'the Winning of the West' the John Browning-designed Winchester Model 1892 stands out as an engineering masterpiece. Light, fast, ultra quick to the point, natural . . . . essentially perfect. Of all the pistol caliber rifles of the day, none have become more viable in modern Cowboy Action shooting than the '92. It's a good year to get your hands on some history. The favorite of the Duke and just about all the cowboy actors. 'Fill your hands you . . . ' The Model 92 was elevated to the status of movie star for three quarters of a Century by many of the most famous on-screen cowboys. When you saw a movie with John Wayne, or watched The Rifleman with Chuck Connors you knew that the rifle they used was more than a screen prop. Going back in time, Annie Oakley performed across the world with Buffalo Bill shooting her special smoothbore 1892. $2,900.00  Firm PriceOnly serious contacts....  PLease."
