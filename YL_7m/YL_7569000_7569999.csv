This accepts any 9mm Glock magazine. I made two and decided to keep only one. This one needs takedown pins and a lower parts trigger kit in order to complete. Includes Angstadt Arms matching upper and lower receiver, Angstadt Arms 9mm bolt carrier, spring, and buffer tube set. Has a Law-Tactical Gen 3 ceracoated buffer tube folding adapter. Barrel is Wilson Combat match grade 9mm affixed to a Dolos Tactical/Panteon Arms takedown set. Everything works as it should. I would recomment investing in a good optic, as the rail on the reciever is too short for a iron sight set-up unless you change out the Dolos tube. Additionally, from previous experience, I recomment getting the extended takedown pin set, the standard set is a bit too wide for the rear takedown pin to fit. Any questions or parts can easily be ordered through Angstadt Arms or Brownells. I do have a Phase-5 extended bolt release attached. You can use a standard bolt release with a lower parts kit if you prefer. I also included a standard charging handle, so parts on your end to complete would be bare minimum. No gunsmithing needed.

From a 50-year Texas collection, here's an uncommon 1911! This first-year production Springfield Armory 1911 was one of the 50 pistols shipped to the Ordnance Office for safety testing in August of 1914. Good original Springfield 1911 pistols are rather hard to locate as only 25,767 were produced in total (compared to Colt's production of over 600,000 1911 pistols). The Springfield pistols were well made and parts were generally interchangeable with those of the Colt. Regardless, many of the components were marked with a small ""s"" to identify them as Springfield parts. The slide and frame markings were also unique and different from those of the Colt pistols. In addition to the maker markings, the left side of the frame and slide were stamped with the U.S. ordnance ""flaming bomb"" symbol while the right side of the slide carried the famous Springfield eagle. The Springfield pistols were also finished differently than the Colt pistols and they received a traditional rust blue type finish. This process left them with a somewhat duller, more satin appearing finish.This pistol is in very fine original condition. All of the markings are sharp and clearly legible. Most of the various component parts carry the small Springfield ""s"". The ""s"" marked parts include the slide stop, safety catch, mainspring housing, grip safety, sear, firing pin retainer, extractor, and barrel bushing. The barrel is Springfield ""s"" marked on the left lug and ""M"" marked on the rear of the hood. The hammer has no ""s"" marking but is clearly correct with the unique Springfield style checkering, long style, with sharp rear edge... Clear evidence that the ""s"" marking was occasionally omitted. The disconnector, magazine catch, and trigger are also unmarked. This pistol has good eye appeal and retains the great majority of its original rust blue finish. There is some expected handling wear and some generalised thinning. There are a few very small dings to the right side of the frame around the slide stop pin but no rust or any pitting. The finish on the grip straps rates very good. The internal wear patterns are consistent between the frame, slide, and barrel. The grips are of Springfield manufacture with 10/11 lines of checkering between the two large diamonds. The grips are in very good condition and free of cracks although there is some normal wear and one small chip at the front/bottom corner of the right panel. The mechanics are in perfect working order, everything working precisely as it should. The bore rates very good and exhibits strong, sharp rifling that shows some minor frost in the grooves. It comes with the correct Springfield ""folded base"" lanyard loop magazine that is in very good shape showing just a small amount of corrosion. This pistol belongs to the first serial block of Springfield pistols and was made in the first year of production (1914). It is also very interesting to note that it is listed by serial number in Scott Meadows' book ""U.S. Military Automatic Pistols 1894-1920"" (page 194) and is one of the small group of fifty Springfield 1911's shipped to the Office of the Chief of Ordnance for safety testing on August 13, 1914. A very nice example of the Springfield Armory 1911 with the added interest of having been part of a special shipment...a great addition to your military collection!"

Whether you're going after high flying geese or a big Tom, you will be able to tip the odds in your favor with the most reliable, well-made and accurate pump shotgun on the market.
With a forged and machined steel receiver with dual steel action bars it is one tough shotgun. Simply stated it's a tough shotgun. Also unique to the BPS is the bottom feed and ejection port - instead of flinging empty hulls out to one side, empties drop straight to the ground underneath the action. This eliminates visual distraction when hunting airborne game, but it also keeps empty hulls from flying in the face of a left-handed shooter. In fact, this feature combined with the top tang safety makes the gun truly ambidextrous X Full (Turkey), Lead Full, Steel Full and Lead Imp chokes."

It has a very low round count, is insanely accurate, and it was purpose built for very hard abuse. It will reliably fire whatever you throw into it, suppressed or unsuppressed, and it will shoot it extremely accurately. Mega Arms Nickle Boron receiver, cerekoted on the outside only. Slick as butter NiB on the inside. Please understand how much this costs before you compare this to your gun store budget gun. Please do your research. Before you ask or get confused - yes the outside of the receiver is cerekoted black and I additionally used high heat black spray paint over that. This was my preference because it helps give the firearm a more worn look. If you don't like it, then this gun just might not be for you. Bad-Arms-Development Ambidextrous-Safety-SelectorGeissele SSE trigger. This trigger is absolutely amazing and will help you shoot faster and more accurately. PWS Mod 2 buffer tube with ratchet lock castle nut and end plateB5 pistol grip. This is a great pistol grip with a good angle for CQB. It is also a prime candidate for a stipple job if you are into that. Unity Tactical Iron sights with Surefire mini Scout light attached. Hodge Defense Rail with Wedgelock barrel nut (amazing stability if you are using bipods or lasers).Micro MOA barrel with patented hybrid poly-hexagonal rifling. EXTREMELY ACCURATE. Nitrided for durability.Daniel Defense Buttstock. Really tight lock up with no wiggle. Better than SOPMOD (really wiggly) and better than MAGPUL (a tiny bit of wiggle). Honestly, the DD buttstock was not what I thought I'd end up with, but test after test brought me back to it because it's reliable, feels great, and the lock-up is perfect. Additional Geissele Mk8 and Mega Wedgelock rail come with your purchase. These are just extra rails that I've tested. Both of these are also great options, but the Hodge Defense (also made by Mega/ZEV) rail had the right mix of barrel nut length, rail rigidity, and comfort. These extra rails have barrel nuts but you'll need to order new screws from each manufacturer for a couple bucks if you want to install them. Don't give me grief about losing the screws - remember this is a great deal. If you offer me a dime less than what I'm asking for then these rails will not be included. I am only interested in Cash or a Glock34 Gen 5 + cash. I am not interested in any other options or variations of what I just asked for. This rifle is worth way more than $1300 so don't waste your time trying to bargain with me. There are far less capable ""Gucci"" guns out there going for 2-3x my price. You're always welcome to spend your hard earned money elsewhere, but I promise you I'm giving you the deal of a lifetime."
