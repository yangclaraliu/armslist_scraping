Hellhound for sale on here for currently $900 previously he was asking $700. First I would encourage anyone looking to research this item. It is not being made anymore because it is utter crap. The rifles kept exploding and the receivers kept cracking. After firing 300 rounds the bolt usually locks up and is impossible to move rendering the rifle useless. This looks like the exact same rifle another person was selling for around $700 as well. My guess is this new seller bought it and realized he got scammed and is now trying to get something back.Please beware this seller obviously has no integrity and is trying to scam anyone foolish enough not to do their research. As a gun community we need to stand together and oppose people like this.There are also countless horror stories regarding the IO Inc. AKM’s including their hellhound. This company has gone bankrupt once already and it looks like a second time is coming soon. Their customer service is one of the worst. Just google “IO Inc Ak47 problems and  you will see what I say is fact. Also you can just do a quick Youtube search of the name IO Inc alone and see they are full of problems. Please do your research everyone!! This person is a thief. You can buy a used Arsenal for $900 and they are considered the gold standard. For anyone who looks at his AK just take off the dust cover and look at the spring as well as the trigger group. I guarantee the spring will be faulty and the trigger group will look ground down. Why? Because the material IO Inc. uses is of the lowest quality. I have owned one and I sold it for $300 dollars. The person who bought it had to send it into IO Inc and still hasn’t received it back. That was one year ago! Don’t be fooled.I tried adding his link but armslist will not allow me. It shouldn’t be too hard to find. I emailed him and his email says Nick Lynch. Not sure if that is his real name.

Looking for a fnx tactical, sig legion 229,226. Hk 45c. Factory  ars. Can make other offers.Our Guardian has proven so popular due to its concealable profile and Commander-length slide that we took it a step further with the CCO ? the Concealed Carry Officer ? a Commander slide on an Officer frame. With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won?t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our ?chain-link? grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look.The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration.The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional."

We designed this weapon to be extremely maneuverable, quick, and extremely accurate. With an overall length of less than 26” this Pistol can be concealed easily and also very discrete if necessary, but if you want to unleash the full potential of this weapon you can reach targets of 300yds or more. The Rebel Raptor is equipped with a 10.5” medium taper barrel with a 10” Keymod rail system and is capable of MOA accuracy. The Raptor incorporates all the Top Shelf parts and construction of every Rebel Rifle, but just in a smaller package.The raptor comes optics ready.BarrelThe Raptor comes equipped with 10.5 Inch Rebel Arms 4150 CMV Nitride premium barrel. Our all new barrel is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO. The 1x7 Twist Rifling is capable of stabilizing light to heavy weight projectiles of up to around 75 grains.Upper ReceiverOur receivers are fully machined from heat-treated, aircraft-grade aluminum forgings for superior strength and durability.Lower ReceiverOur Mod 2.1 lower receivers are designed from a 7075 T6 aluminum alloy forging for reliable performance and outstanding durability. Our receivers are precision machined to ensure installation of mil-spec aftermarket components. Our receivers feature a low shelf for RDIAS use, a flared magwell for easier reloading and a groved front magwell for added grip.Fire Control GroupThe Raptor comes with a premium polished mil-spec fire control group. The trigger pull is measured at 5-7 lbs with standard length reset.Nitride Bolt CarrierThis rifle features a high quality Nitride Bolt Carrier Group. Unlike phoshpated or parkerizing, our bolt carriers have a black nitrided surface that eliminates the need to apply oil to the carrier that can attract dirt, dust, unburned powder, and carbon and lead to cycling failures. The nitriding process creates an ultra-low friction coefficient to the surface. When you feel the surface of the carrier you will notice that it is much smoother and slipery to the touch. It also means less heat generated by metal on metal contact and also provides for easier cleaning.The process hardens the steel as well, which makes this carrier have an increased resistance to wear thereby increasing the life of of the component and increases the amount of shots you can run over the life of it. The Gas Key comes already side-staked properly to the carrier."
