When Beretta stopped making their own Cougar 8000 handguns in 9mm, .40 Cal and .45 Cal they moved the factory (tooling and everything) to their Stoeger facility in Turkey and continued making them there.  Labor costs dropped considerably, but the Beretta quality remains and these really nice handguns are a steal at their MSRP. This .45 is an amazing weapon and very comfortable to shoot and pin point accurate. This is the third Stoeger Cougar that I've had (2 9mm and this .45) and I'll put them up against any handgun on the market for value, reliability, accuracy, build quality and durability. Besides that it's a fine looking weapon. They are DA/SA with a decocker lever on the rear of the slide (a la typical Beretta pistols). This .45 even has an accessory rail, which is not found on the 9mm or the .40 Cal. A really nice handgun at a bargan price. Local pickup/exchange means NO tax, NO shipping fee, NO ffl transfer fee, NO federal forms to fill out and NO waiting."

Yes, you can get one in Stainless, and yes, you can get a wooden stock. BUT, You can't get a stainless Light Hunter with a wooden stock unless you special order it from Savage. When you do this, it goes through the custom shop. This also has had Thermal processing done. What is that you ask? It is a very advanced version of Chriogenically freezing the barrel. All the metal on this rifle has been Cryogenically treated using Thermal Processing. This takes all of the stress out and actually aligns the molecules up to make for a more durable, longer lasting barrel life.  This rifle has over $1,000 put into it and outside of a muzzle brake, there is really nothing more to do. And, that is naturally optional. I am selling this rifle for $850 and that is a bargain. Sorry, no trades. If you ask if this is still available I will not answer you. These scammed are really getting to be annoying."

Pre-war production Lend/Lease M1 Garand Rifle. This is an excellent example of, original condition 1941 M1. Manufactured at the Springfield Armory. The rifle was one of a number shipped as military aid to the United Kingdom under the Lend-Lease Act. The rifle is identified by its low serial number, matching, pre-war date(10-41), and British proof marks on the barrel. All parts appear original and correct for the time of production. In excellent, apparently unissued condition. Original arsenal phosphate finish is better than 95% with the gas cylinder expectedly turned a silvery pewter. There is the occasional rub mark typical of parkerization, as well as traces of old, dried grease, but no rust, pitting or fading of finish are visible on any component other than the gas cylinder. Markings are well-struck, correct, and include the BNP/Tonnage markings and Birmingham House Proofs. There is no import or export mark on the rifle, and the barrel date, 10-41, corresponds with the serial number. All marked components are of Springfield make, with the trigger guard housing and safety possibly being replacements. Furniture rates as near excellent as refinished, with an added coat of lacquer. There are two superficial hairline cracks eminating from the upper rear handguard and no other visible chips, repairs or damage, apart from light handling marks and the occassional pressure dent. There is a faded circle-P firing proof on the pistol grip, as well as a faded Ordnance Wheel and ""SA-GHS"" cartouche on the left of the stock, and the furniture is correct for the gun and almost certainly original. Mechanically flawless, the bore shows no wear to the rifling and traces of residue, possibly cosmoline. I'm not a FFL so make sure your dealer will accept private shipment. Ready to ship!"

I threw a package together to give the new owner a good start at the range, on the trail or in competition. Included in this package is the Glock Tactical Light (GTL) 1x, Ameriglo Tru Dot night sights, three 15 round mags and a Fobus holster that is made to accommodate the light. I personally use this type of Fobus holster while I'm hunting. I can tell you that the retention is great and the comfort of the holster is second to none. I even ride my ATV with this holster on and I have never even worried about my pistol coming out. Glock mismatched the frame and the slide when they shipped this pistol.  The serial number on the frame and the serial number case match.  I talked to Glock.  They said it was a simple mistake and it will not affect the warranty.  Besides, I think that it looks pretty cool and adds character to an, otherwise, boring pistol.Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need additional photos.  I will only accept personal checks, USPS money orders, Credit Cards, Certified Checks from your bank or cash if you are local.  Please add 3.5% for a credit card purchase.  Please include your name and phone number when you contact me, or I may not respond.  I've been getting a lot of scammers lately.  Inluding your name and number will prove to me that you are serious about the sale.  Thanks for looking!"

This rather limited production pistol features the lightweight ""Dural"" aluminum alloy frame but is otherwise your standard PPK from the period. It does not however, have any import markings nor is it marked ""Made in Germany"", except along the bottom of the left grip panel. It appears this pistol was assembled, finished and proofed in Germany, perhaps for sale within Germany herself. The owner's manual is printed in German only. Overall condition is excellent, almost brand new, except that it rested a bit too long in the box and a very small spot of corrosion developed at the right front tip of the slide. Otherwise, the finish is very close to 100%. There is no other rust. The grips are excellent, free of cracks or chips. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent too. It comes in the excellent condition/original box which numbers to the gun. Also included are the original serial numbered factory test target, the German language owner's manual, brass cleaning rod, and firing pin tool. Almost perfect, this classic little gem weighs in at a svelte 17-ounces.Buyer pays $20.00 shipping."
