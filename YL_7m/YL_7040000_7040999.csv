It looks great all around and was manufacutred in 2000. It's a polymer framed handgun, and is generally seen as CZ's (CZ USA) first foray into polymer framed pistols. This comes with two magazines, a factory one and a Pro-Mag. The Pro-Mag is fresh out of the package brand new and hasn't been used. The factory mag is rather well-worn, though. It doesn't always catch the slide after the last round is fired.The CZ 100 is a double-action only pistol with a trigger pull comparable to a DAO Revolver. The gun was designed for carry, but it just as good at the range as it is in your waistband. It has adjustable rear sights and a ported barrel/slide. The componenet in the middle is not an extension of the sights, but rather an odd little device that's meant to chamber the weapon by pressing the component against a hard edge and pushing against it. This is meant to be used if your other hand is busy. Underneath this component is a silver knob that acts as a chambered round indicator. The CZ 100 is perhaps best remembered by fans of movies as being the primary sidearm of Major Motoko, the lead character in the animated 1995 film Ghost in the Shell. Looking for 350 cash or trade (See below for latter, if trading, please send pictures first). Willing to meetup in the following locations due to familiarity: Oconomowoc, Delafield, Hartland, Okauchee, or Brookfield. Can possibly meet elsewhere. Can throw in what little 40 ammo I have for extra. Thanks for looking!"

Buy this firearm online at www.copsgunshop.net.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.  Sorry, no trades. The first of the many recent additions to the Heckler & Koch handgun line, the P2000 and incorporate features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” model. The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols. With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 – 8.5 pounds (27.5 – 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7N). The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol. A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike. Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines."

Kimber builds the world's finest 1911 pistols right here in America—something that makes sense, as few things are as American as a 1911 .45 ACP. Virtually every critical component of every pistol is manufactured inside the Kimber factory. The finest raw materials come through the front gate and Kimber does the rest, the only way to ensure that every part meets unequaled standards. America's best shooters keep choosing Kimber. Legendary LAPD™ SWAT tested five major 1911 brands and chose Kimber. United States Marines assigned to Special Operations Command chose Kimber. The U.S.A. Shooting Rapid Fire Pistol Team trains for Olympic competition with a Kimber. Most recently, LAPD™ SIS transitioned to Kimber. They all chose Kimber for the same reason: quality, dependability and accuracy. So should you.

It has a bolt hold open notch in the safety lever, dimpled reciever, Wolf springs, great RAK1 trigger, lightened bolt carrier, wide paddle ambidextrous magazine release and nice nitride finish. This rifle is completly American made and it shows. I've fired about 3 or 4 magazines through the gun and it is easily the Most accurate AK I have ever owned or fired. It has a side rail for a sight mount on the side of the reciever that is lazer aligned to the barrel. The rifle sits in a black tactical carry bag that also carries the accessories for it. For this rifle I have a polymer Magpul Moe P Mag, a polymer Master Molder ""Law Enforcement"" mag and a Croation bolt hold open steel mag. All 3 of the magazines are 30 rounders. The new sling in the carry bag has never been put on the rifle. I installed the aftermarket quad rail, foregrip and folding stock but I still have the wood set. The foregrip has a sealed storage compartment. I also have a military grade 5 mode flashlight for the rifle with lithium ion rechargeable batteries, charger, spare battery and hard case. $700 FIRM.

These were the last of the real Russian made factory AK's available in the United States. The Vepr is not your standard AK, these are made in the Molot RPK factory in Russia. They are much more robust than a normal 1mm stamped receiver AK, these receivers are 50% thicker which translates to less receiver flex when fired, which = greater accuracy. The trunions are also more stout, and the barrel is set inside of a bulged front trunion. The barrel itself is a beefed up RPK barrel, much thicker than a standard AKM barrel. The Vepr even sports standard 1,000 meter RPK sights, with adjustable elevation AND windage. These are among the most accurate factory made AK's ever produced.Comes with everything that is included in the box, the 5 rd mag, cleaning rod, cleaning kit and owners manual. Extras include:* Genuine Russian Military Surplus sling, OD green with ""OTK"" stamp* 4 Croatian 30 round Steel mags, 2 still in plastic and cosmoline* 2 Magpul 30 round Pmags* 200 rds of 7.62 ammo to get you startedAsking $1,500 or highest offer, not looking for trades.Lowballers will be ignored.Text for fast response.71three-517-four864"

Fits like a glove. Discontinued years ago. These knives are getting harder and harder to find and they don't come up often any more. A production run of 1000. This is an early 360 numbered. Blade just over 6 1/2in long, razor sharp with jagged saw teeth. Enhanced gut hook closer to Beck style. Larger than a T.O.P.S. Tracker and way more brutal. Knife is 12 1/2in overall length. There are sheath scratches and light sharpening which may still be factory sharpening. An incredible design.  The blade is extremely sharp and very clean.  Only slight marks appear on the blade from the sheath leather.  Very very faint surface streaks.  Also there is a small ding on the micadta handle on one side.  The area is about as big as an pencil eraser and is hardly noticeable.  The only effect is it is slightly rough in that area.  MESSAGE ME FOR PICS OF THE AREA.The sheath was custom made for this knife by Holloman Leathersmiths with dual rare-earth magnets for an extremely tight lock in the sheath.  Made from top grade thick saddle leather. Beautiful color.  This sheath was produced for this extact knife when they were first listed for sale.  This was an expensive upgrade, but very nicely hand craftedThis is a terrific package deal and one of a kind deal at that. The hardest thing to deal with when it comes to RS6B knives is finding a cool sheath because they were bigger than other designs. That part is done. This sheath will go the distance..  I will ship CONUS and maybe outside if your area is legal..."
