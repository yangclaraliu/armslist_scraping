Custom Shop enhancements include recessed slide stop pin with surrounding bevel, high cut under trigger guard for better recoil control and aggressive front strap serrations that ensure a positive grip regardless of conditions. Round heel frame configuration makes Super Carry pistols easier to conceal and more comfortable to carry. Serrated mainspring housing welds grip to palm, encouraging fast sight picture recovery between shots.The Super Carry family was designed with a single purpose, to be the finest concealed carry pistols available today. Night sights, ambidextrous thumb safety and match grade trigger group are standard. Stainless steel slides and light weight aluminum frames wear KimPro II, a proprietary high-tech finish that is self-lubricating and extremely durable. The Super Carry Custom has a 5-inch stainless steel match grade barrel, the Super Carry Pro has a 4-inch bull barrel and the Super Carry Ultra has a 3-inch bull barrel plus a frame with shorter grip. Super Carry pistols combine dynamic style with outstanding quality and performance – just what you expect from Kimber.All Kimber pistols in centerfire calibers have a Loaded Chamber Indicator Port.™ When a round is chambered and light is available, the shell casing should be visible through the slot at the rear of the barrel hood. All slides and frames are paired in the early stages of production and travel through the factory together, ensuring optimum fitting of every part. This is one reason Kimber pistols have unequaled performance and dependability. Custom features like high ride beavertail grip safety, extended thumb safety and Commander-style hammer are part of every Kimber pistol.

Asking $150
Fun old bolt action .22.  Decent condition- I've got plenty of use out of it but occasionally when ejecting a spent casing the bolt will pull out of the receiver.  This is either due to a worn sear or the surface of the bolt where the sear would catch it is worn slightly.  This doesn't affect shooting the rifle- the bolt locks up safe with a round in the chamber.  From my experience it's just an occasional annoyance.  It doesn't happen often and when it does I just push the sear down, slide the bolt back in, and continue shooting.  
See my other listings for a (not working) H&R 623 and a (working) yugo m57- I would be interested in trade deal for a .22lr hand gun of some sort.

YES, the gun is compliant. A Norinco SKS has 14 evil Imported parts therefore four must be changed.A US made Tapco magazine counts as two parts (Mag body and follower), US made stock counts as one part, US made handguard counts as one part. That leaves 10 Imported parts which is compliant.This is a fairly rough but perfectly functional SKS. Missing bayonet, rear leaf sight replaced with an aperture sight, stock replaced with a ""combat exchange"" Monte Carlo stock. Magazine is a Tapco detachable 20 rounder (two included). As the second picture shows the rifle has some rust and old, light pitting on the bolt. Luckily the bore is chrome lined, mirror bright and pristine. It functions perfectly with cheap steel case ammo.I might be over exaggerating the negatives, but I'd rather have you surprised that it's not as bad as you thought than for you to be disappointed in its condition.This is a perfect gun to give a rattle can finish and throw behind the seat of a truck or for you preppers, gloop it up with cosmoline and bury it as a bug out stash gun.$330 cash, firm. you pay transfer at your preferred FFL in Snohomish/Skagit counties.

he 9x18 mm Makarov Sa vz. 61 Pistol is the semi-automatic version of the original 7.65mm Browning caliber Sa vz. 61 submachine gun.
The original Sa vz. 61 submachine gun (machine pistol) was designed in the late 1950´s in Czechoslovakia and was intended for use with reconnaissance units, tank crews, Special Forces, and for security forces of the Ministry of Interior. The vz. 61 was developed to fulfill a specific need: a firearm that could be worn like a pistol (in a holster) and capable of full automatic fire.  
9x18 mm Makarov vz. 61 Pistols utilize polycarbonate for the magazine body - specifically TARFLON IR2500.  This is an extremely tough material that is impact and wear resistant.   It is the same material used in 5.56x45 mm vz. 58 magazines.   Two magazines are included with the pistol - both the 2nd generation waffle type pattern (as shown in the photos).
HREADED BARREL INFORMATION:
The threaded barrel is 1/2x28 and includes the thread protector. CzechPoint worked with Czech Small Arms to develop a threaded barrel that does not utilize a thread adapter. This was accomplished by enlarging the outside diameter (O.D.) of the barrel which requires enlarging the trunnion hole diameter that accepts the barrel. The barrel O.D. was enlarged to the fullest extent, but ultimately the O.D. is limited due to the size of the trunnion. The outside diameter of the barrel measures .550 inches so there is a shoulder for indexing a sound suppressor. Czech Small Arms used the thread guide from Advanced Armament Corp. to design this threaded barrel."

The .380 Auto Sa vz. 61 Pistol is the semi-automatic version of the original 7.65mm Browning caliber Sa vz. 61 submachine gun.  This model possesses a Picatinny rail under the barrel for mounting a flash light or laser.
The original Sa vz. 61 submachine gun (machine pistol) was designed in the late 1950´s in Czechoslovakia and was intended for use with reconnaissance units, tank crews, Special Forces, and for security forces of the Ministry of Interior. The vz. 61 was developed to fulfill a specific need: a firearm that could be worn like a pistol (in a holster) and capable of full automatic fire.  
.380 Auto vz. 61 Pistols utilize polycarbonate for the magazine body - specifically TARFLON IR2500.  This is an extremely tough material that is impact and wear resistant.   It is the same material used in 5.56x45 mm vz. 58 magazines.   Two magazines are included with the pistol - both the 2nd generation waffle type pattern (as shown in the photos).
The design of the Sa vz. 61 submachine gun was unique in its time. It uses the following common operational features found on a submachine gun: an unlocked bolt, magazine inserted into the bottom of the receiver (outside of the pistol grip) and a folding stock. These common features are combined with the following characteristics not usually found in submachine guns: extraordinary small size, fires from a closed bolt, and uses a rate reducer to slow full automatic fire."
731,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7782731,For Trade:  Very rare Osgood Gun Works Duplex revolver,"Marion, Cedar Rapids, Iowa",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, January 8, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is for a very rare revolver, the Osgood Gun Works Duplex which was made around 1880 and there were only about 300 manufactured. It is a nickel-plated revolver with black hard rubber grips, it has a 22/32 caliber cylinder/barrels. It holds eight 22 and is a single shot 32. Right now I am putting it out there to see what I can get for it. Please do not be afraid to make me an offer of anything for trade or a cash offer. I could be interested in anything but my weakness is revolvers.  The following is the information I could find on it:
Object Description:
OSGOOD WORKS REVOLVER DUPLEX .22/.32Manufactured by Osgood Gun Works, Norwich, Ct. - Osgood Works hinged-frame revolver with fluted cylinder. Based on a cross between Smith & Wesson and a LeMat. Two barrel .22 over a .32. Cylinder has eight .22 caliber chambers around the circumference and a .32 rf in the center which doubles as the cylinder axis pin. The .32 fires out of the lower barrel. Checkered hard rubber grips. Weapon weighs approximately 8.1 oz.Markings:Barrel: PAT'D DEC. 7, 1880. (Left): OSGOOD GUN WORKS, NORWICH, CONN. Top strap: DUPLEX.Notes: About 300 of these manufactured in 1880s.""Osgood Gun Works - Norwich, Ct. Makers of 'Duplex' and 'Monarch' rimfire revolvers, 1880-83.""The Osgood Gun Works of Norwich, Connecticut, was formed in 1880 for the sole purpose of making this revolver; the partnership between financial backer Osgood and patentee Freeman W. Hood failed in 1882 as a result of poor sales. The Duplex revolver was a modernized version of the better known Le Mat of the Civil War period, which had carried a shotgun charge in a separate central barrel forming the cylinder axis pin. Eight-shot single action hinged frame .22 Short rimfire Duplex guns have an additional .32 calibre barrel - forming the cylinder arbor - which extends back through the frame to chamber a single .32 Short rimfire cartridge. The hammer had a moveable firing pin; set in the upper position it fired the .22 cartridges in the cylinder chambers in the usual manner. When switched to the lower position it fired the .32 cartridge in the lower barrel. The lack of any form of automatic extraction was a drawback. A strap hinged to the barrel in front of the cylinder, which snapped over the standing breech, was a poor frame-latch; it was probably defective enough when new - but soon developed a dangerous amount of play.Duplex revolvers are scarce and unusual. They are generally marked DUPLEX PAT DEC 7 1880; they may also display OSGOOD GUN WORKS."

The Sa vz. 61 was designed for reconnaissance units, tank crews, Special Forces, and for security forces of the Ministry of Interior. The Sa vz. 61 was developed to fulfill a specific need: a firearm that could be worn like a pistol (in a holster) and capable of full automatic fire.The design of the Sa vz. 61 was unique in its time. It uses the following common operational features found on a submachine gun: an unlocked bolt, magazine inserted into the bottom of the receiver (outside of the pistol grip) and a folding stock. These common features are combined with the following characteristics not usually found in submachine guns: extraordinary small size, fires from a closed bolt, and uses a rate reducer to slow full automatic fire.The Sa vz. 61 offered by CzechPoint is the semi-automatic version of the original military issued firearm - it is as close as one can get to owning the legendary vz. 61 submachine gun. Except for removal of the full-auto parts and rate reducer, and three modified parts with new safety, this firearm is like those used by Military and Paramilitary units in nearly 20 countries around the world. As shown in the photo, the Sa vz. 61 finish is comprised of a blued lower receiver with a black paint upper receiver (paint cured at 300 degrees fahrenheit)."
