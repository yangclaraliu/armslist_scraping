It is in Amazing condition, with a deep blue that helped make early Colt Pythons legendary. This revolver spent the vast majority of its life in a dresser drawer. I see no handeling marks or loss of blue. The only thing I see barely worth mentioning is a slight mark on the bottom of the wooden grip that is not through the clear. This revolver locks up tight and the trigger pull and timing are superlative. I can see little to no signs of use. Hardley a ghost of a turn line.  You do not see these vintage Colts in this shape everyday. I have included pics, but due to the shiny bluing, it is hard to photograph. The last pic of the barrel roll mark appears to be chrome, but that is because the light reflecting off the brilliant bluing makes this revolver glow. I have additional pics. *****I've had a few people ask if it is a hollow lug barrel. It is. This makes it a premium example for collectors.No box. I am looking for $2,750. oboI will accept partial trades for other firearms. I like Smith and Wesson revolvers, from the 70's and newer. I like most hand guns and some rifles, so don't be afraid to ask. I would prefer a face to face transaction, but if you're viewing this from a state other than Ohio, I may consider shipping, but payment must be through US postal Money Order and we can discuss shipping cost."

SIG Press Release:
The SIG716™ Tactical Rifles What You’ve Been Waiting For – Have Now Arrived EXETER, NH (January 2010) –
SIG SAUER®, the leading manufacturer of military, law enforcement, government, and commercial firearms will change your expectations of what an AR-10 type rifle should be. SIG SAUER presents the long awaited SIG716 Tactical Rifle line for Law Enforcement professionals and civilians. Chambered in 7.62 X 51 mm (.308 Winchester), the SIG716 Tactical Rifle line is built with the tightest tolerances, making these rifles some of the most accurate and durable AR-10 type models on the market today.
The SIG716 rifles are gas-piston operated with a 3 round-position (4-position optional) gas valve – a design that keeps the receiver free of firing residue for optimum reliability under adverse conditions and extended firing. The SIG716 select-fire modes include single-shot, 3-burst, and fully automatic (Law Enforcement only). The fire control/safety selector is an ambidextrous design for easy accessibility and improved safety.
All models, including the SIG716 12.5” Tactical Patrol, the SIG716 16.0” Patrol, the SIG716 16” Precision Marksman and the SIG716 20.0” Precision Sniper, come standard with a free-floating, aluminum-alloy, quadrail forend with four M1913 Picatinny rails for lighting and laser-mounted options. Barrels are chrome-lined for extreme durability and corrosion resistance. The 16” Precision Marksman and 20” Precision Sniper models feature heavy match barrels.
The muzzle is threaded with a standard (0.625x24TPI) pattern to accommodate a wide variety of flash suppressors, muzzle brakes and sound suppressor devices. The lower receiver is machined from a 7075-T6 Aircraft grade aluminum forging. The upper receiver, machined from 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum, provides an integral M1913 Picatinny rail to accommodate a wide range of optical sight solutions. The upper and lower receivers feature a black, hard coat anodize finish."

See Photos.I bought it new in 2014 and took it to the range a couple of times and have shot maybe 75 rounds through it. I used a mix of brands of rounds and a mixture of .308 and 7.62 and, in admittedly brief use, it has never failed to load, fire, eject. I like the idea of a kick-ass 308 semi-auto battle rifle but the bottom line is it is taking up room and I just don't shoot it. I have my eye on a bolt gun and I need to make room in the safe and the bank account so here it is.I prefer to sell it in Florida. I prefer face-to-face transfer to a Florida Resident with a CCW card and will want a signed bill of sale. I will happily drive up to 200 miles to meet any Florida Resident half way for the transfer. Or if you are out of state I will do the postage and FFL thing for actual charges (at your expense.)"

I installed a guide rod Laser Max. It has been my carry gun and has less than 50 rounds fired. Like all carry guns there is slight wear on the slide but other than that is perfect. I like the guide rod laser due to the fact it is internal  and does not effect carry size and is deadly accurate. It is a good deal, i paid over 300 dollars for the laser."

I'm using them full length in the Chip McCormick 8 Round Shooting Star 1911 45 ACP Magazines with no loss of capacity (what I bought them for). These springs feature 11 coils of aerospace grade Rocket Wire Spring. This is an incredibly reliable feeding, nice extra power 45 ACP spring for +P, 45 Super with the increased slide velocity, and standard 45 ACP loads. I tried Fobus Immortal springs and others and these are the only ones I found that work with the Chip McCormick design follower. I am also using these in my other 45 ACP mags, some minus a coil. I got a decent buy on a bunch of them and am passing along the savings. Compare at $10 elsewhere. Local pickup or I will ship anywhere in the CONUS. $3 each, 5 for $12.50, 10 for $20. These may fit other magazines as well, look at the ends and compare to yours. You could possibly cut off coils for shorter magazines? Email or text me at REDACTED"
