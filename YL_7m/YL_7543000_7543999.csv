R. Sales Co., National Ordnance, Inc. and Federal Ordnance, Inc.A. R. Sales Co. was established in 1968 and owned by Ilia I. Karnes. Jack Karnes, his wife Ilia, and their two children ran the company. Mr. Karnes was a tool and die maker by trade. When the family business started, its first large contract was to make M16 scope mounts. The two letters, A.R., were taken from the first two alphanumeric characters of the commercial name for the M16 rifle. Next, A. R. Sales produced high-end lightweight alloy M1911 style pistol frames and accessories.It appears that A. R. Sales started on the semi-automatic M14 type rifle project by October 1971. An advertisement for its Mark IV rifle appeared in the October 15, 1971, issue of Shotgun News. The response from the civilian market was overwhelming. This included 2000 or more mail-in orders with the $15.00 deposit for a stripped Mark IV receiver.A. R. Sales received its initial batch of Mark IV receiver castings by no later than March 07, 1972. This first set of receivers were used by Jack Karnes to set up fixtures and tooling for the machine tools. There were two Mark IV receiver production lots for the company. The first occurred in the winter of 1973. The first Mark IV rifles and stripped receivers were delivered to customers in January 1973. Mark IV serial number 0143 had been delivered to the buyer on March 02, 1973. The first production lot of Mark IV receivers was cast at Rimer Casting Company (Waterville, OH) using Karl Maunz’s receiver master die according to two sources and Prico (Los Angeles, CA) according to a third source, all highly reputable. The first production lot of Mark IV receivers was machined by A. R. Sales. The first lot of receiver serial numbers ended somewhere between 0001 and 0225 with 200 receivers produced.The second receiver production lot was made in 1976. The receiver serial numbers for the second lot were started at a number below 0226 and ended at number 0250. The second production batch of Mark IV receivers was cast at Gray-Syracuse, Inc. and machined by Valley Ordnance Co. About twenty-five receivers were produced in the second batch.Twenty-five serial numbers were skipped between the first lot and the second lot. The missing serial numbers were allotted for tool room samples and for intended-but-never-realized forged receivers. Both production lots of Mark IV receivers were heat treated by a local company in southern California.A. R. Sales Co. at first bought M14 parts brand new directly from USGI contractors. Mark IV rifles were assembled with new and used USGI M14 parts and USGI M14 wood stocks. Any used M14 parts that were broken or worn were compared to the USGI drawings and rejected in the build procedure. The stock selector cutout was filled in for each assembled Mark IV rifle. According to the October 1971 A. R. Sales Co. specification sheet for the Mark IV rifle, “While most of our rifles will be built with N.M. barrels, we do not glass bed the actions, nor do we produce match grade weapons. We feel that this is best left to those who specialize in accurizing and building match grade weapons, and we do not wish to infringe in their domain.”"

High gloss finish montecarlo walnut stock, high gloss blue, Pachmayer white line recoil pad. This rifle is in excellent overall condition! The stock is in near new condition with nice sharp checkering, and the gloss blueing is perfect with little to no loss except the typical exposure at the muzzle crown, there is absolutely no rust, or pitting anywhere! The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp. After mounting the scope I sighted in with 5 rounds and the rifle printed the last three shots in a 0.78"" group with factory ammo! This rifle has an adjustable flip up rear sight and a hooded front sight, so if you don't like the scope, you can remove it. The only signs of wear I can see are on the jeweled bolt from openning and closing the action. The factory trigger is excellent with a nice crisp break that rivals many aftermarket triggers! This rifle would make a great addition to anyone's collection"

I was very impressed by Jake; while he obviously knows his stuff, he didn’t flaunt it. He professionally and dynamically presented the material. The class covers some very dry material, but, Jake kept the class lively and interactive. Jake is able to use real life examples to ensure the material make sense to all, from the layman to the expert. I highly recommend Foremost Defensive Solutions for this course; and I look forward, myself, to further training with Jake.”Alan F.

The breadth of information was great and I learned a considerable amount where I had thought I already knew enough. His teaching style was engaging as he incorporated slides, videos, personal experience and participation to help us to understand the responsibility we have to ourselves, our families and society as a whole. His own experience as an officer was tremendous. Above all, I left impressed that owning and carrying a weapon is not only a right, but requires the utmost responsibility and judgement on our part. I very much enjoyed the class and look forward to another opportunity to learn from Jake. I highly recommend the training he provides.Thank you again for the class.”Ben S.

I was very impressed by Jake; while he obviously knows his stuff, he didn’t flaunt it. He professionally and dynamically presented the material. The class covers some very dry material, but, Jake kept the class lively and interactive. Jake is able to use real life examples to ensure the material make sense to all, from the layman to the expert. I highly recommend Foremost Defensive Solutions for this course; and I look forward, myself, to further training with Jake.”Alan F. (Full last name omitted by Foremost Defensive Solutions, LLC for this persons protection of privacy) “Professionally presented! Meticulously prepared! AND…even entertaining! Jake was thoroughly prepared to teach critically important information. I appreciated that he stressed safety, practicality, and common sense all while conveying the legally required information. I can’t imagine this material being presented in a more thorough and convincing way. Thank you…..”Mark W.

Not all classes are equal and this one is superior. The class is great for beginners as well as experienced gun handlers; with something to learn for everyone. Jake kept the class entertaining, covering many subjects while still getting across the serious message of gun safety, necessity to know the laws, and teach your children what to do if they encounter a firearm.”Lori B.

The breadth of information was great and I learned a considerable amount where I had thought I already knew enough. His teaching style was engaging as he incorporated slides, videos, personal experience and participation to help us to understand the responsibility we have to ourselves, our families and society as a whole. His own experience as an officer was tremendous. Above all, I left impressed that owning and carrying a weapon is not only a right, but requires the utmost responsibility and judgement on our part. I very much enjoyed the class and look forward to another opportunity to learn from Jake. I highly recommend the training he provides.Thank you again for the class.”Ben S.

It comes with the hard case, about 7 arrows, the hoytt balancer, and the bow sights. I have over 1500 invested in this. The ZT 30 is perfect for those spot and stalk situations where stability and forgiveness can make or break the hunt.Shooting 332 feet per second with a brace height of 6.75 inches, the Carbon Spyder ZT 30 is smooth as silk, incredibly quiet and most importantly, extremely accurate.Featuring the patent-pending Zero Torque Cable Guard System and Hoyt's latest technologies, the Carbon Spyder ZT 30 gives you the upper hand on any hunt or shot situation.Unlike all other cable guard systems that create additional torque in the bow, Hoyt's revolutionary, ZT Cable Guard has a flexible arm that is reverse mounted to direct the cable induced torque in the opposite direction, eliminating the side load torque that the cables apply to the riser as the bow is drawn.The ZT 30 has adjustable AirShox arms to provide optimal damper location.On top of this, the Spyder ZT 30 is one of Hoyt's fast bows, creating a hard hitting, yet strongest, lightest, quietest carbon riser and lightning fast bow to give you that speed advantage.And it doesn't stop there as the Carbon Spyder ZT 30 has a 75% let-off to help this speed cam maintain a generous valley.As well, it is modular adjustable for easy draw length changes with multiple draw lengths available from 24""-30"". Scroll down to see bow specs.The most versatile and advanced bow for hardcore bowhunters.Nothing else is even in the same league. Hoyt's industry leading carbon bows continue to be in a class all their own. Nothing else compares to the high performance, hollow carbon tube design of Hoyt's carbon series bows, because there is nothing else in the world like them.They continue to be a flagship product not only for Hoyt, but for the entire archery industry.Hoyt are bringing more industry leading advancement and innovation to their carbon series with their new Zero Torque Cable Guard System equipped on their new Carbon Spyder ZT series bows. Nothing else compares.For those that are up before their 4 am alarm. Far and away one of the more advanced and hardcore bow in the industry, Hoyt's fast carbon bow, the all new Hoyt Carbon Spyder ZT 30.Smooth, blistering speed in a lightweight package."

It is in great shape, the blueing is still in great condition. There are absolutely no problems with the firearm. It does not come with the original case or grips. It does come with a single original Manurhin magazine. The magazine base's plastic is slightly cracked but in no way hinders performance.I am selling/trading only because I'm not a huge fan of the de-cocker mechanism on firearms. The slide can be racked, engaging a new round from the magazine, and then is able to be fired single action. Engaging the safety puts the firearm back in to a double action pull.I recognize that I have listed the Manufacturer as ""Walther"", but it was in fact manufactured by Manurhin in France sometime in the 70s or 80s. Manurhin has no way to look up serial numbers for a specific date. I've listed as ""Walther"" so people looking for a PPK/S or something similar still see this post."

I bought her 2 more when she picked this up and the Cerakote was done professionally.  Round count is at 50, my wife is the original owner. I installed an NDZ extended take down lever, Vickers slide stop, and Vickers mag release. I actually really like the 42 but my wife surprisingly enough wants a G19, she likes the fuller feel and feels more confident shooting it vs. a ""pocket pistol"" since she is still a new shooter. And as we know, we'd rather have the wives carrying and shooting something that makes them want to practice, and I know she won't with her 42.  Comes with matching Kydex holster, Genotac Mod OWB, outer Kydex is done in same Tiffany Blue as the frame.  Would make a great Christmas present to your wife or significant other!
