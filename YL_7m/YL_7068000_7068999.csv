Like all Cobalt rifles, we build the SCOUT to a demanding standard. We have selected the internals and operating components to be both economical and robust; making cobalt ownership easy and rewarding for the practical shooter. The SCOUT Limited edition is furnished in a subtle battleship gray cerakote and comes equipped with the EDGE muzzle brake. We only made 50 of these rifles. Construction The EDGE-SCOUT exploits all of Cobalt’s disruptive design influence. Our billet rifle stock adds balance, and stability, while improving handling characteristics of the rifle. And beyond the aggressive design, we build the handguard to be utilitarian and M-lok compatible. We machine our upper and lower receivers from billets of 7075 aluminum, then mate and serialized them together to ensure product integrity. Controls Cobalt’s patented DUAL DROP adds new functionality to the AR-15 platform. The system allows the shooter to trip the bolt release with a thumb after a mag change; allowing the weapon to remain up and on target. The magazine release, selector lever, and charge handle on the SCOUT are all conventional single-side controls. The trigger is a classic AR-15 pattern mil-spec unit. Operating System We use a top quality, LiFe coated, full profile M-16 bolt group for long-service life and guaranteed operation under hard use. The SCOUT features a fixed gas block to ensure full power gas delivery to the bolt group, to ensure trouble-free operation in adverse conditions. Barrel We made the barrel from 4150 chrome-moly steel and treated it in QPQ nitride to make it strong and long-lasting. The contour matches the standard government pattern; designed to be accurate and balanced. And to maintain peak performance, the barrels are chambered in 5.56 NATO with a  1-8″ twist rate.Photos courtesy of Cobalt KineticsItem ID: 210000001580"

Compact, accurate and completely trustworthy, the REC7 is designed specifically for situations in which there’s no room for error. Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life.
This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine.
The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance.
The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.
The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance.
At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance.
The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 Class 2 hardcoat anodized and Cerakote finished. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension."

Derby and James D. Brown, the firing pin is inherently weak and is prone to breakage because of a recess cut provided for the crossbolt and is prone to breaking at this point.[1] The sturdier hammer firing mechanism was developed and included in the Type 94 to replace the poor striker on the Type 14 Nambu.[6] The locking system is a rising-block type which floats independently between the lugs underneath the chamber end of the barrel.[7] The single coil mainspring is positioned around the barrel instead of to the rear of the barrel as found on other Nambu pistols.[7] The grip is smaller than other Japanese pistols and is finished with smooth wood[8] but according to author Jeff Kinard, are more comfortable for use by men with smaller hands.[9] The magazine holds a maximum of six rounds because of the smaller grip[6] and it is considered difficult to reload the weapon, with pressure from the bolt holding it inside the pistol.[1] The magazine catch protrudes far enough to occasionally disengage when the pistol is placed on its left side on a hard surface.[1] The magazine could also disengage if squeezed into or jarred in a holster.[1] The manual safety lever is located on the left rear of the frame and has the kanji for fire and safe stamped onto the frame.[1] The front blade sight on the muzzle of the Type 94 pistol and the rear fixed V were occasionally inaccurately positioned making them useless when the weapon is being aimed.[4] The rear sight was reduced from a U-shape to a simple notch in 1944 with the front blade being left unchanged but less attention to detail being applied as World War II progressed.[10]"
