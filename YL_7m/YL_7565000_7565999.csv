This pistol is from my Personal Collection. I acquired it several years before I became a dealer. I doubt that it was ever shot prior to my acquiring it. Since I've owned it probably put a hundred rounds through. It always works. No matter what ammo I use, it never has a misfeed. Like all Ravens, this is strictly for up-close-and-personal work. No 3-inch groupings with this model firearm. That's just the nature of the beast. For years I've used it for shirt pocket carry. Just took a pristine Guardian 32 ACP pistol in trade that is going to be assuming that role. Now, if you have about $450, you too probably should opt for a guardian, but if you don't have that much cash to spend for an occasional carry pistol, then this raven would be a great option. I know I have the original box and possibly some paperwork to go along with the gun. I think the box is a little crushed, but still decent shape."

It has a brown and green laminate stock, blued action and stainless medium heavy barrel. It comes with Leupold standard bases and rings and also an extra Winchester factory black synthetic stock. The original owner put it in the synthetic stock so as not to scar up the factor stock. He says it has had less than 20 rounds fired and it looks quite likely to be the case though I have no way of verifying that. I am asking $500 for the rifle and both stocks. The spare stock alone sells for around $100 and is also excellent condition.  I will have some better pictures later."

I sighted it in at 100 yards and it was very accurate at this distance and the barrel hasnt even been broken in yet.. It is in very good condition and I bought it new. It has an internal box magazine and a threaded barrel. I can sell with or without the scope. The scope is a Vortex Crossfire II 3-9 x 40 with the balastic drop recticle(MSRP $169) . It is very clear and a great match for the rifle. I am asking $500 with the scope and $400 without. Bipod is not included. I can be contacted via call or text 417-241-(nine one two five)Thank you

It is Colt #10000 on the nose.One the right side of the frame there is a shallow electro-pencil series of numbers. It is noticeable - but not overly so. This revolver has been in my family for a very long time and belonged to my grandfather, who was a German bootlegger from Carroll, Iowa during the 1920's and '30's. There is a book in which he features prominently, about Templeton, Iowa and the rye whisky they produced there.I have two original boxes of 32 Long Colt - Peter's - that I would sell and ship separately (see my other listing). 32 Long Colt is a very rare cartridge, indeed.I have fired this revolver. It locks up well and shoots straight. If you need more photos, please ask. I believe this weapon was produced later than 1898 (1901-2, I believe) but should be eligble for C&R status."

It is the gas operated version of the A-500, and the precursor to the Gold/Silver gas action.It eats everything 2.75"" to 3"" and is a joy to shoot. With its steel receiver and 28"" barrel, it is a soft shooter, that would be well suited on the skeet/trap/sporting clay field. It swings nicely.Again, it is a very reliable gun, and never had a single issue with it. Pretty anal about cleaning and maintaining my guns anyways.Gun will come with one choke (takes invector choke) and is in excellent condition as can the pictures attest. Wood stock is magnificent, and the round pistol grip/knob stands out on the rack.Only reason I am selling is that I do not use it anymore and it is taking room in my cabinet cabinet."

I've recently upgraded to an M1, so I no longer have a need for it. The moron I got it from screwed up the fire control group by filing on it, probably the sear, so it will have to be replaced. He also painted it the colors it is now. Aside from the trigger group and the paint, everything else is fine, and it was zero'd to about 500m. The scope, which comes with it, is a 4-12x that seems to hold zero just fine. It's definitely cheap though. I was going to do a bunch of things with it, but I didn't know it was broken when I traded for it, and despite the cheap fix, have since abandoned the project. The rifle is compeltely DPMS aside from the Remington barrel and the bolt on stuff. The barrel length is 20"", and the hand guard is 15"". It will come with everything pictured, as well as 1 20rd Pmag and 2 30rd Pmags. It is chambered in .308, so it's capable of safely firing either .308 Winchester or x51 NATO. I'm currently entertaining offers, but don't be stupid please. It's a waste of your time and mine, because despite the trigger group and the lame scope, I still know what it's worth. Thanks for looking, and enjoy your day."
