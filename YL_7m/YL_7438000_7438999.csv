MSRP - $719, magazines - $50Black. Inquire with questions and for pictures. REDACTEDThe VP40 is the .40 S&W model of the acclaimed VP pistol line first introduced in 2014 with the VP9 (9 mm).In development for more than four years, the VP Series is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.Experience gained by HK engineers with the P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP, but the VP Series breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.Heckler & Koch pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs.The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.The VP trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.The VP40 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six grip side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.Although influenced by other HK models, the VP Series has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.A new feature found on VP pistols is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength.VP40 pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines; either 13-round or reduced, 10-round capacity magazines.VP Series pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces (160 grams).VP pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.The VP40’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.The VP40 is essentially the same dimensions as the 9 mm VP9 model. The overall height of the VP40 is one millimeter (.04 inch) taller. The VP40 also weighs 2.37 ounces (67 grams) more, 28.93 ounces for the VP40 versus 26.56 ounces for the VP9.VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the VP Series is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis.The VP40 has a suggested retail cost of $719. A law enforcement configuration VP40 with tritium night sights and three magazines is also available for $819.New for 2016 are Flat Dark Earth (FDE) models, VPs with special colorants added to the frame during the molding process creating the tan/brown color scheme increasing used by military and security units. The frame’s color is indestructible, permanent and completely resistant to fading or chemical change."

SPECIFICALLY THE UNIQUE DOWNWARD ANGLE OF ITS HANDLE IN RELATION TO ITS BLADE ALLOWED THE USER TO MAINTAIN A STRONG WRIST POSITION DURING USE AND INSURED MAXIMUM POWER TRANSFER TO THE BLADES EDGE. ALTHOUGH IT WAS DECEPTIVELY LIGHTWEIGHT FOR ITS SIZE, THE ROCK SALT CUT WITH THE AUTHORITYOF A MUCH HEAVIER KNIFE WHILE REDUCING FATIGUE AND INSURING SUPERIOR ACCURACY AND CONTROL.  THE ORIGINAL ROCK SALT WAS INTRODUCED IN 2008 AND WAS THE LARGEST KNIFE TO FEATURE H-1 STEEL- AN EXTRORDINARY NITROGEN BASED ALLOY THAT IS 100% RUST PROOF. IN 2011 IT WAS DISCONTINUED AND REPLACED BY THE SCHEMPP ROCK- A NEARLY IDENTICAL DESIGN RENDERED IN CONVENTIONAL VG-10 STAINLESS STEEL WITH A FULL-FLAT GRIND.  THIS LIMITED EDITION SPRINT RUN OF THE ROCK SALT FAITHFULLY CAPTURES THE SPIRIT AND DETAIL OF THE ORIGINAL, INCLUDING ITS BROAD HOLLOW GROUND H-1 BLADE, FULL TANG CONSTRUCTION, AND COMPLETE IMMUNITY TO RUST. ITS TEXTURED, FIBERGLASS- REINFORCED- NYLON(FRN) HANDLE SCALES ARE IDENTICALIN FORM TO THE BLACK SCALES OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION, BUT FEATUREA DISTINCTIVE HIGH VISIBILITY ORANGE COLOR.  THE ROCK SALT'S INJECTION MOLDED POLYMER SHEATH FEATURES A SYMETRICAL DESIGN THAT SUPPORTS AMBIDEXTROUS CARRY. SNAP FIT RETENTION LOCKS THE KNIFE SECURLY INTO THE SHEATH, WHILE A FIRM PULL OR THUMB PUSH OFF RELEASES IT SMOOTHLY WITHOUT THE NEED FOR STRAPS OR OTHER RETENTION DEVICES.

Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself. With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth. Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare"

And this time it’s a fierce one. We all know what happened in Las Vegas by now, but many do not know there has been legislative action brought forth in a bill by a REPUBLICAN named Carlos Curbelo. This bill goes beyond AR rifles or AK’s. This is going to involve everyone, even deer hunters. The bill that has been introduced does not just ban “bump-stocks” it will ultimately ban all semi-auto rifles and pistols. The bill is very loosely written and does not even mention the term “bump-stock”. It states it will ban “parts that is designed and functions to increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle”, which will mean triggers, disconnects etc.
            I am asking you to please be involved with this process because we cannot solely rely on president Trump or the NRA. Representatives need to hear the voice of WE THE PEOPLE. They work for us. Please call these representatives and leave them a voice mail (be courteous) and state “I am a registered voter and DO NOT approve of the Curbelo Bill. Thank You.” I have compiled the list of representatives that have backed this bill and their office phone numbers, I am aware that they are not here in Missouri, but they still need to know that lawful gun owners will not stand by and forfeit our second amendment rights. Even if you just call one, that’s better than doing nothing. So please, take 2 minutes out of your day and leave a message. Don’t count on others to do it.
