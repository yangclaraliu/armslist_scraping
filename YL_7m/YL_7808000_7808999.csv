It comes with a 16"" 416 stainless steel bead-blasted barrel; AAC 51T Blackout silencer adapter; Magpul front/rear BUIS; and a load of improvements that you can read about on the DPMS website.  I bought it in July 2017 and have taken it to the range three times firing about 200 rounds--the rifle is in perfect condition--no scratches .  I had a custom Cerakoted KE Arms 15"" slim 7 sided M-LOK rail system in battleship gray professionally installed (OE DPMS handguard is included); a gray Magpul K2+ pistol grip; and a gray Magpul SL stock.  There is a Magpul ladder rail panel on the top rail and black Magpul Type 1 rail covers on each side of the handguard.     Of course, it comes in the original DPMS box with the lock, manual, and a 20 round magazine.I have nearly $1,700 in this rifle, but I'm asking $1,100/OBRO.  NO trades please. I also have an almost new black Vortex 1-8 x 24 Strike Eagle scope with an illuminated AR-BDC2 reticle (model number SE-1824-1) (not pictured) and a Vortex cantilever mount with 2"" offset (not pictured) for $375.  It comes in the factory Vortex box.I'll need to see two forms of good guy VA ID and the buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale.  I will only sell this rifle to a person living in Virginia in good standing.  I live in Alexandria, but I'm willing to drive a reasonable distance to make the sale.  Thanks for looking!"
