The majority of the original finish is present, however this pistol was certainly issued to a Polish unit, and shows moderate wear from carry and use. The slide is import marked by CAI. The mechanics are functionally perfect. Out of the approximately 500 rounds I have fired through this pistol, I have experienced no malfunctions of any kind. Whether loaded with cheap russian steel or nickel plated Critical Defense, I have come to expect perfect reliably from this pistol. If you are unfamiliar with the P-83 pistol in general, I encourage you to do some google searches. There is an excellent article in American Rifleman which covers these pistols, as well as numerous YouTube videos. Although very similar to the Makarov PM pistol, the P-83 offers distinct advantages including an updated magazine release, a vastly superior DA trigger, notably reduced percieved recoil, and the ability to cycle the action while on safe.Asking price is $250 to include one magazine, or $270 to include two magazines. Unfortunately this item is not a Curio an Relic, and therefor will require a dealer transfer and background check. If the buyer is easy to coordinate with and can meet me reasonably near to Lafayette, I will split the cost of the transfer with you."

Part of the 2016 Urban Grey Suppressor-Ready Series, this pistol is clad in urban grey (a mix of grey and FDE). With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options.
A further evolution of our offerings with the Omega trigger system, the new P-01 Ω Convertible allows users to swap from decocker to safety operation in the same manner as the popular P-07/P-09 pistols. Using the same simplified, more robust variation of the 75’s trigger system as the previous Omega, trigger parts use an interlocking design that allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools. Not only does this simplify maintenance, the trigger parts themselves are made of different materials to enhance durability, operation life and reliability.
The CZ P-01 is a compact, aluminum-framed 9mm designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame make it ideal for discrete carry as well.
With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use.
After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.
Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN."

The best gun I’ve ever had. It’s a smart version of venerable CZ-75, the size of Glock-19 (my G22 is similar to full size BE). 150 flawless rounds through it. The slide features a matte black oxide finish, Novak-style three-dot sights and decocker /safety lever with a teardrop shape for ease of use. This allows the operator to safely lower the Commander-style hammer from the single-action to the double-action position while also engaging the hammer-block safety mechanism. Fieldstripping is simple: align the two dimples at the rear of the slide and frame and take the lever out – done. The recoil of this metal frame is practically non-existent. The trigger pull in SA is light and pleasant 3.5-4.5 lb, but 12 lb. in DA to prevent accidental shooting. There is a small ding on the top of the slide from previously installed RMR (see photo). Comes with five 10-round mags, box and everything from the factory (see pictures)."

The scope is not included. This Carbine Directly descended from the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements for the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program, the SPR is built for high performance.  The SPR variant is one of our most popular models.  Constructed using the highest quality materials, built on our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCI™ raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance- delivering the highest level of performance. The gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws. The SPR with one-piece Monoforge™ upper design includes an integrated rail-base that is stronger and lighter.  The investment castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset.  The SPR uses manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged spiral fluted barrel that are 20% lighter than unfluted barrels of the same diameter.  The increased surface area reduces heat – speeds up cooling.  Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity.  You must be legal to own a firearm, be a Texas resident with a valid Texas Driver’s License photo. A CHL is even better. I can ship out of state to a FFL only, but can also ship within Texas. Will not do business with buyers outside USA, and local delivery only to the actual buyer with ID and cash on hand. No phantom courier pickup. Call or Text Chuck 214 seven04 95 84 Carrollton, TX"

This rifle has a Smith Enterprises Vortex flash hider mounted on the barrel.
