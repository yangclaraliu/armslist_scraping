The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match.  It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Although it’s easy to make and replace. There was a repair to a small crack by the lock at some point before I owned it. Although it’s VERY solid and was never an issue. It’s 160-170 years old. I Wanted to leave in orginal state. This gun was HAND made. All the screws, pins, locks, hammer, barrel, and stock. Nipple is original and wide open to the breach. All screws are original and locktite down. It was originally made as a target bench rifle with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes and mount holder on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very very accurate rifle, Bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1850-1860.. The lock is marked R & W.C. Biddle & Co. Philadelphia. This firm was a hardware store and was noted for importing or making hardware, gun locks, and barrels. Barrel is marked with T + F, in German script, believed to be Thomas Fenner, he was a gun maker from Philidephia Penn. 1829-1860 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel (under the rear sight). Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. Make me a reasonable offer its Hard to price history - Im not wanting to break the bank just a fair trade and hoping to send to a good home. I am open to trades for other firearms. I am looking for a Glock 19 gen 4/5, Browning Hi-power, or a decent 1911. email or text 918-4o2-o854"

These include a bayonet, a period-correct leather and canvas sling, an oil/solvent bottle, ammunition pouches and a canvas tool bag with all the tools. Face to face cash sale to MN resident.

It's basically a cross between a roller locked MP5 and the newer UMP 9 (ie MP5 style roller delayed action and a polymer receiver designed to replicate the UMP). It's set up with a UMP style folding stock (made by SW, which are bit hard to come by). It has a full auto MP5 bolt carrier and comes with 1 German MP5SD straight mag. I can sell some additional Korean MP5 curved mags with it (new in box), if the buyer is interested. The barrel was cut and re-threaded 1x2x28 by ZR Tactical, who then added the faux suppressor and pinned and welded it. They also removed the ""tumor"" (the built in flashlight bump) and replaced it with a rail for a foregrip.This is as close to a UMP 9 without dropping $4k on an HK USC to UMP conversion or $2400 for one of the new Omega Gideon pistols. The gun is ready to go as is and would be a perfect candidate for an SBR (file your Form 1 and then when you get your tax stamp, you can cut the weld on the faux suppressor and have a ready to go SBR with a threaded barrel).Asking $1300"

This gun is in perfect condition the gun feels great in the hand and I do have to say the trigger pull is much much better than glocks, it has a very short reset and is nice and crisp. I do have the box, test target, two mags , the cleaning rods, paperwork etc.... like I said the gun feels great, shoots great, and is accurate. The cz p10 c does fit in all glock 19 holsters just a FYI These guns are very hard to find in stock right now. I will take 600 cash or will consider trading for a glock 19 with upgrades I do have my Missouri ccw license im located in Columbia mo but will drive a reasonable ways to meet up.

More than just another deer cartridge, the venerable .30-30 has been the king of deer calibers since the first rifle chambered in this ageless round was produced in 1894. In fact, it’s a safe bet that in the past century, no other round has put more antlers on the wall and venison in the freezer than the .30-30. So it only made sense that Henry, America’s most storied rifle maker, would produce a rifle chambered for this legendary caliber. This latest addition to our world-famous line of lever-action repeaters was built with the traditional deer hunter in mind. Like its predecessors, it’s both lightweight (just 7 to 8.3lbs.) and maneuverable (39″ long), – the perfect combination for hunting in dense timber and heavy brush.
Like every Henry rifle, it’s 100% American made, with its select American walnut stock and forearm, it is a masterpiece of finely crafted gunsmithing. The H009B has a visually impressive 20″ octagon barrel and a handsome brass receiver and brass barrel band. Both rifles are drilled and tapped for easy scope mounting. The magazine holds five rounds that chamber quickly and smoothly thanks to our crisp, perfectly machined action.
If you’re a deer hunter who wants to carry a rifle like dad and grandpa did back in the “good ol’ days,” treat yourself to a Henry .30-30 and relive the golden era of deer hunting while starting a few traditions of your own.NIB"

While it was being upgraded I also had them replace the sights with CZ factory Meprolight tritium night sights. The plastic grips have also been replaced with the CZ factory rubber grips (installed) and I am also including the CZ half-checkered cocobolo grips I purchased. The gun comes with everything it originally came with, i.e. the case, manual, cleaning tools, two factory 14-round magazines (to which I added CZ rubber base plates) as well as six extra Mec-Gar 14-round magazines also equipped with the rubber base plates. All the original parts are also included.The price is $1,150, but if you’re familiar with CZ and “Cajun Gun Works” then you’ll recognize that with everything you’re getting this is a very fair price (with all the work done and the accessories, this is worth $1,326 and if you add the shipping costs+FFL fee the whole package is worth approx. $1,450)."

It has a Beautiful wood stock and nearly perfect bluing, with a nicely jeweled bolt.You would be very hard pressed to find one of these in this condition today.Break it down, clean it thoroughly, and put it back in the box for a super Christmas gift for your favorite hunter/sports shooter!  They will be proud to carry this to the range!Asking $678 obro.Description from Gunsreview dot com:The exquisite AL390 Gold Mallard features a receiver enhanced with a new engraving presentation of jumping mallards, snipe and ""P. Beretta"" signature. The bolt and magazine carrier are jeweled, while the trigger is gold plated. Fine line cut checkering highlights the highly figured walnut stock and fore-end.The Beretta AL390 is much more than a semi-automatic that does everything well.It's the only semi-automatic that does everything as well as a Beretta.So it's the only semi-automatic you can use with absolute confidence, regardless of game, target or season.The most user-friendly semi-auto a hunter can own. The AL390 is nearly one-half pound lighter than the A390, so pointability and ease of swing are enhanced. Yet the new, lighter AL390 has less felt recoil than before and retains its perfect Beretta balance. The AL390 achieves its weight reduction with refinements to the stock, a narrower fore-end, lighter fore-end cap and subtle changes to other components. You'll find new checkering patterns, a reshaped pistol grip for improved handling and a new comb for better fit. The flawless ""all-load"" performance that has made the A390 a hunter's favorite remains the same in the new AL390. Use the Beretta AL390 for everything from upland birds to waterfoul, to turkey or deer. Absolutely no adjustments of any kind are required to accommodate different loads. A convenient magazine cut-off allows the shooter to empty the chamber for safe handling, or to slip in a different load without cycling any shells remaining in the magazine.You'll get years of trouble-free service. The extensive use of high-strength stainless steel and aluminum alloys makes the AL390 almost impervious to stress and corrosion. The solid receiver is precision machined from lightweight alloy that is as strong as steel. All operating parts are made of high-performance steels and aluminum alloys and are carefully hand assembled, checked, and cycled hundreds of times before they leave the factory to ensure trouble-free performance. Beretta's unique self-compensating AL390 Gold Mallard-Whitegas system substantially reduces stress on the gun's operating parts when heavy loads are fired. In exhaustive tests, the system has performed with perfection, round after round, over the entire range of factory loaded shells, from one ounce target loads to the heaviest 3 inch magnums. Because of its simple design, the AL390 is remarkably easy to disassemble for cleaning and maintenance.Beretta's AL390 Stock Drop & Cast Spacer System-because one size gun does not fit all. We designed the AL390 to bring the fit of a custom stock within everyone's reach by utilizing an ingenious, easily adjusted system of drop and cast spaces for quick adjustment of both the vertical and horizontal angle of the stock to fit each shooter's size and shape. Spacers are provided with every AL390.Both cast and drop spacers are marked with metric dimensions followed by DX or SX. DX numbers refer to right hand/cast-off and SX numbers refer to left-hand/cast-on. By rotating the spacers so the numbers (e.g. 50 or 65) correspond, the stock can be raised or lowered and adjusted for cast-on/cast-off."
