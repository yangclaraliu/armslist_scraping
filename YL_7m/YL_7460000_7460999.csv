All other pocket holsters do, is hold the gun inside your pocket.The KRAMER Pocket Holster does all the things you expect a good pocket holster to do. It ensures the gun will stay in the same place inside your pocket, stops the front sight from wearing a hole in your pocket, prevents the flutes on a revolver's cylinder from cutting painfully into your body, ensures the gun will not be wrapped in a wad of pocket material when you go to grab it to defend your life. AND it also disquises the shape of the gun as seen through the pocket.The body out side of the holster is covered with a piece of plastic laminate that breaks up the outline of the gun, so the tell-tale bulge inside your pocket looks like a wallet. The side of the holster pressing against your body is smooth, comfortable, precisely molded horsehide.Cost $99 New, save here on this barely used holster for $70call or txt REDACTED"

More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. P229 Legion also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc., P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most.This is a used gun with roughly 500 rounds through it. It has minor surface wear from holstering and functions flawlessly.

One of the brightest flashlights of its size, the lightweight and compact EC23 can be easily stored in pockets, packs or bags for quick access to light anywhere you go. Powered by a single 18650 battery, the EC23 has a max runtime of 330 hours and a max beam intensity of 16,200 making it perfect for outdoor use and everyday carry. The EC23 can also be powered by 2x CR123 or 2x RCR123 batteries in a pinch. (We recommend using the NITECORE IMR 3100mAh 18650 battery which can be added via the drop down menu.) An innovative all-in-one control switch located on the side of the flashlight allows easy one-handed operation of five brightness levels and three special modes. The addition of a tailstand provides the ability to light up an area and frees up hands for working or maneuvering.

This listing will be removed after sale, or updated if sale goes through.**Please do not ask if I will ship the items. The listing will be adjusted accordingly if that changes*The price noted is for the barreled receiver. I do have all of the Parts associated to this rifle if you are interested; as complete the total is $550. I am selling it in this manner because, I would rather not cut up a second C93 for a second practice clone build, and of the two, this was the nicer product.Face to face sales only.Listed is a Century C93 that has been completey stripped. The serial number is C9314XXX. It has had 1,600 rounds through it and has had zero failures using both steel and aluminum mags. The ammunition fired was (600) rounds of Wolf gold, and (1,000) rounds Armscor. Both brass cased FMJ. The scope tabs are aligned properly and held an original HK claw mount firmly in place. The rifle was more than capable of hitting multiple 6"" steel gongs at 100 yards in quick succession. This is built using a receiver with the magwell stylings of the G3 and has been parkerized. The bolt gap was gauged with an all matching bolt carrier associated to the rifle. The Carrier consisted of standard 8mm rollers that had been pitted and a worn locking piece to the bolt carrier. It read a .015 when the gauge went in without resistance, at .016 it has some interference and will not go all the way. I also tested 4 other matching carries,a and the gap ranged from .013 to .017; each fit in the receiver and closed up properly. Though of the five three were at the previous .015-.016 gap. This is built using surplus and new US mad Parts. ""New"" parts are the barrel, receiver, and weldments. Surplus parts are the trunnion, cocking tube, bayonet adater, front sight assembly, magazine release, and flash suppressor. Parts that are needed to fire the weapon stock, bolt carrier, bolt head, firing pin with spring, locking piece, stock pin, cocking tube support, cocking lever  with spring, recoilssembly, trigger group, selector lever, and lower. Remaining parts for a complete rifle include handguard, rear sight drum, handguard pin, magazine, and pistol grip depending on lower styling. This is recommended for those looking to have their own specific setup without having to try and sell off parts.  If there are any questions please feel free to ask. I also have parts available noted in my other listings and I update it often."

Mag is used and still in like new condition. These are like hens teeth and are hard to locate. As far as I'm aware they are no longer offered. I found this mag after a very long search but am getting out of ACR's so I don't need it anymore. $50.00 picked up in Greensboro. Trades considered. Thanks for looking.
