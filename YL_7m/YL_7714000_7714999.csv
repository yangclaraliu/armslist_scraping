Trying to make room for other stuff and finish projects that have been sitting for too long.All numbers with the exception of the bolt match. I've got two bolts with the rifle, one with the bolt head and other other without. The barrel is in good shape for the age of the rifle, but does have some pitting in spots.I've never fired this rifle, mainly cause my buddy who was going to help me handload some rounds moved away. All I've ever done was oil it occasionally, and fondle it

812,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7714812,For Sale:  Winchester Model 97 VG COND NO RES!! Winchester 1897 precursor to Winchester Model 12,"loudon, Tennessee, United States",$ 500,"Listed On: Sunday, December 17, 2017",Rifles,Winchester                                                                                ,9.3x74R                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"One of JM Browning’s masterpieces – the Model ’97. The classic lines, balance, the external hammer, and of course that distinctive sound characteristic of all the metal parts working together when you rack the action. Winchester sold a lot of them and people who bought them - used them. They were popular with hunters back in the day to put food on the table. Most M97 Field grades were used hard and put away wet.
 
The Model ’97 take down version I have for sale today is in very good original condition. Based on the serial number DOM was 1935. This is also the popular E series model with buttons you could press to remove shells in the magazine for quick and easy unloading. As you can see in the pictures, she’s not a “minty” but she’s not ugly either. This gun has very honest wear from carry but has been taken care of. The original blue is very good with the most of the wear is on the belly of the gun most likely from the person cradling the gun. The blue on the barrel is very good with no dents, pits, or scratches. Inside the barrel is mint. Barrel to receiver is tight with the adjustment sleeve at the factory setting. The receiver as you can see does have its share of fine scratches. Stampings are sharp and clear. Some minor slot damage near the magazine cap most likely to add a plug for hunting waterfowl. The wood still has the original finish. Very slight bruises on the right side of the stock on the wrist. This was probably from handling and due to its location I suppose these were made from a wedding ring band on the shooters hand. Hardly noticeable but want to try to describe my items honestly. The buttplate has wear on the heel portion of the plate. Most likely from storage and it sat there for a while because it hasn’t been used very much.
 
LOP 13 7/8” DAC 1 ¾” DAH 2 ½” Weight is 7.84 lbs.
 
I’ve shot this gun and used mostly for trap and sporting clays. Mechanically the gun worked great. However I should mention that the shells do not eject from the gun now. I’m not a gunsmith and do not touch my guns with tools. Although ’97’s are great guns, it does have its weaknesses. Most common failures to these guns are the ejector spring or the extractor. I would have fixed the gun before sale but I decided that sending the gun to a gunsmith and paying to ship it back doesn’t make sense. The parts are real cheap. I have another ’97 in my stable and decided this unfortunately has to go.
 
If you’ve been searching for ‘97’s online on the gun listing sites or at gun shows, most of them you’ve probably seen are in fair or less than good condition. Barrels are cut, shortened stock, bad re-blue, or not blue at all – all grey. This is an honest Winchester ’97 that anyone will be proud to own and shoot. If you’re handy with tools and spend time on YouTube, you could fix your gun yourself. Just be sure to have the correct tools so you don’t mar the slots of the screws.
 
Payment with certified check, Money Order, or Postal Money order. After listing ends payment to be received within 7 days. Buyer pays shipping of $40 dollars to lower 48. Alaska and Hawaii bidders please email me for quote. Gun will be shipped in a hard case. Gun must be shipped to a FFL. Firearm must be legal to own in your state. Please check your local laws. I am a private seller so your FFL must be able to accept a copy of my license to complete the transaction. If you've been looking for a really nice Winchester Model ’97 in very good conditon, DON’T MISS OUT and place an order! Good luck!!!"

Size:  The blade measures 28 3/4 from the tip to the guard. The OAL of the sword is 35 1/4"".  Markings:  The left of the blade has multiple battle and knight scenes with ""THE HENDERSON / AMES CO / KALAMAZOO / MICH"", in scroll, the obverse has ""MEMENTO / MORI"" around skull and cross bones, the name ""Roland M Gross"" and more battle / Maltese cross etchings. The guard has a crown and cross, the ivory grip has a faded ""M"" monogram, the obverse has a series of different crosses. The pommel is a knight's helmet and chain hanger loop, no chain is included. The scabbard has red enamel filled crosses, a knight in distress and ""R.M. GROSS"" in stipple pattern.  Condition:  The handle has natural fissures, a few scrapes and fading on one side's delicate crown, monogram and wreathed border. The brass has natural patina, there is play in the guard to blade fit, the blade has darkening oxidation and a few spots of light pitting. A thorough cleaning will spruce it up in no time. We kept it all original for the collector's preference. The scabbard has beautiful design and shows two hanger rings, one has a brass hanger buckle; the brass of the scabbard has signs of cleaning throughout the decades though for a 100 year old sword it is pretty enticing.
