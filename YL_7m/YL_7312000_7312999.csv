The lower is from a local outfit near Canton called Twisted River Tactical and I used a Sig Pistol ""Brace"" certified by the ATF to be good for a ""pistol"" configuration with no NFA Tax Stamp required. This is the eaiest way to get a short SBR-like gun without the wait and cost of an ATF NFA tax stamp. Gun was function tested when I put it together two years ago and runs well. Only has about 250 rounds through it. The only reason I'm selling is that I've gotten an actual Colt 6933 SBR now so I will no longer need this AR ""Pistol"".See parts list below with current component prices if you were to build this today... it would cost over $675 to source all this before tax/shipping but I'll let it go for $550 total or best offer. I'm willing to meet up for a face to face sale or trade with someone in a public setting within about a 1 hour drive of Akron. Radical Firearms M4 Flat Top Forged Receiver, 10.5"" Melonite 5.56mm Barrel, Free Float Quad Rail, Low Pro Gas Block, and A2 Hider ($280)Radical Firearms BCG is also Melonite Coated ($95)Twisted River Tactical Forged lower ($60)Toms Tactical Lower Parts Kit ($50)Sig SBX-15 Pistol Brace ($90)KAK Super SIG SB-15 Pistol Buffer Tube Kit with QD Endplate ($93)Included is ONE 30 round Pmag Magazine ($8)(OPTIONAL) Daniel Defense Fixed Iron Sights(OPTIONAL) Primary Arms MD-09 Microdot(OPTIONAL) ADM Mount For T1 Mocro allows for a lower 1/3 CowitnessTwo things:1) The red dot optic and iron sights in the photo ARE NOT incuded in the $550 price. If you want them the red dot will be +$80, the ADM T1 Micro mount is +$80, and the Daniel Defense Iron Sights will be +$120 ... or +$275 for all of the sights/optics together. I am quite firm on these sight and optic additional prices.  Again, the $550 price is for the flattop Rifle with one Mag only - optics and sights are extra.2) About 1-1/2 years ago, I attempted to change out the handguards. Radical uses a YHM-style barrel nut and float tube. It was so tightly installed at the factory that my barrel wrench could NOT remove it and some marring was caused to some of the barrel nut wrench holes. See Photo attached. The damage is limited to two spanner wrench holes on the barrel nut and is minor, it does not affect safety or function whatsoever, and is 100% NOT visible with the rail installed. I've shot many rounds since and it has not afected accuracy or function and does not prevent further attempts of removing the nut... although I'd reccomend a better armorers wrench than my 2-hole spanner before attempting again."

Much like M-24, the barrel is cold hammer forged and features 5-R rifling. The 5R rifling profile increases barrel life expectancy, accuracy and creates less fouling and bullet deformation over time. Whether you’re a benchrest shooter or longtime hunter, look no further for better reliability and precision. Why 5-R? 5-R rifling is the same type of rifling used on the battle proven M-24 SWS. There are 5 lands as opposed to the normal 6 land configuration. Traditional lands are squared off at a 90 degree angle to the groove while the lands on 5-R rifling are tapered at 110 degrees which results in less bullet deformation. Also, none of the lands are directly across from one another. Both of these features lead to better accuracy and less fouling. Legendary Model 700 Stainless Steel Action featuring the “3-Rings of Steel” makes this the strongest action on the market. Black Cerakote finish for additional protection against the elements 5-R hammer-forged with tactical/target-style rifling like that used in famous M-24 military rifles for the utmost in shot-to-shot consistency 5-R increases barrel life and accuracy, causes less friction and bullet deformation Tactical bolt knob for easy bullet manipulation Six longitudinal LTR style flutes reduce barrel weight and increase heat dissipation H.S.

Much like M-24, the barrel is cold hammer forged and features 5-R rifling. The 5R rifling profile increases barrel life expectancy, accuracy and creates less fouling and bullet deformation over time. Whether you’re a benchrest shooter or longtime hunter, look no further for better reliability and precision. Why 5-R? 5-R rifling is the same type of rifling used on the battle proven M-24 SWS. There are 5 lands as opposed to the normal 6 land configuration. Traditional lands are squared off at a 90 degree angle to the groove while the lands on 5-R rifling are tapered at 110 degrees which results in less bullet deformation. Also, none of the lands are directly across from one another. Both of these features lead to better accuracy and less fouling. Legendary Model 700 Stainless Steel Action featuring the “3-Rings of Steel” makes this the strongest action on the market. Black Cerakote finish for additional protection against the elements 5-R hammer-forged with tactical/target-style rifling like that used in famous M-24 military rifles for the utmost in shot-to-shot consistency 5-R increases barrel life and accuracy, causes less friction and bullet deformation Tactical bolt knob for easy bullet manipulation Six longitudinal LTR style flutes reduce barrel weight and increase heat dissipation H.S.

Worst I can say is no.From Botach:Product Description:The FN 303 Less Lethal Launcher is constructed from durable lightweight polymer with comfortable ergonomics and an easy to operate safety. The FN 303® Launcher is equipped with both flip-up iron sights and an integrated MIL-STD 1913 top mounting rail for optical or electronic sights or other accessories. The lightweight polymer magazine holds 15 projectiles and offers a clear rear cover to allow the operator to instantly verify both the payload type and the number of projectiles remainingWARNING: Use with extreme caution. Not intended for recreational use. Misuse may result in injury or death. Avoid aiming at face or head. Read operator’s manual before use. Instruction required before use. All operators of the FN 303® Less Lethal Systems (to include the FN 303 P) must be certified by the FNH USA Training Team prior to deploying either less lethal system.AccuracyThe FN 303 is extremely accurate at 25 meters and offers a very high probability of torso hits at 50 meters. It can be used at ranges up to 100 meters.EfficiencyThe FN 303 guarantees a maximum effect on impact. The shock and pain caused by the impact instantly stop and neutralize the suspect.Ease To UseUsing compressed air to launch projectiles, the FN 303® gives no flash, very little sound and almost no recoil.Multiple EngagementsThe FN 303 fires semi-auto from a 15-round magazine allowing rapid multiple engagements.The FN 303 projectile has been specifically designed to reduce the risk of penetrating injuries.The primary effect of the projectile is trauma, capable of stopping and neutralizing the aggressor immediately. Secondary effects from the projectiles can be delivered via a chemical payload, such as a marking or an irritating effect, depending on mission requirements.Most of the time, only one shot is enough to neutralize the suspect, which makes the FN 303 less lethal system really different from the other existing less lethal products.The 18mm (.68""), 8.5 g weight projectiles utilise a fin stabilized polystyrene body and non-toxic bismuth forward payload to provide both a more accurate and greater effective range than the other less lethal systems. The FN 303 projectile range includes five different types, featuring identical weight, identical ballistics and consequently, identical impact."

The lower is from a local outfit near Canton called Twisted River Tactical and I used a Sig Pistol ""Brace"" certified by the ATF to be good for a ""pistol"" configuration with no NFA Tax Stamp required. This is the eaiest way to get a short SBR-like gun without the wait and cost of an ATF NFA tax stamp. Gun was function tested when I put it together two years ago and runs well. Only has about 250 rounds through it. The only reason I'm selling is that I've gotten an actual Colt 6933 SBR now so I will no longer need this AR ""Pistol"".See parts list below with current component prices if you were to build this today... it would cost over $675 to source all this before tax/shipping but I'll let it go for $550 total or best offer. I'm willing to meet up for a face to face sale or trade with someone in a public setting within about a 1 hour drive of Akron.

If you want them the red dot will be +$80, the ADM T1 Micro mount is +$80, and the Daniel Defense Iron Sights will be +$120 ... or +$275 for all of the sights/optics together. I am quite firm on these sight and optic additional prices. Again, the $550 price is for the flattop Rifle with one Mag only - optics and sights are extra.2) About 1-1/2 years ago, I attempted to change out the handguards. Radical uses a YHM-style barrel nut and float tube. It was so tightly installed at the factory that my barrel wrench could NOT remove it and some marring was caused to some of the barrel nut wrench holes. See Photo attached. The damage is limited to two spanner wrench holes on the barrel nut and is minor, it does not affect safety or function whatsoever, and is 100% NOT visible with the rail installed. I've shot many rounds since and it has not afected accuracy or function and does not prevent further attempts of removing the nut... although I'd reccomend a better armorers wrench than my 2-hole spanner before attempting again."
