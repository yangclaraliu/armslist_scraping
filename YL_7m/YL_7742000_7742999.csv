Here it is, the new Citori Micro Midas Satin Hunter. It is a shotgun suitable for any lover of over/unders, but this special model will fit youth and ladies very well. The satin-finished Walnut stock is shorter for easier shouldering. The length of pull, which is the distance from the center of the trigger to the center of the butt pad is only 13"". This makes the gun easier to shoulder, quicker to point, lighter and easier to carry —  something that is very appealing to younger people and experienced shooters and hunters alike. It carries all the fine features that have made the Browning Citori the number one selling over and under shotgun in the world.Look carefully. The all-steel deeply blued receiver and barrels, the single selective trigger and hammer ejectors with the famous and easily navigated top-tang barrel selector/safety. These time-proven features may not be readily understood by many shooters, but will play a key role in how the gun works in their hands, and how easily it is operated and shouldered. A recoil pad is fit to the 12 gauge models.Family is the real reason. This is a very fine choice for the dad who is looking for a lighter, smaller over/under and certainly ideal for youth and ladies. And, the Browning name fits right in with the family. It has for generations."

Caliber: 380
Condition: Terrific!
 
Bersa has beem one of the best defensive pistol bargains on the market for several years now.
Top-notch set of features:
Double-action/single-action semi-automatic with many similarities to the Walther PPK, famously carried by the fictional secret agent James Bond.
Sharp looking green grips.  Upgraded rubber grips for an excellent, sure grip.
Slide features a rounded muzzle for easy holstering
3-dot sight system and rear cocking serrations.
External controls consist of a slide catch, round magazine release button and combination thumb safety/decocker are placed on the left side of the frame with the takedown lever located on the right side.
Safety lever automatically decocks the exposed hammer when it is pressed down into the ""Safe"" position, resulting in a double-action trigger pull for the first shot. Feels smooth and consistent throughout the arc of travel. After the first shot is fired, the hammer is cocked and ready to operate in single-action mode. Lots of added upgrades usually reserved for more pricey models. The metallic front sight is dovetailed into the slide. The adjustable rear sight has a small screw for windage adjustments instead of being drift adjustable or fixed in place. The top of the slide is checkered to reduce glare.
The front and back of the grip frame are grooved for improved purchase as is the face of the trigger.
Extended beavertail protects the shooter's hand from hammer bite.
The front edge of the roomy trigger guard is curved and textured to act as a finger rest.
The magazine release button is deeply checkered for positive operation.
Some little 380s hold just six or seven rounds in the magazine. The Bersa Thunder takes an eight-round magazine that ships with an extended finger rest to ensure a firm three-finger grip. The features, fit and function all add up to a gun that give you plenty of bang for the buck.  
Dismantling this pistol is quite simple. Swing and hold the takedown lever down in the 6 o'clock position while pulling back and up on the slide. The rear of the slide lifts off.
Handling: the combination of this pistol's smooth, clean trigger, comfortable grip and moderate levels of felt recoil left me wanting more time at the range instead of less.  Slim, light and comfortable on the hip. It feels so well balanced and the grip fits your hands comfortably. It's an ideal option for self-defense practitioners who are new to shooting or those who have been pulling triggers for years.   
Utterly reliable! !

Caliber: popular 9 mm caliber.
Includes factory case, owners manual, instructions, test fired shell, warranty card, etc. There is also the Springfield loader and clip grip kind of stuff that they throw in too.
Built with Springfield’s legendary reliability and workmanship!
                     
FEATURES:
Proven 3-dot sights. Fully Supported Ramp Sights. Front and rear sights are MILLED & dovetailed into the steel of the slide.
 
Springfield’s famous comfortable ergonomics and grip angle.
TWO factory magazines that are HIGH CAPACITY.
 
In the accuracy department, the Springfield is tremendous! As good as a Glock or better.
Safeties: Grip safety, the gun can only be fired when the hand firmly depresses the safety located at the rear of the handle.  Patented Ultra Safety Assurance trigger system, which guards against accidental discharge. The USA only allows the gun to be fired when direct rearward pressure is applied to the trigger, eliminating the possibility of an accidental discharge if the gun is dropped or bumped. The XD has a striker status indicator that protrudes from the rear of the steel slide when the striker mechanism is cocked. In addition, it has a loaded chamber indicator, which is a thin piece of metal that pops up when a round is in the chamber.
 
Picatinny rail for mounting a laser, light, and other accessories.
Dual spring and guide rod system - less torque is placed upon the guide rod and spring.
 
Weighing a little more than the Glock, the Springfield manages recoil more confidently than the Glock, enabling accurate “follow-up” shots.

I accept money order payments and cash on delivery locally. A local buyer must be 21 years old and ahve a valid Florida ID and be legal to purchase a firearm in the state and willing to sign a bill of sale.Pistol: I broke it in firing it 100s of times using Tipton brand spring loaded snap caps and it has not more than 300 rounds of target ammo through it. This pistol shoots better than new because i broke it in and modified the trigger surface as well as the stupid one dot sight that can't be seen in daylight or dark. The result is that it is more comfortable, esier to see and better to shoot than original. I repaintedthe sights with red and yellow fingernail polish so that they can be seen, at least in the daylight.It has some rust on the slide all ready. Also, rounded off the stupid square corners of the OEM red finished, aluminum trigger and painted it black, some of which chipped off (see picture). but I (ust touched uup the trigger after taking the pictures).It comes with 2 OEM Ruger 6 rd mags with +1 floor plates for mag capacity of 7 rds each mag.The breaking in greatly reduced the pressure needed to pull the trigger as well as fire it. This breaking in did not harm the function of the pistol. It also made the slide a bit easier to pull back.Note that I have bought tried the Ruger LCP, LCP2 & B. THough these LCP mags work in it , it won't cycle and fire the 7th round. The LCP Custom has a nicer (operating) trigger than ANY of the others and more capacity than all but the LCP because it is the same gun, same capacity exc ept for the trigger. The Beretta, brand new, wouldn't reload after firing! All the LCPOs I've had fired reliably and accurately out of the box. Also, breaking in the Pico resulted in a sloppy loose slide because the slide spring apparently is a weak POS and couldn't handle the break-in period.The Bodygaurd had the hardest and longest and nastiest trigger pull of them all and I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with it even though it was well used and fired a lot it stil had a POS trigger pull.Laser: black Crimson Trace model for the LCP with the instant on switch behind the trigger well on the grip.Sticky pocket holster, Kydex trigger guard that fits over the laser as well & a Techna belt clip mounted on right side for IWB carry on right side I use it (with the Kydex trigger& laser cover)."

The LCP Custom has a nicer (operating) trigger than ANY of the others and more capacity than all but the LCP because it is the same gun, same capacity exc ept for the trigger. The Beretta, brand new, wouldn't reload after firing! All the LCPOs I've had fired reliably and accurately out of the box. Also, breaking in the Pico resulted in a sloppy loose slide because the slide spring apparently is a weak POS and couldn't handle the break-in period.The Bodygaurd had the hardest and longest and nastiest trigger pull of them all and I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with it even though it was well used and fired a lot it stil had a POS trigger pull.Laser: black Crimson Trace model for the LCP with the instant on switch behind the trigger well on the grip.Sticky pocket holster, Kydex trigger guard that fits over the laser as well & a Techna belt clip mounted on right side for IWB carry on right side I use it (with the Kydex trigger& laser cover)."
