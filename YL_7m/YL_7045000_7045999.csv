I put in a small envelope and put stamps on it because trackable shipping eats a good portion of a single boresnake order. If you want tracking, I can do it for $2 more.

If I was selling a knock off or counterfeit, I would just sell you a shoelace. These are boresnakes just like any you would find in a sporting goods store. Just one company doesn't sell this product.

Has exactly 4 boxes of dove loads (100 rounds) throught it and has only shot sporting clays never hunted with it. I like the features of this gun BUT Ive shot Brownings my entire life and I just dont particularly like the new A5s so I bought this one back in November after reading a lot of good reviews on it but this gun just doesnt ""fit"" me. Nothing wrong with it or anything like that it shoots, runs and patterns flawlessly. Its the fastest cycling Auto Shotgun Ive ever had the pleasure of shooting, it will even outrun my Benelli M1014 (M4). Includes everyting included in the Waterfowl Pro Package and gun is flawless, no dings or scratches... all it has done is shoot clays in my back yard. Looking for trades will consider any guns... I have cash and other trades for something of greater value... Cash Price is $1400 Firm... Not hurting to get rid of it, got no problem with it sitting in the safe, I have plenty of other shotguns...

Not looking for trades unless it's something drastically in my favor. I am selling to fund another project. This is an M+M Model M10-762 AK. Unlike most of the other AK rifles sold, this is constructed of NEW parts. Manufactured in 2013. It has a chrome-lined, cold hammer forged barrel. QD optic mounting rail, fully heat-treated receiver with RPK-style rear sight (adjustable for elevation AND windage). Hogue grip, Tapco adjustable stock, G2 trigger group and so on. (thetruthaboutguns.com did an in-depth review of this rifle...)This model also has the M+M quad rail and proprietary muzzle brake. I have added an MFT vertical grip, and that balances the rifle out very well. Included with the rifle are (3) 30-round magazines. One is a smooth-side Tapco, which was the original mag provided with the rifle. Runs perfectly. One is a Pro-Mag waffle-style, and the last is a CAI that I picked up a while back. The quad rail covers are included, as well as a Black Rain Ordnance QD single-point sling with HK-style hook.I'm not in a hurry to sell, and if it doesn't, I'm going to SBR this rifle thanks to the AIMR-style integrated front sight and gas block. Converted to a SBR with a side folding stock, this rifle would be a great CQB weapon.$500 CASH FIRM takes it all. I remove my ads when the weapon sells, so if you ask me ""Is it still for sale?"" or ""How much will you take for it?"", I'm going to presume you're one of the ever-present scammers. Which means I'll delete the e-mail without a response. Pick up in Georgetown, KY. I'm not driving long distances and left waiting for hours. For sale only to KY residents 18 and over with valid identification. Bill of sale provided at the time of sale."
