This is a Ruger American Rimfire in .22LR. It has the Predator trim, which means it comes with the OD green stock and an 18"" threaded barrel ( 1/2 x 28 ). Comes with 1x 10-round magazine, interchangeable with 10/22 mags. I installed an adjustable Timney Trigger. Currently it has millimeters of travel and breaks around 1 pound. You can adjust it to be heavier if desired. It's a tack driver.This model does not come with iron sights. It has a picatinny rail on top of the receiver for optics. You can also remove the rail and use bolt-on rings, but make sure to get the ""American Rimfire"" type not the ""American"" type, as the receiver differs slightly. There are no scratches or blemishes on the gun. The only reason I'm selling it is because I mostly shoot my 10/22 these days for subsonic fun.Also, since it's bolt action you can run CCI Quiets all day long. If you have a silencer it is pretty great, working the bolt is substantially louder than the report.$300, face to face, no trades. Thank you!"

This material provides high tensile strength and toughness to withstand typical chamber pressures while still being highly corrosion resistant. ZEV Match Grade barrel bores are some of the most precise in the industry. Every barrel is double honed (rough and finish) until a minimum surface finish of 16 RA is reached. During this process the barrels are held to a final dimension of +/- 0.003″ for consistency and accuracy. The barrels are cut rifled and 100% inspected for groove dimensions and broach finish. While others may have imitated the look of a ZEV barrel, no one can match the performance. ZEV 9mm replacement barrels are the most accurate barrels on the market.

Is this still available? This post will be updated if a deal is pending or removed if it sells. If a deal is pending and you wish to still contact me, I will advise as soon as possible of status.2. How much will you take for it? The price listed is FIRM. There is a slight mark on the right hand side of the receiver due to safe handling. The price is deeply discounted to reflect this and is non-negotiable. The mark is visable only - in other words, you cannot 'feel' it, i.e. no depth to it. Gun is used - not a safe queen - but has been maintained and cleaned after each use. Gun is in very good condition.3. Will you ship? NO.4. Where can I meet you for pick up? Local pick up in the Medina county area ONLY.5. Are you interested in my any trades? See list below.6. How many rounds have you fired? I do not keep an accurate log of number of rounds fired. At a guess I would say approximately 800 rounds of assorted #7.5, #6 bird, #4 buck, 00 buck and slugs. The majority would have been the bird and #4 buck.7. How does it shoot? It's a little slow with ghost ring sights, not as fast as a beed front, but will ring an 8"" gong at 75 yards with 1 oz slugs if you do your part.8. What does it come with? As you see in the picture. I do not have the original box, manual etc... It will not come with a case, I will transport in a case to the pick up point, but it is NOT included. I suggest bring a case to the pick up point should you wish to protect your investment.Thanks for looking.It is your responsibility to know all federal and state laws regarding the purchase of any firearms."

These are relatively minor fixes!This used rifle package comes with everything you see in the photos (rifle, DIY cheek pad, sling, mag pouch, 5 aluminum magazines, cleaning kit, bayonet & bayonet sheath).  I also have the original Century user manual.  There are a few scratches on the upper dust cover.

It takes up too much of the barrel and I want to go shorter.
If anyone has maybe a 12-14"" they want to trade or if someone wants to buy this one.It's ok if the new one will expose the gas block but I'd prefer to keep the tube covered. Hoping for a straight trade. I can replace with some others at about $60 but don't see any .308 handguards below that so I value about $60.
It looks like most of them have barrel nuts/mounting included so I can include the barrel nut/mounting. If it's the same as the replacement I would prefer to replace it with the new stuff though so I don't have to undo it all. We can work it out if intersted.

The P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by Sig Sauer, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a full-size to a carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. With a partially pretensioned striker, it has a crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset. The P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. SigLite night sights come standard and the reversible magazine release makes this pistol completely ambidextrous. Pistol ships with 2 magazines.
