It's in very good condition wearing rubber Hogue grips, no box, we practice with .38 SPL ammo but have shot a couple of .357's just for the experience, priced $600. The other was bought new a year ago with the intention of upgrading, so it's in the blue plastic ser. # box, wears the nice Pro Series wood grips, with the factory stuff. I've never fired it since I hadn't sold the used one and couldn't stand to take it's virginity (I collect S&W's). Price is $700. These are fairly light and compact with a hammer for accurate single action and double action for faster use. Small enough for a woman but big enough for a man, a good choice for home protection. We DON'T DO PICTURES OF ANY KIND so available for local cash sale to OHIO RESIDENT ONLY, CCW holder preferred.

This is the Skeet Model 12 gauge. (the more desirable and harder to find model) with the 26 inch vented rib barrel. The 28 inch barrel, Model Trap is selling for $750-900 on GunBroker in good-excellent conditon. Let me first start by saying this piece is in EXCELLENT condtion. All original parts, wood, barrel, etc. Wood is beautiful and still holds it's shine as it did from the factory back in 1974. The receiver and it's engravings are in EXCELLENT shape as well. The barrel has no pitting or rust! This also takes Colonial chokes. CAN SEND DETAILED PICS IF INTERESTED.-----I will also include an original Garcia Magainze AD from back in the early 1970's advertising the line of Bertta AL-2's. Still sealed in packaging. If you are looking for an amazing Collectors Semi-Auto Shotgun that will only go up in value, then this is it.  I am asking a safe $800 on this shotgun. I know the market is down so the price is OBO. But I feel that is a fair price considering what others are selling for and this is even harder to find. Please do your research before messaging me if needed.
$800 OBO. Cash only. NO SHIPPING. Local only. FTF only. Any ""still available"" or ""what's the lowest you'll take"" will be ignored. Thanks."

THIS IS LEGALLY A HANDGUN! Very nice used Scorpion with AR tube adapter and Sig brace. You wouldn't notice the difference between this and a new one unless you took it apart to see a bit of wear on the finish of the bolt. I bought this a couple weeks ago, took it out to shoot it, didn't like it as much as I thought I would, now I'm passing it on. Worked flawlessly, and is surprisingly accurate with Winchester 124 grain NATO spec ammo (that's all I have). This would make an excellent gun for young/new shooters, home defence, truck gun, or just for fun. There's very little felt recoil, it's not too heavy, 10, 20, 30 round mags are available, reliable blowback action, and very compact even with the brace attached. I am selling this with the following extras:AR tube adapter, pistol tube, and brace ($100+)Eight 30 round mags four still new in bags ($20+ each)Magazine loader ($30)60 rounds of Winchester 124 grain NATO ball ammunition in two 30 round mags (19 cents per round)MidwayUSA heavy duty discrete case in Coyote tan ($30) I'm offering all this for $900. I'm not really looking for a trade, but if you have something from WWI/WWII or other interesting guns for partial or straight across trade let me know. The worst I can say is no. I do require a bill of sale."

If you're looking at this rifle, chances are that you already know this is one of the smoothest, most accurate .22's out there. They're so great, that Remington still makes them today, and their listed retail price is $707.Stamp ""PD 68"" leads me to believe this rifle was created in June of 1957, which (I think) is the first year of production of this model. It does not have a serial number, because serial numbers were not required by law until around 1968, but this is common knowledge by guns dealers, law enforcement, etc., and is perfectly legal to buy, sell, or trade. I will also throw in a box of 100 rounds for it. If you have somewhere to test it, I'm willing to let you fire it before purchase. It definitely has a handful of bumps and scratches, but there is almost no rust, and most importantly, works flawlessly. The functioning pieces of the rifle have been taken very well care of, and kept generously greased. If you would like, shoot me an email, and I can send you a handful of pictures so you can better see the overal condition.Willing to meet within a reasonable distance of Wilmington, NC. No, I will not ship. Cash only. Buyer will receive a bill of sale."

Vaughn Neeley of Timberline designed the sheath.

Although it was not chosen by the Navy, the Emerson-Neeley SPECWAR knife won Blade Magazine's 1995 American Made Knife of the Year Award at the magazine's Blade Show in Atlanta, Georgia, that same year and was displayed as an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art in New York City from May 24 to August 15, 1995."

This is a classic from Ruger who produced one and half million of them between 1972 and 1988. I believe this one was manufactured in the '80's. Stainless steel finish looks good and will be low maintenance. The original wood grips are a little dinged up but I'm including aftermarket hogue grips if you prefer (they really help with recoil when firing high power loads). This revolver is accurate and fun at the range. I'm also including a Ruger hard case, two speed loaders and two speed strips. I don't have the little keys for the case but it's still nice for storage or carrying to the range. Also included will be a box of Speer Lawman .38 special ammunition. Buyers must have a valid Wisconsin DL or CCW (CCW preferred). Cash only. This is a solid package; with tax return season approaching quickly get it while it's available!
