This gun has 98-99% blue. Action works perfectly. Grips are very good plus to excellent (some very minor pressure marks). This gun has a bore with good rifling and pits. Barrel address is excellent and clear. This revolver has matching numbers and has a second set of what we think are assembly numbers on the frame (under the grips, back of cylinder and back of barrel lug). All of the blued parts are sharp and the side plate fits perfectly. So, this gun looks factory, excellent to near mint but the extra set of numbers lead us to believe this to be a factory refinished gun. There are no star marks indicating factory refinish. The pits in the bore may be a case of someone shooting the gun with ammo that, when left uncleaned pitted the bore. This is a beautiful 1 ½” Single Action that may be all original but we are selling it as possibly factory refinished and pricing it accordingly!Any questions?

The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Rogers Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. The stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test.MADE IN THE USA"

It has less than 500 rounds through it and has never failed me. Looking for $450 obo.Why the FNS9C? Compared to a glock 26 it is only slightly larger, this allows you to get a better 3 finger purchase (compared to 2 on the 26) and has a 12+1 magazine capacity. If the flat baseplate is still too short it comes with another 12 rounder with a pinky extension AND comes with a 17 rounder with the magazine sleeve. These magazines are metal and the sights are metal as well, compared to plastic on the glock. It also sports a cold hammer forged barrel that will last 10s of thousands of rounds.Fn has created some of the most battle tested weapons in history from the SCAR to the P90 and it shows in this firearm.What I'm adding: An Osborne IWB holster($50) and an additional 17 round mag with the sleeve ($60). Also comes with the hard case provided by FN."

Sights are exactly like what you would find on a Garand or AR. This thing has almost no recoil and is a blast to shoot. My wife loved it and was able to easily handle the recoil and stay on target with tight groups. Sights adjust for windage and elevation, so you can play a little with your point of aim if shooting longer distances. Asking $475 but willing to negotiate potentially.

It is in the traditional wood and steel configuration of 2006-2007. It has been discontinued in the United States for about a year. My version is in .177. I can consistently hit the bullseye at 25 yards with this rifle and my scope of choice, the BSA 2X7X32 AO. The beech stock is beautiful, being comfortable and warm against the cheek when the rifle is shouldered. Overall weight comes in at just about 7 lbs. About the only thing I don't like is that its report is a tad loud, but luckily my neighbors in my home state of Louisiana don't seem to mind. When you see the single ragged hole in the middle of the bullseye after 5 shots, you'll fall in love with it and soon forget this minor shortcoming. The 890 is definitely capable of stellar accuracy.The rifle has plenty of power for small game hunting and plinking in the backyard. If you don't find one under the Gamo Hunter 890 name, you should know that the Gamo Silver Shadow Supreme is basically the same gun. The rifle comes with a scope stop; I would recommend a sturdy set of adjustable rings (such as Beeman 5030) for the 11mm dovetail be placed on this rifle, as recoil can be substantial. In recent years, the Gamo 890 has been marketed in the United States as a combo and sold with the BSA 3X12X50 AO scope. This is a great optic, but, in my opinion, this particular scope is a bit too large for the Gamo 890 and if you intend to use this scope, please do yourself a favor and buy a good steel 1-or 2-piece scope mount for the 11mm dovetail on this rifle. Overall, this is an excellent airgun for general purpose use, whether that use be hunting, pesting, or target practice. If you find one at a decent price, buy it. You won't be disappointed. “"
