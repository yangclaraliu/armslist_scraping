The Inertia Driven® system in these Benelli shotguns requires no springs or gas cylinder under the forend. That allows the Montefeltro's forend to be slim and graceful, while the lightweight, anodized aluminum receiver keeps weight to a minimum.The 12-gauge and the 20-gauge shotgun are chambered for 3"" magnum loads, making the Montefeltro equally at home in New England woodcock cover and a Louisiana duck blind. This is one gun that looks as good as it shoots. Stocked with beautifully finished satin walnut, the Montefeltro is the gun for the wingshooting purist who wants the feel of a classic game gun with the added advantage of a semi-auto.This Benelli Montefeltro comes with the Benelli Box and Benelli Hard case. It does come with Chokes, Full, Modified, and Improved Cylinder. It also has the choke wrench. This gun was very well taken care of. It is used but the gun has no markings or scratches. (Pictures!) You will be able to see in the pictures. This gun is chambered in 20 Ga, and has a 26"" Barrel.

Pick up a case of PMC Bronze Ammo and you’re good to go for multiple range trips. Each case holds 1000 rounds of high quality .223 Remington ammo suitable for use in an AR-15 or any rifle chambered in .223 or 5.56 NATO. Each round uses reloadable Boxer-primed brass cases.
Ammo Overview
 
Quantity - 20 rounds per box; 50 boxes per case
Manufacturer - PMC 
Bullets - 55 grain full metal jacket boat tail (FMJBT)
Casings - Boxer-primed brass$297 plus tax
 
This ammo uses 55 grain full metal jacket bullets with a boat tail for maximum stability. Muzzle velocity is approximately 2,900 feet per second, delivering the flat trajectories and midrange accuracy AR shooters know and love. With a thousand rounds in this case, you could make one very ragged hole!
 
Shooters frequently pick up PMC ammo in large cases such as this one because it offers an excellent combination of desirable characteristics: accuracy, consistency, affordability, and availability in quantity. These qualities are brought to you by the Poongsan Corporation, a South Korean munitions company that works hard to ensure that every batch of ammo meets rigorous quality standards. As a top supplier for the South Korean military, Poongsan has extensive infrastructure and expertise that enable it to produce vast quantities of FMJ ammo for serious shooters in the US.

This price is firm. COLT PYTHON - 1981 6"" E-NICK with original box and manual. AKA Electroless Nickel, E Nick, E Nickel, Coltguard. The finish on the these revolvers was done slightly different and isn't like the newer pistols that have the yellowish tint. These look like a beautiful Satin Nickel or maybe a type of Satin Stainless, best I can describe it. If you haven't seen one in person then you don't know what your missing. I also have a Colt Archive Letter to go with it to show where and when it was shipped and that it IS a true Coltguard not one that has been refinished like a few I've seen on a auction site.I have more pics that I can send to serious buyers and I can also take a picture of the colt letter if you'd like to see it. I would rate the condition at 99%.There is NO holster wear, pitting, rust, bad scratches, etc. There is only one small handling mark that isn't very easy to spot located under the barrel. I know when it comes to these high end pieces every mark matters. It has been fired but not much. Trigger feels amazing, no creep, just smooth as glass and breaks like thin glass, with perfect Lock Up & Timing. I'm only considering selling it because it's a beautiful piece of art that is just sitting in the back of my safe.This Does NOT mean I will give it away! It is a very nice gun and I don't mind keeping it.Not really interested in trades except possibly a partial trade plus cash. Only would consider old Smith revolver or maybe a old Walther. All must be in excellent condition preferably with box. Trading value will be higher then cash only.Face to FaceKY Resident with ID that can legally own a gun required, Prefer CCDW.Meet in South Lexington area, but willing to drive some at the right price.YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!Collect, Shoot, Hunt, Admire This one is perfect for all of the above!May consider shipping with USPS Money Order Only and only after I can cash it. Ship FFL to FFL for $40.Over the last few years Ive only seen a few that have sold for less then 3k and they were either very worn or didnt have the box. Currently one very similar to mine has a starting price of 3899. Only seen a few of this quailty with their box and they both sold for over 4k, one a little over 4200 and the other over 4800."

Now I'm waffling back and forth on just hanging on to it, but figured I'd give it another push on the merry-go-round, and see if any interesting trades pop up.) The 5906 is a full-sized, 9mm duty pistol, all stainless steel, single action/double action, steel dovetail 3-dot sights, and ambidextrous decocking/safety levers. The pistol functions 100% perfectly, is very clean, inside and out, and obviously hasn't been abused or seen a huge number of rounds. Being an older pistol (around 1990, if that's old), I installed a new factory recoil spring (I'm a long time fan of the S&W gen3's and have been through several, so I had a spare spring handy, and still have the original spring).Included are 3 factory 15-rd magazines, two of them virtually brand new in the packaging (I pulled them from the packaging and ran several mag loads through them to check for function, and they run perfectly, as expected). I'm fine with a bill of sale, or not. I'm fine with a test fire, providing someplace safe and convenient to shoot (and your ammo!!).Buyer/trader must be legal to own firearms, and be a Ga resident, over age 18, with valid ID. I have my GDL and Ga. carry permit, and will happlliy show them. No checks, no shipping, and no stupid scammer questions ( if the ad is still up, I still have the pistol).I think that covers it, thanks for looking...."

When you fire high grain rounds through it the sound is almost like a cannon rather than a crack, and the muzzle flash from the socom 3 looks amazing, so yes I am in love with this gun as everyone who has shot it was. The reason why I am selling it is simply because I am tired of buying rounds for it because they quickly add up, and since I dont have time or the effort to reload rounds ive just been shooting my 556 instead. I bought this gun about 2 years ago and put about 200-300 rounds through it the summer I got it. Since then it has been sitting in my gun safe, so almost a year (yes I take it out every few months to cycle it and make sure its lubed up). There are absolutely no issues with the gun and mabye only a few scratches here and there from just moving it and using it at the range. It has never been into the woods or the rain or any dirt whatsoever (since you cant really hunt with it..) so all the internals are spotless and rust free as well. I bought the rifle for $2,200 new and I can see that it has dropped down to $2,000 now. I am asking $1,200 due to what I paid for it and that its practically brand new (seeing as though I baby all of my guns). So I am asking for $1,200 but I am open to negotiations, however I dont NEED to sell the gun by any means so dont come and try to lowball me. Mods:Magpul 6 position stockMagpul pistol gripMagpul MLOK hand guard/railMagpul vertical gripMagpul rail segmentsCore 16' Heavy BarrelSurefire socom 3 muzzle breakUSMC (whoops) bipodCQB strap (not pictured)*Scope in picture not included (and pistol obviously)"

I fell into financial ruin from getting laid off at work and sold most of my rifles to a guy from Strykersville who drove a red Jeep Cherokee. Seemed like a decent guy, I let him borrow a rifle bag and we even kept in touch after the sale. Long story short, when I got back on track I asked him for only the old malfunctioning Savage/Stevens 87A (wouldn't function in semi-auto) and two AR mags from a family member that had sentimental value. I offered three times the value in return, but the guy ghosted me and wound up stealing the rifle bag. I'm certain we'll cross paths eventually.So now I'd like to try and find one similar to it. Like I said it's a Savage/Stevens 87A, sometimes they just go by Savage or Stevens separately. It's a 22 that can fire all 3 variations of that round, but it only works in semi-auto with the 22lr. It's kind of unique in the sense that you can manually lock the bolt to prevent it from firing semi-auto and just use it as a bolt action. The rifle has a very distinct ""fish gill"" vent on the left side of the receiver. As a fun fact, Springfield made a version of this rifle called the ""87M"" which the Greatest Generation used in boot camp during WW2 as a trainer before they were handed their M1 Garands. Those 87M's cost around a thousand bucks... I'm just looking for the $150 plain jane 87A. The first image was my 87A that I stupidly sold. If anyone has one that they are willing to part with, or has any leads on where I can find one locally, please let me know. Thank you!"

It started life as a 5 1/2” barrel pistol. When I traded for it someone had boogered up the front sight and then wire-welded their 'fix' back in. No way to repair it so that part of the barrel back to behind the loading lever latch had to be removed. So did the loading lever that locks the cylinder pin. I installed a neat spring loaded cylinder pin latch I found on-line [$35]. Makes changing cylinders a breeze for those of us that care about such things.The barrel has been cut to 4.5” and semi-polished at the muzzle. Nice sharp rifling, no rust. Crowning would make it look nicer and a bit more accurate; although, I planned to use it with 45LC #9 shot shells; so, really what difference would it make? Accuracy?  lolStocks are replacements that work fine. Need a bit of fitting around the frame.I have a threaded-post, brass bead for the front sight if you want to have the barrel tapped for it. Just for cosmetic purposes. It would look very cool but be useless as a real sight. Too short. This is a reflex shooter. Point and shoot. The main spring has been lightened to facilitate the draw. Very nice bore with strong rifling. Solid lock-up and hammer drop.The 45 long colt conversion cylinder is in nice condition with some marks of usage. Nice clean chambers and locks up tight in the revolver. Hunter nylon holster is solid and is what it is. Protects the gun. Nice old time personal carry. Just plain nasty close-up and loaded with rat-shot.NO FFL b.s. Required to buy or own this pistol and conversion cylinder in ArkansasIf the ad is up the gun is for sale.  Dont ask if it is, I wont respond."
