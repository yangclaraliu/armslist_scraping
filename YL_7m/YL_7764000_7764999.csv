The 1911 is not for sale.
If you're familiar with the SIG 238, you have a general idea of what this gun is.
The SIG 238 is a clone of the Colt Mustang. The Colt Mustang was more or less a clone of the Star DK.In the 1960s, Colt and Star reached an agreement for Colt to import Star DKs and resell them as the ""Colt Pony."" The Gun Control Act of 1968 derailed that by making import harder. But Colt revived the idea about a decade later, making their own Government and Mustang models that were more or less imitations of the Star.These are sort of collector's items (google ""star dk"" and see what people say about them). Not to be confused with other similar models. Specifically look for ""star dk"". The DK is the aluminum-frame version.In mint shape, advertised nationally on Gunbroker, with box, one of these could go for $500 to the right buyer. But mine isn't in mint condition, doesn't have the box, and I'm not patiently advertising it on Gunbroker. I don't want to bother with shipping etc, just looking for a local sale. All I have is the gun itself, and one magazine. The gun was made in 1966.
Condition is very good, except as you can see in the picture, the paint (or whatever it is on the frame) is worn where your hand goes. It looks purplish in places and gray in others. There's no damage to the metal, it just looks like the paint was rubbed off. Enjoy it as-is (the purple is unique) or it would be a candidate for refinishing.The gun works 100%, never a jam or any functional issue. It's the same size as a 238 and disappears in your pocket."

The SI Holbrook comes coated in the attractive and protective Cerakote finish, Daniel Defense Tornado, and features a small DD logo laser etched into the corner of its black iridium lens and Picatinny rails etched into the iconic Oakley O logos on the temples for a completely custom look. Everything else is pure Oakley. Holbrook features a timeless, classic design—inspired by the spirit of exploration and adventure epitomized by screen heroes from the ‘40s, ‘50s, and ‘60s—infused with modern Oakley technology. The iconic American frame design is accented by metal rivets and Oakley icons, providing equal parts performance and style. Two lenses are cut from the curve of a single lens shield and then mounted in the frame to maintain the original, continuous contour. Lightweight O Matter frame material offers premium comfort while peripheral vision is maximized by XYZ Optics, an innovation that maintains visual clarity at all angles of view. Impact protection meets ANSI Z87.1 Features: – Plutonite Lens: One of the most optically pure materials used in eyewear today, it maximizes clarity and impact resistance while filtering out 100% of all UVA, UVB, UVC and harmful blue light up to 400nm. Not a coating, the UV protection is from the lens material itself.– High Definition Optics: High Definition Optics (HDO) is a collection of patented technologies that allow Oakley eyewear to meet or exceed the testing standards of the American National Standards Institute for optical clarity, visual fidelity, and impact resistance.– Impact Protection: Backed by decades of innovation, Oakley performance eyewear offers uncompromising protection against high-velocity and high-mass impact. The protection is a benefit of the premium materials and unique architectures of Oakley lens/frame combinations.– UV Protection: Eye damage attributed to ultraviolet light includes cataracts, pterygium and macular degeneration. Our Plutonite lens material filters out 100% of all UVA, UVB, UVC and harmful blue light up to 400nm. The protection is from the lens material itself.– O-Matter: A stress-resistant frame material that withstands environmental extremes, it is lightweight yet highly durable. Controlled flexibility enhances impact resistance while contributing to the all-day comfort of frames made with this innovative synthetic."

The front sight is a standard A2 post sight w/ nightsight insert, on the upper's rail I've mounted a Holosun Solar+ Circle-Dot Reticle Holo-Sight. Below it hides a Magpul MBUS PRO rear flip up iron sight. The three sight points are in absolute co-witness.Comes in a CORE-15 plastic hard-shell rifle case (just something I had lying around). Includes 3 Magpul Gen3 Window'd 30rd pmag's w/ dust cover's and ranger plates. Also in the box is a tube of exterme duty long-wear high viscocity gun-grease in a syringe precision applicator, 60rds of 5.56NATO boat-tails, and a convertable single-to-dual point sling with parahook's and QD's (black Nylon). This thing is a lovely beast. When I finished the build and range tested it, I was blown away. It fires crisp, snappy shots with amazing recoil compensation and a very well-balanced feel. I built the gun for close quarters combat, so I needed fast but accurate follow-up shots and the ability to quickly engage multiple targets at point black, short, and mid range... switching comfortably between them and being able to get on target quickly and maintain a moderate to high rate of fire. That's what you want out of a CQB assault rifle. That, low weight, and manuverability are what it's all about.Engagement - Setting up at the indoor rifle range, I rented 3 Lanes side by side for these tests. I set the computer controlled target's in all three lanes to random programs and started them all up at once, standing roughly in the center of the 3. The targets would zip towards me and away, turned sideways so they couldn't be hit, and then randomly pop out flat so you could shoot them, but they would retract again in between .5-3sec. So with two 30 round magazines in this scenario I figured this was the best possible test I could design for how good a defensive weapon this build would be. That's why I'm telling you all this. Guys who REALLY know their guns will get it.    So the results were: on 3 targets in 120 seconds with 60 rounds I scored 60 out of 60 on the paper, 58 within the target area, 44 hitting center mass or head, and 23 dead on target (the two 3 1/2"" circles at the heart and head).   On a standard accuracy test I had 4 people fire 3 test groups of 5 shots and the results were averaged first by 5 shot group, then the three groups averaged together for a total average group size... here is what we got: 1.1""@100ft (me) 1.7""@100ft (buddy) 2.1""@100ft (random guy) and the really telling ones of .75""@100ft, and 2.2""@200ft (w/a x3magnifier) made by my gun-club's range master. This is a sub 1-mil accurate gun!! [*all shots from standing 'braced' position]So though I am loathe to release it so soon after I finished it (the 4 magazines used in the above tests are the only it has ever fired!) something has come up and I need to get my $$ out of it. It's a joy to shoot, it is as accurate as any AR-15 on the market, comes fully equiped for shit-storms of any purportion, it's made from only the best components and parts on the market, and every piece on the rifle is specially treated to resist corosion, rust, and to operate without lubrication. And, it's essentially brand new! I'll never get what I've got in it, but I can get what a rifle of this calibre is worth.This is a brand new competition grade short to mid-range Patrol or Duty rifle. Ready to rock and roll right out of the boxI'll start by saying I'm a seller at $1000. Let the negotiations begin. First reasonable negotiator takes it!!Text D.R. at the following - (5zero2) 68I-8IIsevenSend questions or offers!"

Wilson Combat skeletonized hammer
Wilson Combat mainspring housing
Wilson Combat ambi safety selectors
Wilson Combat mag release
Wilson Combat series 70 parts kit
Wilson Combat guide rod
Grip replaced with an aluminum mag well grip
Hogue finger groove grip insert
The pistol itself is solid. I’ve put probably near 600 rounds through it with not a single hiccup, and it has been thoroughly cleaned and cared for after each range trip.
I am asking $600, fairly firm on price. You can’t really find this specific pistol out there anymore, as they are no longer made. It will come with the original box (missing one side clip), manual, two magazines, ALL original Para parts I had replaced (except for the trigger and grips…I gave them away), a rail-mountable flashlight, paddle holster, dual mag holster, and a full box of defense rounds.
It really is a sweet gun and a sweet deal, and I hate to see it go, but holidays are coming up and I’m willing to part with it.

Rifle was created by Coharie Arms and comes with original manual, a b&t low pro mount, a utg trirail with covers, original HK hook two point sling, and three magazines. This rifle has the traditional 8in barrel with trilug, with a faux suppressor pinned to the trilug to bring it to rifle length. The faux suppressor can be removed for an SBR.  I have still had about 5 hiccups in about 200 rnds and have determined the ejector spring needs replaced ($10 from HKParts) as the current one is a G3 spring. At 25 yds I have been able to put 30 rnds in one ragged hole in rapid fire. This rifle shoots amazing with the smoothest recoil I have ever encountered and is suprisingly quiet even with the faux suppressor. The only reason I am selling it is because I want to try something different. $1500 OBO. Will sell for $1100 with no accessories included."
