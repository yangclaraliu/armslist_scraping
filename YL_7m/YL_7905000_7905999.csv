You can google it for more information, but Khyber Pass copies are firearms produced by the gunsmiths of the Khyber Pass between Pakistan and Afghanistan, known for hand crafting everything from crude to elaborate knock-offs of just about any firearm they could get their hands on for the last 200+ years. This pistol, unlike the original, does not have the 1805 Harper’s Ferry marking on the lock, nor any proofs or markings with the exception of the US eagle marking on the lock. The unrifled smooth-bore is .562 in diameter  (56 cal) as opposed to the .54 cal original and .58 cal Italian reproductions. These things are super scarce here in the states but not uncommon to find in the street markets of the Middle East. Most, if not all in the US were brought back by soldiers stationed overseas or by tourists.This is a super neat, functional black powder muzzle-loading flintlock with awesome patina. I have another Khyber Pass flintlock that dates to the Anglo-Afghan Wars, but I would say that this one is no older than the 1950s.Based on current winning auction bids on similar Khyber Pass copies, I’m asking $550"

All of it is new in the box.The free-floating barrel of the Tikka T3x Varmint effectively eliminates vibration and will not overheat, even during a fast-paced varmint hunt. The synthetic stock has an extra wide fore-end for benchrest shooting, and the swivel stud accommodates either a bipod or a sling. T3x has a new modular synthetic stock that has interchangeable pistol grips, making it possible to modify the angle of the grip. This allows for multiple shooting positions. A grip that never slips. The T3x synthetic stock has a new asymmetrical grip pattern and shape that has been specifically designed to give a solid grip in all conditions. The T3x synthetic stock also has an additional attachment point which allows you to change the width of the stock’s fore-end. T3x models come with a new recoil pad technology that reduces the impact of recoil on the shooter. The new robust pad allows you to fully concentrate on the accuracy of your shots. Be as silent as the forest. T3x synthetic stocks now have a foam insert within the interior of the rear stock – this lowers the stock-generated noise and can help you keep your target in sight. The new T3x receiver introduces a widened angular ejection port that makes it easier to feed one cartridge at a time. Always keep the target in your sight. Robustness and quality go hand in hand. Metallic bolt shroud covers and shields the rear of the bolt body and the firing pin.

Took it out of the box three times since being in my hands, once at the FFL for paperwork, second time at pick up for SN verification, and the third time to take pictures for this sale.Along with the gun, I'd really like to sell off all the parts, magazines, and gear that would have been used/installed/built with the gun. This makes it easier on me than selling all the spare parts individually. This was supposed to be built for USPSA Single Stack division, so all the spare parts, magazines, and gear are LEGAL for Single Stack use. 90% of this stuff is BRAND NEW and even the used stuff is in GREAT condition. The only used items are the 10 Dawson Precision Magazines (magazines from my main single stack gun I sold years ago), the basepads on those magazines, the 10-8 mag release, and the Blade-Tech magazine pouch. I took the price I paid for all the parts/gear/magazines and did a 30% discount which comes out to be $1433 worth of stuff (that's not even counting all the shipping and taxes you save) for $1000.There will be an inventory of what is included as well as a photo to accompany said parts, magazines, and gear.

The most noticeable changes are the bright red stars on the slide and the Soviet hammer and sickle on the frame. These engravings are filled with a red lacquer and the roll marks on the slide are in Russian. These special rollmarks and engravings are a subtle, but a distinctive change to the standard CZ-75B. The bright red lacquer contrasts nicely with the typical CZ black polycoat finish.The pistol also borrows elements from the older “Pre-B” CZ-75. The squared off trigger guard is gone, replaced by a much more aesthetically pleasing rounded trigger guard. The ring hammer has also been replaced with a spur-type hammer. Even the controls resemble their counterparts on the Pre-B models.With the rounded trigger guard, the CZ-75B goes from a strictly utilitarian appearance to one of the nicer looking combat handguns. The Pre-B was also the most numerous variant produced during the Cold War, and is representative of the CZ-75 family during that era. I have installed half checkered wood colored deep-red to match the engraving.Included Original Box, Papers, Lock, One 10 round magazine, Cleaning Rod & Brush (Everything from Factory) Extras: Stainless Steel Guide Rod, 11 Lbs Recoil Spring, Red Wood CZ Grips (Original Parts Included)This is UNICORN, only 1000 guns has been made by CZ.
