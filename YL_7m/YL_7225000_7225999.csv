I only shoot chunks of ice or paper targets and always try to leave the place better than when I found it. Point being I don't leave any trash behind. I used to go to the big shooting spot by the Motocross track on the dam road but apparently it has been closed by the forest service and judging by all the trees that have sprouted up it's been that way for years.  Obviously I'm not trying to weasel my way into shooting on someone's property just wondering where people go these days.
