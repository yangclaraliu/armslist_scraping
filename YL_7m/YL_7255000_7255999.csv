Features Hogue rubber grips, black and white contrast sights, and picatinny rail. Although cosmetically scuffed, the bore, feed ramp, strike face, and all other mechanics look great. The actions themselves also function perfectly, and the trigger pull, single action cock, slide rack, and magizine catch-and-release all work exactly as intended.

Without paying a ridiculous price for it? If you are reading this ad you already know what a Viper is, essentially a Cobra with a 4"" Viper-marked barrel. Here is a very nice Colt Cobra .38 Special, made in 1975, that has had an NOS Colt Viper barrel professionally installed by a gunsmith. The steel parts of this gun show about 95% of the original blue and the aluminum frame shows at least 95% of its finish. The crane has turned plum colored. There are a couple freckles on the trigger and on the crane. The grips are very nice. The action on this Colt is very tight and locks up just as it should. Pick up this good deal at $1200.00 instead of the outrageous $3500-$5000.00 usually asked for a Viper. A Viper and a Boa are the toughest Snake guns to add to your collection. I will ship only to a FFL holder. Be sure your FFL will accept a shipment from a private party. I will only accept a USPS Money Order, with the FFL for payment. Thanks."

I expect this to take a while and that is OK. If I can't find an IBM carbine to trade for, I am happy keeping this gun indefinitely. The only reason I'd sell or trade it for any other deal is if it was an offer I couldn't refuse, ie significantly in my favor. **Receiver is marked ""INLAND DIVISION."" Barrel is marked ""INLAND DIVISION"" ""GENERAL MOTORS"" ""6-45"". This means it was made after V-E Day, before V-J Day during the latter days of WWII. Given its manufacture date, it is almost guaranteed that it saw no action in WWII, but it's entirely likely it went to Korea and perhaps Vietnam. The Battle of Okinawa took place the same month it was made. Perhaps the people who made it were imagining the carbines being used for the dreaded invasion of Japan.Metal is parkerized with no rust or significant issues, though there are a few scuffs. Bore is beautiful. Stock has no markings (typical of an armorer swapping out a damaged stock). Stock is walnut with what I believe is the original finish. It also has minor scuffs but no cracks or gouges. It has a bayonet lug, typical of late-war carbines."

I traded off another gun for this to send off for custom work or as a back up competition gun, but never got around to it. Now it is time to liquidate it because I rather get the money out for something else. The gun is basically brand new as far as the previous owner told me, it was never fired. Comes in the factory case with two factory mags, mag holder, holster, manuals and the gun itself. Trades I am interested in are an Trijicon RMR06 2.0 , Trijicon MRO, 12 gauge shotgun ammo, Streamlight HLX, 9mm ammo, Aimpoints, Trijicon Accupower, and I might be willing to entertain some other things, but this is the priority stuff off the top of my head. Obviously some of these will require some cash to go along with any of these items you offer to even up the trade.Feel free to inquire more on more information and ask for more pictures if you want them.I am willing to meet in Montgomery County MD. We can go to an MSP barracks or a local FFL, preferably in the Rockville area if you are local to there.I might be inclined to ship to ship to your FFL but you need to pay shipping and I need to process payment first before sending it out. I will probably ship it out UPS. The UPS center I use requires a copy of the receiving FFL's license so I will need that too. Thanks for looking and hope to do business with you."

That's why there is no brake. If you want one they sell the front sight post brake combo with some google work. These are as close to original com block that were ever imported. There were very few imported. I have all the original furniture as well as the tacticool furniture that is pictured on it now. I will post pics both ways. I also have the side Mount and scope. The scope sucks. Consider it free in the deal. It will come with 4 circle 10 Bulgarian mags and one Russian Bakelite mag. All mags are 30 rounders. I also have a sealed crate with 2 spam cans with 1080 per can of 7n6 ammo. That's the stuff they banned from further import in 2014. I also have another can sealed of 1080 rounds of 7n6 and half a can I opened and shot some of. There is at least 3,500 rounds left and I will not sell the ammo without the gun. I will trade for the following...a 6.5 Creedmore Ruger precision or Savage stealth.  Would like some good glass for it as well. Possibly a nice creedmore and a Sig P226 in 9mm only. This setup and ammo wasn't cheap and I'm not giving it away. I don't need to sell it so don't make crazy offers as I know what I have here and what it's worth. I work out of town and we will have to meet on weekends. I am in no rush and have to trade around my work schedule. I can travel home through Knoxville on Fridays if that will save you a drive."
