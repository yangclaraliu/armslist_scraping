A lot of things have been added to this gun when it was purchased new, originally intended to use it as a concealed/competition gun. The gun has been a complete safe queen and has had less than 400 rounds run through it, during its entire lifetime. Starting off the list I replaced the guide rod with a custom tungsten guide rod. This helps add weight to the front of the gun making it better balanced for faster follow up shots. Next I have a replacement guide rod spring. This heavy wolf spring is great for a trip to the range, or you could use the standard one from the factory which is also included. I replaced the sights with TFO night sites when it was purchased, these sights last fifteen years, so they have thirteen years left of life in them. I added talon grip tape to the grip to aid it for concealed carry. I also replaced the rolling pin to aid the durability and reliability. Unlike the standard rolling pin, the new one will last a lifetime of dry firing. Yes you can actually damage the rolling pin by dry firing, it is a common problem, which is why I replaced it. I replaced the striker with a Springer striker to make the weapon more reliable. The striker status indicator has also been replaced with a Powder River Precision titanium indicator to help speed up follow up shots. The xdm includes its original case and accessories. It includes a mag carrier, mag loader, and holster from the factory that now no longer comes with the standard XDM. I also am including a custom made appendix inside the wasteband holster made by concealment solutions for the gun. This is a great holster made with custom kydex, and horseleather. The gun comes with its original 3 magazines  Let’s break it down The gun new is valued at 550 used  Tungston guide rod $70 Wolf Spring $15 Sights $80 (Not charging for the custom installation $30) Talon Grips $16 Holster $70 Rolling pin $5 Striker $50 Striker status indicator $25 The XDM Mag carrier and holster, aren’t standard anymore, springfield charges $100 for them now. Cash onlyThis set is worth appx 1098 I’m asking for $650 I feel this is a fair number feel free to text questions or possible offers.Despite what you see in the picture, this only comes with 3 magazines. I sold the other three seperately, hence the price drop."

Here's the cool part: if you own a 308 it comes with a cap (which was purchased seperately) that replaces the vertical adjustment turret (the original is also there so if you arent shooting 308 its fine). This thing calculates the drop needed for 308 (see photos). This was really useful to me on my rifle and so if you have a 308 I think you'll like this. Zero your rifle at 100 yards and then put the cap on. Bam, now the next time you're shooting at 500 yards you crank the dial to 500 and you're good to go."

Only reason I am selling it is because I have another firearm I really want and I needed to sell a few of my more expensive rifles.  Sold the rest first because this one wasn't going anywhere unless the rest did first.  So here it is.  Let me know if you have any questions on this before buying.    With what I have in this rifle, I am pretty firm on the cash price of 2875.00  Regarding trade deals, I will only trade for things that buyers I know are ready to purchase.  The list is below.  If it is not on the list, no point in asking.  I normally have no problem shipping, but this one would be pretty pricey since it is so heavy and the insurance would be a little high.  Who knows, just ask and I will see if I can work it out.  As a bonus, I am throwing in 110 rounds of .50 BMG for you to break it in.  It is a mixture of standard, tracer and steel core."

Firearm has only had 8rds run through it since built, and it's just amazing. This firearm needs to go to a loving home and to someone that will respect it for what it is. Finished out the estimated appraisal on this firearm has come in between 5k-6k. As I stated it needs some finishing touches to be 100% and that's why it will be priced the way it is.

Franklin Armory's revolutionary Binary Firing System (BFS) is ideal for three gun competitors, tactical shooters, and recreational enthusiasts. It features a three position selector - Mode 1 for Safe, Mode 2 for traditional semi-automatic Mode, or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode, the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger, whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Franklin Armory's BFS is easy to install with no custom fitting. The BFS Gen 3 offers a trigger pull of 4.5 lbs. (+/- 0.5 pound), the release phase now has a positive reset, and an updated design eliminates backup disconnector. The stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow. It works in Franklin Armory's F17 series in .17 WSM without modification. It works on .22LR and 9mm uppers without modification. The BFS works in every AR application: AR10, AR15, MPX, etc.    Buy now in store or online!"

This high-tech muzzleloading rifle features a completely threadless breech plug design that will eliminate the common headache of stuck breech plugs and gunk build-up in the threads. The LHR Redemption features external threads where a coupler fits over the breech plug and tightens to the outside of the barrel, making for easy on and off every time. The Stealth Striker fire design eliminates having to mess with cocking and de-cocking a hammer. Simply pull back the lever and fire. If you decide not to fire, a de-cocking button pushes the rifle back to a safe and un-cocked position. The Green Mountain Cloverleaf barrel offers match-grade accuracy, while the Armornite metal finish prevents corrosion inside and outside of the barrel, solving the problem that every other muzzleloader in the history of corrosive powder has had to deal with. This will decrease your cleaning time and improve your accuracy. Speaking of accuracy, these fine rifles feature the FT2 match trigger. With a light, crisp nature increases accuracy and features zero over travel. The Redemption also comes with a multi-tool that features a palm saver and range rod handle built into one tool.  LHR was started by two of Thompson Center engineers that quit after Smith and Wesson bought them out.  They started the company and stared producing muzzloeders of such good quality that Thompson center saw them as a threat.  T/C offered a huge buy out to LHR and they sold the Company.  T/C cut cost, took out the Green Mountain Cloverleaf Barrel and put cheaper parts in the Redemption Muzzleloader.  They rebranded the rifle T/C Strike.  This muzzleloader also comes with the Loose Powder Adapter so you can shoot loose powder (Blackhorn 209) or pellets (777).  This gun new sold for $649.99.   Was Asking $550 Now $475 or best offer.  All offers will be entertained."
