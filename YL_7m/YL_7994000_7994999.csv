I already have other 10mm range toys, so I think I will get out of this while the gettin is good.I have 500 into the gun, another 100 into 3 extra mags, and another 200 into the 6 inch 9x25 Dillon barrel. I also have 240 rounds of Underwood 9x25 dillon ammo, 100FMJ, 100JHP, and 40 of the ""extreme"" 90gr 2000FPS stuff. The ammo would run you about 240 bucks if you went to underwood to purchase.It's been to the range twice, total of 200 rounds down the pipe. Had a couple failure to feeds with both the 10mm barrel and the 9x25 dillon, but the mags are still really tight. The 9x25 is a hoot to shoot, raises some eyebrows for sure. Looks pretty bad ass too, barrel sticks out from the slide about an inch and a half.So, I have a little over $1000 into this. Would take $800 for all of it, including the dillon barrel and the ammo. If you were already interested in something like this you are saving on possible taxes, shipping and FFL fees. If you are not interested in the Dillon barrel and ammo, and only was the Witness plus the 4 mags, it's yours for $550. These prices are FIRM.Trades you say? Here are a couple things I am looking for.Ruger 454 Alaskan, 2.5"" or Toklat. I figure your trade in value at around $800. May be willing to purchase any additional ammo you have as well.Might also swap for the polymer ""carry"" version of this EAA 10mm pistol. 12+1 in 10mm.You HAVE TO HAVE a permit to purchase or permit to carry. No exceptions. Let me know what else you have, worse I can say is no. Don't want a shotgun,  or anything in 22, 9, or 40. No Glocks."

The rifle wears Chinese chu wood military furniture and has 14x1 LH muzzle threads. The rear of the receiver is slant-cut, but the stock fits tightly. Basically, everything that most MAK owners want to do to their rifles is already done, so you’re welcome. Why take a chance with a US-made AK that may have significant problems(I’m looking at you, IO, Century, Riley, Pioneer, etc), when you can own some good old-fashioned Chi-Com craftsmanship? Comes with a single Yugo BHO 30rd mag, but five Chinese flat-backs and a Factory 36 75rd drum are available to the buyer. 1700rds of Russian FMJ and JHP are also available, with a small handful of East German steel core mixed in.     $900 for the rifle and one 30rd mag. $1100 for the rifle and all of the mags + drum. $1400 for the rifle, mags, and ammo. Yes, that seems high, but it isn’t 1993 anymore, when these rifles were $200. Chinese AKs haven’t been available new for 24 years, and are thought of today as one of the best AKs you can own. If the price seems like too much for you, then please find one somewhere else for less. Mags and ammo are NOT FOR SALE SEPARATELY until the rifle sells, and the buyer has first shot at them. NO trades unless you have a Colt Delta Elite(10mm), older Combat Elite, or Springfield TRP with ammo and mags to make the trade even. No HO-scale model train sets or imitation crab meat wanted, either... You know who you are. ;-)"

Two new 10mm TRP™ Operator® models – one with a 5-inch barrel, and a longslide with a 6-inch barrel – deliver tactically proven engineering, greater terminal velocity and now more stopping power.The TRP™ (Tactical Response Pistol) line is based on the custom Professional Model™ that met the stringent specifications to win the FBI’s coveted HRT 1911 pistol contract. Until now, Springfield’s TRP Operator 1911s were available in .45 ACP only. Since its introduction, the TRP has become the standard for serious fighting handguns – a tradition the feature-rich 10mm models continue.Forged steel frames and slides are precision fitted to Match Grade stainless steel barrels with fully supported ramps. Frames and slides are coated in Black-T®, a self-lubricating, highly corrosion resistant finish that is engineered to shield the firearm from the heaviest use and toughest conditions. Integrated three-slot accessory rails allow rock-solid attachment of lights and lasers. Sights are 3-dot tritium nightsights, featuring a tactical-rack rear in the 5” version, and a fully adjustable rear in the 6” model.The Octo-Grip™ front strap and mainspring housing coupled with G10 VZ Grips® assure a confident hold. Once the ambidextrous safety lever is flipped, the Springfield Armory Gen 2 Speed Trigger, tuned to a crisp 4.5- to 5-pound pull, delivers custom-grade feel and performance. The 10mm recoil is tamed by properly balancing the recoil impulse with a heavier slide/barrel combination in conjunction with an optimized recoil spring making it an unbelievably soft-shooting pistol. Each 10mm TRP Operator is shipped with two 8-round magazines.The new 10mm TRP Operator models weigh in at 40 oz. (5-inch barrel) and 45 oz. (6-inch barrel), making these full-sized 1911 pistols soft-shooting and well-balanced options in a serious fighting handgun."

Never jammed, never had any issues. It’s been well-oiled and maintained. Only real issue is the age of the gun brought with it some usual, minor cosmetic wear on the front part of the gripping surface (see pictures). Other than that, I’ve been really easy on the pistol. Very easy to conceal and an absolute conversation piece. People really seem to love the Makarov.(For those of you interested in the history and more info on the Makarov, see below.)I’m selling with intentions to get something different.///In search of: S&W M&P Shield 9mm, HK VP9, or a Ruger Gunsite Scout .308//####Call or Text (502)299-8382#####******Asking $449 OBO, and open to any type of trade. **********Here’s an excerpt from Wikipedia:“The Makarov pistol is a Russian semi-automatic pistol. Under the project leadership of Nikolay Fyodorovich Makarov, it became the Soviet Union’s standard military and police side arm in 1951. Seen throughout various video game classics and the world. “Another excerpt from We Are The Mighty:“If you are a Russian cosmonaut, you’ve got more than a space suit to protect you.The Russians have been packing heat in low Earth orbit for decades.Along with fishing gear and a first aid kit, the Granat-6 survival kit in every Soyuz spacecraft has a Makarov PM semi-automatic pistol and plenty of ammunition.Presumably available to hunt game or provide a self-defense option, the pistol is just one more tool for the space-faring Russian to use if things go wrong.But the Makarov PM – for Пистолет Макарова, or pistolet Makarova in honor of its chief designer Nikolay Makarov – has plenty of down-to-Earth uses.Concealable and compact, it fires the Russian 9 x 18mm Makarov round, which is slightly shorter and fatter than the 9-mm NATO pistol round used throughout the rest of the world. It has a double-action mechanism – if a round is already chambered the pistol can be fired by pulling the trigger without manually cocking the hammer.Even though it is heavy for its size and has a stiff trigger pull, it’s a natural for police work and covert operations. The designer even copied features from the Walther PP (police pistol) designed in 1929, including its size and the shape of the pistol’s frame.Not surprisingly, since its introduction in 1951 the Makarov was frequently the handgun brandished by state security agents in the U.S.S.R. or the old Eastern Bloc when they said, “Comrade, come with us.”Even in the age of polymer-frame pistols, the Makarov has its adherents.Spetsnaz (Russian special forces) team members often carried the Makarov as their sidearm, particularly team commanders, deputy commanders, and radiomen. They sometimes carried a suppressed version of the weapon for so-called “wet works” – kidnappings and assassinations where stealth, surprise, and silence were necessary for mission success as well as personal survival.With the fall of the Soviet Union, many Makarovs flooded the market and eventually ended up in the hands of shooters in the United States.“The Makarov is more reliable than most of the more expensive small pistols, is well made of good material, and is surprisingly accurate,” writes Matthew Campbell, author of 21st-Century Stopping Power: What Works, What Doesn’t, and Why.”####Call or Text (502)299-8382######******Asking $449 OBO, and open to any type of trade. **********"

Is in like new condition and comes with two magazines, box, and paperwork. These models come from the factory with a beveled magazine well and magazine release button. I also made the following upgrades:-CZ FACTORY TRITIUM NIGHT SIGHTS ($100)-CZ FACTORY ENHANCED P-01 SLIDE STOP ($40)-CGW STAINLESS GUIDE ROD ($30)-PREMIUM PACHMAYR WOOD GRIPS ($40)That's $210 worth of upgrades to a pistol that usually sells for $1000+ on GunBroker.

874,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7994874,For Sale:  US INDIAN POLICE 1889 12 GA TRAP GUN,"Raeford, Fayetteville, North Carolina","$ 1,695","Listed On: Wednesday, March 7, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,This is a rare United States Indian Police 12 GA Trap Gun with smoothbore. The 1889 is stamped on the butt of the weapon but the weapon is most likely older. Barrel is approximately 22 inches long and is a single shot with an overall length of 39.125 inches. This is a Native American single shot trap gun. On one side it has Benicia Arsenal and the other has Pine Ridge Indian Agency. The trap gun is made by British and the proof marks suggest between 1811-1892. I have more pictures than what Armslist will allow me to post so if you want any of the marks I can send them. I am not sure of the original manufacturere date and the overall condition is good. The mechanics of the firing mechanism seem to work as it should with the hammer have two different cocking positions and the trigger will release the hammer. The trap door open by pulling the pin and it exposes the breach. The serial number is 2868. The rifle is missing the front band that holds the barrel to the stock. This is something that was common with these types of guns and if you research pictures you can see that some of the Indians used some type of cord to secure it in place.

For your security and mine we can complete the transaction at a local gun shop at my expense. This is one very serious firearm. When I asked the dealer if he had any defense ammo for it, he replied, ""anything you put in it is defense ammo"""

Oval .020 deep rifling. That's right, it's one of the spectacularly  accurate H. Toenjes custom barrels. It was made in 1995-96 and rechecked and proofed by Hugh last year. The proof target is pictured, it speaks for itself. It has a CM-3 beautifully stripped maple stock stained with Aqua Fortis and LMF Walnut stain and finished with many coats of Tru-Oil and cut back between coats for a semi gloss finish. It features a Roller Lock and Roller double set trigger. You must actually shoot the Roller lock to appreciate the Swiss watch like action Bob gets from his locks.. there is just no comparison to any other lock. The rifle has been proofed a second time with 200Gr 2f and a .526 ball and a .024 patch. It has not been shot in and is must be shot to target, it is new and you must do the normal sighting in procedure. For the sake of full disclosure...I had completed the rifle and was doing the final finish and discovered that the ramrod hole drill had run out to the bottom and as I was finish sanding it broke through...I planned this rifle for Hawken Matches so I expected to shoot off a rest or cross sticks some of the time....I thought that a saddle plate would be an ideal solution, it would be an excellent cover for the ramrod problem and add interest to the rifle. It has  13 3/4"" pull and apx 3"" drop. It feels real good to me and I am about 5' 11"". The rifle weighs about 10 1/2 #.I built this rifle to sell at $2000 +, but in consideration of the saddle plate ramrod issue I will sell it at a reduced price.

Tiger stripe CAMO stock. Comes with a hard case and a couple mags. I have the rails for it but currently have the synthetic upper of another M1A on it (which it comes with). It makes the weight much more manageable if you don’t care as much about attachments. I am missing the metal front plate for the rails so if you did want to attach them you would have to track down one of those. The rifle is located in Virginia because I could not bring it with me to this Left sided state of Maryland when I had to move. It Wouldn’t take me to long to find time to get down to Virginia to either meet with you or ship it out from a firearm store there.
