I posted a link of the rifle from where I purchased it at the bottom so you can see the specifications for yourself, the only thing that is aftermarket is the muzzle brake and extended charging handle, it's a Lantac dragon and a Leapers charging handle. I have two windowed 25 round pmags, about 200 rounds of ZQI 7.62x51 rounds and 60 rounds of softpoint ammo. I will be keeping the scope, mount, bipod and soft case for other rifle. I'm looking to recoup some of my money back, I will sell for $1600 and have about $2100 invested in all."

That was done about 3 weeks ago and the fiber optic sights were installed at the same time. I polished some of the contact points in the trigger housing to clean up the trigger pull a little bit. I also polished the barrel as you can see in pictures to give it a different look. This gun is in absolutely perfect condition. And marks or scuffs you see in pictures are just smudges or lint. The gun looks brand new. This is the thumb safety model. It will come with a gray, carbon fiber, concealment express kydex holster as well. (Note. The sights are Williams hi-viz fiber optics. They are NOT night sights). I would prefer a trade for a Glock 43 but will entertain other options as well as cash offers. Would like to get $400 cash. Text/email Derek913-731-11zero8"

I've listed this before and my reserve was never met so this time around I'm drastically lowering my reserve. This Compact Carry has the Wilson Combat Action tune and Mag Well guide done by them. The pistol is NIB and unfired since leaving Wilson, and yes they do test fire all of these that have had the Action Tune to ensure reliable ignition. The pistol comes in the factory blue plastic shipping case with the small parts replaced by Wilson. The outer box was discarded by my dealer prior to my purchasing the pistol from him. These are fantastic pistols that for some reason are not being produced anymore so their numbers are small. I believe this was because Beretta could not supply the pistols to Wilson even though it's big brother the Wilson Combat 92 Brigadier Tactical is still available. That ensures that the Compacts will only increase in value over time, so bid with confidence. SHIPPING IS FREE!"
