It has a name 3 to 9 Power Scope with bullet drop compensation and lit reticle. Also comes with 30 round GI mag... This is a great rifle that is chambered in 5.56 and can shoot .2 two three as well. I have fired brass and steel case ammo through this rifle and it does well with both... this rifle would be great for backpacking using as a truck / Jeep car rifle or a great bug-out rifle... Lots of Firepower and a small package. It has the heavier weight threaded barrel from the previous models before it the threaded barrel is a half by 28 thread which is common for 556 and can be used suppressed silenced. At this time I have an A2 flash hider on it but it also will come with a compensator that I have had on it in the past... Serious inquiries only cash only if you want it shipped it will have to be to an FFL at your own expense for shipping and transfer fees thanks

Price includes gun and all ammo, plus a cut-down plastic stock.  I will consider adding a box and a half of clays and a thrower, too.  Meet Face To Face only, in a public place.  Cash only.  No trades, no shipping, no couriers, no BS.   ABOUT THE PRICE:  I looked at GunBroker, and the last 20 auctions for a Remington 1100 20 gauge which had bids (not just listed for a high price - but prices folks actually bid) - averaged $480.  You'd have to add shipping ($30) and FFL ($20) to that.  The ammo - ordering it online would be $185 - plus shipping, so figure $200 total.  So this is a $730 deal - I'm way below that.  ABOUT CONTACTING:  If you're interested, email me and be sure to include a number I can text - please - too many scammers and BS flingers out there.  Thanks in advance."

Handgun has EXACTLY 450 rounds through it (I still have the used brass and will happily throw it in if you want it) and is cosmetically flawless. Bought it about six weeks ago, and I'm not as impressed as I want to be with it. Ithought I'd see if anyone else is willing to trade me something desirable; if not I'll hold on to it as it certainly isn't a bad gun in the least. If you do a little searching over the internet, you'll find that the gun reviews extremely well. One of the biggest complaints about it is the price of the exotic ammunition ammunition: well, I've got an answer for that...Here is everything that will come with this lot:One - FN Five-seveN Handgun in factory FDE clean and well lubed ($1250 standard retail)Seven - Factory 20-round magazines with Mag pouch (comes with three, $150ish for the extras)Two-Thousand-Nine-Hundred rounds of American Eagle 5.7x28mm Ammunition. That's 58 50-round boxes. ($1300ish from the discount stores)And of course the original box, papers, etc.If you do the retail math, that's approximately $2700 worth of stuff if you went bought all of that right from mainstream gun stuff websites (Buds, Brownells, Midway, etc). I can say that a I like the pistol, but I don't Love it, so therefore I'm possibly interested in trading or selling it. I'm not dead set that the firearm must go, but if youre interested and can hit me with the right item(s) worthy of my interest, I might bite."

First up - I have a very good condition CZ-82 in 9mm MAK. Installed on the pistol are wooden Marschall grips, and a stronger recoil spring from Wolff.  Included with the pistol: 3 magazines, the Wolff tuning spring kit, original black plastic grips, military-style holster and cleaning rod, police style holster, police style mag holster, 330 rounds ball ammo, 37 rounds Hornady defence ammo.  Price for everything:  $500.
Next - I have a couple of Mosin Nagant rifles. First the less impressive of the two, is a beautiful m91/30 manufactured in 1938.  All numbers matching.  I've done the small trigger job with the shim and spring so the trigger doesn't flop around, but it's stock aside from that.  $200.  I also have one of the more rare m44 finds.  Only manufactured for 1 year, a TULA arsenal M44 manufactured in 1944.  The only model more rare than this is the 1943 test model.  The floorplate of the magazine was force-matched during factory refurbishment, but all numbers otherwise match.  $400.  Both rifles have the extended rubber recoil pad installed - the m91/30 with a black pad, the m44 with a brown.  As shown in the pic, I also have Ammo for these - a total of 940 rounds - 880 rounds in two unopened 1980's Bulgarian surplus (the cream of the crop) in wooden crate with can opener, and 3 packs of WPA Millitary Classic.  Ammo $400.  Included with the rifles, bayonet for the m91/30, two slings (one per rifle), oil can, cleaning kit, ammo pouch, and tool pouch, and of course, the original matching number metal butt-plates.  Total for all: $1000
Finally, I have an Italian Beretta 92S. This is not the FS, so the mag release is at the bottom of the grip, not at the trigger guard as we're used to.  It's a surplus LEO trade-in and includes two magazines.  $350
I'll sell the guns individually, but I'd rather not seperate ammo from the accompanying firarms. I'll also ignore all ""low-ballers.""  Use the contact button in the listing, it'll go to my cell phone.  Face to face transactions only, and I will provide a Bill of Sale for you to sign."

Please email color choice when ordering. The much anticipated update to the TIP keychain flashlight is here! The Nitecore TIP SS -Stainless Steel Edition- is every bit as powerful as its predecessor with new dual modes and a detachable clip. The new “Daily” and “Constant On” modes give users more control over their light based on their intended frequency of use. In Daily mode the TIP SS will automatically shut off after 30 seconds of use meaning you’ll never have to worry about leaving your flashlight on again. For those who desire more control, Constant On mode will stay on until turned off. Weighing under an ounce, the TIP SS uses a CREE XP-G2 S3 LED to emit a max of 360 lumens. The TIP SS has a new detachable multi-purpose clip which doubles as a switch protector, preventing accidental button pushing, as well as a USB port cover keeping it free from dust and debris. Rechargeable through this built-in micro USB port, the internal 500mAh li-ion battery and circuit design give this keychain flashlight up to 46 hours of run-time and holds up to a year in stand-by. A few minutes with the TIP SS and it’s clear this flashlight is a worthy addition or upgrade to any keychain.

If you are looking at this ad you know all about how great these guns are.
The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle.

When I asked for pictures, he informed me he did not have the box, only had one magazine and did not have the Certificate of Authenticity that comes with the gun. He would only send me pictures of one side of the gun and refused to send me photos of the other side of the gun which contains the serial number. He told me he bought it at an estate sale, and when I asked him multiple times for the serial number he said 'I could see it in person' and refused to let me call local law enforcement to make sure the gun was not stolen. This gun regularly sells for close to $3,000, and this guy was willing to take less than $500 bucks and did not want the serial number to be looked up.

If you have ever wanted a single person shelter system that will perform in all 4 seasons for your survival kit, this is the limited opportunity you do not want to miss. This product was developed for Naval Special Warfare sniper/observer teams, and has never been available previously to the public in its original military Coyote color. Like most premium outdoor brands, Mountain Hardwear has on occasion produced specialty products for the Special Operations community in limited quantities that are not offered to the public. Also like most premium outdoor brands, the vast majority of Mountain Hardwear products are made overseas in large factories to leverage a wide range of commercial materials and achieve economies in manufacturing. Due to the fact that our military Special Operations units require Made-in-USA products to comply with the Berry Amendment (if you don't know what this is, Google it), often these special not-for-public items become even more exclusive by the fact that they are actually MADE HERE. Style Name: Hunker 1Style Number: OU9576Capacity: 1 PersonCategory: 4-Season ExpeditionMinimum Weight: 4 lbs. 15 oz.Stuffed Size: 23"" x 7""Floor Dimensions: 91.5"" x 48""Peak Interior Height: 28.5""Floor Area: 24 sq ftVestibule Area: 15 sq ftThis tent does not come with assembly instructions because NSW did not request any. If you are at all familiar with modern tent set-up you are good to go. If you are not, just ask a friend who camps and you'll be amazed at how simple it is."

A fully loaded weapon may be carried in this buckle, but not discharged. This buckle is the famed model from Personal Protection Concepts of Ohio, using Richard “Dick” Casull’s patent. He is also the brilliant designer of the mini-revolver and the famous .454 Casull revolver. Stainless steel buckle measures approximately 3"" x 2"".

Since then, it has been to the range about 5-7 times where it flawlessly fired 300-400 rounds. I am slightly OCD so I cleaned it after each use. When not in use, the gun spends its time in a safe with a dehumidifier. I still have everything that came with the gun. I also added Hogue grips which work great. From what I observed during the short period of time that I used the gun, it shot great and has no probably with numerous types of 45 ACP ammo. The only reason I am selling it is because I don’t use it enough to warrant keeping it and want it to find a new home where it’ll get more use.

Also interested in Zev factory Glocks, not pieced together glocks with zev parts. Not looking for any trades that require cash from my side. I may throw in some parts or another gun for the right trade. Not interested in shotguns or hunting rifles.If the ad is still up then it is still available. I will not answer emails only asking if it's available since most of those are spam."
