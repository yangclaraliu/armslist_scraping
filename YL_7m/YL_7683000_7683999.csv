This makes for incredibly fast deployment with this knife. I removed it from the package to inspect it but it has never been carried or used to cut anything. I marked it at $25 originally figuring someone would want it for nothing and I was correct. Anyway, $21 is what I paid for it and that's what I will take. Thanks for looking."

Very nice M2 walnut stock, adjustable rear sight, flip safety, bayonet lug, and an M2 mag catch. Bore is brite and shiny with lots of life left in it. Also a very light import mark on the barrel. This rifle would make a great shooter for someone.
There are two kinds of 30 Cal. carbines … . One that loses its value over time ( a commercially made rifle ), and one that is an investment….that is, it will at least HOLD its value, and likely INCREASE in value over time. ( a genuine U.S Carbine .Caliber 30 M1 rifle , made during WWII). You DO get what you pay for
As well as being an important part of the United States Military history, you can defend your home and family with it. It is also easy for anyone in the family to shoot…. Very controllable, with plenty of punch ( more muzzle energy than a .44 mag.) .  Just as important, you can find parts for it if something needs to be replaced ( not always true with a commercially made rifle ).   Thank you for looking."

I've also replaced the straight out charging handle with a turn down to accommodate a scope mount. It was a project I was very excited about and just never finished so it's a great start to a modern take on the Mosin if you're a fan. You will need to have the receiver bored for the scope mounts. The peg to lock the bipod on is missing, I'm sure its not expensive. Please keep in mind this is a project.

Bore is very nice with sharp rifling, metal finish is the nicest I've ever seen on an M39 and wood is also nice with no damage and oil finish. I've removed 90% of the cosmoline the Finns had it packed in but you can look forward to some brush and mineral spirits time with this one. Tang markings are Tula hammer, Soviet acceptance and proof stamps and a very worn circle which may be the remnants of the original Remington manufacturer (the US made Mosins for the Czar). See pic for barrel shank markings. Finns likely captured this one as a Russian Mosin 91 or 91/30 in the Finn Civil War of 1917 or the Winter War of 1939-40 and used the receiver to make an M39. The Finns never made a single receiver- all were Mosin purchases or captures that they converted to mutiple models including the M39. I have many more pics available- just ask. I have this up on GunBrkr for $499 but will sell to a local Montanan for $400 to avoid the shipping and FFL hassles. Extras include 10 stripper clips, Strike Hard Gear OD green bandolier, Allen quilted canvas case, and Finnish Army issue green leather sling. Plenty of cheap surplus ammo out there for these. FtF sale in Helena area preferred but I'm willing to drive some. Buyer must be adult Montana resident willing to sign bill of sale. Thanks for looking and message me with any questions."

I had this mounted on a .223 Wylde AR for just a short time (less than 1 year) and replaced it with a first focal plane scope.  This is a beautiful scope with fantastic glass and you can really feel the quality just handling it.  I've debated over and over if I should sell it but I just don't think I'm going to have a use for it. 
I have included the Leupold Alumina Flip Back Scope covers.  These are aluminum covers that fold back onto the scope, in other words they do not stand up like most covers.  When the caps are closed, they are held by magnets. These are absolutely the nicest scope covers I have ever used or come across.
Also included is a Switchview throw lever.  I really never got to use it but this will allow you to easily change magnifications while looking through the scope.
The scope is in perfect condition other than a small blemish where the scope covers touched the scope.  Also, if you look close you can see where the scope rings where mounted.  (I don't think this is ever avoidable.  I had this mounted with LaRue Tactical LT104-30 mount.)
I purchased the scope from Brownells and paid $600.  I got the scope covers from Midway for $100, and I think I paid $60 for the throw lever from Brownells.
You can get all the specs here but I'll list a few:
https://www.leupold.com/scopes/rifle-scopes/vx-r-patrol-3-9x40mm-30mm
- Second focal plane reticle- 30mm tube- excellent eye relief (please look up the specs)- Firedot TMR reticle (the center can illuminate with 10 levels of brightness)
Please email me if you would like a copy of the manuals in PDF.
Note:  The reticle is the Firedot TMR which is the left reticle in the reticle photo (the one on the right is the Firedot-G TMR which illuminates in green).  (Sorry, I could not find a better photo of the reticle.)"

But the Shuffle II’s look is very different from the Shuffle. With a tanto blade, strongly textured handle, and BlackWash blade, the Shuffle II has a brawnier look and feel. The blade is made of 8Cr13MoV, a quality stainless steel known for its ability to hold an edge, strength, and hardness. The heavily textured handle enhances grip, while still being comfortable to hold and use. A liner lock secures the Shuffle II’s blade open in use, but closes easily when its tasks are done. It also features the strong finger contours, handy bottle opener, screwdriver tip, and lanyard attachment that help define the Shuffle. As a utility knife, a work knife, or just a great multi-function pocketknife — with a beefed-up look — the manual opening Shuffle II is a perfect choice. It comes complete with a convenient reversible (left/right) pocketclip. Features: – Thumbstud– Manual opening– Liner lock– Reversible pocketclip (left/right)– Bottle opener, screwdriver, lanyard hole Specifications: – Steel: 8Cr13MoV, BlackWash finish– Handle: Glass-filled nylon– Blade Length: 2.6″– Closed Length: 4″– Overall Length: 6.3″– Weight: 3 oz."
