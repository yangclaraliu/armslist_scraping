Comes with the original box also. 
I've also done a couple upgrades to this one including improved bottom metal and the enlarged knurled bolt handle. This rifle has been good to me but I'm letting it go so I can upgrade a model based on the Anschutz 54 action.
Price is for the rifle only. I may be willing to make a package deal and include the Leupold VX-3i EFR 6.5x20x40mm scope and Talley rings. Bipod not included.

So today I present an unissued French MAS MLE 36/51 bolt action rifle in original 7.5x54 MAS caliber. I acquired this over 25 years ago from a friend who was in the collectible miltary firearms business at the time. So whenever a new shipment arrived I got a phone, went over for a visit, and was allowed to hand pick the best of the best that he had. It was quite a privilege but I did always pay a bit of a premium for the extra consideration. I won’t go into the history or features of this rifle because I believe that if you are looking at this then you already know what it is and realize that the 36/51 was imported in far less quantitiy than the MAS 36 making it more rare from the get go. Then finding one of these today isn’t easy to begin with let alone one in this type of superior condition. It’s just about as good as there is and it’s never had a shot fired. The numbers on the buttstock, receiver, bolt and floor plate match. Then as you might expect the bore is in new condition without a speck of dirt, discoloration or corrosion. It comes with it’s original sling and slip on rubber recoil pad that made launching a grenade more manageable.  I also have two boxes of 7.5x54 ammo that will be included in the sale.I’m asking $750 for this beautiful rifle and it has to be a FTF sale with a Florida Resident of legal age. Rifle can be inspected and picked up in the Brandon area with proper notice. I cannot ship at this time so please don’t ask and I won’t reply if you do. Shipping firearms is difficult and time consuming for private collectors today plus it’s the game all of the scammers with their bogus cashier checks and money orders try to play. So just don’t bother as the Good Lord gave me a brain therefore your BS scams won’t work with me. I accept American cash money only and will provide a proper bill of sale. I have more pictures that I can send to those who are seriously interested. Thank you."

Research Beretta J92M9A3M for exact features.Based on military feedback, Beretta has designed another member of the M9 family, the M9A3 9mm pistol. The M9A3 delivers all of the critical features that today's combat professionals require in demanding environments.The redesigned pistol features a reduced-circumference grip, universal slide design with a universal sadfety decocker , an extended threaded barrel, a beveled magazine well, oversize mag-release button, a 3-slot Picatinny rail, front and back strap checkering, reduced circumference grip with thin grip panels as well as a wrap-around backstrap grip (included, not installed), and 3 (17rd) - sand-resistant magazine for maximum firepower.The M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law enforcement and consumers demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to perform exceptionally in any tactical or home defense situation. Proudly made in the U.S.A.M9A3: Evolution of the Tactical-Pistol ConceptWith the M9A3 semiauto pistol, Beretta has created a coming-together of all the tactical and functional features that today’s combat professionals may require. From Vertec-style thin grip to universal slide design, from a beveled magazine well to oversize mag-release button, from a 3-slot built-in Picatinny rail to high-capacity capability for maximum firepower, the M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law-enforcement and VIP-protection professionals demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to be perfect for any tactical use, including home- and personal defense, tactical competitions as well as duty carry in any condition. Vertec-Style Thin Grip for Instinctive PointabilityThe Vertec-style vertical grip of the M9A3 offers two very important benefits. Its vertical configuration makes it easy to point the handgun to where one would normally point the index finger of the dominant hand. This instinctive pointing is highly prized by tactical shooters and makes for consistent--and consistently-accurate--target acquisition. Also, the grips are thin in spite of being able to accommodate a double-stack, high-capacity magazine. This makes trigger-reach simple even for those with smaller hands, besides offering a more compact profile for those carrying the M9A3 concealed. All this, plus the crisp checkering on the front- and backstrap as well as removable wraparound grip, make any combat hold simple and consistent. Versatility and easy AccessorizationrEasy to Use and MaintainThe M9A3 was designed to be used in the heat of combat. For this reason, Beretta has put a generous bevel at the magazine well, so that tactical magazine changes may be performed quickly and easily with one hand, regardless of lighting conditions. Along the same lines, the magazine-release button is oversized, making it simple to use when seconds count even while wearing gloves. And the M9A3 is low-maintenance thanks to its hyper-resistant FDE finish that is practically impervious to the elements, sand-resistant magazines 17 rounds, and intuitive tool-free disassembly. Whether it’s on duty, at home, for concealed carry or at the range, the M9A3 will always give you the absolute best of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and long history serving the needs of professionals the world over.Caliber: 9mm Luger -Barrel: 5.2"" threaded -Tan Slide & Frame -Polymer Grip -3-slot picatinny rail -Beveled magazine well -Removable fixed night sights -Three, sand-resistant 17-round magazines -Overall Weight: 35.2 oz.UNIVERSAL SAFETY DECOCK LEVERS"
