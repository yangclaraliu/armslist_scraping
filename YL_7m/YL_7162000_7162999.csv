Comes with 2 six round mags. Shows very little signs of being shot. My guess is a safe queen.Sig Code is as follows:220CO-45-SAS2TP220, Compact, .45, 2-Tone, Slite, SRTSo, this version comes with the Sig nightsights and the SRT (Short Reset Trigger). Date of birth on the box lists it as 15-Jun-2011. The SAS is the “dehorned” model meaning all the sharp edges to catch during carry have been smoothed over.This is the BiTone model, not the SAS2B which is the all ""blued"" version. The bitone model seems to be scarce. I cannot find any actively for sale nor any that have been sold in the past on GunBroker. So, please keep this in mind when offering up trades.Only real flaw I can find is shown on the 3rd pic where some of the blackening on the barrel edge is gone. However, the gun shows very little wear and would be a great addition to someone’s Sig collection.For trades, am open to many items. Calibers if interest are:9mm, 10mm, .357 Mag, .45.223, .308, 30-06, .348 Winchester, .375 H&H, 6.5 Grendel, .458 SOCOMHowever, things that really interest are:1911sOther Sigs (especially with E2 grips or ones that E2 grips can fit).357 RevolversIf the only thing you have to trade is a tall stack of $20s, shoot me an offer :)"

The rear sight has a couple small nicks, I think the gun had a scope on it before I purchased it and I assume the rear sight was probably laying around somewhere as the gun has no nicks like the rear sight. I do not have box, just gun as pictured. I shot it one time at gun range, one ragged hole at 25yards with winchester white box.

We start with one of our popular single shot rifles, then hand fit a shotgun barrel to create the Matched Pair. The result is a highly reliable rifle with adjustable sights and a button rifled barrel for enhanced accuracy, which quickly swaps barrels to become your favorite shotgun. This makes the Matched Pair the perfect gun for hunting or a fun day at the range. Available combinations are listed below. Change Barrels Faster Than You Can Change Your Mind To change barrels, make sure the firearm is unloaded. Loosen the front swivel and remove the forend and swivel. Open the action and insert the barrel, replace forend, tighten the swivel and you are done and ready to shoot. One screw, one minute, no tool, no kidding!"

It is chambered for 3"" shells in 20 gauge. It is the compact version so the length of pull is 13"" compared to a typical 14"" or above. The barrel is also a 24"" which is shorter compared to the more traditional 26"" or 28"" shotguns. It functions flawlessly. I've had about 200 or so rounds through it with no malfunctions just using cheap birdshot. Selling it because I personally can't shoot it very well because it doesn't fit me very well and it isn't adjustable in any way. The stock is black sythetic and would make a great light gun to give to a smaller statured person or a kid. Comes with the three standard chokes it comes with stock which are improved cylinder, full, and modified as well as an additional Carlson's skeet choke I bought for it."

The G43 is the most highly desired and anticipated release in GLOCKs history. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It's ultra-concealable, accurate and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols. This gun is made in the USA and for $50 more I'll sell an alien gear IWB hipster and a self defense ammo. Also open to trade for bear defense .44 magnum of equal value."

It does not have the typical sticky bolt problems. The only negative is that the extractor will need to be replaced but I do have a replacement and does come with it. It is stamped with the CN on the receiver designating it as a sniper rifle, but what makes this rifle unique is it was never drilled for a scope. On most of them you can typically tell where it was welded. Yet on this rifle you can tell that the receiver was not drilled or welded.I really do enjoy shooting this rifle but I have not fired it in over 2 years, so it's time to let it go. The price is pretty firm at $250.00 You will have to sign a bill of sale and show ID. CCW preferred."
