Germany versions are hard to get and very expensive.  The Bulgarian version is supposed to be equal and part compatible with them, unlike the P64, Radon, and other lesser clones that aren't even compatible.This has the desired plum hue to the trigger and the original Soviet style handgrips which were removed from many of these for import and replaced with a shabby black grip.  Still has some grease on it from storage.  Comes complete with a black holster with gun cleaning rod and belt lanyard as well as a brown leather holster.  All appear to be new.  Mix and match the holster to match your attire :)Also included is a variety of ammo.  When buying a new gun, I buy a variety of ammo.  Some to break in with, some to test to find what load the gun likes best.  2ea Tula 92gr FMJ, probably the same stuff the Russians used from their own factory1ea Barnaul Silver Bear 94 grain FMJ1ea Barnaul Brown Bear 94 grain FMJ1 ea Sellier & Bellot 95gr FMJAll 50 rounds per box, 250 rounds totalYou can find an ad on SOG for these showing a retail of $595 for the pistol without accessories and ammo.  You can find them used with the black grips for around $300, but why pay $300 for beat up and the for-import black grip?I don't know if there are more of these to import or this is from the last batch, I just don't know, but they aren't all in this condition, that's for sure!  The pistol, holsters, and ammo retail for about $680NOTE:  Due to excessive spam received in replies to the ads, primarily people phishing for email addresses, I will not reply to a response if you don't provide a phone number, or if I am unable to Google your email address and confirm it is valid."

This was my CCW, and I carried it every day. Holster is extremely comfortable and probably the best holster on the market for IWB. Holster comes with a detachable side car for an extra mag. I have 3 8 round magazines, and 2 15 round magazines. I'd like to sell the gun outright, but I am open to trades.Contact Justin at 651-two eight zero-0062"

Has approximately 300 rounds through it. Has upgraded Apex trigger and NDZ aluminum finger extension on the 7-round magazine.Apex trigger installed by gunsmith at LFI in Johnstown. I have the receipt for that service as well as date of transfer receipt (purchased new online). Includes 3 8-round magazines and 1 7-round magazine. I have all the original paperwork and packaging as well as the stock trigger and base plate. I own two Shields and would like not to. This gun has never been holstered in kydex or leather so the only noticeable wear you’ll see is on the barrel. I am interested in trading for a Glock 43. Would be willing to include $ if you find it necessary. Would be up for selling it but preference a trade for a 43. Must meet at an FFL. Thanks for looking!!RomanREDACTED

Very fun and accurate. MSRP value for this rifle/scope/bipod/Pmag combo is over $1,650 and it’s in immaculate condition! The “used” value is a little over $1,250. So I’m asking $1,200 cash obo or $1,300 trade value."

A 4.25"" bushing barrel allows field strip anywhere, and keeps the weight down when compared to pistols of comparable size with tapered cone barrels. Already loaded with options, we find that most customers want it just the way it is. When it comes time to choose your everyday carry gun there is a lot to consider. You need something that is reliable, accurate, and easy to wear all day. You need something that you can enjoy shooting a lot, because there is no substitute for practice. That's where the T3 comes in. We designed this pistol to be pleasing to the eye, but also to be a workhorse that can stand up to thousands and thousands of rounds. The T3 has the best features for any gun its size. The frame is based on the Officer model, but for those with large hands, it features an extended magazine well that gives you the length you need to get all your fingers on the grip. The extension also serves another function. The hand-cut geometric angles really add to the looks as well. The slide is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a better sight radius. Another consideration is weight. The T3 actually weighs one ounce lighter than most officer size 1911s. This makes the T3 the first choice for an all-day carry pistol. Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eights Night Sights are standard. The mainspring housing, as well as the rear of the slide, are horizontally serrated to match. This feature also helps prevent snags on silk lined jackets and coats that checkering often causes. The top of the slide is also serrated to reduce glare. A Nighthawk Custom lightweight aluminum trigger that has been blacked-out using Cerakote™ breaks between 3.5 and 4 lbs with no creep. When you put all of these features in one package, you come up with the finest carry gun you can own. All you add is practice."
