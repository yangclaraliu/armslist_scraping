I wanted to sort of set this rifle up as a scout rifle. Lost interest. 16 inch chrome lined  barrel. Magpul Zukhov front. Original stock. I hand stippled the Punisher skull on it for fun. Didn't finish the hand grip though. Comes with stock stippled front grip. Shot about 750 rounds out of it. Not one problem. Great rifle. Also comes with the hard case that is pictured and the  6 - 30 round AK magazines that were never used so they are new. I will throw in 190 rounds of steel Russian ammo and a ammo box as well. Don't worry this beast was designed to eat this ammo like butter. This rifle is easily converted to pistol grip style in about a half hour. Everything you see in the picture is yours for $1100. Sorry guys I can't part this out.

These were made only for a short time to complement the model 70. They have the same barrel/action as a model 70. In fact the only difference between the two is that the 670 has a different stock and the 670 does not have a floor plate built in. Mine is a later model with a G serial number. These were the most sought after because of the buttery smooth action. Many custom built bench rifles have been built off the these G serial number models. This one shoots great and comes with a sling and a scope on it.

Priced very low. Complete package. Sighted in and accurized. Leupold VX 2 3-9X40The Accura® MR rifle is CVA’s top-of-the-line muzzleloader. This rifle offers a higher level of performance and more specialized features than other CVA muzzleloaders. The Accura MR Nitride model provides a level of accuracy performance that is unequaled by any muzzleloader on the market today – due to its custom, premium quality, Bergara barrel. These Bergara barrels, are made from high quality 416 grade stainless steel, have quickly become recognized as the most accurate production barrels in the world. And while many of the world's most highly regarded center-fire manufacturers use Bergara barrels on their guns, only CVA offers them in a muzzleloader. It is these Bergara barrels that enable CVA to guarantee their ACCURA series rifles to be ""The Most Accurate Muzzleloader You've Ever Shot -- Or Your Money Back."" The Accura MR Nitride rifle features a nitride treated barrel that's meant to take mountain rifle to a new level—making it the closest thing to a “corrosion-proof” muzzleloader that has ever been developed. The technique used to treat the barrels is known as Salt Bath Nitride. Already used in military applications, the nitride process hardens the outer layer of steel, making it more durable and more corrosion resistant than chrome—which was previously the highest standard in bore toughening techniques. Unlike exterior ceramic coatings, the nitride process penetrates the outside and the inside of the barrel, and can withstand thousands of shots.The Accura MR is designed to fit a wide range of shooters with its compact size. The MR provides just the right combination of balance and maneuverability for the rifle's intended purpose. The Accura is simplistic in operation because the breeching lever is built right into the trigger guard, making the Accura one of the easiest opening break-actions on the market. This gun can be disassembled by removing a single screw. The MR design sports many of the same features to help you with your hunt, like CVA’s patent-pending Quick-Release Breech Plug (QRBP), the only such breech plug on the market that can be easily removed with your fingers, no breech plug tool needed. The rifle's ergonomically designed stock is fully ambidextrous, and is upgraded with a SoftTouch coating and rubber grip panels, making it both comfortable and secure in the harshest of weather conditions. Finally, each Accura MR model comes standard with a DuraSight® DEAD ON™ one piece scope mount and matching camo Quake® CLAW® Contour Sling."

This is brass cased ammo, that is super reliable and balls-accurate out of my P32 (even with its diminutive sights). The load was discontinued, so there may be some hazy or spotty brass, but function remains the same as if the just come out of the factory. Price per case is $300 (that's roughly $100 CHEAPER than Blazer aluminum is online, and WAY more accurate, I can attest to that). Got a .32? Don't wanna worry about feeding it for the rest of your life and then some? Hit me up! Can provide pics of accuracy and jazz upon request.
