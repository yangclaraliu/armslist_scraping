It also boasts more gain than any other Marshall to date--and that's really saying something!Each of its 4 channels - Clean, Crunch, OD1 & OD2 - are not only completely independent of each other, they all boast 3 Modes, all 12 of which are footswitchable and feature their own unique gain structure. It makes the JVM 4-channel effectively 12 Marshalls in one!The JVM410H amp head has studio-quality digital reverb with a level control for each channel. This is also footswitchable, as are the amp's two Master Volume controls and the Series/Parallel effects loop. Resonance and Presence are equipped with master controls.Even though the head and combo both house 28 controls and 8 LED switches on their front panels, they're incredibly simple to understand because of the extremely logical layout. Each of the 4 channels has the usual suspects when it comes to controls - Volume, Bass, Middle, Treble & Gain--accounting for 20 of the 28 controls right away. Take away the 4 reverb controls and you're only left with 4 Master controls--2 Master Volumes plus Resonance & Presence.Add to this an ingenious footswitch (UK patent pending) and the fact all the amp's switching (channel/modes, Reverb, Master Volume selection, FX loop) can be done via MIDI and you're looking at an incredibly flexible amp! The 6-way footswitch boasts 7 LEDs and memory, plus it connects to the amp via a regular guitar cable.From the cleanest clean to the filthiest distortion ever found in a Marshall and all points in-between, the JVM410H all-valve amp head will give you whatever tone you need right when you need it.JVM410H Tube Amp HeadIn a nutshell, the Marshall all-valve, 4-channel JVM410H 100-Watt tube head is the most versatile Marshall amplifier ever made.

Guitar plays and sounds amazing. Body in beautiful shape.______________________________________________________________________________________Jackson QuicksilverThe Jackson Pro King V KV solidbody electric guitar is primed for modern hard rock and metal! As soon as you pick up a KVMG Pro Series King V, you know you have an aggressive instrument in your hands, with a fast-playing maple neck, a string-through-body design, and beefy tones (thanks to two Seymour Duncan TB-6 Distortion Mayhem humbucking pickups). The oil-finished neck plays fast and smooth, and the ebony fingerboard is adorned with cool shark fin inlays. For sonic intensity and exceptional playability, you'll definitely want to check out the Jackson Pro King V KV.Jackson Pro King V KV Solidbody Electric Guitar at a Glance:• Neck-through design for monumental sustain• Optimized fretboard provides comfort and serious speed• Wide range of tones from a pair of Seymour Duncan pickupsNeck-through design for monumental sustainThe Jackson Pro King V KV owes its great tone and sustain in part to something you won't even notice at first glance: a neck-through body design. The oil-finished, through-body maple neck doesn't just join the body; it's actually part of the body! This configuration contributes to sustain in a big way, since the entire guitar is structurally integrated. Jackson employs a string-through-body design that also bolsters sustain.Optimized fretboard provides comfort and serious speedWhat plays faster than the Jackson Pro King V KV's ebony fretboard with 12""-16"" compound radius? Not much! The radiused fretboard makes it easier to form chords close to the nut and is flatter up the neck for faster lead lines. Down low, your fretting hand will appreciate the 12"" radius that keeps things nice and comfortable for natural, relaxed chord work. Up top, a 16"" radius lays it all out flat for effortless, low-action, high-speed runs with monumental string bends without fretting out. In other words, it's effortless to switch between rhythm and lead playing on the Pro King V KV. It's this kind of playability that has made the compound-radius fretboard a favorite at Sweetwater.Wide range of tones from a pair of Seymour Duncan pickupsThe Jackson Pro King V KV comes equipped with a pair of direct-mount Seymour Duncan TB-6 Distortion Mayhem pickups for high-octane performance. Why direct-mount pickups? The additional contact with the body results in increased tonal transfer. Master volume and tone controls give you tonal control over all three pickup positions, and the Jackson Pro King V KV sports a hot enough output to make any amp scream!Jackson Pro King V KV Solidbody Electric Guitar Features:• A powerful combination of a fast-playing design and the full-bodied tone of Seymour Duncan pickups• Excellent sustain from a mahogany body, maple neck, ebony fretboard, and string-through-body design• Oil-finished neck has a comfortable, well-worn feel• Compound-radius fretboard plays fast and smooth• Seymour Duncan TB-6 Distortion Mayhem humbuckers for huge tone• Comes with case"

Has been my favorite pistol for quite some time and currently my carry pistol. It comes with the factory Glock .40 barrel, a Lone Wolf .357 sig conversion barrel, a Lone Wolf 9mm conversion barrel, high rise right hand OWB leather holster, and three magazines. It also has a BT Guide Rod upgrade and a grip plug in the bottom of the frame/grip. Two of the three magazines have grip/capacity extenions. Of course it comes with the normal factory Glock case and kit. I usually keep most of my carry items near stock but on these sub compacts I feel the guide rod is a must-needed upgrade, especially for the hotter .357 sig. The trigger is stock and so is frame(no stippling or grinding). I bought the 357 sig for velocity with a short barrel and the 9mm for cheap practice. Ended up never really using the 9mm barrel after I started reloading my .40. I paid 110.00 each for the conversion barrels and 54.00 for the BT Guide Rod. I will throw in whatever 357 sig ammo I have left, know its not much, but know I have Hornady .357 sig defense ammo for carry.https://btguiderods.com/category/glock/g26-27-33/Glock= 450Lone Wolf 357 conversion= 110Lone Wolf 9mm conversion= 110BT Guide Rod= 54.00Leather thumb break holster RT Hand= 40.00Just the basics totals 764.00, I would assume 700 is a fair trade value.I do not mind adding cash to balance the trade as long as its reasonable and your item is known to be of higher value(as I know some are below).

Numbers in Farsi match on barrel, receiver, stock and bolt handle. Bolt and stock are marked correctly with factory acceptance stock. Lion stamp on receiver is sharp, along with serial number stampings on stock and inscription on receiver. In full disclosure: Bore is rated as good, with sharp lands and grooves but does show moderate frosting. Rifle has been refinished at some point and does show evidence of refinishing to include restain, light sanding and reblue. I installed a reproduction sling with buckle. I also installed a replacement rear leaf spring/ rear sight pin and cleaning rod. Leaf spring and rear sight pin are authentic BRNO parts and correct for the rifle. The cleaning rod is the correct length and came from a Yugo 48. The safety cocking knob must be pulled out slightly for the safety lever to rotate to the safe position. I didn't want to replace the part as the cocking knob is correct to the gun and factory marked. Please have checked by a competent gunsmith. Those choosing to pay with paypal will incur 3% mark up to cover Pay Pal fee. Please let me know if you need any more pics or would like to discuss on the phone. This is a very nice rifle for a Mauser collector and a real gem for any Mauser enthusiast."

I just have no use for it whatsoever.I bought it used, so the previous owner may have put more rounds downrange. I got it as you see it, with polymer stock (maybe a Choate?) and upper handguard piece, and a 30-rd steel magazine. It has the dulled ""spike-style"" bayonet. The sights are straight and dead-on accurate at least out to 100yds.Selling it for $250; seems like Norinco SKS are going for about $300 or so these days, with the stock wood furniture. Trade value of $400.I'll include the case. On this one, I'm open to offers. What do you have sitting in your safe you don't want?Please be over 21, legal to own a firearm, be willing to sign a Bill of Sale (unless you're a CHL holder). F2F preferred in/near Katy area."
