Light, powerful and technically advanced, the Millennium PRO is the choice for concealment and back-up carry.Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
 Comes with everything aas new including the hard case, cleaning brush, and mag loader. Cash only. Prefer to meet inside Shooters. You can test fire it if you wish.The only trades I am looking for is a Ruger Old Army black powder pistol or a .556x45 AK. Preferably the Zastava M90NP."

Each magazine I have ordered from ASC I have had to send back due to the rounds nose diving I side of the mag. This is a SHTF gun and it has been well taken care of. Maybe 200 rounds through the barrel.  The barrel is actually bear creak arsenal which is .making a name for themselves in the barrel market.  Will be willing to trade for a well made well taken care of ak47 My mags will be included but not my flashlight as seen in pictures. Double point sling adapter in the rear as I only run single point sling. Looks better in person and not heavy at all. NO DUAT COVER INSTALLED. IF YOU WANT IT I WILL GIVE THE PARTS.

$750 firm in cash or will look at trades.
If offering a trade, let me know the details.  +/- cash trade offers also OK.  Mostly into semi-autos, but let me know what you have and the deal.  Also, I have lots of AR's already, but will consider another quality rifle.

Stock, foregrip, rail, Magpul flip sights, etc. It's had about 25 rounds through it. This one gets a lot of compliments and is a fun display piece that you can take out a shoot any time. A lot of people have refer to it as a ""Halo"" gun. Still just as reliable as any Remington shotgun should be.  It's been to the range, shooting in the woods, and even deer hunting a couple times. Badges on the rail are easily removed with an allen key. The stock is spring-loaded and has a thick soft pad to reduce the impact of recoil quite a bit. Would even feel comfortable letting my 9 year old shoot this. May consider a trade, just let me know what you have to offer (guns or other items). Have over $800 into it. If you offer me something dumb like a stereo system don't expect a reply. Full asking price gets a hard case included. Please don't offer me anything on trade that isn't equal value. Display stands are not included. Can reply to this ad via email, or text REDACTED."

People typically love (or hate) the RTF2 frame. Glock every now and then will do a special run of the frames but not the slides. When they do they put a premium price on them. Both have factory Glock night sights. The 90% one went to the Glock factory in Jan 2016 for the night sights and they also replaced all of the internals.

Please make sure to ask any questions on condition or request photos of specific areas of the gun prior to bidding if you have any concerns. I have tried to include information as accurate as possible in this listing but please verify if anything seems out of order or needs clarification.Firearm is in excellent condition from consults - considered to be greater than 85% valuation for KBB standards with conservative estimate. The Krag–Jørgensen is a repeating bolt action rifledesigned by the Norwegians Ole Herman Johannes Krag and Erik Jørgensen in the late 19th century. It was adopted as a standard arm by Denmark, the United States of America and Norway. About 300 were delivered to Boer forces of the South African Republic.A distinctive feature of the Krag–Jørgensen action was its magazine. While many other rifles of its era used an integral box magazine loaded by a charger or stripper clip, the magazine of the Krag–Jørgensen was integral with the receiver (the part of the rifle that houses the operating parts), featuring an opening on the right hand side with a hinged cover. Instead of a charger, single cartridges were inserted through the side opening, and were pushed up, around, and into the action by a spring follower.The design presented both advantages and disadvantages compared with a top-loading ""box"" magazine. A similar claw type clip would be made for the Krag that allowed the magazine to be loaded all at once, also known as the Krag ""speedloader magazine"". Normal loading was one cartridge at a time, and this could be done more easily with a Krag than a rifle with a ""box"" magazine. In fact, several cartridges can be dumped into the opened magazine of a Krag at once with no need for careful placement, and when shutting the magazine-door the cartridges are forced to line up correctly inside the magazine. The design was also easy to ""top off"", and unlike most top-loading magazines, the Krag–Jørgensen's magazine could be topped up without opening the rifle's bolt. The Krag–Jørgensen is a popular rifle among collectors, and is valued by shooters for its smooth action.Please ask any questions prior to bidding.Firearm is sold as is with no warranty.Please note WV residents must pay 6% sales tax.

There are no Springfield proof marks meaning that Springfield never assembled it and only the drawing number, date and steel batch code are SA. This surprised us and after a few phone calls to elderly collectors and authorities on the Garand we were assured that although unusual and very rare this is a product of sharing or loaning of parts to keep production output unbroken by delays. Parts sharing or use of other manufacturers parts was more common place than most people think but was very poorly documented and it is likely that only a few hundred at the most may have been built this way and even fewer would have survived post war rebuildsThe bore has strong lands and grooves and has been through the rebuild process as there is hard chrome around the gas port .The Gas Plug is a single slot type which is period correct and is most likely a replacement as the blued finish is almost 100%.The Gas Lock is a Winchester and is surely original to the rifle as it is the beveled type and the finish wear matches the gas cylinder.The Gas Cylinder is a genuine Winchester round band, narrow base with the FSMWO diagonal saw cut."
