Would like about half of the value in cash though.  Only straight trade I'd consider would be a pair of 9mm Glocks.I otherwise would like sell it for $950.If interested feel free to call/text three 16 six 19 nine 853, texts preferred.  If you call and I don't answer leave a message.  ""Is this available"" emails will be ignored due to all of the spam lately.Local sales only, I will not ship!Thanks!"

Minor finish wear on the part where you can use a coin to pop off the side cover, but other than that everything looks brand new. This was an open box item originally hence the plain packaging. Asking $580 for the Aimpoint Micro T-2I also have a LaRue 1/3rd lower co-witness QD mount LT660 that the Aimpoint was mounted on. Selling that separately for $80, but willing to make a deal for both sight & mount for $640.Cash/Paypal is fine. NO trades please. Located in west Houston. I am willing to ship for an additional $10 via USPS."

I am asking $200 for the upper or $220 if you would want the rail and foregrip.  I also have the bolt and charging handle that I would include for $290 total.  Please feel free to text me at REDACTED with any questions or offers and I can send more pics as well since I am only allowed to upload one.  I can be free to meet in Terre Haute or Clinton.

It is in rough condition, I would guess about 70% but is an excellent shooter. It has no active rust but the left side has some pitting from old rust and the wood has some scratches. The right side is in pretty good condition. As stated it is an older rifle and the looks certainly does not affect the performance. It operates smoothly and is very accurate and reliable. Considering the condition I am only asking $250 or an equiatble trade value. It would be an excelent gun for youths or others for hunting or for a keeping in a truck rack."
