It utilizes the same design principles as the Walther P38 pistol of World War II fame. the P5 was a more in depth version of the famous Walther P38 and P1 series. Development on the P5 resulted in requests by German police and federal agencies for a new sidearm. Walther engineers decided to use the P1 model as the basis of the P5 and gave it a similar locking system, reinforced frame, and dual recoil springs. In addition, the Walther improved the extractor, shortened the barrel, and increased the slide length. The trigger is a standard double-action/single-action trigger. The slide lock also doubles as the decocker and is located on the left side of the frame. engaging it once will release the slide, a second time will drop the hammer without firing the gun. The Walther P5 Compact is used and comes with original box and papers, two magazines, and the gun comes with the original test target. No trades but will ship."

Color is Black Barrel is 24"" 26"" with the brake.  The Barrett MRAD rifle’s user changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun’s modularity. The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply unscrewing two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, This unique design paves the way for future caliber interchangeability and serviceability at the user level. The Barrett MRAD also boasts Barrett’s new trigger module that is easily accessed for maintenance, adjustment, and replacement. This match grade trigger is drop fire proof and combat ready. The thumb operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the Barrett MRAD rifle’s 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a Picatinny M1913 rail with 20 MOA taper. At 21.75 inches, the rail offers plenty of space for in line night vision devices. Configurable side and bottom rails allow for mounting a number of other accessories. The Barrett MRAD rifle’s stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. When folded, the stock latches around the bolt handle for added security during transport. Because the stock folds to the bolt handle side of the action, the rifle is the same width overall, folded or extended. Made of a temperature resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle to user contact point. The rifle’s length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. From its multi-positional quick-detach sling sockets to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color of the rifle that blends into any environment-every detail of the Barrett MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own.

It is the most accurate 45 I have shot.  Functions flawlessly.  Generally shooter grade BDA45s get around $600-650 and don't come up often.  Extremely clean in box versions fetch $1200-1400.  The boxes alone get $200 empty on the bay.  My best esrimate of value would fall between the $600 and $1200 range. I would need someone with far more expertise than me to determine exactly where in that range. Cabelas had one in similar condition with no box last year for $799 and it sold fairly quickly.  Who knows...maybe they just had someone who couldnt live without it.  The BDA 45 is a grail gun for some Sig and Browning collectors.  I love it. Heck, we both came to this earth in 1978.  However, I prefer more aftermarket upgrade availability and am not one for safe queens.  Saw one at the Lucas gun show yesterday for $895.  You won't find a better shooter. This was loosely based on the Browning Hi Power and was built when quality mattered."

For a 135 year old gun, it appears to be in good functioning condition. I had it checked over by a gunsmith in Scottsdale who only works on the older Winchesters and was advised that it would be safe to fire. Per the Winchester letter the gun was shipped in 1885, and returned to the Winchester factory for repairs on March 29,1910. The barrel measures exactly 20 inches, so it was shortened at some time in the last 135 years. The barrel and receiver have the correct Winchester proof marks and inscriptions. The Winchester letter will be included with the gun.Also included is a period correct (I was told), four piece cleaning rod that was in the butt stock when I received the rifle years ago. The bore is fair to average,and could use a good cleaning. At a starting price of $500, I believe this to be a low cost entry into a really neat old Winchester. I am not an expert on Winchesters and have tried to describe this as accurately as possible......."

The ramrod is NOT original I picked up a dowel-rod and stained to match. It does have a brass decorative peice missing on side of the stock. I didn't want to replace it. Although it’s easy to make and replace.  There was a repair to a small crack by the lock at some point before I owned it. Although it’s VERY solid and was never an issue. It’s 160-170 years old. I Wanted to leave in orginal state. History- This gun was HAND made. All the screws, pins, locks, hammer, barrel, and stock. Nipple is original and wide open to the breach. All screws are original and locktite down. It was originally made as a target bench rifle with a tubular sight confirming the 2 holes and mount holder on the top of the barrel but was removed long ago. (Judging by the patina) This gun is fully operational and shoots exactly as it did in the mid 1800's. I have shot it many times and riflings are excellent and its still a very very accurate rifle, Bore and nipple cleaned for storing. Lock has markings traced to Philidelphia lock maker in between 1850-1860.. The lock is marked R & W.C. Biddle & Co. Philadelphia. This firm was a hardware store and was noted for importing or making hardware, gun locks, and barrels. Barrel is marked with T + F, in German script, believed to be Thomas Fenner, he was a gun maker from Philidephia Penn. 1829-1860 Pre-civil war. More than likely the tubular sight was removed prior to the civil war (If the gun was to used in the field) The barrel does have 13 tick marks on the side of the barrel (under the rear sight). Not sure if these were kills or marrking for something else. If the gun could speak I am sure it would have many stories. I will throw in some lead balls to go with the rifle. I am willing to part with the old dog for the right deal. I have seen these priced 700-3500$ Hard to price history - Im not wanting to break the bank just a fair trade and hoping to send to a good home. I am open to trades for other firearms. I am looking for a Glock 19 gen 4/5, Browning Hi-power, or a decent 1911. email or text 918-4o2-o854"

930,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7534930,For Sale:  CZ75 Compact Custom SA Target Pistol LN,"Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama",$ 850,"Listed On: Saturday, November 4, 2017",Handguns,CZ USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"""SOLD"" Pending Funds! This is a Custom CZ75 Compact all steel model (slide and frame) with a rail 9mm pistol, that was converted to SA trigger for extreme target shooting or for competitive shooting tournaments. All custom work was done at Cajun Gun Works, LLC. (see pic of work done.) All mods that were made to enhance the shooter's mind set of reliability, accuracy, and ergonomics for more accurate target shooting with a SA (Single Action) pistol. This pistol is extremely accurate, and rivals some of the best 1911 SA pistols made, for a lot less than 1/3 the cost of those custom pistols. I don't shoot that much any more, (extreme wrist pain from arthritis) so I just decided to see if some other gun enthusiast might be interested in this great gun. I'm selling off quiet a few of my guns, so ask if you don't see what you want, and I just might have what you are looking for, and willing to part with it. This gun is still like new, and comes with everything that it came with from the Custom Shop, and has all the stock parts returned, just incase you want to quickly convert back to DA/SA trigger action. Using a CGW's video it is about a 1/2 hour job. Shown with Red custom metal grips, and also comes with the two tone Grey and Black grips as well. This single action (SA) trigger group operates just like any 1911 and can be carried cocked and locked, if so desired. It will be of much lesser weight, and a lot less in shooting cost as a 9mm vs. a 1911 .45 acp. With the newer 9mm +P+ hollow point ammo, there is not enough difference in knock down power from the .45 acp than a good quality 9mm, and this gun carries (14) rounds in mags and (1) in the barrel. That is a lot more 'party favors' for the bad guys over 1911 .45 acp's. The CZ's design is the most copied and proven design semi-automatic pistol in the world. It's inverted slide rails to frame, automatically makes it inherently more accurate than the 1911 design. When 'accurized' like this gun, it becomes a phenomenally accurate and reliable side arm. The lower profile and lower bore axis, makes for a softer shooting 9mm than most every other 9mm pistol. That makes for faster and more accurate second shots for double taps. As wonderful as this pistol is to hold and look at, the best experience comes once you hit the shooting range. Whether if you are shooting standard or +P+ loads, this gun handles recoil beautifully. The grip frame spreads the recoil evenly across the web of your hand, and between the textured grip panels and the beavertail, the pistol stays centered in your grasp. Between the recoil handling aspects and the pistols short reset trigger and being (SA), it sure makes for easier and more accurate follow-up shots. Your eye instantly picks up the light gathering (green) front fiber optic sight. As far as accuracy goes, if you like all of your rounds to produce one ragged hole in the target, then you will really like firing this Cajun Gun Works Customized CZ75 Compact SA 9mm. This is almost a give away at only $850 with factory case and three mags (two mags of 14 rounds each and 1 mag that holds 17 rounds, and comes with two sets of custom grips.) Grips were $76 each by themselves. See list of Custom gun-smithing work from CGW, LLC. that cost $720 which did not include the price of the gun, which was $550, that was bought elsewhere and sent to CGW, LLC. That's about $1270 worth of gun for my price of only $850. Trade value would be higher of course. I don't need to sell any of my guns, I will run out of time before I run out of money. I'm 71 yo and have bought and sold more than a few guns in my life time, so I know a little bit about gun values. It is one beautiful gun, and actually looks better in person. Will ship to your FFL dealer with proper payment. But, I would prefer a FTF transaction here in Huntsville, AL. 35806. I have an A+ rating on gunbroker.com as a private gun owner as both a seller and a buyer. I will require a signed Bill Of Sale to an Alabama resident of legal age, on a FTF transaction.
