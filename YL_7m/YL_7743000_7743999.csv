The extras are accessories included: what is in the pictures, over $240 worth, including Sticky pocket holster,$25; Kydex quick draw trigger/laser guard cover,$10; 2 +1 mag extensions,$20; extra mag from another LCP; Techna belt clip, $25; laser,$150; not in pictures: 150 rounds of target ammunistion and about 18 rounds of Sig Sauer holliow points.After receiving payment, I'm willing to ship this to your FFL in state or out of state for an additional $25. I accept money order payments and cash on delivery locally. A local buyer must be 21 years old and ahve a valid Florida ID and be legal to purchase a firearm in the state and willing to sign a bill of sale.Pistol: I broke it in firing it 100s of times using Tipton brand spring loaded snap caps and it has not more than 300 rounds of target ammo through it. This pistol shoots better than new because i broke it in and modified the trigger surface as well as the stupid one dot sight that can't be seen in daylight or dark. The result is that it is more comfortable, esier to see and better to shoot than original. I repaintedthe sights with red and yellow fingernail polish so that they can be seen, at least in the daylight.It has some rust on the slide all ready. Also, rounded off the stupid square corners of the OEM red finished, aluminum trigger and painted it black, some of which chipped off (see picture). but I (ust touched uup the trigger after taking the pictures).It comes with 2 OEM Ruger 6 rd mags with +1 floor plates for mag capacity of 7 rds each mag.The breaking in greatly reduced the pressure needed to pull the trigger as well as fire it. This breaking in did not harm the function of the pistol. It also made the slide a bit easier to pull back.Note that I have bought tried the Ruger LCP, LCP2 & B. THough these LCP mags work in it , it won't cycle and fire the 7th round. The LCP Custom has a nicer (operating) trigger than ANY of the others and more capacity than all but the LCP because it is the same gun, same capacity exc ept for the trigger. The Beretta, brand new, wouldn't reload after firing! All the LCPOs I've had fired reliably and accurately out of the box.

It' just sat on my rifle and I've never even sighted it in. The optical clarity is fantastic! I own a few fairly highend optics (Razor Gen II 1-8x & 5-24x, Acogs, Accupower) and I can confidently say this optic does not disappoint. It definitely surpasses the Gen II Viper pst. Its pretty comparable to the NF SHV with the Bushnell having a tad better light transmission. I can't really say why I've never used it. It just happened to be mounted on a rifle I rarely used. If it doesn't sell no big deal. I love it. Work has been slow and I've had to the whole month of December off. Being that it' the holidays I figured I'd try and make a little extra money. I think $600 extremely reasonable considering they still sell for $1k. I'm always open to trades even if it' something of higher quality I may be able to come up with the difference on my end even though the only reason I'm posting is because money is tight, lol.

He's more into archery and  I've recently gotten into precision shooting so I don't need a trainer. It has a little bit if rounds through it, maybe 500. It looks and feels brand new. It has a lot of nice features including an adjustable trigger. I currently have a Viper PST GEN I  mounted on it and I'd like to sell as a package. I payed close to  $600 for the rifle and over $550 for the optic. I think  $750 is more than fair considering the the rifle is brand new and you'e actually unable to pick up the Gen I PST. A lot including myself prefer the Gen I over the II. FFP MRAD and their value has started to skyrocket.

Research Beretta J92M9A3M for exact features.Based on military feedback, Beretta has designed another member of the M9 family, the M9A3 9mm pistol. The M9A3 delivers all of the critical features that today's combat professionals require in demanding environments.The redesigned pistol features a reduced-circumference grip, universal slide design with a universal sadfety decocker , an extended threaded barrel, a beveled magazine well, oversize mag-release button, a 3-slot Picatinny rail, front and back strap checkering, reduced circumference grip with thin grip panels as well as a wrap-around backstrap grip (included, not installed), and 3- sand-resistant magazine for maximum firepower.The M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law enforcement and consumers demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to perform exceptionally in any tactical or home defense situation. Proudly made in the U.S.A.M9A3: Evolution of the Tactical-Pistol ConceptWith the M9A3 semiauto pistol, Beretta has created a coming-together of all the tactical and functional features that today’s combat professionals may require. From Vertec-style thin grip to universal slide design, from a beveled magazine well to oversize mag-release button, from a 3-slot built-in Picatinny rail to high-capacity capability for maximum firepower, the M9A3 was designed to deliver the performance that military, law-enforcement and VIP-protection professionals demand. In short, this combat pistol was designed to be perfect for any tactical use, including home- and personal defense, tactical competitions as well as duty carry in any condition. Vertec-Style Thin Grip for Instinctive PointabilityThe Vertec-style vertical grip of the M9A3 offers two very important benefits. Its vertical configuration makes it easy to point the handgun to where one would normally point the index finger of the dominant hand. This instinctive pointing is highly prized by tactical shooters and makes for consistent--and consistently-accurate--target acquisition. Also, the grips are thin in spite of being able to accommodate a double-stack, high-capacity magazine. This makes trigger-reach simple even for those with smaller hands, besides offering a more compact profile for those carrying the M9A3 concealed. All this, plus the crisp checkering on the front- and backstrap as well as removable wraparound grip, make any combat hold simple and consistent. Versatility and easy AccessorizationrEasy to Use and MaintainThe M9A3 was designed to be used in the heat of combat. For this reason, Beretta has put a generous bevel at the magazine well, so that tactical magazine changes may be performed quickly and easily with one hand, regardless of lighting conditions. Along the same lines, the magazine-release button is oversized, making it simple to use when seconds count even while wearing gloves. And the M9A3 is low-maintenance thanks to its hyper-resistant FDE finish that is practically impervious to the elements, sand-resistant magazines in 15 or 17 rounds, and intuitive tool-free disassembly. Whether it’s on duty, at home, for concealed carry or at the range, the M9A3 will always give you the absolute best of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and long history serving the needs of professionals the world over.Caliber: 9mm Luger -Barrel: 5.2"" threaded -Tan Slide & Frame -Polymer Grip -3-slot picatinny rail -Beveled magazine well -Removable fixed night sights -Three, sand-resistant 17-round magazines -Overall Weight: 35.2 oz.UNIVERSAL SAFETY DECOCK LEVERS"

I purchased it new, can’t remeber if I’ve ever shot it and it’s never really been carried I just prefer my Kahr 380. Comes with two extra mags (4 total), they all have finger extensions. Also comes with three desantis holsters (nemesis pocket holster, ankle holster, ankle mag pouch). Has everything that came with it from factory. Need to see INDL and LTCH (nothing recorded) would prefer to meet on northeast side of Indy but willing to drive around 465 loop for the right deal. $500 OBO. ONLY trades I’m interested in are a Gen4 or newer G17/G19. I’m got cash to add if you have additional mags or holsters. Text preferred (317) four 0 seven 99 five three. Merry Christmas"
