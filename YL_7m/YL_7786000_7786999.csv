Then I started to customize it and that's where the Cerakote and Magpul furniture came from. To me the normal 870 looked very plain, so I thought why not make this one as functional as I could. I went with Cerakote cause it is proven to be the best coat to resist basically everything from scratching to rust & corrosion. The polymer that Magpul uses is undoubtably high-quiality as well, and it has a slightly better recoil absorbsion factor. It is also FAR more ergonomic then the stock furniture. I still have the box and all the add ons for the Magpul parts (basplates, etc). I also thought the capacity was a little low, so I added a magazine tube extension (bringing it up to an 8 round capacity). That tube is pictured and it is also Cerakoted. I also felt the need to add a sling mount on the forend cause with the stock having one, I didn't think it would be right not to have one. I took very good care of this while I owned it, and I have not had one issue with it at all. The reason why I would like to sell it is because I am currently in college and I never get the time to use it sadly. It's very hard to let go, but I'm hoping to get it to someone who will like it as much as I did. *I am including the case with the purchase along with the 2 boxes of ""Royal Buck""I am open to trades:Glock 19 (Gen 3 and up)Glock 43 Sig Sauer P320 (SUBCOMPACT-MEDIUM GRIP)"

The barrel is a 1-8 Wilson Combat 20 in thread pitch on it is 1/2 by 28 and is been a terrific Barrel. The trigger is a CMC single stage 3 and 1/2 pound and this gun has no recoil or at least such little that at 200 yards my scope picture does not move so you can do multiple shots and make that steel ringer jump around. For those that don't know 223 Wylde will shoot standard 223 or the high pressure 556 with greater accuracy. If you've ever ran a rod down a556 bore and then did it with this one you don't want to sit this one has a much tighter chamber tolerance and that shows up in accuracy. The real on the bottom is a 15 and a half yhm t style rail with a rib to bottom it's very comfortable.

If your primer doesn't fire because of the cold or whatever, you can squeeze the trigger again and the firing pin will hit the primer again.   It comes with a $35 hybrid leather /kydex holster, talon grips, and extra mag (pro mag).   Why pay for a gun, then have it shipped($30) and then pay a transfer fee($25)? Buy it from me instead. : )  Must be willing to meet in person and fill out a bill of sale while flashing me you cwp or id. Thanks for your time."

The PX4 Storm SD (Special Duty) was developed to meet the very demanding requirements of the original 45 caliber JCP (Joint Combat Pistol) specifications issued by SOCOM. It utilizes state-of-the-art materials and finishes for superior weather resistance capable of withstanding the toughest weather and military conditions. The manual lever safety and slide stop lever are both ambidextrous while the magazine release button is reversible. The SD features a distinctive dark earth-colored fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame with a Mil Std-1913 Picatinny rail and matching interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit. The Px4 SD features locked breech action with a rotating barrel system, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. Its extended, chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and features a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. The PX4 Storm SD comes with three magazines, a 9-round flush fit and two 10-round extended, all with a special PVD corrosion-resistant, high lubricity finish. This model comes with a threaded barrel and a heavy-duty custom-fitted waterproof case with a FDE finish.

I bought the limited edition in 2013. I am deciding to let one go. At one time I had 3 of them. I shot a lot of deer with this bow. Not very often you see the green optifade. It has a lot of gray accent to it that is nice for matching to the bark when you don't have any foliage. Favorite camo patterns are the mossy oak treestand or the realtree hardwoods.Original limbs. You can get a hold of Barnsdale Archery to get limbs replaced if you ever need them. My limited edition only has a loop on it and I have tugged it back here and there. You can get the limbs for about $150. You can still get the cams from Bowtech. Adjustable draw length. Bow comes dry.Rest is negotiable but would rather keep the accessories. The string is brand new and have only put a few hundred shot through it. No frays or anything. Not sure if I am doing the right thing. But I have some other financial things that need to be taken care of. This Destroyer is great for someone that can use a speed bow that I don't think has been surpassed by any other bow. I have seen some of the videos of the new stuff and nothing really impresses me. I paid about $1100 plus tax for this bow. Going to set the price at $600 obo. Please see the pictures to see it was well taken care of. I always tie to the cams and they do not have any scratches on them. I have kept bow covered with a Primos case. I have found that I get about 6 3/4"" brace height by using the modified grips rather than the stock ones that came with the destroyer. For the money you are getting a great bow, fast bow, and an accurate bow. Nothing surpasses this for FPS right now. This is probably why they came out with the limited edition - two many people were complaining that they didn't have anything to offer this year. I don't really want to get rid of it, but I have another one and if can help someone out that can't afford to spend $1200 on a new one. Call with any questions. Thank you for your intetest."
