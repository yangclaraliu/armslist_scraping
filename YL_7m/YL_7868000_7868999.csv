Now is the time to start making phone calls. Call the Legislative Message line at 1-REDACTED and tell them that your message is for ""All the members of the House Judiciary Committee"" and your message is ""Give HB 210 a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee and send it to the floor with a favorable report"". I have spoken to many senators and representatives that are pro-gun and want such bills to pass, but they say that Kentuckians just don't call in support, and the voices of opposition outnumber the few who call. So if you want to not only protect our gun rights, but advance them, you need to call and make your voice heard to your representative. A right not exercised is lost. Hell, get your friends and family to call also!The House Judiciary Committee is Chaired by Joe Fischer. Representative Fischer is a fair and honorable man. He will give the bill a fair hearing if he senses enough support for it. There are some very anti-gun people on that committee that will fight this bill. Expect to see them try to attach several stupid amendments to it. We can win this fight and get this bill passed, but we have to fight and fight smart. This is the first bill we have had in several years that affects all concealed carry licensees. If this passes, the ban on guns will stop on public college campuses, there will no longer be any gun bans in city and county buildings, except detention facilities and court facilities. You would be able to carry at a city council meeting, a Fiscal Court meeting and at a meeting of the General Assembly. The ""mad mommies"" will be up in arms about this bill. They will call day and night. Don't let them ""out call"" us. Get your friends and neighbors to call and everybody call often. Call your individual Representative (http://www.lrc.ky.gov/Find%20Your%20Legislator/Find%20Your%20Legislator.html )and tell them to do all they can to get Chairman Fischer to give this bill a hearing. It has a real chance of passing!I also urge you to oppose HB-31, HR-68, HB-189, and HB-209. HB-31 is a bill that would criminalize leaving firearms unsecured. This is a slippery slope that leads to laws like they have in California, where all guns in a home must be unloaded and locked in a safe and all ammunition is to be locked in a separate safe in another room. HR-68 and HB-189 would remove the Kentucky legislature’s preemptive authority on firearms regulation and let local governments make their own laws.  Such a bill would harm Kentuckians all over the state as they visit Louisville, Lexington, and other cities that hold a less than favorable view on armed citizens. Finally, HB-209 would make anyone convicted of a hate crime prohibited from buying or possessing a firearm. And we all know how loose the standards for labeling something as a “hate crime” are."

The rounds snap in to the moon clips - so they're just as secure as a traditional speed loader. Competition revolver shooters swear by moon clips, because they're such a fast reload.Jerry Miculek can dump 12 rounds (with a reload) in under 3 seconds. (I can do it in about ten.) Insanely fast and smooth action.Chambered in .45 ACP - a powerful round, but without the muzzle climb of a magnum. Extremely comfortable and quick to shoot. Best of all - being a revolver, it will shoot anything you feed it from super expensive, to super cheap steel or aluminum case ammo.Beefy full-lug barrel on the large S&W N-Frame, matte stainless finish, gold-bead Patridge front sight and adjustable rear sight. It's got a 4.1"" barrel, is 9.5"" overall, and weighs in at just over 40oz unloaded.It's in pristine condition with a nice, frosty matte stainless finish, and is laser engraved with the ""Jerry Miculek/Lightning Bolt"" on both the firearm itself and also on the custom wood monogrip.

Great firearm based on the original Sig 551 and more recent Sig 556 designs, it allows training with low cost ammunition on a firearm that shares the same form and controls as its big brothers. It's designed from the ground up as a .22LR and is not some sort of retrofit, and as such it's exceedingly reliable. It's a 16.5"" barrel on a blowback mechanism, and uses full size style .22LR magazines rather than the thin mags found on many other .22LR rifles. They fit into the same style pouches as traditional AR and AK magazines.The gun is the Classic version which has a polymer fore end barrel shroud, full length top picatinny rail and birdcage style barrel flash hider. It also comes with an adjustable length stock which folds, allowing for close quarters usage or compact transport. I have a Bushnell Trophy 1x28mm multi-reticule red dot scope mounted to the top rail. It has red and green backlighting modes with multiple intensities as well as three reticule styles (dot, cross and ring). Very easy to use in any condition and quick acquisition from 1-100 yards.It comes with three 25-round magazines, one Sig Sauer branded Black Dog magazine and two grey CMMC magazines. It also includes a 50-round drum magazine by Black Dog. These are hard to find and usually run about $75 just on their own. Super fun!I also have an additional bull barrel and barrel wrench that will go with it, which allows for more consistent target shooting due to better heat dissipation. I never used it, and there is some very light surface oxidation near the end of the barrel. It's purely cosmetic and hard to notice. I'll try to take some cleaner to it. These usually sell for about $150.All of this fits into the factory hard case, which has the original manual and paperwork that shipped with it. The rifle and scope are in great shape, no notable nicks or scratches. Little bit of powder residue left on the flash hider and some residue on the internals. It's had about 2,000 rounds put through it with only a handful of failures to fire. For 22LR that's pretty great, and the only stuff to give it a spot of grief was bulk Remington Thunderbolts, to the surprise of nobody.These rifles are great firearms and are becoming harder to find. Those who have them tend to keep them, and I'm in no hurry to part with it, but wanted to test the waters.I'm asking $750 OBO for the rifle and all accessories. Hard case, accessories, red dot scope, three magazines plus drum mag and the heavy target barrel. I have a variety of .22LR available separately if you wanted something to shoot along with it, let me know if you need some and we can figure out any additional cost for it.Cash only, local sales only. I can deliver between Anchorage and the valley areas.Thanks!"

232,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7868232,For Sale:  1967 Colt Python 357,"Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California","$ 1,250","Listed On: Tuesday, January 23, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"$1,250 FIRM price. Take it or leave it. Please read this entire description.Colt PTFA Manufacturing Co. Python 357 Magnum revolver. Serial number indicates made in 1967, and thus should be a C&R gun (Curios & Relic). I purchased this gun in 1992. I only took it to the range twice over the years. Works great. Has that smooth feel that you expect from Colt. The reason I’m selling it is because I have too much stuff and would rather have the $$. People in the online forums who have viewed pictures of this gun have told me that they believe that this gun must have been refinished at some point. You be the judge. I am no expert. As you can see it shows quite a bit of wear, but keep in mind that some of these photos are ultra close-ups in discriminating light. The outdoor pictures are actually the best representations of how it looks in person. ( http://investingadvicewatchdog.com/colt.html )No factory box or manual. For questions please email me at REDACTED or call REDACTED (landline). Buyer pays for all fees including DROS, dealer fee if any, plus shipping cost if being shipped (likely via UPS Next Day Air, Fed Ex or USPS Priority Mail). If this gun will be shipped then I plan on using Turner’s Outdoorsman (Torrance, CA) who have recently quoted me a total of $75 including shipping. If you are purchasing in person at an FFL dealer near me (I live in Pacific Palisades, CA) and don’t require shipping, then expect to pay about $25 to $35 for the DROS fee and possibly $7 for a lock if required, although FFL prices and fees may vary. State law(s) may or may not impose a waiting period before a firearm can be released to a purchaser. Payment forms accepted when shipping: Bank cashier’s check or certified check. Payment forms accepted if purchasing in person at FFL dealer: Cash. Please note that your check MUST CLEAR BEFORE I ship. If your check is from a major bank that has a branch near me then I can cash in person at that branch (and thus if cashed and cleared I would then proceed with the FFL transfer process immediately). I ship within the USA only. If this gun is being shipped then you have a 3-day inspection period, assuming you are able to return it to me without legal or shipping restrictions. I spoke to a woman at the California department of justice and was told that because this gun is a collectible (over 50 years old) it is legal to ship out or within California. She also told me that it is also legal to ship it back into California if needed -- This being legal even though the gun is not on California’s roster of approved firearms. If for any reason you are unable to ship the gun back to me (such as due to changes in the law or incorrect understanding of the law(s), due to shipping regulations which prevent return of the gun, etc) then my 3-day inspection period becomes null and void and the sale is final. Also if you are able to return it, you will only be refunded for the sale price of the gun itself, with no refund for DROS fee and shipping (if applicable). Additionally you would be responsible for paying sales tax (if any) which may be imposed by the FFL on having the gun shipped back to California. My Internet research indicates that there should be NO tax imposed by the FFL if shipped back to CA. Please do your own research to be sure. Since I am not a retail seller, I am NOT collecting any sales tax for this sale.If purchasing in person, once you have purchased, the sale is final and there is no “inspection period”. Transaction must take place at an FFL dealer on the West side (near Pacific Palisades).http://investingadvicewatchdog.com/colt.html"

I took it to the range the other day and it cycles well, shoots accurately, and is overall a pretty fun gun. Unfortunately I don't get the chance to shoot shotguns very often, so I'm looking to trade it or sell it. I live in Gettysburg but am willing to drive if you live close by.
