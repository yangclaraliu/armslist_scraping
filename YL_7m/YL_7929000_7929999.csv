Like its legendary FN forefathers, this combat handgun was designed to not only survive the battlefield, but to emerge victorious. It is the latest in technological advancements in handgun engineering, offering .45 ACP performance and a host of unique features that no other handgun can match. Its 15-round magazine is precisely engineered to take a dive to the prone position and naturally roll up toward the target. The checkered polymer frame has a low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil, enhanced operator control, and a grip angle that provides unmatched natural point of aim. Four interchangeable backstraps come standard to quickly customize the grip feel. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous for ease of use. The 5.3″ cold hammer-forged stainless steel barrel has a threaded muzzle to accept sound suppressors, compensators, and other accessories.

I had it on here for  $1400 and the highest offer was  $900 so I liked it better so I kept it. Am I asking too much? I thought it was a bargain at $1400.

Nothing visibly wrong so this could be a quick fix for someone that knows more about camper furnaces. The electric water pump can blow the fuse if other things are turned on. (I never used the water tank, around 10 gal, so this wasn't an issue for me, I only used hose hookup which works just fine with the sink.) Again, probably a quick and easy fix. Cosmetic: It was hailed on at some point many years ago so there are small pings in the roof. Does NOT leak when setup, have not ever had issues in storms. Canvas and roof are great for keeping out the elements. Newer stick on tile flooring over original linoleum, looks okay, some wear already."

Pistol comes with original 7 Rd mag and an additional 7 rounder.The laser itself is visible on a well-lit white wall at 4 yards.   It seems a bit dimmer than I recall,  so I will replace the battery before it's delivered to the buyer.Buyer must have valid NC PPP or CWP and DL."
