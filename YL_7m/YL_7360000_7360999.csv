Is finished in a proprietary Legion gray PVD coating, custom G-10 grips with a Legion medallion, the SIG SAUER Electro-Optics X-RAY high visibility day/night sights comes with three magazines. The P226 in DA/SA includes a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. This DA/SA is available in 9 mm. The DA/SA also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. P-SAIT trigger.

It's one of the latest war copies I've seen, with a date of January 1945, based on markings. Very hard to find, let alone  this late in the war to still be in one piece.

208,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7360208,For Sale:  US Civil War Confederate Kerr's Patent Revolver Rare London Armoury Co LAC .44 Kerr British,"18960, Pennsylvania, United States",$ 560,"Listed On: Saturday, September 23, 2017",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"PENNY START, TWO WEEK, NO RESERVE AUCTIONKerr's Patent Revolver, 3rd Variation; ca.1863 London Armoury Co.(LAC) Production/Confederate Issue; .44 Percussion; S/N: 9900Rare, Kerr's Patent Revolver...this percussion revolver was produced by the London Armoury Co at their England factory under contract with the government of the Confederate States of America. A highly-sought after piece on the collector's market, Kerr revolvers are among the few Confederate martial arms that may be identified by serial number. These revolvers were manufactured beginning in 1859, with Confederate agent Capt Caleb House signing a contract to purchase the LAC's entire output beginning in 1862. As such, Kerr's .44 Patent Revolvers falling between serial numbers 1019 and 10150 are considered to be within the range of weapons shipped by LAC via Fraser, Trenholm & Co. to the Confederacy. The revolver has all correct features, including matching serial numbers on the frame and cylinder, and the serial number places its production in late 1863 or early 1864. Although lacking the JS/Anchor mark, the grip does have the vacant panel, and it should be noted that many Kerrs with verified Confederate provenance are not so proofed. Called the 'Cavalry Model' by the Confederate army, the bulk of these revolvers are thought to have been distributed to Confederate cavalry units. Of note to the collector-the most famous record of these guns is the invetory of weapons logged by Julian Pratt of the 18th VA Cavalry Co. H. Known as Pratt's Roll, the document is incomplete, but lists 10 revolvers by serial number, all between 9240 and 9975. This places this revolver in close proximity to the guns on Pratt's list and may be considered to be within the Pratt range. An outstanding find for the collector, this Kerr's Patent revolver represents an extremely rare piece with strong investment potential.Condition:Fair overall, condition is closer to good with respect to Confederate-issued arms. The gun has desirably seen no refinish or restoration and wears its original LAC bluing, which is strongest on the lock plates. Bluing on the frame, barrel and cylinder are perhaps 20%, with the whole of the surface covered in moderate pitting, old dried grease, and black powder flash corrossion. Evident original bluing is present, with the patina trending toward russet and amber-there is no active rust on the gun. Markings are correct, with the serial number(often misidentified as the patent number) on the frame and cylinder matching. There are London House proof marks on the barrel and cylinder, with London Armoury Co. address on the lock plate and a second logo on the left of the frame. Additionally, the assembly number is present on the frame under the cylinder(pictured). Of note-the loading lever is a replacement and is in need of tightening. Grips rate as good with moderate wear to the checkering and no cracks or chips. As stated above, the grips are free of markings, proofing or cartouches. Original lanyard ring is present. Mechanically, the hammer holds cock and the trigger engages the hammer, while the trigger does not cycle the cylinder. The bore has evident rifling overlain with heavy consistent pitting running the length of the barrel on both grooves and lands."

This gun has been in my family for a long time. This gun has all the standard provisional Liege Belgium proofs. There is a cursive “b” indicating the 1923 year, and all of the inspector marks are pre-1924. All 3 engraved serial number match indicating it is all original and it shows the gun was imported to New York state. I am inclined to believe that this was made by Georges Laloux because on the barrel flats there looks to be engraved ""GL"" which I have a photo of. I matched this mark when I googled Georges Laloux, and also found an image of a pamphlet showing this manufacturer made a 1923 hammerless model, but it appears they are very rare, as Laloux was big on the hammer model SXS shotguns. It is possible that I may have missed something but I have scoured the gun with a magnifying glass and this looks to be the manufactures mark. I am not a professional and in my area I found more on my own, as ""experts"" just label them guilds because they don't know the history or don't want to take the time to find out. I have many close up photos of proof marks, inspection marks, and trademarks available upon request. This is a hammerless, break away box locking system with assist open that functions flawlessly, it is an assist open, have a video of it functioning also available upon request. It has functioning slide ""ejectors"" for spent shells, but the shells are not ejected wholly - they slide away when broke open and make the spent shell easy to grab. Once the break-away is closed the firing pins automatically set for fire. It does have a manual slide safety switch. The gun fires well and can shoot modern light shells no problem. The barrels are NOT damascas. All of the mechanisms are flawless and operate perfectly the engravings are beautiful, but the gun is not without flaw. The barrels are in excellent shape boors are completely  smooth  and I had gunsmiths in the area look at it. There is a very very slight defect near end of left barrel, an imperfection not really noticeable to the naked eye except in a certain light/angle. I had the steel verified with gunsmiths due to this and there are no cracks, stress marks, or any splitting of any kind.  I had to point out, local gun appraisals did not notice this. I have shot modern light duty bird thru the gun, and gunsmith said should be fine, but a gun like this is more for collecting than firing but can be fired it shoots well actually.  If you are looking for a beautiful sxs this one is the right price. I have had this gun appraised and it has appraised twice at twelve hundred $ minimum. For these 2 appraisals the maker was not identified, now that I have done some leg work a   Georges Laloux hammerless from 1923 is rare. So I thought I would try listing it for a reduced price - as the gun is not without flaw, but in excellent shape. So I am listing at less than half of the appraised value due to the defect that I have pointed out up front. I can send pics of all of this to anyone upon request. If I cannot sell for $450 I will just keep the gun. I would like to sell it because I have other needs and a beautiful antique shotgun, while nice and somewhat sentimental…. doesn’t really do much for my other firearm needs, so I’m selling it to get what I need. Only trades considered would be AK and would have to be in very good condition, no junk. If I had the funds for my needs I would never sell this piece… The art work, engraving, checkered wood stock are all beautiful and in excellent condition. Very nice side-by-side. Selling for $450 Firm no low balls this is a good price Can email me or call or text. I have all kinds of pics of artwork and proofs that I can email, this is a very rare 1923 sxs shot gun  I'm near Indianapolis. Willing to meet or ship if necessary. Any shipping costs will be paid by buyer or added to the price of $450. You can also call or text me. Thanks, David REDACTED"

This is a clone of the venerable and  legendary H&K MP5-K and is the best clone on the market. This is because it was made on original H&K factory tooling by MKE, the Turkish arms manufacturer. I have less than 500 rounds through this gun. I'm selling it because I just don't have a need for it. It's an excellent gun and is very accurate for having such a short barrel because of the H&K roller-lock mechanism. This gun has fed everything I've ever put through it without a single malfunction. That includes Winchester white box that is know to cause FTFs and FTEs in smg type weapons because of its inconsistencies. My original plan was to SBR this gun but I've just lost interest in it. It hasn't been fired in months. I have other guns that I'm more interested in shooting. The sale of this gun will include all original parts that came with it from the factory which includes the unused cleaning kit, sling, 3x30 round mags and the removable picatinny rail. I will also include a Choate Tool folding stock and US made forward grip. These are not mounted on the firearm because I do not have the permit to SBR it. I'm selling this beauty for $2000 OBO or trade for the right DSArms FAL in good shape. If you have an interesting firearm you're looking to trade, don't be afraid to throw it on the table. Not looking for ARs or AKs. I might accept an AR-10 type rifle though. If you'd like more pictures, I'll be happy to send them to you. I'm not shipping this gun.

Wish it could talk. 12001893 Marlin first year in 38-55. Marlin letter signed by William Brophy and Montana chamber of commerce letter. Barrel is marked WF Sheard Montana. He was a gunsmith in Montana and patented the Marbles site. Barrel was shortened nicely, it also has a quick take down pin instead of a lever screw.  $500Also have a rare KOLIBRI pistol, 12 rounds in original tin 2.7mm. Original presentation case. Very nice. Smallest Semi Automatic ever made.$6000 SOLDMight trade for anything interesting. Send offers by email, text or callREDACTED"

This is a hammerless, break away box locking system with assist open that functions flawlessly.  It has functioning slide ejectors for spent shells.  Once the break-away is closed the firing pins automatically set for fire.  It does have a manual slide safety switch.  The gun fires well and can shoot modern light shells no problem.  The barrels are not damascas.  I have had this gun appraised and it has appraised twice at twelve hundred minimum.  Here is the interesting part, the maker trademarks are difficult to make out under the “crown”  I have researched this and I have someone else also helping me.  The thing is the estimated value and appraisals are “as is” without the maker determined as it sits in its condition and year.
 
Many people call these “guilds” because they don’t take the time to find the maker.  This gun could increase greatly in value, and in turn I would raise the price accordingly once the maker is determined.  I am continuing to research as I post this.  I would like to sell it because I have other needs and a beautiful antique shotgun, while nice and somewhat sentimental…. doesn’t really do much for my other firearm needs, so I’m selling it to get what I need.  No, I’m not interested in trades I know what I want to buy.  If I had the funds for my needs I would never sell it…  
 
The art work, engraving, checkered wood stock are all beautiful and in excellent condition.  Very nice side-by-side. $800 firm
Can email me or call or text.  Near Indianapolis.

Vest, hard case, Mags by magpul, single sling. and much more. flat top with iron rear flip up adjustable and 6 point front sights. laser, light, 90 down the tube. still tight as hell. OK, This comes with a brand new tactiacle vest with full belt, about 400 round of 223 a brand new clening tool for the bolt and pin. three 30's 3 10's the light is bright and a thumb away, the laser covers the block and is green and easy to adjust. extra battery's yea you can buy this for about 1,000 plus tax and hell...All I need is your FID and DL. The sling is made by Tactical Link, The tool is a Kley Zion, The rifle itself has been proven over the years and is a out of the box nail pusher. Was bought in FLA. so it's a nice piece and you can do anything you want to it as all AR's. But in honesty why? It'll rull all day without a jam or stoppage. I have other cleaning tools I can toss in for those first time rifle owners. Rod's brushes, so on. So before you go to that local store around the corner and pay for just a rifle think about all the extras she comes with. The case alone is worth over 100.00 all added up your looking at 1,500 or more. WHAT TOO MUCH? THE AMMO IS WORTH 200.00 ALONE! THE LASER WAS 80, THE LIGHT WAS 60. THE STRAP WAS 75.00 THE CASE 100.00 THE MAGTECK MAGAZINES WERE 25 WITH COVERS FOR THE 30'S ABOUT 15 FOR THE 10'S W/COVERS. THE ZEION TOOL WAS 37.00 AND MORE TOOLS AVALIBLE. THE RIFLE WAS 1,200.00 AND ONE OF THE FIRST YEARS PRODUCED AFTER THEY LEFT BUSHMASTER. IT'S ONE OF THEIR BEST BEFORE HIGH PRODUCTION. SO I CANNOT SEE WHY NO OFFERS. YOU WILL NOT FIND A NEW RIFLE BETTER THEN THIS ONE. I DON'T CARE WHAT'S ON IT..LIGHT COVERS BLA BLA BLA..THIS IS A HEAVEY BARREL CHROMED LINED UNLIKE MOST GARBAGE OUT THERE. LOOK AT IT AND LOOK AT OTHERS. FLASH SUPRRESOR AND KNIVE LUG COVERED BY LASER. EASY OFF AND ON. THE VEST IS A MAG HOLDER AND PISTOL HOLSTER, IT HAS A FULL BEST ON IT FOR ALL YOUR COP TYPE ACCSEORIES IF YOU WANT OF JUST TAKE IT OFF. IT HAS ALL THE SPOTS IN THE BACK FOR BREAKING IN TOOLS, THE FRONT IS LOADED WITH MAG HOLDERS AND OTHER POCKETS. IT HAS A RUBBER STRAP OVER THE SHOULDER BOLDER HOLDER. THISIS FOR WHEN IT'S FULLY LOADED WITH GEAR IT HELPS CARRY THE WEIGHT. IT'S NOTHING EXPENSIVE BUT WORKS FINE FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO CARRY THEIR MAGS FOR A FIGHT. THE BELT CAN ACCOMODATE EVERYTHING FROM CUFFS TO MORE TACTICAL PISTOLS HOLSTERS. RIFLE/SHOTGUN CARRY WITH EASE. IT WAS NEVER USED DUE TO WAITING FOR THE STHTF. YA KNOW? AS YOU CAN SEE IT HOLDS SHOTGUN SHELLS OR OTHER LARGE ITEMS LIKE MORE LIGHTS OR EXTRA EQUIPMENT. POCKETS FOR MED KIT/MAPS AND SO ON. COMPASS OR WHAT EVER YOU NEED CAN FIT IN THE VEST, IT'S A GREAT BUG OUT ITEM. OR JUST FOR HUNTING YOUR LOCAL STREETS....I MEAN WOODS.

I have for same my p226R-22-BAS w/the caliber X-Change Kit to 40S&W and am including 2/500 round bricks of 22LR (Remington Thunderbolts).  This is the model with the with the slide for 22LR. Everything else is the same as the p226 in center fire calibers full size frame, full size slide, decocking lever, mag release, everything. This is the ONLY pistol out on the market that allows you to train with the same pistol that you would use for defense. You can fire 22LR at the range or on the coarse and the simply drop out the 22LR mag, slide off the 22LR upper assembly, slide on the 40S&W upper assembly, and insert the 40S&W mag. It is literally that simple to change out the training slide for the defensive slide. I'm going to go over a few things but feel free to ask any questions or if you would like more pic's let me know. I'm limited on how many pic's I can post.I am the first and only owner of both the pistol and the X-Change kit. Pistol was purchased at Ft.Belvoir VA and the X-Change kit was purchased new direct from The Sig Store on their website. The 22LR slide has had (MAYBE but probably less) 200 rounds through it, it's not even broke in yet. The 40S&W slide has had (again maybe) 100 rounds rounds through it, again not even broke in. The pistol and X-Change kit are in like new condition and could easily pass for brand new. Anyway here is a list of everything I'm including with the price:Sig Sauer p226-22-BAS (DA/SA) $550 on BudsX-Change kit in 40S&W $400 (sigsauer.com)1 extra Sig Sauer brand 40S&W mag 12 round (kit only came with 1) $34 (buds)2/500 round bricks of Remington Thunderbolt ($25/each)$700 firm takes everything! Meet in Summerville!  This is NON-NEGOTIABLE!  I have already had 1 prospective buyer waste my time and try to give me some bullshit about getting a ticket after I waited for almost 2 hours.  No Holds and No Trades please!"

TALO Had FAIL ZERO coat the slide and barrel with nickel boron coating. Nickel boron provides a hard, durable surface (40% harder than chrome) and permanent lubricity to metal substrates, allowing firearms to operate without oil or grease. EXO coated components last longer, clean up easier, and require minimal maintenance, while increasing relaibility in harsh environments (sand/dust, hot/cold, suppressed fire, frangible ammunition). TALO tested one of these to evaluate their failure rate. They ran 5,000 rounds through it with no malfunctions or lubrication.This Glock 19 TALO EXO is in lightly used to near perfect/mint condition. I put about 100 rounds through it, cleaned it, and it's been sitting in the safe for years. I recently put brand new Wilson Combat Vickers Elite Battle Night Sites on it as well - $112.00. It comes as a package with three new Glock OEM magazines, three new Magpul PMAG magazines, three new Magpul PMAG Floor Plates, a new Ghost Inc. 3.5 Connector, a Ghost Inc. Grip Plug - installed, but new, a Glock OEM extended slide stop lever, and a Glock OEM extended magazine release - both installed, but new.Price is $550.00 cash firm - looking to fund another project. Not looking for any trades, and I do not want to split up the package deal. This is a fair asking price for everything included, so all low ball offeres will be ignored. Willing to meet a a local police department during daylight hours. Prefer LTCH holder, but not a deal breaker.Contact via email - please reply to this ad. Thank you for your interest."

This is one of the newer models made in Upper Sandusky Ohio. I'm only wanting to trade it because I just never take it out of the safe because I don't want to marr it up, comes with a very nice Ithaca soft case. Downsizing and really can't justify keeping safe queens so I'd really like to trade for a nice Mossberg 500 Persuder style preferably the 18.5"" version but would consider the 20"" or a 930 tactical. Also like the FN P12 shotgun and the Benelli Nova tactical. Possibly others but not interested in any freedom group Remington's.
