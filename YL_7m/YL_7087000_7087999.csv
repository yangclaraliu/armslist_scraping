These are made without the bayonet lug and are not military issued models. Rather these are produced with all new parts and better quality control for public sale to the non military market. I did a little research and theses get good overall review for quality and workmanship for their price point. Got this in trade and decided I don't need it. Gun is of course fired and when I acquired it, I stripped and cleaned and test fired for accuracy etc. Gun runs and cycles fine and does what they are supposed to do. Iron sights are accurate out to about where I tested it (100 yards) there is included an optical mount that clips on and off with ease if you wanted to add scope, light, etc to it. Gun will come with 2 30 round mags, new and one still in wrapper, the aforementioned optical adaptor and a hard carrying case. Also 200 rounds of factory ammo. Synthetic stock only, I don't have the wood. And as you can see the gun is finished with some custon paint work. If you watch the news, you know these things can take a beating and still perform reliably in a very harsh environment. Not the prettiest guns by far, but they are very popular and inexpensive to own and shoot. Will only meet daytimes Monday through Friday. Local to Columbus and generally within reason of I270. I am working and can't run a long time/distance to make a deal. I am CCW and prefer the same. Will produce and expect Ohio ID and legal buyers only. Price is pretty firm and I will not respond to ridiculous offers from low ballers."

This .243 Win, rifle features Mossy Oak Break-Up® Infinity™ camouflaged stocks and the “Deer THUGS” logo laser-engraved on the receiver. Honoring the THUGS (Today’s Hunters United for Good) moniker, Mossy Oak donates a portion of the proceeds from their Deer THUGS merchandise sales to the Wounded Warrior Project. At the core of the ATR rifle is an all-steel machined receiver for a positive lock-up and smooth, solid bolt-operation; free-floating, button-rifled fluted barrel with protective recessed muzzle crown, constructed of durable carbon steel; weather-resistant, classic-styled synthetic stock fully camouflaged with Break-Up Infinity; and integral top-loading magazine with five-round total capacity for reliable feeding and ease of loading/unloading. Standard on the ATR Deer THUG rifles, and all ATR models, is Mossberg’s patent-pending, user-adjustable LBA™ (Lightning Bolt Action™) Trigger System. The durable machined trigger assembly is constructed of aircraft-grade aluminum which undergoes a hard-coat anodization to minimize corrosion and wear. The LBA’s unique skeletonized lightning bolt trigger blade blocks the sear from releasing the striker until the blade is fully depressed. This sear engagement design provides for a creep-free trigger. Trigger pull can be adjusted from 2 to 7 pounds with a standard screwdriver. Other value-added features include factory-installed, Weaver-style two-piece scope bases; stock and forend sling swivel studs; and sling.  Model: ATR Caliber: 243 Action: Bolt Action Capacity: 4+1 Finish: Matte Blue Stock: Mossy Oak Break-Up Infinity/ Deer Thugs Logo Sights: No Sights Barrel: 22"" Fluted/ Button Rifled Barrel Length: 42"" Features: Top Load Magazine/ 3-9x40 Scope"

This is the model released prior to the current G33. The only real difference is a slight variance in lens size (talking milimeters), the mounting bracket is a switch instead of a throw, and thats more or less all. It retailed brand new for 435 after tax. The mounting bracket needs two tiny springs I cannot find online so Id recommend buying a new mounting bracket, either fixed or flip to side. This will run between 40-140 dollars depending on what kind you get, hence my low price. Everything with the actual unit itself functions flawlessly, the lens is free from any scratches or abrasions whatsoever, and it has been well taken care of. Im relatively firm on price but will entertain offers."

Serial # 971,896 with NO prefix rather than an underlined No. Although some publications list this serial number as March 1943 production, it may have been finished after production was started again in May-June ’43 (after shutdown in Feb.) with the new on site Ordnance inspector. He designated that new production pistols would have the NO prefix to distinguish newly produced pistols. Since old receivers were used up in new production a mix of NO and No can be found in serial number range 955,000 to 1,016,000. This pistol has the Du-lite finish with some blued parts. Regulations required the same finish on the receiver and slide but parts could be other finishes. Slide is type 2 with markings 1 3/8” long and ending in N.Y.U.S.A. Type 2 slides started about #935,000. Blued High Standard barrel. P stamped on the left side of the lug, HS on the right. Bore is mirror with a little micro erosion from firing. Feed ramp is bright with traces of finish, not polished. Recoil spring plug is blued. Remington narrow hammer. Finely checkered early Remington mainspring cover. Blued checkered slide stop (Colt). Blued safety checkered on top and bottom with no undercut (Colt). Colt supplied these parts to Remington until Remington could make them. Front sight has sloped serrated ramp on rear. Rounded cut on front of rear sight with squared aperture. Early Keyes grips without re-enforcing rings around screws. No hits, bangs or smashed checkering. Bluing on pistol is about 95%. There is some wear on the top of the barrel and on other moving parts. Du-lite was not as sturdy as Parkerizing. Heat treated area on end of the slide is very visible but there is none above the slide stop."

It has one kit (shell plate and powder funel but not sure of the caliber.) Friend inherited the press and gave it to me if I would reload for him till my labor paid it off. I already have a progressive and don't want to have to purchase other caliber conversion kits. Going to use the money to get a new digital powder measure or a new scope. The parts that are missing are less than $50 to replace and even cheaper if you can find used ones. These are really great presses and this model sell new for about $500. He gave several die sets with the press but I am keeping some of them but passing along a Lee 45 ACP Die set, and a RCBS box that had 300 savage and British .303 die's in it, and they are RCBS die sets. It also has the Primer tray. I am asking $350 OBO. Contact JB at REDACTED if you are interested"
