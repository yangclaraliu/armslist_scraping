Background: The Beretta-created Stoeger 8000 Cougar semi-auto pistols inherit the reputation of the original Beretta 8000 as reliable, durable and powerful. First designed primarily for tactical undercover work, the Cougar is now carried by a growing number of police officers as their official duty sidearm thanks to its ergonomics, low recoil and inherent accuracy.  The goal was to be a smaller, more compact and concealable pistol for undercover and security work. The LAPD issued a variant of the Cougar with a 4"" barrel for a time.

Beretta bought Stoeger for their skilled manufacturing employees and then shipped the original Beretta Cougar machines to Stoeger to continue making the famous Beretta Cougar pistol (which made room to make the PX4 model pistol).

In its new incarnation, Beretta developed an ergonomically-advanced pistol that is compact but capable of handling high-power cartridges, offering high magazine capacity and giving a long service life. This has been possible also thanks to the innovative adaptation of a locked-breech system with a rotating barrel. Today, the Stoeger 8000 Cougar pistol is manufactured by the Stoeger Silah Sanayi A.S., strictly in line with the most traditional Beretta quality control and attention to detail.    LOW RECOIL

Upon firing this pistol, shooters are amazed by the low felt recoil. This is due to two factors working together. The first is the rotating barrel system, which dissipates recoil radially rather than directing it into the shooter’s hand. The second is the central block, which absorbs the mechanical recoil from the barrel and the slide before this is transferred to the frame. When the Cougar is in battery, the positive lock-up of barrel to slide assures perfect alignment of barrel and sights. Upon firing, the barrel travels and rotates with axial movement. Besides low recoil, the result is superior accuracy and quicker recovery for follow-up shots.

ADVANCED ERGONOMICS FOR EASY HANDLING, CONTROL, CONCEALMENT

The Cougar is one of the most ergonomically advanced pistols in its class. The user-friendly, contoured frame and grips make the Cougar exceptionally easy to control during firing. By taking hand anatomy and instinctive hold into account, the Cougar accommodates smaller hands and also protects larger hands from being bitten by the slide. All edges are rounded or beveled, and are carefully finished to make the Cougar virtually snag-proof and exceptionally easy to draw and conceal.MORE FEATURES

Rotating barrel action: the barrel stays put while the slide travels backward, rotating approximately 30 degrees by means of a cam pin and tracked milled onto the barrel and frame that unlocks the barrel from the breech once a safe chamber pressure is reached. This enhances accuracy as the barrel stays pointed on target and does not travel to the rear and then slightly tip up at the muzzle as in many other designs.

All metal lower frame: In stark contrast to the polymers used by most other semi-auto handguns being sold today. No plastic guns here. Visible External Hammer – a real hammer like a real gun!Double action and single action.

Safeties: Safety and de-cocker are combined into a convenient single lever.  It is also AMBIDEXTROUS for right and left handed shooters.

Take down lever is easy to use for field stripping and cleaning Reversible magazine catch.  Sights: 3 dot sighting system easily acquire your target. Both front and rear sights are MILLED and DOVETAILED into the steel of slide for durability and easily visible.  Smooth trigger action. Clean, crisp let off when working the action."

This is from their latest D series run of TCP's, which resolved the short stroke dead trigger problem that some of the earlier models experienced.  I've fired 24 rounds through it (2 mags of 6 rounds, twice),  Both mags functioned perfectly, the gun had no failures.  I was shooting at 10 yards and plinking pepsi cans off a fence with ease.  It shoots surprisingly well if you do your part.  I bought a ruger LCP, this Taurus TCP, and a Colt mustang XSP.  The ruger LCP is the worst of the three.  The Taurus out performed the Ruger no doubt about it.  The trigger is surprisingly good.  I just really dislike the way the gun looks.  The finish on these things is dogshit.  I sold the Ruger LCP because I think it's garbage, had multiple failures and it was hard to hold onto when firing.  I'm selling the Taurus because I'm being terrorized by my wifes nagging. I'm being forced to thin out my collection.  I don't want to part with it because I don't like to sell a gun that performs well, but the Colt Mustang XSP is better and looks nicer, and I really only need one pocket gun.  Just keeping the bare essentials, so this one has got to go.  As you know all Taurus's come with a lifetime warranty that transfers to a new owner.  No paperwork needed.  I bought two spare magazines for the gun, one of which broke when something heavy fell on it.  One of the feed lips bent really bad and ultimately broke off.  I'm including it in the sale because you can use it for parts.  The gun shipped from the factory with 1 magazine, and spare mags are hard to come by as well as expensive.  So the gun has two perfect condition magazines and one broken one you can use for parts.  Comes with the box it shipped in from the factory (just a cardboard box with taurus logos on it), and the safety keys.  It has an internal locking mechanism you can activate with the safety key which keeps the gun from firing.  Manual included."

You may have seen some of my other posts though.  Basically I'm being bullied by the wife to sell off all the guns I don't need, and I'd very much like to receive a blowjob again sometime in the next decade, so I'm thinning out all the stuff I don't need.  No sentimental value here really, my dad passed me down some other guns that I will hold onto, so I can part with this one no problem.  I'm not certain what to price it at because of the finish.  But I see blued Colt Delta Elites being sold in the 800-900 range in decent condition on various gun auction sites.  I figure a good refinish of the gun could cost somewhere between 200 and 300 dollars. So lets take the lower end of 800, and subtract the higher end of 300 for a refinish, and come out around $500?  I don't know.  Make me an offer and I might go for it.  No box or paperwork, comes with one magazine."

This gun contains no German markings at all. This is a pre-war model completely unmolested by the Nazis. These are becoming extremely hard to come by, and this gun is one instance where a lack of Nazi markings actually makes it more valuable. Most items of this time period fetch a higher dollar for any Nazi markings. Polish proof and inspection marks are all in the correct places. Stamped on both sides of the trigger guard bow and on the left side of the slide ahead of the decocking lever. This is all original parts to one gun, not pieced together. The serial numbers all match.  Barrel, slide, and frame. The only damage to the gun is one of the grip panels has a chunk missing. Replica grips can be found for 30 bucks.  Original grips can be found around $100.   Also, It appears a soldier inscribed his name on the slide and dated it. I tend to believe it was a soldier as the date etched into the slide (april 13th, 1945) was only a month before victory over europe day (may 8, 1945) Ive tried to find info on the name etched into the slide but have come up empty so far.  Feel free to dive into that rabbit hole on your own.  Light wear on the bluing. And the original white color fill is still mostly present.  This can be redone or removed easily.  The slide to frame fit is excellent, decocking lever, slide release, and mag release all in excellent working order. Mechanical function of the gun is pristine.I have fired the weapon just to test function.  There is a reason the Nazis made this one of their official sidearms during the war, they are extremely well made and surprisingly accurate.  If it werent a collectors item I probably would have made this one of my main range guns.  It's a great shooter not just for the time period but even now.  It rivals a well made 9mm 1911.  I'm not putting a price on it because there is such a fluctuation in the prices I see it being listed for.  On collectors websites people are selling these for upwards of 4 grand. Given the etching of mine I'm thinking something under 2 grand. If i could find some historical info on the name perhaps it would be worth more.  Please make an offer and we will negotiate from there.  I can tell you the average of all offers I've received is about 1500.  I'm treating this like an auction and just taking the best offer.  It's been up for about 2 months and I'm making a decision on Friday.High resolution video of the gun can be viewed at the following link.https://youtu.be/ngM3IIluAL0Make me an offer, cash or trade, lets see what happens."

Back in the 1930’s Winchester came out with the 37 to compete with similar products made by Iver Johnson, Harrington & Richardson and others. It was produced until 1963 so it’s a C&R gun. It has a 30 inch barrel, a full choke and is chambered for 2 ¾ inch loads. The bore is mint. The blue is about 94% with minor rubs and freckling. The wood is sound with no cracks and just one ding at the right side of the forend. The wood finish is a bit worn and a bit of refinishing would make the gun look near new. Original Winchester logo buttplate. A very nice addition to your Winchester collection."

I've pretty much switched completely to 9mm and really don't have a need for this stuff anymore. I have loved this pistol, open carried it for many days, put probably 2000rnds through it (without any problems), shot my NRA Pistol Instructor qualification with it (it is way more accurate than I am), shot a couple of USPSA competitions with it (it can run way faster than I can), and at one point said to a group of folks that I would never sell it. Well, now I'm selling it, along with the holster, light, ammo and reloading dies. I never used the reloading stuff, just thought that some day it might come in handy (and it hasn't). I have put together the list of everything in the lot, along with the what I paid for each (not including tax or shipping) and it comes to over $1400. Now I'm ready to let it go for $900. I keep the pistol and light clean, and really the whole package looks pretty much factory fresh, other than a few loose rounds that I couldn't find the factory box for. I might be interested in trades as well, just hit me up and we can talk about it. Lot includes:FNX-45 Black on Black DA/SA - complete with all FN America provided accessories (Pistol Case, Back Staps, Lock, Manual, 3x 15rnd Magazines) $769.99Bravo Concealment OWB Holster and Mag Holster (OD Green, 1.5"" Belt Loops) $86.99Streamlight TLR-1 Weapon Light $120 (BC holster is configured to be used with light mounted)Ammo included in sale: 780rnds a $400+ value!!80rnds Hornady Critical Defense 185gr FTX ($18.97/box)58rnds Hornady Critical Duty 220gr +P FlexLock ($26.43/box)50rnds PMC 185gr JHP ($29.99/box)100rnds Federal 230gr HST +P ($29.87/box)350rnds Armscor 230gr FMJ ($22.43/box)150rnds American Eagle 230gf FMJ ($18.97/box)50rnds Wolf 230gr FMJ ($14.64/box)Lee Precision 45ACP Reloading Kit ($30 I think)Shipping: I WILL ONLY SHIP TO FFL HOLDERS IN STATES WHERE LEGAL, PLEASE CHECK YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE BIDDING I will need to know what FFL I will be shipping to so please provide your FFLs phone number so that I can get a copy to ship the pistol. I need that within 48hrs of sale if this pistol is being sold to a person outside of South Dakota. This pistol is also available for pickup at no additional cost, as long as you have a SD Drivers License and can pass a NICS check. If you are a SD resident, and want the pistol shipped, I will need an FFL. I will ship the Pistol to the FFL FedEx Priority Overnight, but everything else I will ship via FedEx Ground straight to your door. So I will need your shipping address for that. I can also ship that to the FFL if you prefer but it will arrive a few days after the pistol. Once the sale has ended and I have received your shipping info, I will provide you with the cost to ship. I will tell you this, I just checked shipping from SD to FL (figured that was the furthest to ship) and it was $100.75 for just the pistol. The ground package will probably ship for about $15. I will add the cost to ship to your final sales invoice, which you will use to submit payment. So keep shipping in mind as well as your FFL transfer fee at your FFL location. Final payment will be via bank transfer, certified check, or USPS money order. If you want to use a credit card, I will have to use PayPal and I will have to add 3% to the total bill. I will ship as soon as payment has cleared (same day if possible)."
