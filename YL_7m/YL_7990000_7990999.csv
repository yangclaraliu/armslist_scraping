I would say it's been shot a total of no more than 100 times over its life. I probably shot 70 of those myself. This is the perfect gun for reaching the higher elevation geese. The Model 1100 is one of the most popular guns for skeet shooting and includes extras, like the comfort fit stock bumper and gas operation eject. 
It has a 30-inch barrel. Nowhere on the gun does it say it is a ""competition"" model. However, this gun was designed by Remington for this purpose and is well known as a competition gun.Uses 3-inch magnum shells.

I bought this about 3 years ago. It started as a Mark III Talo edition. Factory 5.5 inch threaded barrel. Here are the modifications I had done (nothing too crazy):1.  I removed the factory compensator and had MaddMacs Precision custom make a new compensator.2.  I installed a Volquartsen extended bolt release that works great and very comfortable. 3.  I removed the spring from the loaded chamber indicator. But this can be easily reinstalled as all factory parts and original box will come with the pistol. 4.  It has a Bushnell Fast Strike red dot installed on a shorten and Cerakoted Ruger scope base. I had this shortened to better fit the gun and Cerakoted to match the grip and compensator. 5.  The barrel was also Cerakoted gun metal grey. This is a look that I enjoy as all black guns do not do anything for me. As mentioned before, this will come with all factory components. Including the original box and 2 magazines. This thing will run through a box of ammo with no problem. If you've owned a Ruger before, you know they have no problems with reliability. It is dead on accurate. The Bushnell combined with the 5.5 inch barrel make it very easy to be a confident shooter and hit whatever you want. Unfortunately, it is time for me to part with it. I do not get out as much as I use to due to life changes and I'm hoping to find it a new home. I hope the next owner will enjoy this as much as I have. Price is negotiable so please do not be afraid to make an offer. I am also willing to ship to your local FFL dealer or meet up if you are local. Feel free to call/text or e-mail. REDACTED.
