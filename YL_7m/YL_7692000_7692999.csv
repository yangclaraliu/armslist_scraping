The rifle shoots remarkable, It shoots so well that when testing loads its hard to tell what group is best because the groups are so good. I have been using Sierra 175gr TMK and Nosler 168gr CC and since the barrel was installed have shot under 200rnds through it. The Rifle is kept in a temp controlled safe and coated chamber in light oil when storing. The rifle is in great shape with no blemishes as it was used at the range and kept in hard case when transporting. Price is without the optic, rings or bi-pod.

It has exactly FIVE (5) rounds of American Eagle FMJ fired through it, but I didn't like the weight of a barrel this long. I did not really measure accuracy because the shots were mainly to test function. At 25 yards where I tested, the shots were touching in the center of the target after only bore sighting with a laser. I would expect reasonable accuracy at longer ranges with better ammo.Here are the details:-HBAR-Fluted-20inch-.223 WYLDE-1:8 Twist-ParkerizedAlso, I have a LuthAR MBA1 (black) stock and a mil-spec A2 buffer tube kit (7075 aluminum) from Brownells. Both are also nearly new and have only sat on my build for those 5 shots before I swapped it for a collapsible stock. For transparency: I paid $150 for the MBA1 Stock, $50 for the buffer tube kit, and $100 for the barrel before shipping/taxes. As of 12/11/2017, the prices for these items new are still the same online.I am asking $130 for the stock, $30 for the buffer tube kit, and $80 for the barrel.If bought all at once, I will take $210 for all of it.

The stock is just black synthetic and does not have the Dura-Touch tacky coating (which rubs off anyway). The gray rubber inserts are very grippy. The receiver is alloy. I hope this helps. I recently bought brand new and shot it three times (twice at the range and once while pheasant hunting). Excellent condition. Browning Cynergy Composite Feather 12ga 28"" barrel shotgun. Black stock with gray rubber inlays. LOP is 15"" as pictured, but comes with a spacer, when removed, makes LOP 14.75. Other recoil pads may be purchased to make the LOP even shorter. Includes choke wrench, locks, paperwork and manual, improved cylinder, modified, and full chokes, and original box. Only about 6.5 lbs! Nice balance. The only imperfections I can find that would deviate from factory new condition are a few very light, superficial marks on the stock. I'm only selling to fund another shotgun purchase. Here is a good buy for you guaranteed.Insured flat shipping via FedEx ground service available on request for extra $40, Money Order and Certified Check would be shipped immediately with USPS Delivery."

Christmas is upon us and I want to free up some funds to give my kids the Christmas they deserve. These 2 bows are from my personal collection. They have always been stored and strung/destrung properly. Both have perfectly straight limbs and sport their original finish. They have no chips or cracks, only some light scratches that come from being well cared for for over 40 years of their life. So without further delay here are the finer details. 1st is a 1975 Bear Black Panther. This is an original Grayling Michigan made Bear Bow. It has a 56"" Amo length and has a marked draw weight of 50/55 lbs @28in. It pulls 52 lbs on my scale. This bow is in great shape and has a factory accessory port for a stabilizer or fishing reel. Tips are perfect and the rest and strikeplate are ready to go. I would rate this how a solid 9/10. $125 and it will be a great addition to any collection. The next one up for grabs is a real gem. This bow is a 1969 Browning Explorer II. This was Brownings flagship hunting bow in its day and its craftsmanship and beauty reflect that fact. This bow has a AMO length of 62"" and a arrow rippin 60lb draw weight. The riser is handmade from a solid piece of African Rosewood and has beautiful coloring and grain. Tips are perfect. The old rest and strike plate were just removed and cleaned up. Its ready for the new owners choice of a shelf or elevated rest. I would rate this bow at 8/10. This is a very beautiful bow and very hard to come by with this high of draw weight. I am looking for $180 on the Explorer. There will be no disappointments with these bows. Feel free to call/ txt/ or email me if you would like any additional pictures or have any questions. If the add is up they are still available. All calls/ messages returned. 270- six zero eight-2560, my name is Aaron.*****both bows are sold pending funds"

It has normal minor handling marks from use.The Super Black Eagles were made for the serious hunter and will perform like the pro it is on 2-3/4"", 3"" and 3-1/2"" shotguns shells without adjustments. The SBE comes with a weather-resistant composite stock and is finished in non-reflective black.  At the heart of the Super Black Eagle is Benelli's ultra-reliable Inertia Driven™ operating system, consisting of just 3 main parts: the bolt body, an inertia spring, and a rotating bolt head. This super simple design does not use gas to cycle the action, allowing it to remain cleaner than a gas-operated semi-automatic shotgun. The smaller mass of parts in the action and no heavy gas operating components housed inside the forend make the SBE an extremely trim, and fast handling semi-automatic shotgun. The ComforTech® recoil reduction system tames recoil from magnum loads and reduces muzzle rise for fast follow up shot.
