And this time it’s a fierce one. We all know what happened in Las Vegas by now, but many do not know there has been legislative action brought forth in a bill by a REPUBLICAN named Carlos Curbelo. This bill goes beyond AR rifles or AK’s. This is going to involve everyone, even deer hunters. The bill that has been introduced does not just ban “bump-stocks” it will ultimately ban all semi-auto rifles and pistols. The bill is very loosely written and does not even mention the term “bump-stock”. It states it will ban “parts that is designed and functions to increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle”, which will mean triggers, disconnects etc.I am asking you to please be involved with this process because we cannot solely rely on president Trump or the NRA. Representatives need to hear the voice of WE THE PEOPLE. They work for us. Please call these representatives and leave them a voice mail (be courteous) and state “I am a registered voter and DO NOT approve of the Curbelo Bill. Thank You.” I have compiled the list of representatives that have backed this bill and their office phone numbers, I am aware that they are not here in California, but they still need to know that lawful gun owners will not stand by and forfeit our second amendment rights. Even if you just call one, that’s better than doing nothing. So please, take 2 minutes out of your day and leave a message. Don’t count on others to do it.Carlos Curbelo (R-FL): REDACTEDPeter King (NY): REDACTEDLeonard Lance (NJ): REDACTEDPatrick MeeHan (PA): REDACTEDEd Royce (CA): REDACTEDChris Smith (NJ): REDACTEDErik Paulsen (MN): REDACTEDRyan Costello (PA): REDACTEDIleana Ros-Lehtinen (FL): REDACTEDCharlie Dent (PA): REDACTEDThe Bill: https://curbelo.house.gov/uploadedfiles/finalbumpstockban.pdfPlease watch this video Military Arms Channel video: https://youtu.be/sCLoIorYguU"

It is thin, at barely an inch wide, making it a favorite for concealed carry.The trigger is DA first shot with following shots SA. The difference between this pistol and others claiming to be double action is that the first shot is true double action. The hammer strikes every time the trigger is pulled just like a revolver. Trigger pull is very smooth with DA pull at about 10 lbs and SA pull at about four lbs. A short reset allows quick follow up shots. No Trades!"

Both these rifles use #209 primers and are intended to use sabots or “Powerbelt” bullets. The .50 is a “Buckhorn Magnum” model. It is equipped with a 3-9x Russian-made scope, and the iron sights have been removed. The .50 barrel is rifled 1:28” and the bore has some pits but nothing that interferes with shooting. Thirty-six (36) T/C “Maxi-Ball” 370 grain bullets are included. The .54 is an “Eclipse Hunter,” and it has a Williams peep rear sight fully adjustable for windage and elevation. This rifle is drilled and tapped for scope mounts as well. The barrel in the .54 is in perfect condition, bright and shiny, and also rifled 1:28”. The .54 comes with a “conversion kit” to enable the use of #11 percussion caps and/or musket caps should you prefer. I have included some Hornady .54 sabots to be used with .44 caliber pistol bullets, and there are some 240 grain MagTech .44 bullets to shoot in these.Also included in the sale is a set of tools for inserting #209 primers into the breech, and for removing the breech plug(s) for cleaning; plus a couple of .50 speed loaders.I’m selling these because I prefer sidelock guns. I bought them as “loaners” and have no further use for them; so my loss is your gain. The .54 hits like The Hammer of Thor and is suitable not only for deer but bigger game such as moose or elk. The deer season is opening SOON!I’m selling them as a set, not separately. Since these rifles are not “firearms” within the meaning of the Gun Control Act of 1968, they be sent directly to your street address (unless your state has some additional restrictions on the shipment of black powder firearms). I will ship via FEDEX and I don’t make money on shipping: you’ll pay actual cost."

Much like M-24, the barrel is cold hammer forged and features 5-R rifling. The 5R rifling profile increases barrel life expectancy, accuracy and creates less fouling and bullet deformation over time Whether you're a benchrest shooter or longtime, look no further for better reliability and precision. Why 5-R? 5-R rifling is the same type of rifiling used on the battle proven M-24 SWS. There are 5 lands as opposed to the normal 6 land configuration. Traditional lands are squared off at a 90 degree angle to the groove while the lands on 5-R rifling are tapered at 110 degrees which results in less bullet deformation. Also, none of the lands are directly across from one another. Both of these features lead to better accuracy and less fouling.  Legendary Model 700 Stainless Steel Action featuring the ""3-Rings of Steel"" makes this the strongest action on the market. 5-R hammer-forged with tactical/target-style rifling like that used in famous M-24 military rifles for the utmost in shot-to-shot consistency. 5-R increases barrel life and accuracy, causes less friction and bullet deformation. H.S. Precision composite stock features full-length aluminum bedding blocks for enhanced stability and shot-to-shot consistency. Dual front swivel stub system for convenient mounting of bi-pod and sling. X-Mark Pro externally adjustable trigger. Silencer ready with 5/8x24 Threads.

Includes 5 round magazine and Tasco Pronghorn 3-9x scope. This rifle is a serious shooter, even from a rest I feel like it outshoots me every time. Superb quality overall, and just a pleasant rifle to shoot. I don't use it much these days, so it should go to someone who can really wring it out. I'm fairly certain the Tasco scope is NOT sighted in (it's been forever since I shot it and I remember a different scope on there back then). It's an absolute tack driver, and I'd easily put it up against US/Euro made rifles costing 2-3x more in terms of accuracy.Rifle features a cold hammer forged spiral heavy barrel. Bluing is great all around, with a few marks here and there from handling (mostly receiver area, and difficult to catch in a photo). Stock has quite a few marks on it but no cracks or major damage. Tried to pick up all the wood damage there is in the pics, again mostly just handling marks.Looking for $250 cash only, no trades.

These rifles are almost clones of the M38 except for the ground off M91/30 rear sight.The ""1891/59"" marking on the receiver suggests the carbines were created in or after 1959. It was initially thought that Bulgaria or another Soviet satellite country performed the conversions in preparation for a Western invasion that never came. Recent evidence suggests that the M91/59 was indeed produced in Bulgaria from Soviet-supplied wartime production M91/30s. Total production of the 91/59 is uncertain; figures as low as one million and as high as three million have appeared in firearm literature.asking 250 obo, any cash offers are welcome"

Classic case of ""it's the shooter, not the weapon"". If there are any trades for around the same asking price (especially any revolvers), I'm open to hear anything! Seriously, no rude responses; if the offer you shoot me isn't satifactory, I'm not going to be nasty. Theres no harm in asking! Please do not be afraid to shoot me an offer!

The barrel was threaded by a local 07/02 SOT/suppressor manufacturer so the threads are bore concentric for suppressor use or flash hider/brake mounting.Ive seen it for sale for $600 online at the cheapest with a threaded barrel.The scope is a Primary Arms 4-16x44 illuminated MilDot reticle.  It’s zeroed to the rifle using the 52gr SMKs mentioned previously. Fresh CR2032 battery and it has very solid clicks. $160 newAsking $500 for the rifle alone, with 2 aluminum 10rd mags and 50rds ammo$600 for the rifle, scope, mags and ammo"
