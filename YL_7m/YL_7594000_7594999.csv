The 590A1 was first introduced in 1980s. Born from the 500 series that appeared in 1960, it has, at the U.S. Navy’s request, a heavy-walled barrel, metal triggerguard and safety, and a new corrosion-resistant finish.
Nine-shot versions were fitted with a bayonet lug. Before adoption the gun passed a 3,000-round endurance test with buckshot and slugs that allowed for just three malfunctions. It was the only gun tested that passed. Sand emersion, saltwater fogging and interchangeability tests were also part of the procedure. The 590A1 was adopted by the U.S. Army, Navy, Coast Guard and several Special Forces units and has since been issued by several hundred police departments, as well as state and federal agencies including the NYPD and the Texas Department of Public Safety.
The action is pretty standard stuff. Twin action bars attached to the fore-end move the bolt to and fro, and since the single bolt lug locks into a steel barrel-extension mortise, the receiver can be machined from aluminium alloy to save some weight. The trigger group holds most of the firing system and can be removed for cleaning by tapping out one pin. A tubular magazine is threaded into the receiver, and the barrel is collared to the magazine tube and held in place by the magazine cap. Fire controls include a tw-position top-tang safety and bolt release located just behind the trigger. The barrel and extension are machined from steel and button-drawn to the cylinder bore. The front sight has a high-visibility fluorescent orange stripe down its centre and is brazed onto the barrel. Metal parts wear a durable Parkerized finish.

As Combat Handguns’ Paul Scarlata puts it, 'everyone appreciates getting a lot of bang for the buck, something that Armscor understands very well.' Armscor manufactures an extensive line of firearms (distributed by Rock Island Armory here in the States), and the double-action/single-action M200 is one of its latest revolvers in .38 Special.The M200 has polymer, finger-groove grips for better control, a 4-inch barrel with a 3-inch underlug that protects the ejector rod, and a ramped-blade front sight paired with a square-groove rear sight machined out of the frame. Scarlata digs in further: 'Like many current production revolvers, the M200 uses a transfer bar ignition system. When forward, the hammer rests against the frame and cannot touch the frame-mounted firing pin. As the hammer is cocked, a bar is raised between it and the firing pin, which the falling hammer hits, pushing the bar forward to strike the firing pin and ignite the cartridge. The bar then drops down, leaving the hammer resting against the frame once more.Features:Caliber: .38 SpecialCapacity: 6Barrel Length: 4""Metal Finish: ParkerizedGrip Material: Rubbered-BlackAction: Single/Double Safety: transfer bar systemSight: Ramp front sight, wide square notch rear sightWeight: 1.76"
