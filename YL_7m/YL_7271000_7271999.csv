I have owned both the PPS and now the Shield, but maybe the Glock 43 will be my next one.I have rented the Shield and Glock 43 at the range x2 (and many others), but I enjoy buying them and using them at my leisure, then selling to get another."

      I have one .50 caliber Hawken for sale with a rather unique flintlock mechanism (I'm by far used to the caplock, I've never held a flint hawken in person before). It has some surface rust that needs attending near the touch hole but other than that appears to be in great shape. It is fairly short, fairly light, and fairly well balanced, and would make a great hunting or range rifle. It even has sling swivels.Price is firm and well below value. Shipping is $30.Boilerplate:Everything is shipped USPS Ground and arrives on your doorstep, as black powder guns don't require any special handling or transfers. I accept Paypal, bank transfer or money order.

The nDLC finish is exclusive to the Glock manufacturing process. The nDLC finish increases protection against corrosion and scratching and improves the ability of the pistol to function in degreased or adverse conditions. The nDLC finish will be exclusive to Gen5 pistols at this time. Accuracy: Glock Marksman Barrel - The Glock Marksman Barrel (GMB) features new barrel rifling which delivers improved accuracy. Versatility: Removal of the finger grooves on the grip - Removing the finger grooves improves the ergonomics of the grip. The absence of finger grooves improves the ability of the pistol to deliver a consistently comfortable grip to a wider range of customers, regardless of their finger size and whether or not gloves are worn. Ambidextrous Slide Stop Lever: The ambidextrous slide stop lever makes it easier for gun owners to quickly, safely and comfortably manipulate the slide whether they are left-handed or right-handed. Speed: Flared mag-well - The larger opening of the flared mag-well makes it easier to funnel the magazine into the mag-well, particularly in high-stress situations where fractions of seconds matter. Reliability: Glock's Safe Action System makes the handgun ready for use at any time. Three automatic independently operating mechanical safeties are built into the fire control system of the pistol and are operated by the trigger. The safeties protect against inadvertent firing when the pistol is dropped or receives any other abnormal shocks. Features: Glock Gen5 Magazine: The new Glock Gen5 magazine comes with an orange follower and a floor plate which is extended at the front for faster magazine change. The Glock Gen5 models also feature some of the proven Gen4 advantages, such as: Modular backstrap and beavertail system: Every Glock Gen4 and Gen5 model comes with backstraps in two sizes, each one with or without beaver tail. The multiple backstrap frame allows the users to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. Enlarged reversible magazine catch: The magazine catch of the Gen4 and Gen5 frames is reversible and enlarged towards the rear of the pistol. The reversible magazine catch is more user friendly to the shooter's reach and allows them to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol. RTF Rough textured frame surface: The Gen4 and Gen5 have a rough textured frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction, without being too aggresive. It is present on the frame as well as on the interchangeable backstraps."

I have owned both the PPS and now the Shield, but maybe the Glock 43 will be my next one.I have rented the Shield and Glock 43 at the range x2 (and many others), but I enjoy buying them and using them at my leisure, then selling to get another.

I have MANY more photos of the firearm in question, please just ask and I'm more than happy to send them. I apologize that I can only show one here, it's a very silly limitation.     I have for sale a Gunsmith's Special 1854 Enfield Tower musket. These saw action throughout India, Africa and Asia before being superseded by the advancement of cheaply produced rifled barrels. This is unmarked on the lock, allowing the owner to represent any number of years, styles, and armories. Everything else is ready to go right out of the box. This comes with a free new bayonet, that like most reproductions, will require machining to fit properly, as well as a free scabbard that is used. That is $100 value added for no charge.Details:-Furniture: Mild Carbon Steel & Pure Brass-Stock: Teak-Caliber: 60 (uses a .58 ball)-Length: 49""-Weight: 9.5lbIssues:-The gun needs a deep cleaning to get rid of the layers of factory goop protecting it.-The ""gunsmith"" portion is the missing nipple and what appears to be tar in the nipple well. It is this issue that accounts for the $125 discount, and a competent gunsmith should be able to repair it. The firearm takes Euroarm nipples.The price is firm, these sell for $500 online without the bayonet or scabbard. Shipping is $45.
Boilerplate:

Everything is shipped USPS Ground and arrives on your doorstep, as black powder guns don't require any special handling or transfers. I accept Paypal, bank transfer or money order. If you ask me 'if I can just accept a check and you'll arrange for someone to come get it and you promise to blah blah blah"", not only will you be ignored, but I WILL REPORT YOU AND YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS TO MY NEAREST FBI, BATFE, AND POLICE OFFICES.

I have MANY more photos of the firearm in question, please just ask and I'm more than happy to send them. I apologize that I can only show one here, it's a very silly limitation.    The 1854 Enfield Tower was designed with inferiority of force in mind. The British Empire was not about to trust colonial armies (having learned their lesson here in the USA among other colonial pursuits) with the state-of-the-art rifle-muskets of the time, so instead opted to make the same essential firearm, but smoothbored. Thus even if a colonial army rose in revolt, it would find itself sorely out-matched against British regulars. For sale is a single model of this, with no dating on the lock itself (so feel free to represent any armory or specific year you like best), as well as a new bayonet (requires machining to fit) for free, and a used scabbard, also for free. That is a $100 value added at no charge, in addition to the firearm itself being priced well below retaill value. Details:-Furniture: Mild Carbon Steel & Pure Brass-Stock: Teak-Caliber: 60 (uses .58 ball)-Length: 49""-Weight: 9.5lb
Price is firm, as stated this is well below retail. This sells for $500 without the bayonet or scabbard. Shipping is $45.

I have MANY more photos of the firearm in question, please just ask and I'm more than happy to send them. I apologize that I can only show one here, it's a very silly limitation.     I have a single Pedersoli that has some damage for sale here, priced well below retail to accommodate the cost of repair. No damage affects the actual function of the firearm, but the problem is severe enough that it will eventually cause issues.Issues:-Large crack in the stock in the front of the lock. At current it does not affect function, but I suspect (being a complete amateur at carpentry) that if the gun is fired consistently without addressing the damage, it will eventually cause the stock to break in two. I also believe it can be fixed, it is just far beyond my ability to do so. -Long storage life since the incident (reenacting) means the rifle's oil has picked up grime. A thorough cleaning is highly recommended (as it always is with black powder, really)Other than those issues, the gun functions just fine. For this gunsmith special I have included another gunsmith special; a Pedersoli bayonet ($150 value) that is free of charge. It is missing it's locking ring, but otherwise is fully functional and freshly sharpened. Pedersoli should be able to assist both with the stock and bayonet ring by calling their factory.Price is firm, 65% off a new Pedersoli or 40% off a used model, in exchange for you having to repair/replace the stock and clean it up a bit. Shipping is $50
Boilerplate:

Everything is shipped USPS Ground and arrives on your doorstep, as black powder guns don't require any special handling or transfers. I accept Paypal, bank transfer or money order. I do not accept anything else. If you ask me 'if I can just accept a check and you'll arrange for someone to come get it because you were deployed to Saturn and you super-duper promise to blah blah blah"", not only will you be ignored, but I WILL REPORT YOU AND YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS TO MY NEAREST FBI, BATFE, AND POLICE OFFICES.

Simple in its execution, yet robust and reliable, the revolutionary Strike Latchless Charging Handle offers forged 7075 construction, efficient side gas venting, and a solid, comfortable interface for the user. Reliable receiver lockup is achieved through a novel hidden spring mechanism that uses the Charging Handle insertion slot in the upper receiver charging handle channel. This channel features a natural radius that will not wear rapidly like the external, 90-degree edge of the standard CH latch area of the upper receiver. The flat spring bearing surface is much larger than a steel ball bearing, spreading force and wear out over a larger area. Increased service life is one benefit of this type of system, as is the comfort and peace of mind that come from a lack of moving or external components that can break or snag/catch on your gear and foreign objects. The solid aluminum construction is durable and provides a solid mounting point for the ISO Tabs, an add-on component that increases surface area for those using large optics and/or gloved hands. WARNING: For standard mil-spec AR15 only. Not rated for suppressors and /or full auto fire. Not for use on SBRs or pistol length barrels (<14.5"") Package include- 1x Ambi Charging HandleFeatures - Net Weight: 0.9 oz- Improved service life over competing designs.- Ambidextrous architecture.- Simple, sleek, snag free design.- High-efficiency Gas Vents.- 7075 Forged Aluminum Construction.- Modular Extended Latch options coming soon."

Picatinny scope mount that cost about $50 all ready for the scope of your choice. Ventilated foreward grip, sling mounts, poly stock. Comes with a 20 round magazine. Any questions about this fine firearm please just google Ruger ranch rifle, they're pretty standard.Personally this is my home defense gun, I've had many ruger mini-14's. You can load a new magazine a lot faster than reloading a shotgun. That says it all right there. Shot guns are good for those who can't aim. With a red dot sight you can aim very quickly. Versatile, can shoot game again if you aim, have taken down 2 bucks with a .223 one shot to the head. Will penetrate walls, cars, doors. Used one of these to chop through a cinder block wall one time. You can get 30 round or drum magazines. I have never had one single problem shooting a mini-14, not one jam of any type ever and I've shot many 1000's of rounds through my guns. This particular gun was a back up in my armory and not shot.Now everyone loves their black guns but I find Ruger's to outlast them. They're great guns to have if you don't want to tinker all day with your AR-15. If you just want a rifle you can throw under the front seat of your truck and have it work first time, every time, this is your gun. And it won't rust like a black gun.

Trigger is fantastic. Trade interests are: RM06 Type 2 RMR. Trades will be in person or you are shipping first. Currently at 5 P-09's and 2 P-07's,  its time to thin the herd. I've been using a dot more and more and don't want to cut this slide as it's discontinued,  silly as it may seem. 480.00 shipped FFL to FFL.  Or 440.00 face to face in Central PA, as my FFL charges 40.00 for shipping...... Will text or email pictures to interested parties."
