This has been my primary carry for about a year and although I do love this pistol I'm wanting a 9mm in a similar package. The pistol has Glock night sights professionally installed. I have 7 OEM 13 round mags, 5 of which have orange Vickers badepads on board. I do have the OEM base plates if interested. I also have 3 G22 OEM mags (15 rounders) and 1 ETS 30 round mag. This Glock also includes 3 gen4 recoil springs (standard springs). I have a wax color fill on the slide that can be easily removed with a toothpick if desired. This gun runs flawlessly, the ETS mag is actually very well constructed and I have had no issue with it. The other 10 mags are all drop free magazines. Please inquire for additional pics if interested. Roughly 500 rounds through the barrel. No modifications have been made except the night sights installed. Everything else is stock."

See missing parts below. The Gew 88 (commonly called the Model 1888 commission rifle) was a late 19th-century German bolt action rifle, adopted in 1888. It was developed by the Arms Commission in Spandau Germany. The Gew. 88 was originally manufactured for the 7,9x57 cartridge, loaded with nitro-powder. In 1902, Germany adopted the S-patrone (with lighter and much faster “Spitzer” or pointed bullet) many of the Gew.88 rifles were adapted for this new ammunition. These rifles (rechambered and re-grooved), are often referred to as “Gew.88S”, and are clearly marked with the letter “S” stamped on the top of receiver, in front of the ejection opening. A special feature of the G.88 rifle is the tubular barrel jacket, which is screwed onto the front of the receiver. This jacket is intended to protect the barrel from rough handling and elements. The overall condition is fair to good. The bore is bright and the rifling is solid. Made in 1891 at the Imperial Arsenal at Loewe Berlin. Serial Number 5356 matches: The barrel, receiver, stock. The bolt serial number does not match. The barrel cover has another serial number on it, likely swapped out when it was rechambered. There is a Prussian “crown” above an “S” cartouche on the buttstock. The receiver has the unit marking 164.R.5.64.   This rifle is all original and with factory modifications. It is missing the bolt head with extractor and ejector, rear sight, the cleaning rod and the magazine dust cover. The weapon is non-functional without the bolthead, extractor and ejector.
Here are the Specs: Gew.88 rifle. Caliber/ cartridge: 7.92x57 S-patrone. Overall length: 1240 mm / 48.8”. Barrel length: 740 mm / 29.1”. Weight, empty: 3.8 kg / 8.37 lbs. Magazine capacity: 5 rounds.

The action was trued during this time and all put in a Bell & Carlson 700 Titanium 1st generation stock. All work done by IT&D custom gun except mating the stock. Green paint on the barrel is simply Krylon and can be easily removed. Will include 46pcs of once fired brass. This was built to be a lightweight coyote rifle, but have switched to an AR platform. The LVSF was chosen due to the slightly heavier barrel, so it would take longer to heat up during bench sessions while still very light to carry over extended periods. I have far more money invested in this than the asking price, but have found something I would like to have. If this ad is up, then the gun is still available. All inquires asking if it is still for sale will be ignored."

Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.We accept visa/mastercard/discover at a 3% loss of cash. USPS money orders same as cash.If sending money order you will be required to obtain & send tracking number. 15.00 Shipping. NC. residence pay 6.75% sales tax.

Asking ""will you Take 250"", or can you meet in Luisville?"" Will not receive a response.Selling my Benelli Supernova 12 gauge pump shotgun. Has 18.5inch barrel, pistol grip stock, 4+1 capacity and sling attachments. Also has a button on the slide that when you press it and rack the slide it will eject the shell in the chamber but NOT load another from the tube, making it easier and quicker to change loads like buckshot-slug when hunting or lethal-lesslethal in HD. I would honestly keep this shotgun if the stock was adjustable or shorter. I am a short statured lefthanded shooter and the combo of the too long length of pull and the slide being so far foward makes it both uncomfortable and hard to get follow up shots. If I were to keep it I'd throw a +2 tube extension on it and a sling. Has less than 20 shells through it and is in great shape, has been in the closet for almost 2 years. I live in Garrison but will go as far as Maysville.WILL NOT take less than 300 cash, I could have sold it at least a dozen times for 250.
