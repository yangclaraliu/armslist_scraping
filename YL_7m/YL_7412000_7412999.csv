This Over under is like new with all the original manuals, 5 chokes, and case. The MSRP on this model 68631 shotgun is $3100. You won't find such a great deal anywhere else. Please take a look at the detailed pictures there are a few handling marks but overall excellent condition. I hope you have fun bidding on this beautiful shotgun.Here's what Beretta has to say: The 686 Onyx Pro Field hunting shotgun has all the functional features of our premium over-unders at a particularly attractive price. The premium, oil-finished walnut stock and fore end complement the gloss-finished blued receiver with gold P. Beretta engraving, not found on other 686 Silver Pigeon models. At its heart, it has the best-in-class 686 action, which is compact and low-profile while being extremely strong. Besides 12 and 20 gauge, this shotgun is also available with beautifully scaled-down actions for 28 gauge for a true premium-grade experience. Whether you take it to an upland hunt or to the clay range, the 686 Onyx Pro gives you the flawless performance and the classic looks of a Beretta. The 686 Onyx Pro Field is built on the legendary 686 action, a long-standing favorite among hunters and competitive shooters. It features two conical locking lugs at mid-action, right between the barrels, giving it great locking strength and durability while keeping the action’s profile considerably lower. The advantage is that the eye of the shooter is a lot closer to the plane of his supporting hand: considerably better swing and hand-eye coordination. The 12- or 20-gauge Silver Pigeon has impressed countless hunters for its efficient dimensions and fast handling. But if you see and bring to your shoulder a 686 Onyx Pro in 28 gauge, you will be doubly impressed by the premium feel of the petite action. These are scaled down to fit the smaller gauges without any extra weight or bulkiness--something that you normally find in shotguns prices several times as much as this. While not as elaborately decorated as our premium shotguns, the 686 Onyx Pro has all the elegance that you can expect from a Beretta. The beautiful oil-finished stock sports a beautiful and crisp checkering pattern, and the Schnabel fore-end adds to the classic flavor of this over-under. The glossy blued receiver is adorned with P. Beretta gold engraving blends perfectly with the stock and contributes to the gun’s graceful lines. This is a shotgun that has all the elements of a treasured heirloom."

When it arrived it had never had linseed oil on the stock or been disassembled. I cleaned and oiled it and put a small amount of raw linseed oil on the stock for preservation. I believe it to be unissued and only factory test fired. I disassembled it ONCE to complete a Carbine Club info sheet. It is ""Brand New"" on the inside. You can tell by the photos that this is not a ""put together"" or refinished Winchester. Take a look at the other listings of available Winchesters and compare them to this weapon. The stock inlets are like they were cut yesterday sharp and crisp. Stock shows the milling machine marks of the machinery on which it was made. The grip is the widest/thickest I've EVER had my hand on. The only wear is on the bolt blue where over the years I have opened and cleared the bolt for viewing of astonished collectors"

This pistol is practically new and there isnt a scratch on it. It comes with two magazines, the manual, plastic box and the original cardboard box with the specs on it. It would make a very good carry weapon. I would ask the buyer to see some ID... Tennessee drivers license and (preferably) Tennessee carry permit. I have mine as well.

It is assumed the Poles manufactured these carbines on Soviet machinery that was relocated into Poland. One reason for this assumption is that Soviet M44 production ceased in 1948 and the machines used to manufacture these carbines were no longer needed."

The buttstock is the Choate one-piece Dragunov stock. It is by far the most solid and ergonomic AK stock I've ever shouldered.It provides ideal cheek-weld and length-of-pull, completely fixing one of the most well known issues with AK ergonomics. Seriously, with this stock, an AK doesn't feel like an AK any more, it feels like a ""real"" rifle (and I say that as a big AK fan!)The handguard is from Magpul, and is also probably the most comfortable and functional AK foregrip you can buy. It is heat shielded.Looking to get a very reasonable $60 cash, or trade for 9mm ammo. I'm letting them go because I don't currently have a rifle for them, and they're just gathering dust.The photo shows the actual stockset, on an actual AK.

According to American Rifleman magazine, only 15,000 of these rifles were ever made & it is estimated that only 800 still exist in fully functional condition and this one with a serial number in the 1300's was one of the first ever made. It is in like new condition and appears to have never been exposed to the elements and probably has been fired less than 10 to 20 times. Besides being a wonderful collector's piece, this is probably the ""new"" shooters most perfect firearm. I purchased the rifle 5 years ago as the first rifle to be given to my 10 year old grandson but unfortunately, he developed & ultimately died from leukemia before we had the chance to enjoy it together. My only hope is that some other Father/Son and/or Grandpa/Grandson get the chance to enjoy it as a team.  The best way to reach me is via text to REDACTED however I will respond to emails but am somewhat slower if you choose that avenue. Price is modestly set at $500.00 and you are getting a bargain so negotiations are a waste of time. Serious inquiries from Tennessee residents LEGAL to own and/or buy a firearm and unafraid to show a valid & current TN Driver's License or Carry Permit are welcome. Inquiries from ""underage"", out-of-state and/or felons are a waste of your time & mine. God Bless and thanks for looking. By the way, I am retired military, a LEGAL TN Carry Permit Holder & life-long resident so you won't get any games from me. Please let me know if interested and if I can provide any additional information.Sincerely,Jim Morton"
