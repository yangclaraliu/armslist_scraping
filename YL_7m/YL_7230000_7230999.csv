The shotgun has a 9+round extension allowing for 13 2 3/4 inch shells to fit. comes with original 5 round tube as well. The shotgun is fun and features a 28inch barrel perfect for ducks and geese hunting.  Looking to sell so I can get a semi auto for competition. Pump is great but has it's limitations for speed. Would love to sell to some one getting into duck hunting as that was what I got it for and it was the first gun I ever purchased. Comes with original magazine tube and spring as well as 200 12 gauge shells, a 10 shell holder, box of clay pigeons. buy this shotgun and you will be able to go out the same day and blast away."

Has under 200 rounds through it and is practically brand new. The pistols are also very hard to find which is why I bought it in the first place but I just don't get out enough to shoot it. Want someone to sell to that will appreciate the gun and shoot it lots!

Love it all the same though, have a cheap sight on it, and am willing to throw that in with no extra charge, along with a thirty round magazine and case for it. The case is a hard back case. The rifle has had several hundren round through it, but the life of the weapon is still very much so good. I have gauged the weapon for barrel erosion, firing pin erosion, head spacing, and barrel straitness, all pass the tests. This rifle as I said has been well taken care of.

If you are not familiar with it, this is a trigger system for the ar15 platform. It is a trigger, sear,ambi safety, and stripped carrier. It is an easy install for anyone. What this trigger does is gives you your standard safety mode, single fire mode, and echo mode which gives you a BANG on the pull of the trigger, and a BANG on the release of the trigger. There is a 6 month waiting period to get this trigger from fostech. There are a ton of videos out there on the trigger, so if you are interested in it and unfamiliar with it, watch a video on youtube. I'm open to trades of all sort.

It has the xlr reticle which has subtensions out for windage holdovers. The scope is in MOA. The scope itself is in great condition, it does have a small nick in the top of it, but it does not affect it. It was mounted on a 300 win mag and held its zero perfectly, and I was able to shoot sub moa groups with this scope on the rifle. The only reason I am selling is that I have replaces it with a vortex Razor for the increased elevation. It does come with the lense covers (elastic straps) the only thing with the covers is that the 50mm objective cover was trimmed on the bottom to still fit the scope with the 30 moa scope mount (wasn't enough space between the scope and barrel to allow for the cover, this was trimmed by a local gunsmith who built the 300 win mag). This includes the scope, the lense covers, sunshade, original box (not damaged), all paperwork (owners manual, reticle manual), zero stop shims, and a set of Burris low 30 mm rings. This scope retails for $900 on midwayusa and other sites. I am asking $650. Also this is backed by vortex's VIP warranty that transfers and doesn't require prof of purchase. They will fix or replace their products, which is why I always buy their scopes. If you need additional information or pictures please email."
