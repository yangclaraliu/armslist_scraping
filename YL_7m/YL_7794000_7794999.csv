Thanks for looking.  The gun is located in Rockford, Michigan and all applicable laws will be followed in the transfer of this rifle.  Please email, call, or text if you are interested: REDACTED."

It was primarily purchased for longer range shooting and hunting. Ended up getting a short action cartridge for long range and won’t be hunting for a couple years due to having a newborn, so deciding to sell. Please read the whole post, as this rifle comes with lots of extras including ammo. Great deal if you reload or plan to reload.This was my 3rd long range project and only got started. I performed a slow barrel break in and cleaning, and fire formed all the Norma brass I purchased. I will provide you with my load development notes so you can continue project if desired. I shot only a total of 127 rounds through this and half of that was initial break in and cleaning. Before brass was fire-formed was getting under 1moa (normally .80) without load development. With load development this will shoot exceptionally. Great long range rifle, for someone that hunts or wants to get into long range shooting.

Sierra MatchKing bullets have very thin jackets and are held to exacting tolerances in diameter and weight. These Hollow Point Boat Tail bullets have a small meplat to produce a higher ballistic coefficient. Their accuracy has been acclaimed worldwide and they have been used to win more target competitions than all target bullets from other manufacturers combined. The 30 Caliber 175 Grain MatchKing was developed along with military experts for use in the M21, M24 and M40A1 sniper systems. It then generated a large amount of interest by long range competitive shooters due to its high ballistic coefficient and ability to remain supersonic at 1000 yards out of a 308 Winchester. This is not loaded ammunition.Technical Information* Caliber: 30* Bullet Diameter: 0.308* Bullet Weight: 175 Grains* Bullet Style: Hollow Point Boat Tail Ballistics Information: * Sectional Density: 0.264* Ballistic Coefficient: 0.505"

Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TX driver’s license or permit.  I’m in College Station so anywhere in the Austin, Houston, DFW triangle is ok if we can meet halfway to save driving.If the ad is still up, the gun is still available. Cash only please so I can go buy something else. I’m not really looking for a trade and definitely not low-ball offers. Thanks!"

Both guns have a magazine (the larger one fits in the compact frame as well) and night sights! If you aren't familiar with the P250, it's Sig's modular handgun. This means the only part that's a registered firearm is the trigger module, meaning the frames, barrels, etc. can be shipped without an FFL and interchanged easily (i.e., changing the color/size of the frame is easy and inexpensive!). This is an excellent system if you want one to carry and one for the range, or maybe a couple with different sized hands both want to shoot. I'd prefer a cash sale but will reply to all trade offers as well. Please contact me with any more questions. Thanks!"
