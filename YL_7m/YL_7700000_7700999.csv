Comfortable to Conceal and Carry Weighing only 11.5oz unloaded, this double-action-only (DAO) pistol is comfortable and unobtrusive to carry, no matter your preferred mode. The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts. Soft-recoiling and Absolutely Reliable The Pico is soft-recoiling and makes target recovery lightning-quick after every shot, thanks to its minimal barrel tilt. This feature also makes feeding utterly reliable, even with more open hollowpoint designs or the hotter .380 commercial loads. This means that when you need it for concealed carry or home protection, the Pico will always deliver the performance you expect of a Beretta. Easy to Disassemble and Customize, Loaded with Features, Made in USA Like its slightly bigger brother the Nano, the Pico is engineered to be easy and intuitive to take apart and reassemble. Its heart is a serialized modular chassis, meaning that the frame can be easily swapped to accommodate the user's preferences. Shipped with a storage case and two 6+1 stainless steel magazines (one flush, one with grip extension), the Pico features adjustable, quick-change sights with no gunsmithing required. It also offers ambidextrous magazine release, as well as a super-low-profile slide-release lever to keep the slide open when desired. The Pico is made in USA and brings all the reliability and quality of Beretta as the leader of a new generation of concealed-carry firearms."

Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing. Easy to Conceal Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days. Easy to Use and Maintain The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA."

It's Winchesters model 1911 nicknamed the Widow maker. There wasn't too many made because of its design of being a barrel charge shotgun. So some thought it would be a good to charge by placing the butt on the ground and pushing down on the barrel. Not a good idea. Thus the nickname widow maker. But to a Winchester collector it was an important shotgun. This was Winchesters first autoloader. It's a 12 gauge and was produced in 1917 so it has reached its 100 year anniversary. This shotgun is still in good working order, but really a nice collection piece. This shotgun is a easy take down."

BUT IF YOU WANT SOME OF IT THE PRICES ARE STILL HEAVILY DISCOUNTED AND THE GEAR IS ALL NEW/LIKE NEW CONDITION. NOW'S THE TIME TO BUY, TOWARD THE END OF THE SEASON, BECAUSE YOU WILL PAY MORE FOR IT NEXT FALL. IF YOU GET IT NOW THEN YOU ALREADY HAVE IT FOR FALL AND SAVED TONS OF MONEY. YOU'RE READY!!!A.  3 Rig Em Right Deluxe Slotted Decoy bags.  Retail is $89.95 each at Sportsman's Warehouse.   These are the best bags and have exta slots that will hold one full size mallard and 3 medium ducks for 16 decoys each,  or if you put teal in 1 pair in each main slot with the decoys bottom to bottom, then it will hold 30 teal. $55 each or $150 for the whole bunch. THESE REALLY ARE THE BEST WAY TO STORE, PROTECT AND CARRY YOUR DECOYS, AND THEY TAKE UP LESS SPACE IN THE BOAT THIS WAY TOO. ONCE YOU TRY THESE YOU WILL NEVER EVER WANT TO USE ANY OTHER DECOY BAG. THEY ARE HONESTLY THAT GOOD. WHY DO YOU THINK I BOUGHT 3 OF THEM.  SERIOUSLY, THESE ARE THE BEST THING GOING FOR WHAT YOU SPEND, EVEN IF YOU BUY THEM BRAND NEW AT THE STORE.  I JUST CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THEM. THEY WORK GREAT!B.  1,000 gram thinsulate   Size XXL, Rustic Ridge Waterfowl waders with boot.  These are 3.5mm thick and retail for about $180 new at Sportsman's Warehouse.

Sell for $125D.  1 case of 3 inch magnum Black Cloud Snow Goose BB's and are 1 1/8 ounce at 1635fps.  This stuff hammers geese. I used some from a differenct case  in Canada a few years back and doubled on Specs at 40 yards with it and other geese closer in.   Thes price on these varies from $185 per case on sale to $229 a case at some places. I got these from Rogerssportinggoods.com (best and cheapest place to get your waterfowl ammo and they ship duck ammo free of charge to get your business)  I will sell these for $105 for the whole case, which is 10 boxes of 25 shells each for a total of 250 shells in perfect condition. They are new and in the original case.  E. 3 boxes of Kent Fast Steel and I think it's 1480 fps with an 1 1/4 ounce of 3 shot.  3's will kill mallards and teal. Big ducks and little ducks. I know Phil Robertson Duck Commander personally and they use 3 inch magnum #3's on ducks.  The reason I say it works on teal as well is because they are a smaller duck, so the extra pellet count fills in the 30 inch pattern better than 2's do, yet 3's will also reliably kill mallards.  3 boxes for $35. CALL OR TEXT AND MAKE YOUR OFFER ON THIS GREAT GEAR.

I bought this gun this summer and used it for one season so its in almost new condition. The gun has a fully rifled barrel with a cantilever scope mount, so you don't lose your zero when taking the barrel off to clean the gun. The cantilever scope mount also means you can put a smooth bore barrel on it without having to take off your scope. It has a set of mid-height rings and a 2-7x32 prostaff shotgun scope by Nikon. The prostaff scope has a BDC reticle on it that, when coupled with the Nikon app, tells you where your point of impact is out to 150 + yards. I also installed an all black Remington ShureShot stock that is sleek and very comfortable to shoot. I got groups of about 1.5"" at 100 yards using Hornady 300gr SST shotgun slugs.

I first bought this shotgun brand new two years ago as a stock VEPR 12 with a folding stock. Since then I had the professionals at Legion USA cut the barrel to 13"" and re-thread it for a ""GK-02 Ilyin"" that was welded and permanently attached giving it the overall legal shotgun barrel length of 18"". I also had a gunsmith professionally fit and install a Zentico B-20U hand guard as well as a Molot competition magwell. The grip has also been replaced with a Zenitco PK-3 pistol grip for the AK. I also have a Zenitco PK-1 front AK grip on the hand guard. The trigger is an ALG AKT trigger that makes this thing an absolute dream to shoot! This VEPR also has the snake hound machine heavy springs kit as well as a KNS precision front ball sight post. I may have missed some upgrades but all in all I have just over $2,400 in this with all the parts and gun smithing labor.

Uses the well-mannered 32 ACP round. I believe it holds 6 + 1 with one magazine. Until the 1980s most European law enforcement agencies used 32 ACP as their standard caliber. 32 ACP is more controllable and has less recoil than the more common defensive 380acp and 9mm rounds. While the wood grips look good the Chrome is very rough. That's why it's price so low.  Small conceal carry pistol, but pretty heavy for its size."

You won't find a X95 on FGT, Armslist or gunbroker priced this low with the upgraded parts and IWI bag.
The X95 (Micro TAVOR) is an innovative three-caliber firearm that is a combined assault rifle, carbine and sub-machine gun (SMG). Leveraging its advanced technology, the X95 can be converted in minutes from 5.56MM caliber to 9MM caliber to 300 Blackout caliber and vice versa. This leap in innovation makes it possible to use the same weapon platform for highly diverse scenarios. Its compatibility with different ammunition calibers also saves training time, spare parts and significantly reduces TCO.

This one is 5.56MM Model with exactly 20 rounds fired. It’s in pristine condition and has just about every available factory upgrade installed. The following factory upgrade parts are currently installed on this X95. The total for all the parts/bag are $446.95 and the X95 was $1720 brand new. All factory parts will be included. I basically have $2167 into this gun.
