You might confirm with your reference material. This gun is used but in mint in box (MIB) 99% condition and appears to be test fired only by the original owner. It was purchased as NIB unfired by me a few years ago here on GB and has remained a safe queen in my collection. I haven't fired the gun since I've owned it. This 40 year old Colt is a great example of a very desirable gun. This gun has nicely grained factory grips. The worn, tattered, and taped original factory box and the factory literature shown in the photos are included. But please base your purchase decision on your own review of these high resolution photos. This gun is from my personal collection. I am a discriminating collector and I believe you will be very pleased with this gun in your own collection."

A rubber combat grip is installed which greatly enhances pointability and control.  The low recoil of the 9mm combined with the all steel construction and ergonomic grip make this gun is a great shooter.  Feed ramp and magazine catch have been polished to smooth operation. This version is  one of the later imports and uses the dedicated ""skinny"" type 9mm magazines. Standard 7.62x25 Tokarev magazines can be used by removing the spacer within the magazine well.  Short grip heel and slim profile make it a great carry option. Asking $285 I also have an extra 7.62x25mm barrel which I would be willing to sell with the gun for an additional $150."

Others may request a “background check” from a local sheriff and submit a copy of that in lieu of other credentials.  If you carry regularly or are prepared to use a firearm for your own self-defense - this class is essential in it's knowledge and attitude shaping."
