That person had the barrel chopped (shorter than I would have) but didn't go any further with it.What you see here is the following:Izhevsk M44 built in 1944. Good bore. AK74 muzzle brake threaded and installed by a speciality gunsmith in Pensacola, FL.Monte Carlo stock. No I don't have the original Russian stock - sorry!Pensacola gunsmith also did a trigger job too, and it's smoother than any M91-30 or M38.Magazine and action are held together with bedding pillars, and aftermarket screws. JMeck scope mount, and a classic Bushnell 1-4 power scope. The nicest feature of this rifle is the Max Shepard bolt. I went all the way with it. I'm making the deal sweet by adding in a box of hornady, and a half box of Brown Bear. I'd be glad to meet in the Cranberry area, or in Harmarville or Moon areas as I frequent those parts of town. I am out of town quite a bit, so please be patient when you reach out to me.I am usually in town Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Thanks"

This is a 1942 Sako M39 with a wartime stock, chambered in 7.62x54r.I've got a large picture gallery that shows the rifle in extensive detail here:https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mosinimg/mosin.htmlFeatures of this rifle include:- Number matching receiver and bolt (Finnish matching; original Russian bolt number is scratched out)- Non-matching floorplate- Shiny bore with strong rifling- Original cleaning rod- Non-original slingThree other features about the rifle condition are worth mentioning:1. The barrel IS counterbored. I tried to show it in the pictures, and hopefully you can see that the last inch or so of the barrel before the muzzle is smoother and darker than the rest of it. This doesn't seem to affect performance, however; I was easily hitting a steel target at 250yd with this rifle.2. The import marks are very discreet; I actually had to look really hard for them. They are located on the underside of the barrel immediately above the cleaning rod. I've taken a picture, but in reality you have to hold the rifle up to the light and close to your face to see the import marks properly. If you don't look for them, you won't see them.3. I've inspected the rifle closely and determined that, while there are several gouges in the stock (I tried to show this in the pictures), there are no cracks.In terms of the bore, the best way I can describe it is shiny (seems just shy of mirror shine), strong pronounced rifling, and no pitting, frost, or dark spots that I'm able to identify. (When shining a bore light through the barrel, it's kind of blinding because it reflects the entire way down.)I am happy to answer any questions about the rifle.SHIPPING:I am an individual with a C&R license. I am happy to ship to a C&R license holder, or any FFL of your choosing. I will ship to any state, but I will only ship to FFL01 holders in CA and NY.If I am shipping to an FFL01, it is the buyer's responsibility to make sure that their FFL will accept shipments from an individual. I will call the FFL before shipping to confirm with them as well.Shipping is via USPS, and should not exceed $50 for priority mail (including insurance and signature required). I am happy to offer a quote based on the shipping ZIP code.PAYMENT:Face to face purchases are cash only. No trades, please.If I am shipping, I will accept USPS Money Order, Certified Check, or personal check as payment. For personal checks I will hold the rifle until the check clears. I will ship it out the following business day."

It has an 8.5"" barrel with 1/2x36 threads on it, and has a 7"" free float keymod rail with flip up backup sights. Magpul MOE+ grip and I'm including five 31rd ETS mags. Also included is a Bushnell Holosight red dot. Asking $850 for the package, will sell for $650 without the Bushnell Holosight.Next is a second pistol upper that I swapped out a few times with the setup above. it is a 10.5"" barrel with 1/2x28 threads on it, and it has a 9"" keymod free float rail installed with fixed A2 style sights on top. Asking $225 for the upper as pictured, or $200 with the above gun listed.Would also consider trades, I would love a Sig P226 in .357 sig, but would be happy with a .40s&w that I could get a .357 barrel for (or maybe you have both barrels with it). I also love CZ's, and would especially love a suppressor ready CZ P-09 in 9mm. Will consider other Sigs or CZ's, possibly a nice 1911 or maybe a 10mm. I also really like the Ruger Redhawk .45acp/.45 colt revolvers or a Redhawk 8 shot .357mag. As you can see my interests are all over the place... If you're interested, send me a message and maybe we can work something out. I would also give a serious cash discount to anyone interested in all of it at once."

The handgun is in excellent condition and has been properly cared for. It was purchased around 6 months ago and has approximately 300 rounds through it.I had a gunsmith install a Ghost Trigger 4.5 - Ranger trigger bar so the trigger is slightly lighter and more consistent (not too light or too heavy). I still have the factory trigger bar that will be included with the gun. This part is replaceable so you can always install the orginal. The original box, 2 magazines and backstraps are included (The backstraps are not cerakoted, as they came from the factory in standard black). A bill of sale will be required to purchase the Glock, and I am only willing to meet in a public place. If you are not prepared to provide your DL # and sign the bill of sale then please do not contact me. Thank you for your interest!"

The Valor series is our flagship line, meaning it’s the best we have to offer. Frankly, we feel it is the best built production 1911 on the market.
The V-Bob is loaded with features, including a forged Bobtail frame with 25 LPI checkering front and back, an undercut trigger guard, tactical ledge night sights, VZ slim line G10 grips, EGW carry bevel bushings as well as our tool-steel fire controls and other premium small parts. Every piece that goes into the Valor series is hand-fit, polished and blended to provide you with not only the best functioning gun we can provide, but also the best looking.
The V-Bob can be had with either a matte stainless glass bead finish or our super durable black Duty finish. This finish is a revolutionary treatment process that actually bonds to the components and creates a super-durable matte black skin. Our Duty Black finish beats any of the spray-and-bake finishes most companies use today, hands down. Our durability testing proves it and our customers love it – which is proof enough for us!"
