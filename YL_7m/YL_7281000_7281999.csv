As such, my prices are fixed. Thank you!First, my preban Russian FM-AK47-11. Will sell with authentic RPK74 furniture worth $200, and a rare Russian 40rd RPK magazine worth $60 (not pictured). An awesome and handy RPK built at the legendary Molot war factory in Russia. 2017 production.Selling at cost. Paid $1100 after tax and then paid for the Russian accessories. If you don't like the purist stuff, sell it all and you'll probably have even less than 1100 in this preban that sells for way more on gunjoker/armslist.Rifle is perfect. Laser straight. Must I get into the details? It's a VEPR. You get what you pay for. $1299. Second, I'm selling an Aimpoint Comp M4. SOLD THANK YOU!Third is my Glock 19 manufactured and test fired in Austria. This is an exceptionally rare Glock as not many 19s were inspected and tested overseas.The story of this handgun is that when Obama first took office, the run on Glocks was so rough that Glock in Austria had to sell pistols destined to European LE agencies and the Iraqi army to the US. The demand was too high, and a few of the Eagle marked 19s made it stateside before production finally caught up. They came with the older, better ""frying pan"" slide finish. Less than 1K rounds fired. Comes with Israeli Meprolite night sights and an awesome $200 stipple job. Maritime cups. Books, box, test cartridges, etc. Larry Vickers baseplate extended magazine release, and slide catch installed. Surefire XC1 and IWB holster can be included for a discount. $500!Finally, I'm selling my folding stock Molot VEPR 12 semi auto shotgun.  SOLD THANK YOU"

New Haen, Ct, USA, Patented Oct 11 1887 April 2, 1889. August 1, 1893"" in two lines ahead of the rear sight and ""Special smokeless Steel"" is boldly roll-stamped on the left side of the barrel below the rear sight.  The caliber designation ""30-30"" is stamped on the top of the barrel between the rear sight and the receiver.  ""Marlin Safety"" is roll -stamped on the top of the receiver in script letters with small foliate designs on either end of the marking.  The servial number is stamped across the bottom of the receiver.  The upper receiver tang is roll-stampedwith the designation ""Model/<1893>,"" with arrows on either side of ""1893."" In 1905 the tang marking was changed to ""Model/93,"" the tang & barrel markings indicate that this rifle was probably manufactured c. 1904-05.  The Model 1893 rifle was the first Marlin lever-action rifle manufactured for smokeless powder cartridges.  The rifle retains at least 99% plus of the original blue finish on the marrel, magazine, forearm cap, loading gate, hammer and buttplate.  The receiver, bolt & lever have virtually all of the firey, vivid, original case colors.  The stock & forearm are in excellent condition & retains ALL of the original varnish finish.  The walnut wood is in near perfect condition.  The barrel & receiver markings are crisp.  The bore is bright.  This is an extraordinary example of a Marlin Model 1893 Lever-Action Rifle.
