Some of these handguns are of questionable legality, and dubious ownership. Before you wire your hard earned money to NYC and thereabouts, make sure you are dealing with the legal owner of the firearm, the firearm is on a valid NYS Permit, and that all transfer arrangments are made in accordance with State and Federal Law through an FFL. All it would take for legitimate firearms owners to lose this website in NY would be one bad transaction, or one deal through an anti-gunner or NYC cop trying to entrap someone."

I have too many Mini-14s (3).  Just got a deal on a Tactical so something needs to go.  I've got a 581 series Stainless Ranch Rifle that has the heavy, tapered barrel.  Comes with two 20 round mags, Ruger scope rings and a stainless Accustrut.  Also has Wilson .45 ACP front and rear shock buffers.
At the first range session I was getting shot stringing with a warm barrel.  I added the Accustrut and it ended the stringing.  It shoots 1"" 50 yard groups with cheap Fiocchi 55 gr. FMJ and iron sights.  It has had under 100 rounds through it.  Never a malfunction of any kind.

The metal is excellent and the wood is very nice. This AK has grenade launching capability and grenade launching sight as shown in the pictures.

The rifle shoots the popular 7.62x39 caliber. It is very accurate, features a threaded muzzle with a slant brake installed Two mil-surp metal 30 round mag's and Green canvas sling,bayonet lug,bayonet and scabbard (number matching) and heavy duty bipod with 200 rounds of Ammo,upgraded Black fore end with UltiMAK M9 optic mount ( Wood Fore end Included ).Barrel: 16 1/4"", Overall: 34 1/4"".

The rifle is a combination of original Yugoslavian rifle parts and U.S.-made compliance parts. The fit and finish of the rifle is more than acceptable, with an evenly applied Parkerized finish and an above-average-condition wood fore-end.

The M70B1 has some novel features that set it apart from the run-of-the-mill AK variant. First, it has the enlarged and reinforced area around the trunnion like the RPK on its stamped receiver. In addition, a unique grenade ladder sight located on the gas block, when rotated into its upward open position, provides meter range marks and cuts off the gas port in the gas block. Also, the rifle features front and rear flip-up night sights, although the luminous material has long since disappeared. Has a smooth and comfortable trigger."

SKS is in 8/10 condition. This is the paratrooper model, which is noticeably shorter than a conventional SKS. Appears to have never been issued. Just stowed in cosmoline until a collector who recently acquired it gave it a home in a gun safe. Gun shows some scuffs and scratches from light use, especially around the takedown latches. SKS's just aren't my bag, so Im letting her go. Interested in any 7.62AK and ammo.

463,http://www.armslist.com/posts/81463,For Trade:  Cub Cadet IH 682 Tractor for trade,"Macedon, Rochester, New York",Offer,"Listed On: Friday, December 31, 2010",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"picked up this IH built 682 with a badly blown Kohler kt-17 last year. I swapped in a freshly rebuilt (by me with Kohler parts) K-301 12hp from a IH Cub Cadet 1250. I used all the correct 82 series engine mounts for the swap, and it fits perfectly. The electric clutch works perfectly, and lines up correctly, as does the muffler. It starts up and runs very nice. I replaced the hydro pump as the old one had a worn swashplate....so I just replaced the pump, but I do have a good swash plate now to swap into the old pump if someone is interested. I started to adjust the linkages and got it pretty much where it needs to be, but winter set in, and I put it on the back burner so I could get my garage re-arranged for winter. It runs great and drives good..but needs some adjusting of the rods, and linkages. I did also notice that after I first started it up it dripped a little hytran from a seal on the pump.....but it seemed to stop after running it for a while, and now it doesn't leak..possible just dry seals from sitting, I don't know, but it seems good now. 
Sheet metal is all in good shape...normal scratches from tree limbs and such, but no major dents or dings, hood ornament is missing..lights all work, steering is nice and tight, tires are ok..some cracking..but not too bad....it also comes with a mule drive and 44"" deck that mows nice..it needs some welding on the runners, but still pretty solid. 

Overall its a great running solid tractor, and I love the 82 series Cub tractors, but I'm itching for something else.  

 Myself and the 682 are located in Macedon, ny 20 miles East of Rochester , Ny  ...drop me an e-mail and we'll take it from there, Trade only please...Thanks! 


Here is a short video of my son driving it after the engine swap this fall.. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkQenD6demM"

This one fires 7.62x54R (about a 30-06), considered a knock off Dragunov but more like an AK-47. Most consider these to be sniper rifles and they can be accurate out to about 1000 yards or so but in reality they are a “squad” rifle and are designed to reach out to 500-800 yards with ease. These are starting to dry up and becoming harder and harder to find, the real Dragunov back in the day was about the same price before the ban now you can’t touch one for under $4000.00. Last year at this time they were plentiful and could be had for $500 or less, try that now. This is a good investment piece or if you just like to plink the ammo for these are relatively cheap (880 rounds for $170 or so shipped). Also the WOW factor at the range is pretty nice! 


This PSL/ROMAK is in 98% condition, only very slight wear from being taken in and out of the safe. Looks to be fired VERY lightly (50 rds or less I would say). Comes with (1) 10rd mag and the factory scope (the ones for sale below do not come with a scope, the scope is at least another $75-100 by themselves). This also includes a military scope cover. 

I would like to hang on to it and sell it down the road for a lot more however times are tough so in thinning the safe this one had to go. The first one here with $700 cash takes it, my loss is your gain. Thanks for looking and have a happy new year!

This is a factory new, unfired, Century Arms Polish M1960 milled AK-47 rifle in the popular 7.62x39mm caliber. The M1960 is built from original first generation AK parts on a new US made milled receiver and with a new proper med-heavy 16"" long barrel. This has the original Soviet milled AK look and feel. The AK-47 is perhaps the most famous assault rifle in the world. Prototypes appeared in 1946 and fullscale production had begun by 1951. The original AK used a heavier barrel, milled receiver, silver bolt carrier, bayonet lug under the front sight block, ported gastube, 14mm threaded barrel, and differently shaped furniture. In 1959, Russia switched to the cheaper and lighter AKM, which used a stamped receiver and had a lighter barrel. Poland began making a licensed built copy of the original milled AK in 1960 and this is what this semi-auto rifle is based upon. The M1960 was virtually a clone of the original Soviet AK-47, produced at the famous Radom factory, known for its quality and good fit and finish. The rifle I am selling here is new, unfired. It comes in the original box. It has all the early aK-47 features including 14mm threaded barrel, type I bayonet lug, original laminated furniture, and even the original Polish pistol grip. It comes with 1-10 round magazine, proper bayonet with scabberd and cleaning kit. These are neat rifles for someone wanting an early style of aK, an accurate shooter, or just a fun range toy. Over the last year, the US made ATM milled receiver has prooven to be reliable and durable.  If you have any questions at all, please feel free to contact me

Just took this out and shot it for the first time last week.  This rifle is dead on and love the dual set trigger which gives you a great hair trigger.  The only reason I want to sell it is to pay for parts for my van and or get more .357's.  I am not in a financial bind and I don't have to sell it.  The price listed is the price I paid so I will not go any lower.
