The hammer has a couple of spots on it, that I have tried to get off, but didn't want to scrub on it too much. See pics, I did take a close-up of it. Also on the right side of the slide there is some discoloration in the bluing. It is very slight, but it is there. I bought this a few years ago from a gentleman selling his collection. He bought it new and never fired it. I couldn't resist and put the 21 rounds thru it. Anyway, he stored it in the box, and that is what I believe caused the discoloration.
It will come with one mag. and the box. The manual is MIA. Anyway a very nice piece.

Norinco SKS – all matching serial numbers – very good condition. Comes with what you see – scope (Leapers 6x32) and receiver mount, original matching # receiver mount, bayonet lug bipod, bayonet, 4 stripper clips. Bayonet lug bipod works great at the range, I like the actual bayonet on there when the gun is just laying around – looks way more impressive! Shoots great, very accurate, very clean. 

Second:
Ruger 10/22T – used, but not abused – stock and barrel are very nearly perfect, only signs of external wear are on the scope mount (which is included) and a small mark at the very tip of the barrel. Also very clean, a true tack driver! Add a scope and you are ready to go! Includes attached scope mount and one 10round magazine. 

$350 each, or I’ll do $650 for both.

Only permanent modification is a small hole (pluggable) drilled into bolt-face to accommodate the firing pin. Fully functional rifle: ejects, feeds, and magazine works correctly! Not bad for 130 years old! Walnut stock restored by non-abrasive methods and painstakingly finished with raw linseed oil (original finish). Hardware and receiver left in the original “white steel,” without use of abrasives. Cartouches and marks are intact. Barrel has browned with age. Bore is dark (in grooves) with light pitting but good sharp rifling. Barrel has been pressure lapped using the Ross Seifreid method. It shoots as well as the sights allow. Barrel slugged nominally .429-.430; twist rate works optimally with heavy 44 Mag bullets. The Lee 310 grainer is great. I have fifty 8mm Lebel cases cut and formed in Lee 41 Swiss dies (included in package) to go with it. Cleaning rod is a homemade look-alike. She’s wearing an old M1907 sling, which works as well as any on such a long rifle. 41 Swiss is approximately equal to 44 Mag in power IMR 4759 works, but I have used FF Black Powder and American Pioneer Replica Blackpowder as well. I have enjoyed her, but now I hope somebody will enjoy her as much as I did. Antique; can ship to doorstep with copy of driver’s license. She’s clean and covered with rust-inhibitor. FTF or USPS shipping $20."

Stock a bit rough but no crack or splits even in the handguard. The arsenal disk indicates almost a perfect barrel/throat condition, which is somewhat unusual. Barrel does indeed look excellent and it shoots very well. Around 1.5 MOA with quality handloads.
6.5x55 is available just about anywhere a good selection of rifle ammunition is found (BassPro). Remington loads it as does PrviPartizan of which I can sell you all you want for $13 per 20 round box locally.
The sights are calibrated for 300 meters, so I bought a taller front post and filed it down so it’s on a 100 yards. I have original sight. They are very good adjustable sights. The overall quality and condition of this rifle is very good. No rust, though a lot of blueing has worn away. Trigger is a somewhat heavy 2-stage. The Swedes made these during peacetime with the greatest attention to quality and condition. No other Mauser is made as well, is as smooth, or is chambered in as good a caliber. I have the very basic carrying strap, sight hood, cleaning rod, stripper-clips ($1 ea), and bayonet ($25) for it as well. 
The small ring Mausers make superlative sporterizing candidates for Eastern game like Whitetails. 6.5x55 is a truly superlative cartridge with excellent range, great accuracy, and moderate recoil. Off-the-shelf parts are available for this rifle that can take you anywhere you want to go. I even have an inletted walnut sporter stock for it for $50
I have Mojo Aperture rear sight for this rifle for $50. 6.5x55 Reloading dies for $20.

Round count is 84.  It has a NF 20 MOA rail and a APA Little Bastard Brake, bolt knob and trigger worked by Short Action Customs.  The trigger is perfect in my opinion.  This is a great example of a 5R that has had the work most of them need and it performs very well.  It would be a great rifle to drop into a AICS chassis.

Here's what I'm looking for.  I need something semi-automatic and handy as a partial trade.  There are also some bolt action surplus rifles I'm interested in too.  

I'd value my rifle at $1300 trade, $1150 sale plus shipping. 

I also have a Vortex Viper 6.5-20x44 Mildot and a set of TSR rings that I could put with it depending what's offered or if someone is interested as a package.  I won't sell the scope separate until the rifle sells.  $375 including rings with rifle.   

Everyone here knows what things are worth so I'm just going to list items I'm interested in.  If you need to offer some cash, please do so.  I'm not going to trade even for a near stock AR or a Romak PSL.  

Trade: 
AR15 .223 or 6.5 Grendel.  18"" or 20"" with some type of aftermarket trigger. (very interested in another AR need brass, dies, etc. for Grendel)

FNAR (even)

M1 Garand

Romak PSL 7.62x54r

M1A (I'd probably need to do the package on my end depending on the level of rifle). 

Swiss K31 (also interested in dies and brass for this one as well). 

I'm also interested in .22 rimfire rifles (CZ, Savage, Izhmash, Ruger 10/22). 

Ruger .22 pistol (Mk III 22/45)

.357 Magnum (Taurus, Ruger SP101) 4"" barrel, adjustable sights. 

Keltec .380

Ruger LCP .380

IOR 4x24 Prefer Dragunov Reticle but will consider others (M1 or M2 with ocular focus)

Mix and match is fine.  If you're interested in trading some items, please list your items with what you would value them at in your email or pm. 

I may add items as I think of them.  If you have something along these lines that's not listed feel free to contact me.   

Tag here and pm or email.  

On sales or cash with trade, I can accept discreet paypal buyer pays 3.5% fees or US Postal Money orders only.  

Here are the pics of the rifle.  Everyone knows what a Vortex Viper looks like but I can take pics if needed.

The Z2 is a compact high-output flashlight featuring a CombatGrip™ body. It uses a precision micro-textured reflector and a SureFire incandescent lamp to produce a smooth, brilliant beam with enough power to temporarily blind and disorient an aggressor by impairing his night-adapted vision. Output is either 65 or 120 lumens, depending on which easy-to-install lamp you use—high-output or ultra high-output. The tactically-correct pushbutton tailcap switch provides secure, ergonomic activation control: press for momentary-on, twist for constant-on. The Z2's patented CombatGrip™ body improves performance with various flashlight/handgun techniques, such as the Rogers/SureFire technique, and provides a secure hold in wet or cold conditions or while wearing gloves.

I’ve owned probably a dozen of these in the last 50 years, shot them all and never remember a misfire of any kind. They are easy to break down for cleaning and are all built of  very strong tool-steel. No cheap plastic will be found in a ’34 like in today’s small concealed carry .380s. This particular gun, WWII era, is dated 1942 and is in very good condition. It has developed some bluing wear along the sharp edges as is to be expected for this old a gun. See the photos. But otherwise appears to have been very well taken care of. The rifling is strong and sharp with only a faint hint of the satin look that seems to develop even in the best of  barrels of these older guns. It has none of that awful pitting that is seen an a lot of WWII guns subjected to corrosive ammo and poor cleaning. It is a great and accurate little shooter. You can spend your money on one of those trouble prone steel/plastic new ones, or twice as much as I’m asking on an all steel Walther PPK or similar weapon. But you won't find a more reliable weapon than the 1934. Yours for $350 cash only and meet in a public place."

TFO - Tritium/Fiber Optic Technology!
Brightest Day / Night Sights On The Market

TFO gun sights use the same proven technology as our TFO archery pins. These sights are the most revolutionary innovation since TRUGLO, Inc. introduced fiber optics. TFO refers to our patented combination of Tritium and Fiber Optic technologies. The Tritium maintains the brightness level of the sight in low light (or NO light) conditions. That means you can see your sight even in complete darkness—with perfect transition through all light conditions. Tritium does not need batteries and does not need to be charged with light—it simply glows!

    * The ultimate handgun sight.
    * Uses our patented TFO technology.
    * Unbelievable transition through all light conditions.
    * Glows in the dark.
    * Uses the brightest tritium available.
    * CNC machined steel construction.
    * Green front and rear.
    * Concealed fiber cannot be seen by target.
    * Fits standard holsters.
    * Snag-resistant design"

 I RECENTLY SENT THIS SCOPE TO TRIJICON AND HAD THE FOLLOWING REPLACED:

    *  NEW FIBER OPTIC
    *  NEW EYEPIECE LENS
    *  NEW TRITIUM.

 I ALSO BOUGHT EYEPIECE LENSCAP AND KILLFLASH AS WELL AS NEW WINDAGE AND ELEVATION CAPS. 

 PLEASE FOLLOW THIS LINK TO VIEW THE FACTORY SPECS: http://www.trijicon.com/user/parts/products1.cfm?PartID=476&back_row=4&categoryID=3

I bought this acog within the last 6 months to use on my 308.  I sent it to trijicon to get the listed above items fixed and then used it on a 308 since the reticle bdc marks are the same for a 308 or a 223.  The eye relief is a little close for use on a 308 as the recoil is more than a 223.  So I decided to sell the acog and use the money for an Eotech.

The tritium alone is a $400 update, the other updates are over $100.   I have never seen a scope with more clarity than a trijicon acog.  This acog was made in 2006 according to trijicon and that is why I had the tritium updated, that and the fact that it was not as bright in total darkness like I thought it should have been.  Now it is great!"

I've come to the conclusion that I'm never going to actually install it myself and my buddy is way to busy to come over and install it, so I've decided to sell it to get some of my money back. 
I was told it worked good when I bought it, but haven't seen it in action. (the guy that sold it to me is a real good buddy for over 5 years) 
I have no idea what the output is on it, there is no writing on it at all, I just know that it's 220V and when I bought it, I asked if it would heat an oversized two car garage, my buddy laughed and said, ""Easily!"" 
It comes with a White Rodgers thermostat unit. The heater does have a squirrel cage fan in it and I believe it's ready to install.

I mostly just take it out of the case once in a while to see if the laser is still working... Unbelievably I think it still has the original battery still working in it! This is one long life laser! I remember spending more money to get a longer life laser- I guess I got what I paid for....
Basically I don't need it, so I'm not desperate but I do want to sell it."

This rifle is a very early (1973, I believe) 45-70 production model, serial number 130-509**, so it has a clean non-drilled receiver, and it has an unusual and clean looking non-slotted receiver screw. The #3 is unusually versatile as a hunting arm being extremely light, short and fast handling. Only Ruger knows why these were discontinued in the 80's. A #3 in this condition is very difficult to find. I know, it took me 10 years to find this one! But how things change...

I do not have any pics up at the moment, but will post them later.  Has small handling marks, but glass is great as is the fiber optic rod.  Has 5.5 power, with fiber optic collimation and tritium which creates a bright red chevron aiming point.  Reticule is specifically calibrated for the trajectory of a 5.56.  Look up these scopes online, they have possibly the best glass of all the ACOG's, and go for far more than asking price (even used in the same condition).  Fairly firm on the asking price, and will entertain trades of the same value.

The second picture shows exterior flaws as best I could by manipulating the lighting.  Under normal conditions it appears as it does in the other pics, I would just rather overstate any of the items flaws than understate them so we can deal with confidence.  Also, I am aware that it the base says 3.5, however it is a TA55.  From what I understand, Trijicon uses 3.5 (TA11) bases for these optics, as everyone else I know whom owns a TA55 has the same markings on the side.  I have also called Trijicon to verify this, so no worries."

Purchased new in May 2010

This rifle is very accurate and well made and absolutely 100% pristine. The Savage Accutrigger is the closest thing to electronic ignition you'll ever feel. It is 1 lb 11 oz. of pure crisp disengagement. I only have about 300 rounds through it. I bought it to use for target and light hunting but I have decided to go the air rifle route for target/hunting. Am selling this to fund an AR project. The Mueller scope (4.5-14 x 40AO) is mated to the rifle with Burris Signature Zee rings (med height) with inserts and matte nickel finish. I have $570 into this rifle. I will also throw in 1100 rounds of .22 rounds. Call REDACTED for additional details. Would make a great Christmas present. Thanks for looking."

Will also fire .308 Winchester. This is the most accurate version of the SVD available in our country due to the wide availability of match grade .308 ammo. I have not personally fired this rifle, but on my own NDM I scored an MOA grouping with Portuguese surplus.

A true copy of the Russian SVD in the NATO caliber, one of only 1000 in the country. The rifle has right about 50 rounds fired through it. Again the notoriously weak finish is nearly entirely intact except for the wear points of a semi auto such as the bolt slide area and a few scuffs on the dust cover from mounting the scope. 

The rifle has 100% matching serials. The entire rifle and kit is completely original as imported in practically new condition.

Comes complete with all the original accessories, including the cleaning kit, cleaning rods, scope box, spare bulbs, scope with infra-red detection, canvas tool bag, the 10 round magazine, all the paperwork and manuals, and spare rubber eyepiece. All accessories are in new condition.

I may consider trades for Arsenal SGL 20, 21, or 31, for $550-600 for the base rifle 

May also consider a PSL for $500 for the base rifle and scope 

May also consider a Wasr 10 or Wasr 2 for $300 

May also consider Interarms Russian and Bulgarian style AK-47 and AK-74 for $450 

May also consider DS Arms standard FAL full length battle rifle. 

Also considering Mauser K98, Springfield 1903, Mosin Nagant M38, Enfield No1 Mk3 with magazine cut off and adjustable windage rear sight. 

Also considering Ruger GP-100 6in blued for $300 and Glock 19 RTF $350-$400 and Ruger Mini 14 for $350

And also another NDM 86 in 7.62 x 54r

And feel free to offer what you have as there may be something that didn't make the list!

All trades must be in good condition and most importantly good shooters. All prices are for reference and actual prices will be seen on an individual basis.

And I will consider any combination of the above trades or multiples there of, within reason of course. But if you have 2 PSL's or multiple Wasr's or both Arsenal's, etc that might be a possibility I would look into.

This is just a general overview so feel free to ask any questions and make sure this rifle is legal wherever you are located. Thanks for looking!"

This is a spectacular rifle in great condition for a collector or shooter, just in time for Christmas. The receiver and trigger group display the correct numbers and while I haven't checked the barrel I believe it matches as well (per previous owner). The only non original part is an adjustable gas plug (necessary if you want to shoot modern ammunition) which can easily be swapped if you so desire. 

I know this rifle will shoot 1"" or better at 100 yards with match ammo. Bore is shiny and clean and everything functions flawlessly, only marks are those one might expect on a babied 69 year old rifle from a war zone. 

Accessories include ~200 rounds of Greek surplus ammunition in e clips and about 10 or so extra e clips, rifle sling and .30-06 lee die set, and about 100 rounds of 30-06 brass. 

Price is $900 local or you pay to ship FIRM. 

I'm not really interested in trades at this time, unless you have a mint condition high end ak47 pattern rifle of similar value. NOT interested in century, saiga, or chi com. NOT interested in your SKS.

I love the gun, but need some cash!!  You all know how it is sometimes!  I purchased this pistol on 3/04/2010 for $575.00.  I purchased it for home protection and have put only 1 box of rounds through it the weekend after I purchased it.  I will be asking for $450 or best offer, which I know is more than reasonable considering I have seen this pistol sell on here for $550.  I just did a search before creating this and saw several Glocks for well over $500.  I absolutely do not mind giving someone a great deal on this handgun if I can sell it quickly.

The gun comes absolutely everything that Glock includes in a new gun purchase.  These items are:

-The gun (obviously)
-Glock case
-Gun lock with key
-3 15 round magazines
-3 Interchangeable grips (small, medium, and large)
-Cleaning brush
-Speed loader
-Manual

Here is a link so you can see what it sells for retail, however this model only has the 10 round magazines instead of the 15 round:

I will be happy to answer any questions you might have about the firearm.  First come first serve, so call me ANYTIME!!

Excellent, almost new condition with 98% or better nickel. Excellent mechanics. Grips are original targets with some minor marks on them. Believe it or not, they came from S&W looking largely this way. Their grip QC wasn't the greatest during this time period.
