Night sights still glow well enough to pick up easily at night. Less than 300 rounds through it and in great shape. Comes with factory box and two 13 round magazines. This glock is in 40 S&W but can easily be converted to 9mm or 357 Sig. Only trades I would consider are a Gen 2 Glock 17 or 19$400 can only meet in Bloomer or Chippewa Falls unless trading.

The rifle has a 26 inch round barrel with a bright sharp bore and has Browning scope bases with special Browning swivels for carrying strap. Metal condition is overall excellent with original factory blue and no rust. Beautifully grained walnut stock and forearm with deluxe checkering, all original and excellent with no cracks. The original finish shows some slight wear marks consistent with a firearm this age. This weapon started out life as a .30-06 and was customized to a .300 Weatherby Magnum in 1980 by the late Al Perry, gunsmith from Roseburg, Or. who was considered the finest gunsmith in Southern Oregon and was customized at his suggestion. I would give an overall rating on the entire rifle at 85-90% condition. I believe this was manufactured in the early 1970s and was made by Miroku, a top tier manufacturer of quality firearms word-wide and is located in Japan. They have manufactured most, if not all firearms for Browning since then. A new butt pad was added in 1990. Over the years I have take lots of game with this rifle and its ready for the next buyer to continue the harvest.

The upper is a TD-415, 14.5 inch pinned and welded barrel. These are nice uppers.

Safety is genuine HK ambi selector. Trigger is a hiperfire 1-stage, extremely clean break. Spikes H3 buffer in an M93 stock. Ergo rubberized grip. These uppers alone are being sold new for 1800 on hkparts.net. I've got about 800 rounds through this gun. $1500 gets the gun, $1700 for the gun with the strikefire red dot and flip to side magnifier. 1,600 with genuine HK diopter irons.This gun has been a pleasure to own and shoot but I just don't shoot it enough these days."

If you want to buy this just to turn it and make a few bucks, go for it.  I am interested in talking to serious buyers only.  I seriously get a case of the ass when people spend 20 emails and hagling price (It's still 2k).  Wtih the gun comes the extra stock - Reloading Dies, 80 pieces of brass (Nosler, Hornady, Lapua, and some HSM - thats about 100 Bucks worth of brass).  I have at least 20 rounds of Ammo Sellier Bellot and HSM (Doesnt sound like much but thats $100 worth), Dies for reloading ($55), Bullets (Lots of them from 225gr - 300 gr, Hornady, Lapua, etc over $100 worth.  There is plenty of extras that come with this to make this one hell of a deal for the buyer."

The P226 in DA/SA includes a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The DA/SA is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG. The DA/SA also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most. The P226 SAO variant brings the same feature set to the table in a single-action only package. The addition of the SIG Master Shop Super Match Flat Trigger provides exceptional feel and consistent trigger pull regardless of finger placement. The SAO is available in 9 mm."

I have an almost new DPMS GII SASS for sale. I love the rifle but decided to go a different direction. It's had less than 60 rounds through it with 0 ossues. It ran flawless with average winchester ammunition and held sub moa grouping. It's set up for long range shooting. It's topped with a vortex viper 6.5 x 20 x 50 with a 50 mm sunshade. It's mounted on a leupold 20 moa base. I have all the original paperwork,  boxes and case that came with all of it. The new owner will not be dissappointed. Shown by appointmemt only. I do have a few boxes of ammo that will go with the rifle. This is a very nice semi automatic sniper system that shows no wear. I have just shy of 3k invested and accepting cash offers only. Sorry no trades. I am not desperate to sale so please save lowball offers. More pictures available upon request."

As seen in the pic, it is a takedown rifle that can be broken down for easy transport. It's comes with (1) 33 round magazine and (1) 17 round magazine. It takes Glock mags. It also comes with a TruGlo red dot and a nice Plano case. This would be a great gun for someone wanting a lightweight pack rifle or truck gun. You'll never have trouble finding mags or ammo. It has an incredibly tame recoil impulse, on par with a .22 LR. Good for younger people or new shooters. It also has ambi ejection, which means you can choose which side it ejects spent casings. A nice feature for lefties. 9mm is so cheap nowadays you can shoot all day.Overall, this gun is in great condition. It has some small blemishes from use as expected from a gun you throw in a pack. It shoots well and I've taken good care of it. I have no reason to sell it, I just hardly use it. I originally bought it for camping, but I got my CHL and ended up using a Glock 10mm AKA the tupperware handcannon. So, my survival rifle now survives in my climate controlled safe. I will only meet in the NWA area. I also require proof that you're not a prohibited person. A valid concealed carry permit or a current military/law enforcement ID will work. Cash only. I will provide more pictures on request and answer additional questions."
