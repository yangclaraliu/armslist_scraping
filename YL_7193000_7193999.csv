This is the excellent WALTHER P22 Pistol.  The P22 is a 3/4-size rimfire rendition of the famous Walther P99 center-fire pistol.
FEATURES:
Actions:  This Walther is a HAMMER-Fired pistol and enables both Double Action and Single Action firing for all types of shooting fun.   The External Hammer easily pulls back for convenient shooting.  Trigger pulls for Double Action and Single Action firing are excellent.  Nice, crisp trigger break!
Ergonomics:  great for shooting!  Sculpted and stippled grip is well designed to allow virtually any size hand to be able to control the pistol.   Hooked front on the trigger guard, providing a nice place for the offhand index finger.   Comfortable for large and small shooters alike.
 
Safeties:  Slide-mounted safety on both sides that blocks the firing pin so the hammer can be manually lowered safely. It also has a magazine disconnect safety so the gun won’t fire without the magazine inserted and a paddle-style magazine release that can be used by right- or left-handed shooters.
Magazine is constructed of stainless steel with a polymer follower and bump pad. 10-shot capacity.
Very handy ambidextrous magazine release located at the bottom rear of the trigger guard.
Sights: ramp front sight with a white dot pressed into the slide and a polymer rear sight adjustable for windage with two white dots.  Excellent sighting as there is plenty of light between the front sight blade and the rear sight.
Picatinny accessory rail for the mounting of lights, lasers and other accessories.
Low recoil make it easy for anyone to shoot.
Accuracy:  I shot great with bulk ammo and even better with CCI Velocitor and Winchester Power Points."

It is all original, has all matching serial numbers (grip frame, receiver, barrel, bolt assembly, trigger, sideplate), and has no import marks. It is not a “GERMANY”-marked export gun, and it has the proper “GESICHERT” marking under the safety lever and the proper “GELADEN” marking on the extractor. My research indicates that it was manufactured in 1923 or 1924, based on the serial number (8816m). The gun is mechanically perfect and fully functional. It retains about 85 – 90% of the original bluing, except for the front strap and back strap of the grip, which show more wear. The bore has good rifling, but there is some slight frosting. That doesn’t affect the accuracy; I can consistently break clays on the berm at 10 – 15 yards. The grips show a bit of wear, but there are no cracks or chips. The grips and the wood-bottom magazine are not numbered, which is correct for this model. Not a museum piece, just a nice all-original shooter that you don’t have to be afraid to take to the range, and priced accordingly. Also included is a like-new aftermarket Mec-Gar magazine. Asking $875 shipped to your FFL or C&R. Paypal is preferred. No trades. Any questions or additional pictures needed, please ask. Thanks."

I have for sale a rare Kimber Pro Shadow LE II chambered in 45acp. Kimber made only 500 of these pistols in 2001, this one is number 64. They went primarily to law enforcement officers as they were custom guns that were built for police work. They had many nice features which improved reliability and usability like coned barrel (eliminated barrel bushing, increasing reliability), full guide rod (increasing reliability), hi dpi front strap checkering, big dot night sights, flared and lowered ejection port, polished internals, lightweight frame, non-reflective finish, and some other features that I can’t remember right now. This is a really nice 1911 pistol, small enough to be easily concealable. The pistol with come with kimber box and papers and two magazines. The pistol came with only one Kimber mag from the factory.

Obviously I can't tell you how many rounds have been put through it, but it's a USP, so it's not much of a factor. Since I've owned it, I've put three or four hundred rounds through it myself with no issues with brass, aluminum, or steel cased ammo. Everything has fed just fine with no hiccups. It has H&K's V3 trigger, which means it is decock-only; there's no safety. The gun has an AC date code, which places it as a 2002 manifacture. It comes with three 12-round HK magazines. No case or paperwork. Would prefer buyer to be a TN HCP holder. Will not ship, likely will not come to you unless the deal is heavily in my favor. The only trades I'm interested in would be a CZ Scorpion, or an FN FNX-45 Tactical in FDE.REDACTED for faster responses."

A while back I bought forty (40)-50rd boxes of Rem 9mm brass ammo and saved the boxes and plastic trays in hopes of resusing them if/when I got into reloading. Well that's still years away and I want them gone. I figured I'd offer them to someone who already reloads or anyone else who might want them. There should be about 34 of them (because I kept some to put in ammo cans for range trips) and the only thing wrong with them is I had to remove the UPC for the mail in rebate but a little shipping tape or something and they'd be fine. If interested, just email me and we'll figure out a time and place to meet because it'd be stupid to ship them. Be patient I'm very busy and this isn't a priority. I'll leave this up maybe a few weeks then recycle them."
