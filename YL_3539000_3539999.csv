Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide (elderly, those with arthritis, small women etc...). You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. Taurus also makes a small caliber tip barrel design, but has a much heavier trigger (due to being double action). The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $210 (Reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $140.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven."

Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta reduced to only $210. Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $140.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven."

I have cleaned and shot this rifle. The iron sights are accurate at 100yds and that is the longest distance of the range I was at. I believe the rifle is the Tula/Izhevsk because it has both markings and matching numbers.. I pulled the detailed information from 762x54 website:

This receiver was originally produced at Izhevsk in 1942 in the #5.5 pattern with an unstepped tang, no extra notch forward of the stripper clip guide, a high wall, unmachined right rear, no inner receiver ring and the lug race cut through. Some of the rifles were later used to build a 1943 Tula PU sniper and further machining was done. The tang is marked with the Izhevsk arsenal arrow in triangle mark and dated 1942. It also has the Tula arsenal star marked bolt and a partial date of ""4"" which is presumed to be the first digit of ""43"". This is very similar to Receiver #4.5.3 above with the exception of the beginning receiver pattern and the subsequent amount of work necessary to bring it up to Tula specifications. The only difference in the final pattern of the two is the lug race cut through which this one has and #4.5.3 does not. At Tula the extra notch forward of the stripper clip guide was cut as in all original Tula receiver production, but done somewhat crudely. The high wall was retained to accept the PU side rail mount, but the right rear was machined, also as in all original Tula receiver production. Of course the lug race cut was not replaced and this is the one feature that points toward Izhevsk production since it was never done on original Tula production receivers. The steps at the tang were not added which would be a match of the #6 pattern and therefore it matches the later #7 pattern. This extra, and unnecessary, work done by Tula justifies it's reputation for careful craftsmanship and a higher degree of quality in spite of the pressures of war time production. However, a 1941 (redated from 1940) Tula barreled M91/30 built on a #5 1941 Izhevsk receiver with no modifications has also been documented. Whether the receiver was sent to Tula by Izhevsk or the barrel to Izhevsk by Tula is a mystery, but the tang is not remarked by Tula. For this and other rifles with receivers that don't match their barrel see the Soviet Mosin Nagants Built on Earlier Receivers page."

For those not familiar with this pistol it is a solid milled steel military handgun with a chrome barrel and SA/DA action.
1968 model with rounded hammer for snagless drawing. Comes with two mags, one that has a matching serial number and one that does not. I ground down the finger rest on the non-matching mag to better facilitate pocket carry. Will also include a box of Hornady XTP defense rounds.
The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is much more hard wearing and corrosion resistant than the original blueing. This was done about a month ago by FTW Coatings here in town.
Would like to trade for a quality pocket .380 or snub .38 revolver. Would be interested in a S&W BODYGUARD .380 or .38, but will consider other pocket sized similar pistols.
Otherwise will sell for 300 FIRM. I have 450 in this pistol from the pistol purchase and cerakoting service, so I will not go any lower.
I can also include a set of custom walnut grips for additional cost or higher value trade (see last picture).

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series.

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

The 22LR is identical to the Thunder .380, only slightly smaller. So it will make a good training tool for handling the .380. And with CCI Mini-mags, it would be a great backup CCW pistol.

Gun Details:

All metal frame, slide, barrel.
Manual safety. Decocker.
Users say the 22LR works best with high velocity ammo (1200+ FPS).

LNIB. Never fired (by me). Cleaned & oiled from factory test fire residue.
Mine includes:
* Two (2) 10-round mags (original comes with only 1).
* Speed (thumb) loader (I bought it separately).
* Original box: manual (paper & CD), safety key, spent shell casing. 

Compared to Walther James Bond PPK/22: Bersa has better sights, is less heavy (18.9 oz vs 24 oz, empty), and is less expensive.

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons that features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN SCAR MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

Specifications and Features:
-Next-generation impact and crush resistant polymer construction
-Modified dimensions allow for wider compatibility with non Colt-spec 'STANAG 4179' platforms
-Constant-curve internal geometry for smooth feeding
-Anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability
-Long life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, black-oxide coated (MIL-DTL-13924D)
-Anti-glare translucent MagLevel windows on both sides of the body along with a painted Indicator on the spring allows for easy determination of rounds remaining
-Over-travel insertion stop on the spine
-Ribbed gripping surface and new aggressive front and rear texture for positive magazine handling
-Paint pen dot matrix panels on the bottom of the body to allow for identification marking
-Flared floorplate aids magazine handling and disassembly yet is slim enough for use with many double and triple pouches
-Pop-off Impact/Dust Cover to maximize feed lip life, minimize debris intrusion and for additional protection in storage and transit!!!

The Beretta Px4 Storm SubCompact pistol is the most advanced deep concealment tactical pistol of its kind.

PX-Storm-SubCompact-intro

It is a miniature-size version of the ultra-reliable PX4 Storm, a double/single-action pistol that keeps gaining an enthusiastic following among military and police organizations worldwide. The SubCompact does not sacrifice any of the features of its larger counterpart, while offering superior concealability and light weight.


Low-RecoilLow Recoil in a Lightweight Package

In spite of its diminutive size, the Px4 Storm SubCompact was designed to be pleasant to shoot, offering minimal muzzle-jump and keeping recoil mild. The tilt-breech system was designed to work with the rest of the frame to dissipate both the kick in the web of the shooting hand and the muzzle rise that happens at every shot, making this handgun far less punishing on the hand than others in its class, the PX4 SubCompact is quick back on target--a best-of-both-worlds situation combining superior concealment and low weight with a full-size shooting experience.


Superior Durability and Ease of MaintenanceEasy-to-Maintain

The stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion- and sweat-resistant, making it perfectly suited for concealment even in hot and active conditions. This is a tactical pistol that is designed to work as hard as you while being as low-maintenance as possible. Disassembly is extremely easy and quick and requires no tools, while the tough and surface-treated steels enable you to keep it as good as new with a quick wipe even after a whole day in the holster.




Feature-RichUser-Friendly, Feature-Rich and Ambidextrous

With the included interchangeable backstraps, the PX4 Storm SubCompact is easy and quick to adapt to different hand sizes (for instance, male or female) and grip styles. A built-in Picatinny rail further adds to its flexibility, making it possible to attach a variety of tactical accessories without any gunsmithing or alteration. Furthermore, most controls are either ambidextrous or reversible, making it easy to shoot and train with either hand dominant. Any shooter considering a reliable and soft-shooting subcompact for concealed carry or personal defense should give the PX4 SubCompact a very close look.

""
The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.

In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

Made in U.S.A.

You'll love this rifle, Like I do but I put myself in a tough spot and need to sell it. It have no personal; attachment so it has to go. It's almost perfect but does have a few small scratches here and there in the wood. The metal is all perfect and when I say small scratches in the wood I mean small. There's no rust and the gun fires perfectly. i have hunted for Pigs with it and it took down a 200 lb Boar at 150 yards on the Northern California Coast no problem."
