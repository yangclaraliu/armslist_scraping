Have used it for a few seasons. These aren't made anymore, and a lot of guys who like regular 700's like to use these for muzzleloading since the action, trigger, etc all feel the same. It is complete, and in good shape, showing only the kind of wear you would expect to see on a reasonably well cared for gun that had seen a handful of seasons of hunting. The stock is camo from the factory, the barrel is shiny stainless with some camo spray paint over top of it (cause i don't like to have shiny things on me when i hunt). If you want the spray paint would come off easy. I masked off the sights and stock, so it's totally reversible with some acetone. 

I also have a Knight muzzleloader that I would like to get rid of. It's in about the same shape as the Remington, i just haven't gotten around to taking pictures. It's also a .50.

In addition to the 2 guns i also have a lot of projectiles/bullets, powder pellets, tools, some spare parts, owners manuals, and stuff like that.

Since this ad is for the Remington, i'd like to get 250 for it, and all it's specific parts. The knight, i'm thiking 150, all the bullets/powder/caps and whatnot... i dunno, i'd love to make a deal on the whole lot of everything for about 375.

Gun Review: This is Posted on GOOGLE
The Charter Arms Undercover is a gun whose owners come hungry for self-defense, and leave satisfied that their attacker ate lead. Whatever else you can—or cannot—say about this mid-priced revolver, it’s one accurate gun of a son.

But a recent experience with the Charter Arms Target Mag Pug left me wondering if a reasonably competent shooter equipped with any of Charter’s products could hit the broadside of a barn. I’m pleased to report that the Undercover is one of the most accurate .38s I’ve ever fired. The collection of dots in the target’s center (at twenty feet) was so well-gathered that Adam at American Firearms School challenged me to repeat the feat using double action. Only I’d already punched the paper in double action mode.

A 1934 Czech VZ24 8mm mauser bolt action rifle. This rifle was made at the famous factory in Brno, Czech. It was sold to the Romanians who put their crest on it. The crest was partially scrubbed off by the Russians after the war. However a good part of it remains on the rifle, which is uncommon. The stock shows a lot of wear as you would expect from a rifle that saw action in 2 countries. The bore is dark in the grooves but has strong rifling. The Czech rifles were noted for their smooth actions and this one is no different. It cycles and fires with no problems. The upper hand guard has one small crack and one a little longer one that was repaired. Does not affect the function of the rifle. This rifle has a lot of history but has a lot of shooting life left in it. It would be good for the collector, a nice truck gun, hog gun, or deer rifle. The 8mm packs a punch. It comes with 20 rounds of surplus ammo. Asking $220, willing to negotiate a little. Please text any questions or requests for more pics to REDACTED. Thanks"

This makes shooting the AR-30A1 comfortable for even the smallest or recoil-sensitive shooter. The competition grade barrel and our patented V-block receiver bedding system are keys to the AR-30A1’s minute of angle accuracy. ArmaLite’s patented V-Block™ Bedding Wedge and V-Block Stock assure absolute strength and repeatability for superb accuracy. The aluminum stock reinforces the receiver like a bench-rest sleeve. The magazine of any mag-fed firearm is critical to reliable feeding. The AR-30’s magazine underwent extensive development testing to assure reliability of feeding. It is made of steel, not polymer or aluminum, to provide years of heavy duty service. The single stack design of the AR-30A1 magazine minimizes the material removed from the receiver for the mag well. This significantly contributes to the strength and stiffness of the AR-30A1 receiver."
