My wife picked it up to learn to shoot rifles, but .308 is too much for her, so we're moving down in caliber.

These Mausers are very rare. About 127,000 were made, which is not very many when compared to the 535,000 full sized M96 Swedish Mausers.This one has been sporterized by one of its previous owners. I am not knowledgeable enough to restore it myself, and was hoping someone else could either restore or enjoy as is. The rifle is missing an upper forend, original rear sight, stock disc, and I think the nose piece has been slightly modified (although now it looks better in my opinion). The gun does have a Williams rear peep sight. It's a well done sporterization, but still a sporterization nonetheless.A few seconds of searching Google shows that Swedish Mausers are considered the highest quality Mauser variants out there, and 6.5x55mm Swedish already performs incredibly. This rifle puts that in a smaller package that can easily be carried around all day (7lbs). This gun also doesn't necessitate constant worrying about a potential loss of value depending on how you use it. It's a great hunting rifle, a great target rifle, a great whatever you can think of rifle. What's not to love?I think it's all matching, which doesn't really matter after sporterization but never hurts to know. Designed/adopted in 1894, made in 1917. I've shot five rounds through it. The gun handles amazingly well.Does not include sling. Local sale only. $350 OBO, no trades unless for other (non-sporterized) milsurp.
