Bought new the first week of January 2011 and has had ~200 rounds fired total. I completely cleaned the factory lubricant before firing and on the 3 occasions the gun has been fired it was thoroughly cleaned within hours. I have had zero problems and the gun is very accurate.  The SR9c would make a great CCW.  Comes with a 10-rd magazine which includes a pinky extension and a 17-rd magazine with a grip extension that gives the gun a full size grip.  Also included is a mag loader, gun lock, all original papers, factory test fire bullet and original box.

Buyer must have valid CC permit or firearm purchase permit from Sheriffs Office."

These slings use one of the better designed HK style snap hooks. (Maxpedition uses ones that break VERY easy) The nylon webbing is 1"" wide and black, with a factory rated break strength of 2000lbs.  Tubular nylon webbing is used on the lower half in the bungee section.  Although the webbing claims it will take 2000lbs, I doubt that the connectors will.  This thing is solid either way.  PLUS they are sewn in the USA! Instead of being sewn by children in another far off land.  

These slings are available with or without side release buckles.  Since the pics are too large to post here, you can check out my ad on Northwest Firearms here:  http://www.northwestfirearms.com/part-accessory-classifieds/46967-1-point-sling.html

This gun functions excellent, bore is clean, and finish is good to very good.

At just a little over 14 inches in length, this exceptional firearm is even more difficult to find than its rare 9mm version.  Because of its larger caliper, it came originally with a 22 round clip (which is included).  To this date, I have not found another 40 CAL that is currently being sold or has been sold as this one.

The Spectre is an Italian submachine gun that was produced by the SITES factory in Turin. It was designed by Roberto Teppa and Claudio Gritti in the mid-1980s. Production in Italy ceased in the year 1997, with the closure of SITES, but proceeded in very small numbers in Switzerland through Greco Sport S.A., a company founded by one of the designers of the Spectre, Claudio Gritti, until 2001. During the mid 80’s and early 90’s, a limited number made its way to the states via imported by American Arms Inc.  The Spectre is used by the Swiss armed forces and by Italian armed forces, and has been exported elsewhere.

The Spectre is a compact and light weapon, designed for instant firepower in close combat at short ranges. The four models have top-folding buttstocks, and were available with or without a forward handgrip ahead of the magazine housing. The largely polymer Spectre has a stamped-steel receiver.

The Spectre is a standard blowback firearm operating from a closed bolt; however it has some unusual features. The barrel shroud completely hides the barrel. The bolt is designed to pump air through the barrel shroud to provide additional cooling. The Spectre is hammer-fired and the trigger group is double action with a decocker. This allows the shooter to safely carry a round in the chamber and fire immediately. As this eliminates the need for cocking prior to shooting no manual safety is provided. Unconventional 22-round capacity, four-column magazine ise provided with the Spectre, but it can also use conventional magazines.

I’m open to offers and trades, but I am only entertaining trades for either an AR-15 or Bushmaster."

Not a youth model, but would make a great kid's first shotgun, or Mom or Dad's for that matter.  Planned to use it as such, but went another direction.  

Takes 3"" and 2 3/4 shells, full choke.  It is like new.

This is a Canada made Winchester, they made these at the Cooey factory, so they are sometimes refereed to as Cooey Winchester shotguns.

It looks very nice only showing a couple of light ""use"" marks. Bore is very clean, action works perfectly.

After googling the 840, These were made between 1961 and 1965.  Beat up examples sold for 150-175, found some asking 250-275, but those prices seem high for a any single break action of any caliber.

Mileage is currently around 140,000. My wife and I have been using it as a third car and I drove it all summer for the gas mileage and AC but recently got another vehicle to replace it and the alternator died shortly afterwards. 

Pros:
-The body's in very good shape with no rust. 
-We recently replaced the hydraulic arm in the trunk. 
-Interior is fairly good. Shows regular signs of wear, but no major tears or cracking.
-Tires are fairly new.
-Replaced plugs, wires, & air filter in August.
-Air, heat, defrost, etc. all work.

Cons:
-Not currently running
-Leaks oil.
-Alternator needs replacing.
-One of the back shocks squeaks.
-Coolant bottle was plugged since Mitsubishi no longer makes the sensor that goes in the bottom of it. The plastic bracket that held the bottle also broke and right now it's held in place by zip ties.

If you have any questions or would like to take a look at it, just drop a line. 
I know some people like fixing these cars up, but I'm not one of them and just have no use for it anymore. My wife and I want it gone but don't have the heart to just scrap it.
We haven't had any real interest in it after several posts on craigslist, so I'm to the point of letting it go for just about any decent firearm."

The Sig comes with Sig Night Sights (Tritium) so finding your target at night is not a problem.  

If you visit the Sig Sauer website, you'll find that the MSRP for the Two-tone P238 is now $693. So, buying this gun for under $500 is a huge bargain...take advantage of it.

The rifle itself is perfect. The first run of these rifles in the early 2000's got horrible reviews. This is an example of the revised second generation that came into the U.S

The first had bolt gap issues as well as the delayed roller back system being parted together from their plant once imported to the states.


The rifle for sale has perfect bolt gap from the time i received it and after shooting, the sights are straight as an arrow. The bore is perfect. When i bought this i also selected a hand picked rifle for an extra $25

Since then Century Arms has turned their reputation completely around with this run of rifles, an example of this is the rifle i'm selling here.

If you look into these rifles online you will see that they are almost a direct clone of the HK91, the HK91 was actually produced after this rifle. As well all the parts are interchangeable between the 2 rifles.

So basically its one bad-ass semi auto .308 that i just don't have time to shoot. No failure to fire issues or mag issues. Most people run 1000's of rounds through this rifle with zero issues. Its a true battle rifle.


Im including the factory magazine and 4 HK-91/G3 mags that have all functioned perfectly at the range.

Price with all 5 mags is $500 OBO, for another $100 i'll included 250 rounds of silver bear FMJ. I paid over $600 for the rifle/mags/hand select.

Not really looking for a trade unless its a Remington 700 SPS tactical(.308) at this point in time but would possibly entertain something if it appeals to me.

Please only text if your in state and or serious.

It is Miroku made and does have the rounded knob that is favored by browning collectors. This gun is new but there is a small scratch in the clear on the buttstock from when it was placed in a safe sometime back. This fun still has the waxy coating present from the factory and still has the ""please install choke tube before firing"" sticker on the barrel. This gun has NEVER been fired, which is one of the reasons I want to get rid of it. Yes I know it's rare to have a over 40 year old firearm new in the box, and yes I know it's a great investment but I like to shoot and hunt ALOT. I would be more than happy to send those who are seriously interested more photos over iPhone or even let you view it in person. I am listing it far below blue book in order to take into account the small scratch and for a quick sale. I am looking to liquidate some college debt so some of my less useful firearms must go.

UPDATE... I am getting a lot of inquiries on painting firearms. Prices go from $80-$160 for duracoat paint. I can do it cheaper with less durable paint as well. The picture of the savage on pods is NOT for sale its a example of a different patter and it is a 2 layer job and for duracoat is $125.

It also comes with one brand new in the box G22 15rd magazine, polished extended slide stop, Glock logo slide backplate, Grip Plug, Pachmayr rubber grip and an uncle mikes IWB holster.

It has been in my family for many years but, due to some financial circumstances, I find myself forced to sell.  I'm not an expert in such matters, but I'd rate the gun approx. 85% in finish and 95% in function (I've only had it to the range a small handful of times in 10 years and have had three failure-to-eject using cheap ball ammo).  There is some wear shown on the outside of the gun on the slide, but overall it's in fantastic shape for its age.  It is being sold with one original magazine.

Below is a link containing a lot of information on the particular model (including fun facts like General Patton used to carry one in WWII).  As per the standards described on the site, the gun was manufactured between 1918-1921 and would make an excellent piece for a collector.  The same model listed on Gunbroker without reserves are priced between $650-$1100, but I am asking $600 to hopefully facilitate a quick sale and not a lot of lowballing.  I would be willing to entertain a partial trade for a subcompact in .380 or 9mm (Ruger LCP, Kel-Tec, etc) but I will need $300 cash at minimum in addition.  I know there are some people out there that like to email and offer 50% of the asking price-- if this is you, please save both of us the trouble and don't do it.  I do have some things I need to take care of, but I will not just give the gun away.

Please don't hesitate to email me with any questions, specific picture requests, etc.  If, for some reason, I cannot get the pictures to load on the ad I'll be happy to email them to you.

Thanks a lot!

HEAD: 

[url]http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product/ISP-Technologies-Theta-300W-Guitar-Amp-Head?sku=483011[/url] 

The Theta Amp Head offers a unique approach to the guitar amplifier, providing two selectable input pre-distort preamplifiers. Using the Theta guitar amplifier head is like having two low-noise, extremely high quality preamp pedals at the input of the amplifier. Each front-end pre-amp has gain, bass, mid level, mid sweep and treble which provides amazing pre-distort tone shaping. The amplifier's ""Clean"" and ""Distort"" circuits have the same post distort tone shaping. Tone beyond your wildest dreams! Extreme sonic flexibility. The Clean channel has additional tone shaping with the inclusion of a Presence control, providing more than 20dB of high frequency boost. You want gain? The Theta amplifier head has greater than 140dB of gain and you can control and make it useable because of the included dual independent full-featured Decimator Noise Reduction systems. 

The Theta incorporates Dynamic Saturation Modulation™, which delivers the actual feel of a saturated tube power amplifier. The Theta also packs a huge punch; the internal D-CAT power amplifier delivers more than 300 watts RMS into a 4-ohm load and 150 watts into an 8-ohm load. Derek Bowers, renowned IC design engineer from Analog Devices and Buck Waller of ISP Technologies, developed the patent pending D-CAT power amplifier technology. The D-CAT is a super high current power amplifier technology capable of driving a .5-ohm load. This means that the D-CAT amplifier delivers excellent transient response and punch. 

ISP Technologies Theta 300W Guitar Amp Head Features: 

Dual Amplifiers Clean / Distortion 
Clean Channel Controls — Presence—Bass—Mid—Mid Sweep—Treble—Decimator—Reverb—Output Level 
Distortion Channel Controls — Gain-Bass-Mid-Mid Sweep-Treble-Decimator-Reverb-Output Level 
High Quality Digital Reverb 
Dual Input Preamplifier

ACTIVE CABINET: 

[url]http://www.rebelamps.com/isp.htm[/url] 

The patent pending VECTOR ACTIVE GUITAR CABINET has bass on tap, designed as the perfect complement with maximum performance when used with the THETA HEAD. Years of experience in designing the highest performance Active Sound Reinforcement cabinets has allowed ISP Technologies engineers to develop the ultimate Active guitar cabinet. Simply connect the speaker output of the THETA HEAD to the input of the VECTOR like you would any other speaker cabinet and get ready to unleash the most unbelievable low-end punch and bass performance you’ve ever heard.

This little pistol shoots great. Smooth trigger and perfect function. It does have some finish wear in the normal areas (see pics) but that does not hinder performance at all. Carries very well and comes to hand like it should. Has Trijicon night sights and a few 13 round mags, all Sig factory, not aftermarket. Right now it has a Hogue slip-on grip on it that makes it even more comfortable. I also have the original box for this pistol. Ideally, I would prefer to trade for a Glock 19 (gen 3 or 4) but feel free to make an offer if you'd like to buy it instead and we can go from there. I do not have to get rid of this but I really don't like having several pistols sitting around not being used. Do a little research on this model so you will be more informed as to what it is before trying to low-ball me. I will only laugh and send a smart-ass remark back. Once again, this pistol functions perfect, is accurate, carries well, and is comfy to shoot."

551,http://www.armslist.com/posts/88551,For Sale:  Polish Tantal AK-74,"Waukesha, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 650,"Listed On: Friday, January 21, 2011",Rifles,no type,5.45x39mm                                                                                ,no type,Rifle,"I'm selling a Century built Polish Tantal chambered in 5.45x39.  I bought the rifle new and have fired 120 rounds through it.  Century Tantals are not built with scope rails however I had a gunsmith weld one on.  The original ill-functioning thumb safety has been replaced with a standard AK safety.  The rifle comes with two mags, the scope carrier, a standard stock, detachable muzzle brake, Tapco trigger-group, and a collapse-able wire stock.  Scope is not included.

This is not one of the Century Tantals with the junk American-made barrels that can't properly stabilize 7N6.  I fired exactly 120 rounds through the gun.  The first 20 shots were fired one at a time, with cleaning in between shots to properly brake in the new barrel.  The next 80 were fired in rapid succession to get the barrel good and hot.  The final 20 were fired at 100 yards to test accuracy.  There were absolutely no failures or keyholes.  I fired the rifle from a sitting position without sandbags.  My groups were under 3"".  

All 7N6 ammo is corrosive.  I cleaned the entire rifle over the course of about 45 minutes using various stages of boiling water, wire brushing, Hopepe's 9, Bore Butter patches, and tooth-brushing.  Afterwords, every metal part was treated with a fine layer of oil.  

This is a very nice rifle and the addition of a scope rail gives the 5.45x39 due justice.  The only minor issue is the typical Century lackluster finish.  You don't need to take my word for the reliability of the rifle.  Come to my land in Mukwonago and shoot it yourself.  If you don't want the scope carrier or the wire stock, I'll sell it without.  I might consider trades.  Email me with any questions."

Chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO (223 Rem.), the FN FS2000 Series are semi-auto only variants of the proven F2000 selective-fire bullpup carbines. The FS2000 Tactical offers an integrated MIL-STD 1913 top mounting rail and emergency backup folding sights. The FS2000 carbines are gas operated and use a rotating bolt lockup for reliability and greater accuracy. Both variants have 17.44"" cold hammer-forged MIL -SPEC barrels and muzzle brakes. Fired cases are ejected through a forward port away from the operator. Models with 10- or 30-round detachable box magazines (DBM) are available. The polymer stock is fully-ambidextrous.

...This rifle has only had around 200 rounds through it (one good range sesssion), and has been exceptional.  I am only looking to see what else is out there and try new things.  This is an exceptional rifle that has a barrel longer than an M-4 to keep great ballistics yet the whole rifle is under 30"".  Points like a dream, shoots more accurate than me, not to mention it looks like a Halo gun and will turn heads wherever you shoot it.  Included is 5 30-round magazines."

Comes with a smith & wesson vinyl holster, Pachmeyer rubber grips, and about 1/2 box of Remington 44 special lead
round nose ammo.
This pistol locks up tight, like a new one.  Very lightweight and thin, perfect hand cannon for
concealed carry.

This is a long shot, but whatever.

Mosin 91/30

Remington 1917 .30-06
Baikal MP153 12 gauge semi auto with 18"" barrel
MAG7M1 12 gauge
Ruger P89DC 9mm

I'll take 650 for all excluding the P89 and MAG7, I'm only going to let the 9mm/M7 go if you're trading something of interest to me.
So basically, you're looking at 5 guns for $130 each, and each retails for about $100 more than what I'm asking, the Baikal alone will fetch 300.
I don't want any bolt actions, small caliber rifles, shotguns or handguns, I have no need for them.
The Norinco 98 in picture #3 is not for sale.

Trade for SKS's, MAS 49/56, AR10, AK47, Saiga rifle, M1 Garand, G3, you get the concept here, semi automatic battle rifles.

Selling a well taken care of Marlin lever-action 30/30.  This rifle has not been shot nor taken out much.  It's probably had a handful of boxes of shells shot through it in its lifetime.

It looks great.  I guess it's 30 years old or so now, but it really looks great.

There is an area of light mottling or pitting in the wood on the left side of the forestock near the barrel.  There are also a few little divots on the outside of the barrel near this same area.  

I couldn't capture these areas with photos very well.  They aren't big areas and didn't show up well in the photos I took.  

I do have some good high-res photos, though, that I'll be glad to email you if you write.

Comes with a better-than-decent black rifle case."

VERY low round count (less than 150) and no problems. Heck, it ain't even broke in yet.  I like the 14.5"" barreled ARs because they seem to be 'handier' than the 16"" versions, and some of the issues that 16"" guns have with pressure in the gas system and the bolt cycling too fast are drastically reduced by not having that extra 1.5"" of barrel past the gas port. This one has been 100% reliable every time I've taken it out.

Standard stuff...14.5"" barrel w/Izzy comp (brings it up to a BATFE-happy 16""), 1:9 twist, chrome lined bore & chamber, flattop receiver w/ handle, 6 pos collapsible stock, 1 - 30rd mag, factory hard sided case, papers, etc.

I've added...Ambidextrous single point sling plate, CAA stock saddle, Midwest Industries front sight rail adapter & Surefire G2 Nitrolon light, and a Buffer Technologies Extractor kit.

I've also staked the gas key properly and reset the rear sight range wheel for using the IBSZ and a 50yd zero.

Its a great shooting rifle, but I need to free up some funds for another gun project, and since the other project is an AR, this one needs to go.

MSRP is $1299, IIRC...I've seen new ones listed online around $949...I'm asking $850 FTF.  Shipping can be worked out if needed.  

No trades, unless you have a bone-stock 10/22CRR + $$$

I'd prefer to do it on a 4473 at work (Greensboro), but could meet anywhere reasonable to do the deal.

 Thompson has accumulated some dust from lack of use.  I have never fired the new .308-barrel.  I’ve shot about 5 maybe 6 boxes of ammo through the 22-250.  Note the scope bases, they alone are worth $$$.  T/C Encore is known for accuracy and quality.  There are many after market accessories and a vast amount of calibers in aftermarket and factory barrels.  Encore is very versatile, you can add a black powder or shotgun barrel or turn it into a pistol.  Add a 45/70 or a 30-06 pistol barrel and have a miniature hand cannon. The Encore only been to the range a few times and is anxious for you to take her out again. The bottom line, you are looking at a like new rifle and barrels."

I tried to serial number date this rifle and found some interesting info. I am not sure if it affects the value or not. The serial no. is G176XXXX. According to this article http://www.wisnersinc.com/additional_info/Winchesterpost_64_M70.htm ""USRAC (United States Repeating Arms Corp.) was formed and continued manufacturing Winchester brand rifles and shotguns under license from Olin Corp. on 7-20-1981. This final year of Olin production saw a new ""XTR Featherweight"". But very few actually made it to the dealers shelves before USRAC took over. The only way I have been able to discern the difference is that the thin red/brown rubber Pachmayr buttplate would have been the only difference displaying either the name 'Winchester' or 'USRAC'."" The butt plate on this rifle says ""Winchester.""

Round count is low, about 400, factory ammo, non corrosive and always cleaned. Condition would be about 80% and all normal wear (holster, etc.) Never dropped, smashed and no excess damage. I also polished the feed ramp (I do it to all of my guns) and oil them every couple weeks (even when not fired and only carried). The springs reduced the recoil noticeably and made the weapon, for me anyway, more comfortable to fire.
