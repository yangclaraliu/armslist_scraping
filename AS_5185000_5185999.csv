This FR-8 was developed from the Model 1943 short rifle, which was based on ""large ring"" K98 Model 1898 Mauser action.
This specimen was adopted into the Spanish Military in 1956 as the La Coruna.
The rifle was modified to fire the 7.62×51mm CETME and 7.62×51mm NATO rounds and was used well into the 1970s by mounted Guardia Civil units in the Sierra Nevada.
The FR-8 is an example of the type of carbine recommended by Jeff Cooper as a Scout rifle in the early 1970s, and bears a strong resemblance to the Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle introduced in 2010.
The flash hider was designed to be compatible with NATO-standard rifle grenades.
The under-barrel tube, which resembles the gas cylinder found on automatic weapons, actually serves as the bayonet mount and as storage for cleaning gear.
The rear sight is an elevation-adjustable rotary type with aperatures for 200 m (220 yd), 300 m (330 yd) and 400 m (440 yd), as well as an open ""V"" notch for 100 metres (110 yd).
The front sight is elevation-adjustable via a special tool and Operation is identical to the standard Mauser design."

Premier Core-Lokt Ultra Bonded PSP and 14 boxes(270rds. to be exact) of Federal 140gr. Vital Shock Nosler Accubond.  Can't find either of these 140gr. ammo in stock anywhere right now, so this may be it??, but when it was available the Remington sold for around $30ea. and the Federal was $35+ea.  $580 firm for all the ammo, sold new for close to $700 before any tax and/or shipping online, so at $580 it saves you at least $120.  Or I will split it up, $150 for the 110rds. of Remington and $450 for the 270rds. of Federal or may do $150 for 90rds. of the Federal.  Also, I've had several trade offers for USED firearms that sell new for around $500-$550.  Just because it is ammo and not a firearm, I am not going to straight trade $700 worth of new factory ammo for something that sells used for $450-$500(maybe), I am going to need a little cash on top.  I will consider trades only if it's a good deal as far as the value goes, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now, pretty simple.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.Trades considered:I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  We can do current price to current price on ammo. 1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer. Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal. Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Garland area or will ship via UPS for $25 more.  Thanks for looking!"

This safe features a 30 min fire rating and it made out of 12 gauge steel. The lock on this safe is a group 2 mechanical dial which is way more reliable than the cheap locks found on low priced safes. The safe weighs in at around 450 pound and the dimensions are 22 D x 28 W x 60 H. Instead of a standard rifle rack, the safe has a rifle rod sheet installed on one side of the interior. With this setup, only shorter guns can be used with the rifle rods (34"") but you could easily cut another shelf and make a standard rack if you are looking to store longer guns. This safe was used primarily for non gun related things and it would make an exellent ammo/document safe because of all the shelving. The safe has the electrical outlit kit installed so that you can run the included golden rod inside to prevent rust. Also thrown into the deal is a rechargable moisture collector and 2 pistol racks ( im cleaning out just about all of my gun related things because of a move).

I understand the high cap mag laws are BS, but don't risk my freedom by attempting to have me ship somewhere it's illegal! Thanks for looking."

These are popular for the match grade accuracy and the steel core penetrators within. These are no longer imported and very sought after.As for why I am parting with them...I sold my dragunov over a year ago and the purchaser wished to pick up the remaining ammunition at a later date. Since he has been not heard of for over a year, they are back up for sale.I will not open a case since the bands are intact but if you wish to open upon purchase for inspection I'm completely comfortable with that. I will not split a case. $750 a case firm (2 tins a case). No discount for purchasing both cases. I can meet in the Bonney Lake/Buckley area. I will also accept pre-1964 US coins (junk silver) at spot price as partial/full payment.

This means it comes with TWO barrels: an 18 inch security barrel and a 28 inch vent rib field barrel. This shotgun also comes with the marine coat trigger. Great starting shotgun for new/advanced gun owners. Mossberg has proved itself to be one of the most reliable shotguns in the firearms industry today used in many police forces as well as the military. I have only used the 18 inch security barrel a couple of times with about 50 rounds of slugs/00buck so it is basically new. I have used about 200-250 rounds of #8birdshot for clay shooting in the vent rib barrel. This gun was always cleaned after every range trip within hours. Always maintained and stored with thin coat of oil to preserve bluing. I have only owned it for about a year (first owner). I'm looking to upgrade to semi auto shotgun, so I plan on selling this one.Selling for $300.00 firm. Buyer pays transfer fee. Will do transfer only at Turners Reseda or The Target Range Vanuys. I have original gun lock. Text me at REDACTED or leave me a message. I might not be able to get to the phone because I'm in classroom most of the time. THANKS!!!"

The 1927 Sistemas are the same gun as a regular 1911A1 but were manufactured for and issued to the Argentine military and police forces. They are considered authentic mil spec 1911s by Colt and Colt collectors. In 1927, the Argentine Arsenal began manufacturing the Model 1911A1, production continued through 1966. The slide on this firearm is marked on each side with lines that read ""EJERCITO ARGENTINO SIST.COLT.CAL. 11.25mm MOD.1927"" which means Argentine Army, Sistema Colt, and notes the caliber, and the model number. The other side is stamped ""DGFM FMAP"" which stands for  (D.G.F.M.)  Direccion General de Fabricaciones Militares or the ""Military Manufacturing Agency."" (F.M.A.P.) Fabrica Militar de Armas Portatiles or ""Small Arms Factory. These guns were made in Argentina under license from Colt, with Colt machinery, and with the help & supervision of Colt engineers. They are known as ""Model 1927 Sistema Colt"" or Colt system. Parts from the 1927 Sistema are interchangable with those of the 1911A1 unlike the later Ballester Molina models. According to the serial number, mine was one of six hundred manufactured in 1963. This .45 looks, feels and shoots beautifully, all serial numbers match and the pakrerizing is excellent. The gun has Pachmayr custom grips, comes with seven magazines, the original grips and a Blackhawk Serpa OWB right hand holster. Cash price is $900.00 but I'm also looking for a lever action deer gun and I'm willing to do some trading. You can own a piece of military history. This gun would look beautiful displayed or can still be carried everyday. I have a CCW and I would prefer you have one as well or at least have an Ohio Drivers License and be willing to sign a bill of sale. If this ad is still up, the gun is still available. Thank you for looking. Have a good day."

I love this pistol but it is a little to big for my hands. I am a smaller guy and it is just a little to thick for me to grip well. I am looking to see if anyone would be open to a trade. Weapon is less then a year old has had probably 300 rounds through it. Never had any failures of any type. Some slight holster wear which is barely noticable. I have two holsters to go with it. One is a hidden hybrid the second is a small leather holster made for appendix carry. I do not have pictures to post at the moment but if you are interested I will take some and send them to you.
