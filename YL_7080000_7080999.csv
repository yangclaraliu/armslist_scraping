I have owned the gun for about 5 months and have shot less than 100 rounds. I also replaced the original lever loop with a larger lever loop ($50) for easier action. However, I will also be giving you the original lever loop as part of the deal in case you have smaller hands. This is a beautiful gun that I immediately fell in love with, but it is a little heavy for younger boys to shoot with its octagonal barrel. This is a mans gun and so I am looking for a lighter lever action gun for my younger son and grandsons to shoot. I still have the receipt of the gun where I purchased it from Ranch & Home for $749 plus tax. I am willing to eat a few dollars in order to purchase a lever action gun that is a little lighter for my grandson to shoot. The lever action on this gun is really smooth and there is hardly any recoil at all. Call, text or email if you are interested. My cell is five-zero-nine, eight-five-one, four-six-three-zero. My email is ptdaveb at yahoo. My name is Dave"

This is the combination of a trigger safety, firing pin safety and drop safety that render the loaded pistol incapable of firing, even when banged or bumped, unless someone actually squeezes the trigger. Three full capacity 10- round magazines are provided with Glock 30 Gen4 pistols. A set of white outline sights sit on top of the slide, are highly visible, easy to use and track reasonably well. The 3.78"" hexagonal hammer forged barrel of the Glock 30 Gen4 increase muzzle velocity and provide greater accuracy than conventional rifled barrels. Overall, the Glock 30 Gen4 is a powerful, compact, accurate and versatile self-defense handgun that is built for a lifetime of reliable service."

In this case, different is very good. The Model 70 Ultimate Shadow, with its flowing lines and integrated, rubberized, oval-dot gripping surfaces on the pistol grip and fore-end looks distinct from other composite rifles. When you pick it up, you’ll know why. The stock immediately gives you a comfortable, secure hold even when wet or cold. It feels tight (and light) in your hands and gives you better control from any shooting angle. Lightweight is good. The Ultimate Shadow is also lightweight. You can carry it into remote, rugged country without worrying about any extra weight, or dinging up the rifle when the hike gets rough. The free-floating barrel and M.O.A. Trigger System contributes to exceptional accuracy and its classic, Controlled Round Feed action continues to make the Ultimate Shadow’s receiver the most reliable and smoothest cycling in the industry."

This gun is in great shape! It has a few light scratches but any gun this old will. Serial number puts production at 1987. Old enough to be made when Remington still built quality guns (I don't think there's a single plastic piece on this gun) but new enough to have modern features like a ported barrel that's threaded for rem-choke. Finish is deep blued with engraving on the receiver and bolt and wood is checkered walnut with a glossy, hard finish. The 28 inch barrel is ported behind the bead and chambered for magnum 20 Guage 3"" shells. The smooth bore slug barrel has a 2 3/4"" chamber, adjustable it on sights and is in slightly rougher shape but is still 100 percent functional. I'm not factoring the slug barrel into the price anyway, it's just a free extra. I took several wood ducks with this last year before I realized it's too pretty to be dragged on a hunt. That's my opinion anyway, but I need to thin out my gun collection so it must go. Email me for more pictures, I can't put more than one high resolution on Armslist."
