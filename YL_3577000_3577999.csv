Many dealers online with advertise this gun, but  then under the lower price they will print....

Of course you can advertise a lower price if it will take you six months to get one of these lovely limited production masterpieces.

If you want a Gun NOW that will go up in value and make you the talk at the Gun Range, this one is for you. If you do the math, this is a steal.

http://www.thesksmagadapter.com/our-products/

The SKS Magazine Adapter was developed because a lot of potential customers refused to permanently modify their rifle or stock. They requested we come up with something they could use without making any VISIBLE changes to their stock. The G3/1 is just the ticket for doing that. We devised a ""tail piece"" that holds the adapter tight under the front mag tab (trunnion) on the barrel. The only modification to the stock is a very slight removal of some wood or polymer where the locking piece contacts the stock on the INSIDE. You may need to relieve the mag well also if the magazine is binding. It will be shipped ""matte black"", anodized, aircraft aluminum, with the socket head screw and wrench necessary to install/adjust it. The adapter WILL FIT ANY SKS type stock. It is a ""drop-in"" fit for your stock. It does not use the cross pin. You can now use your cleaning rod in the stock with this adapter."

This makes a huge difference in recoil and shoot ability. This would be a great revolver for the alternative methods portion of the upcoming Whitetail season."

This barrel boasts CMMG's W.A.S.P. salt bath nitrocarbuerization treatment, sometimes known as nitriding, which offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance as compared to chrome lining or phosphating. Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without build-up, so accuracy is not compromised. The barrel and upper receiver have M4 feed ramps for flawless cycling. A ""F"" marked front sight post/gas block is fitted, and a removable MBUS rear sight is included.

The upper receiver is forged aluminum with a flat top Picatinny rail for easy and secure mounting of optics. A M4-style handguard with a heat shield is equipped. The lower is forged as well, with a low shelf for RDIAS, and is compatible with standard mil-spec componentry. The magazine well is bevelled for quicker, more confident reloads. An adjustable butt stock and A2-style pistol grip are outfitted. Front and rear sling mounts are mounted for easy carrying."

The factory 3-dot sights have been upgraded with the excellent Trijicon HD night sights, orange front, dated 2013 (see https://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=HK110O). The factory V1 LEM trigger was changed to the excellent TGS (Todd Green Special) LEM configuration. This trigger setup is widely discussed online, just google for it, but in brief, it brings the V1 LEM weight up from about 4 lbs to about 5.5-6 lbs and provides that weight evenly throughout the trigger travel. Not as good for competition shooting, but much better LEM setup for concealed carry. All upgrades professionally installed by a gunsmith, so you don't see the silly marring and gouges left behind by many DIY-ers.

The pistol is otherwise completely stock and comes with the original factory steel 15-round magazines (two of them), factory box (serialed to pistol) and HK factory goodies (e.g. manual, test fire casings, all three backstraps (medium is installed), HK lock, HK sticker). Original sights and V1 LEM springs are included.

I am the original owner and purchased this pistol as a backup to my carry gun. 

Fired over 500 rounds over a few range trips as part of my regular protocol for testing a new gun (e.g. function check, feeding of different hollow-point self-defense ammo). Shoots like a dream. Very accurate. Thoroughly cleaned and inspected after range trips. Lubricated per factory recommendations.

Good-looking and rugged pistol, great for concealed carry or just plain fun at the range. If your daily carry setup is not squared away yet, don't miss this opportunity to pick up a terrific, like-new carry gun with the desirable (and often hard to find) LEM trigger variant.

I live in Birmingham, but travel to Huntsville and Mobile regularly. I can provide proof (e.g. pistol permit) that I am a good guy and as many references as you need from recent firearms transactions. Deal with confidence. I won't waste your time, please don't waste mine.

I have 2 lap tops for trade for a handgun or Ruger 10/22 Rifle!  The Dell is model Latitude D-600 we had it working when we reloaded it then it just went to blue screen so all it needs is a new hard drive and this Dell would rock. New hard drives are $40-$60 dollars.  Comes with charger when its has a new hard drive added it will function flawless everything else works.  The other lap top is a Acer Aspire 55702 it works but the finger mouse board is not working and 2 of the keys are not working. I always just hooked up an external keyboard and mouse by USB and used this lap top and it works great then!  The second picture of the Acer came out blurry the icons are very clear and nice on the display.  Both these lap tops ONLY need someone who has the know how and time to fix little things on them. Both come with charger plug in adapters.  The Dell has a nylon carry case. The Acer holds charge great with strong lithium Ion battery.  The Dell had some charge on its lithium Ion so it should recharge when you put a new hard drive in it.  I'm also willing to throw in leather work for any kind of knife sheath you might need for one of your fix blade combat knives or hunting knife. I do professional looking leather work.  Here is a list of hand guns below I'm interested in and I'm trying to stay away from high end handguns to be fair on this trade.

The UBL-37 is the B&D re-creation of the venerable M-203. It is single action with a cocking lever on the side. It boasts a positive trigger block safety. As with all B&D Launcher products, it is chambered in 37/38 mm and made to the highest standards of American workmanship. Constructed of 6061 aircraft grade aluminum and 4140 hardened steel, it is rugged while maintaining a reasonable weight.

This product has particular appeal to SWAT Launcher Specialists who might prefer to have a launcher as part of their primary armament. 
The UBL-37 attaches to any rifle or carbine fitted with a Picatinny Rail using the included Picatinny to Picatinny clamp.

Based on the proven design of the Viet Nam era M-203 grenade launcher, the UBL-37 has advanced it to new levels. As always, state of the art materials are used throughout. The plastic forward grip is now machined from Teflon stock for a sure grip and sleek appearance. All metal parts are Hard Coated or Black Oxide treated. We think that you will agree that it is a perfect counterpoint to your tactical weapon platform.

The UBL-37 is equipped with a 9” barrel topped with a full length Picatinny Rail for attachment to your Picatinny Rail equipped weapon. The underside of the barrel has a 4” rail at the muzzle end for bipod or other accessories. Loading is accomplished by releasing the barrel and sliding it forward to it’s positive stop. Ammunition up to 6” long can be easily accommodated. The latest design uses a machined Teflon grip and shorter, thinner barrel. The combination of these innovations has reduced the weight of the original by over a pound.

The UBL-37 will handle 37mm ammunition made by any manufacturer. Available ammunition includes flares, smoke and other pyrotechnic rounds for civilian use. If you are a member of law enforcement or the military you can have a variety of “Less Than Lethal” rounds at your disposal. These include Batons, CS Gas, Wildlife Management (Bird Control) and crowd dispersing Rubber Pellets. Rounds up to 6” long can be accommodated."

The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. 


The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."

-One Glock factory 6.02 inch long barrel ($172 retail value)
-All original Glock accessories including:

Utilizing the time-tested rotating bolt and adjustable gas piston operating system, the SIG556xi allows operators a choice of caliber, barrel length, handguard/stock configurations and lower receivers. 

A removable barrel allows the operator to select the necessary length for a given mission. Adding the appropriate bolt, the SIG556xi can be changed to any of three calibers, 5.56x45mm NATO, 300 Blackout, and 7.62x39mm NATO. Users can also quickly change out the non-serialized lower receiver, allowing the use of either AR-style STANAG magazines or rock-and-lock AK-style magazines. The SIG556xi upper receiver is the serialized part, making the lower an easy to purchase part. 

Polymer handguards accept all Magpul® light and rail kits.  Truly ambidextrous, the SIG556xi features an ambi safety selector, magazine release and user swappable charging handle (right- or left-handed). Optional receiver end plates allow for the use of either AR receiver extension tubes and buttstocks or M1913 compatible stocks.

The barrel has NOT been counterbored. The bolt is in great shape and is smooth and the headspace checks out to be safe to shoot. I have scrubbed the chamber so there will be no sticky bolt issues. This will be an accurate, reliable, and fun shooter. 

The stock is an excellent condition post-war stock in a nice, dark color, not the weird red shellac which is so common. No cracks, gouges, or splits. 

With this package, you know what you're getting and being prepped for you, it will be good to go right away. Great rifles."

Dependable and durable AK style long stroke gas piston
Thicker receiver than an AK, The receiver is as thick as a Russian LMG receiver and built to outlast you!

 It has had about 80 rounds through it, all brass cased non-corrosive ammo. It has a tabuk flash hider which really helps when firing 7.62x54r ball ammo. The action is butter smooth and cycles flawlessly. The wood is in great shape. This rifle is very comfortable to hold and does not kick quite as hard as a Mosin Nagant. 
This was my bear gun, and now that I'm downsizing my arsenal, it needs to find a new home. It is very accurate with the right ammo, and it's a great gun all around. I'm including five- 5 round magazines.
 The mags alone are worth $225 @$45/each, plus you cannot find five-rounders ANYWHERE. This would make an enthusiast like myself very happy, as well as anyone who likes to hunt large game

Comes with :
Rifle
Sling
Five-  5-round magazines (valued at $225)
Tabuk flash hider


I also have an endless supply of Russian 7.62x54r surplus if you are interested in buying any (though i recommend not using mil-surp in this rifle, and cleaning thoroughly afterwards if you do)"

I have a Browning B-80 L. It came to me scratched up on the sides of the aluminum receiver, but in otherwise pretty good shape. I polished the sides with the intent of Duracoating it, but I like it and left it like it is.  There are some small scratches in the remaining finish of the receiver. Barrel and stock finish are good.  It takes Beretta 300 series barrels and the Browning barrel on the gun is stamped PB. It has a 28"" to the end of the adjustable poly choke barrel.
I like it. Doves? mod. Turkey? crank it down to full. 
This gun has the adapter installed to shoot light target loads and function with everything you put in it.
It has a new Houge pad and the factory pad is included and will screw right back on.
It has been a relatively easy gun to shoot well and a fairly light kicker for a 12 ga.
It looks pretty good, shoots better than it looks and has the longevity of a 300 series Beretta.
Thanks
Mike"

By popular demand, Buffalo Bore is introducing five new 38 Super+P loads. With three different expanding loads and two penetrating loads, we have covered the basis of anything you'd like to accomplish with the 38 Super+P cartridge. These are full power 38 Super+P loads. All five of these loads feature flash suppressed powders so the shooter will not be blinded if firing in low light. Feeding, function and accuracy was very good in all three of our test pistols.

The first run is stamped bar 10 bushmaster on receiver.. This series had issues with bolt and chamber; the fixed series is stamped on receiver as mod. Bushmaster .308. Mine is the second run bar10 modified bushmaster .308. It has NO issues with bolt and chamber. 
The BAR-10 was meant to compete in the .308 market against Armalite's AR-10 series rifles and Springfield Armory's M1A Rifle by offering a .308 rifle that could accept the relatively inexpensive metric and inch pattern FN FAL magazines.
**Due to funding and lack of demand this complete model was sold to Rock River Arms in the 2006 year range** 
Now that the demand has increased for this caliber- Bushmaster has came out with an OCR model. The OCR gun is a nice model but was not built to the standards of the original BAR10. 
A2- Bar10 308 - With factory upgraded Skeleton stock and Izzy Muzzle Brake, factory hard case, and two magazines.
ONE OF THE MOST ACCURATE 308s ON THE MARKET
It is in perfect working order, with minimal signs of ever being used.
The Bushmaster .308 series was manufactured in late 2004-2005
THIS IS NOT THE O.R.C.- This is the edition that was built better than all the rest to beat the competition. At the time it was the only ambidextrous 308 on the market! 
$1250 
Heres what Bushmaster has to say about this gun:
The magazine controls are ingenious, both in how they have been adapted to the FAL magazine and in how their ergonomics offer the shooter improved control. The magazine catch is a spring-loaded latch that engages the locking lug on the FAL magazine’s upper rear face. The release is fully ambidextrous. When the release is pressed from either side, a lever retracts the latch and the magazine drops free.

Like the magazine catch, the bolt release is a departure. It consists of a one-piece bar that extends across the bottom of the rifle just forward of the trigger guard behind the magazine well. Pressing down on either side releases the bolt. The optional ambidextrous safety transforms the Bushmaster .308 into the only fully ambidextrous AR-type rifle available. Bushmaster also eliminated the sometimes inconvenient charging handle latch, replacing it with a hidden spring-loaded detent in the center of the charging handle that engages a recess in the upper receiver.
The upper and lower receivers are made of forged 7075-T6 aluminum. About half of the .308’s components interchange with those of .223-Rem. caliber rifles, but none are stressed, so reliability is"
