68,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7172068,For Sale:  Leather Dual Loop Holster and Cartridge Belt,"24503, Lynchburg, Virginia",$ 75,"Listed On: Monday, August 7, 2017",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Western style brown leather holster and cartridge belt manufactured by Hunter Holster Company. Both items in New Old Stock (NOS) condition: purchased new, never used, stored in a drawer for the last 10 years. The holster and belt are set up for right hand wear, but the holster could be worn on left side for cross draw. The leather holster is in frontier dual loop style, comes with hammer thong and leg tie thong (both removable), and is designed to fit a single action revolver with 7.5"" barrel (full barrel coverage). The leather cartridge belt is sized XL (approximate adjustment range is 46-51""), and has 25 sewn-on leather loops to fit .44, .45 and possibly other cartridge sizes. (I have tested it with .44-40 and .45 Long Colt cartridges: both sizes fit well.) This authentically-fashioned leather gear would work very well for a cowboy action shooting participant, a frontier re-enactor, or anyone who simply prefers this classic holster belt style. Both holster and belt are in excellent, unworn condition. Cartridges were once stored in the belt loops for a period of several months: as the brass casings tarnished, they stained the belt leather above and below the loops -- you will see exactly the same tarnish marks on the original 1800s gun belts that this belt is modeled after. See detail photos provided. Please note that the 7.5"" barreled revolver and the .44-40 cartridges shown in one photo are not being offered for sale in this post: these items are shown in order to illustrate their fit in this leather gear. Additional photos available on request.Price is $75.00 cash for the holster and belt as a set. This is less than half the price you'd pay in purchasing these items from a retail seller. I will consider selling the holster and belt separately ($40 cash each) if anyone wants to contact me about that possibility. The holster and belt can be viewed/picked up in or near Lynchburg."

I had hoped to fit a magazine extension to it and use it for some competition now and then, but I have since learned that the A300 can't accept them. It comes with the factory box and everything that came with it.  Thanks for checking it out.All face-to-face transactions require a valid Ohio ID. I may consider some trades listed below, but not much off of that list. Absolutely NO non-firearm trades (chainsaws, Xboxes, body armor, etc.) will be considered, period. My bills are paid here; lowballing me is a waste of your time.  I do travel between Mansfield and Columbus frequently; I am happy to bring it with me if you live along that area, but I'm not delivering the shotgun halfway across the state.

I personally have a FS .40 but a good friend of mine has a FS .9mm that also fits like a glove. This holster makes a FS pistol unnoticeable. The only reason I am selling is because I recently bought a S&W Shield so I no longer carry my FS. If you haven't done your research on holsters StealthGear makes, in my opinion and quite a few others, one of the best quality and most comfortable American made gun holsters on the market. This holster was $115 when I bought it and it has no damage what so ever. Keep in mind, when you buy a holster from StealthGear, you won't get it for about 2 months. It takes them a month just to process the order, then they have to make it. If you are interested, you can text me anytime during normal hours at nine1nine eightthreezero threesixsixsix or email.Thanks"

This rifle will run circles around the DPMS GII. I removed the PRS stock so my son could have an adjustable stock while deer hunting. This is a great gun for kids to hunt with because of the minimal recoil, accuracy, ease of aiming with the scope, and it’s heavy (but not too heavy for them to manipulate) so it sits great on shooting sticks or a bipod. Not to mention in the hands of a trained individual it’s role and abilities are very nice to have.  Will sell entire package for $2000 Cash. Details Below. Willing to ship to your FFL once funds clear if you live out of the area and can provide references. Over $3200 invested.Rifle is a DPMS AR-10 SASS upgraded and modified for hunting and tactical use with a Timney 4lb trigger which makes this rifle a dream to shoot.Chrome moly bolt carrier and DPMS 7.62x51 heavy fluted stainless teflon coated barrel with a Surefire SFMB muzzle brake ready for a suppressor. (If you look up the SFMB or SureFire Muzzle Brake it actually has been proven to increase accuracy and has many other qualities, without a suppressor).Has MAGPUL MBUS back up sights that are zeroed at 100 yards. Shoots 1/2 MOA or better at 100. Barrel break in procedures were followed and rifle was always meticulously cleaned inside and out and stored inside. Rifle is clean and in Mint Condition with the exception of a few marks in the finish on the ejection port case deflector from the brass casing being ejected and deflected away from the shooter.  Only 43 Rounds down the barrel so this rifle is just going to get more accurate as you shoot it which is insane because this rifle is already like shooting a nice bolt action with half the recoil. This is the link for the scope if you want to check it out: https://www.midwayusa.com/product/346427/burris-fourx-tactical-xtr-rifle-scope-30mm-tube-15-6x-40mm-illuminated-xtr-ballistic-762-reticle-matte. Included are:-The DMPS SASS Rifle-1 PMAG 20 Round magazine and two stock metal 20 round magazines -Burris FourX Tactical XTR Illuminated (push button to toggle reticle illumination intensity) (European Version of the XTR) 308 Ballistically tuned 1.5-6x40mm (30mm diameter tube) scope.

IT WAS CUSTOM MADE FOR MY RIFLE. I BELIEVE IT IS A SOLAR TACTICAL KYDEX GRIP.  Other info: These were the model that came out before the sub-2000. The SUB 9 was WAY more durable than the sub-2000. It came with a complete BILLET receiver with mostly all STEEL/ALUMINUM construction. Even the sights are all ALUMINUM. The only parts that are polymer is the butt stock and the handguard. It folds in half and can fit most laptop cases. IT CANNOT FIRE IN THE CLOSED POSITION.  The lock up is extremely tight and theres no play WHATSOEVER. It's got a heavy, yet CRISP trigger. It is a blowback design rifle. ALSO, unlike the sub-2000, the SUB 9 has a last round bolt hold open FEATURE, which is REALLY NICE. It's extremely light yet durable for what the SUB 9 is. I bought this gun brand new and have put less than 50 rounds in it. I'm selling it because I'm more into the AR's right now and don't see a need for this gun any longer.   BTW THIS GUN IS FEATURELESS. The gunsmith had to drill the receiver to attach a bullet button, so I declined. This gun is in MINT condition.  PM ME or call me for more information.  Donald 949 three three one 4299"

I have moved to an IWB holster with my VP9 so I am letting the CPX go and that is the only reason. It is in excellent condition with two magazines, a Fobus OWB holster (not correct for the pistol but it works), an OWB flap holser (good for working outside keeping debris off the pistol) and an ambi IWB holser. The last holster works exceptionally well for SOB carry, which is how I carried the CPX most of the time. No one can tell you have a concealed. No ammo is included. As stated it is a CPX-1 so it has the external safety/decoker which works very well. This is an excellent carry pistol and is VERY accurate. I liked it so much I bought the -2 model for both of our sons. My asking price is a FIRM $200 for the pistol, mags and holsters. If I can't get that it will stay with me. Yes I know you can buy one at Bobby Joe's Pawn and Pottery in the box for $250 but those are -2, the -1 model will cost about $275 with no extras. To buy this you must have a current NCDL and a current NC CHP or permit to purchase and be willing to sige a bill of sale. If you have the permit to purchase I will need the original and not a copy. Yep, believe it or not, that one was tried once. Email or text and I shall respond as soon as possible. FTF cash in Greensboro area only. I do not need help selling and spammers can eat dirt and, well you know...  thanks fer lookin'. If the ad is still up the pistol is still for sale."
