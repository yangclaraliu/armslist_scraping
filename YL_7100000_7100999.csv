Winchester only produced 196,400 Model 50s between 1954 and 1961. Winchester stopped production because it was too expensive to manufacture, and the profit margin per unit was too low. A true “pre-64 Winchester”, the Model 50 is considered a well built and reliable shotgun – it has all machined parts and no stamped, cast or plastic anywhere. It is a short bolt blowback action with a floating chamber, and the first production autoloader with a non-recoiling barrel (the Browning A5 and the Remington 48 have recoiling barrels). This shotgun is at 98% (almost pristine bluing and stock) swings and tracks quickly, making it a favorite with many champion skeet and trap shooters.
This particular shotgun was manufactured in 1961 and features a 28 inch full fixed choke barrel and walnut “field grade” stocks with factory hand-cut checkering. The stock is free of cracks, chips, deep scratches, or gouges but may have some light handling marks. There is no rust, pitting, or cracks in the metal. This is a NICE gun!Serious Inquiries Only!
Add this rare Winchester to your collection, or take it into the field next season!

I love my Taurus but, since I have the Glock 43 which is almost identical in size to the Taurus PT-709 slim, I'm looking for something smaller and easier to carry, being that I am a female. Possibly a .380. I really like the .380 S&W bodyguard. Just let me know what you have and we can talk trade!  I have a beautiful 9mm, Taurus PT-709 Slim COMES WITH 3 Mags total! Capable of holding 7+1. What I love about this gun is the variety of safety features this gun is equipped with. That is why as a single mother I went with the PT-709 Slim. It has a key ring adjuster, one side is a tool to adjust your sights, the other tool is made to fit a small button hole on the right side that disables the slide action completely, until it's turned again. It has the standard slide safety/flip-up switch on the left side, and just like the Glock it has a trigger safety. This gun is nearly the same exact size and weight of the Glock 43, (as I have both and have compared the two) the only differences being that the Taurus has the extra safety features, and the grip on the Taurus is a bit longer, which in my opinion is more comfortable and adds more stability. I haven't done any kind of special customization internal or external, so no tweaking has been done to any of the parts on this gun, with the exception of adding a grip extender to one of the magazines to get a feel for the comfort.. and simply breaking it down and cleaning it regularly. Another pro: being that it is 9mm, the price of ammo for the 9mm is significantly cheaper to find compared to .380 ammo. ☡All in All☡: I have a 9mm Taurus PT-709 Slim handgun, 3 magazines (one mag with a grip extender added), a hard case (right hand) belt holster molded to fit the pistol, Key ring sight adjusting tool, and slide lock disablement/enablement tool, and the original box. Thanks,Natalie Call/Text me @ REDACTED."

Two have no cracks, two look professionally repaired and one needs glue repair. Look at the pictures. Some have a light surface rust and others do not. I cocked and pulled the trigger on all of them and they fire. Triggers appear to be adjustable for pull weight and are smooth and light to the pull. All have front sights, but there are only two rear sights. One of them (windage) needs a ball bearing and spring (similar to an AR15 rear sight spring and bearing.) All have adjustable rubber buttpads."

ALL of the ammo is FMJ, Brass, new factory loads from quality companies. Better than 'Walmart' loads from Fed/Win/Rem/CCI, etc. Some are significantly hotter (Chrono'd to compare). The Geco .45 and 38 loads are great and from the Swiss. I found Euro ammo from S&B/Fiocchi/Geco/Aguila/PPU to be more consistent and hotter for training.$13 - 38Special - 125 and 158 Grain (250-300 Avail) (Great ammo. Accurate, most relaxing/enjoyable shooting experience though a lever-action Carbine (Rossi 92, my favorite to shoot of 13 guns..).

S&B, Aguila and Fiocchi have all impressedme w/ full-power and best value. The last 30 rounds are 135gr FM Reman and shoot fine. $20 for 300 Round box of CCI MiniMags, $15 with other ammo bought.Need to sell QUICK!

I've done some more research and have been contacted by some knowledgeable individuals sharing their information and here is was I've learned; this isnt an authentic WW2 military sword but it's not a Chinese knockoff either. This blade is a Japanese handmade folded steel blade (not made with Tamahagane steel though) made in Japan in the 60's and 70's to look like a WW2 Katana. The Hamon isn't present because someone probably polished the blade, it might come back with an acid etch though. But the blade is still a very beautiful pattern welded (Damascus) with minimal spotted surface rust. Also I've  been told that the scabbard or Saya could be an original WW2 but that's unknown for sure. It's a shame it isn't an authentic WW2 katana but it's a Japanese made katana and a pretty cool conversation piece as well.$250 OBO open to trades"
