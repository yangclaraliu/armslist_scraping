Very nice condition.
- All matching serial numbers with bright bore, defined rifling & minimal muzzle wear.
- Milled with threaded barrel and original cleaning rod.
- Original Bayonet, sling, manual, multi-tool with cleaning kit and 10 stripper clips.
- Original scope mount with rings, plus a vintage Bushnell Sportview 4x scope.
- Beautiful Walnut original stock and black hard case
- 10 round original magazine.
- Must show valid Indiana Drivers License, as I will for you with a simple ""Bill of Sale/Trade"" included.
- Please note: The only issue I'm aware of with this SKS is the receiver cover pin wants to ""walk out"" slightly when rapid fired. If you're an SKS/AK guy you already know about this.
- I just took this rifle to the range on October 1st and it shot great! I shot brand new Lapua brass, Wolf steel & Romanian mil-surp (1972) ammo through it with zero FTF or FTE. I have video of some rounds going down range on my phone I could show you. Again, I noticed the pin walking slightly after a number of rounds. No biggie, just full disclosure. I'd appreciate the same about your trade. Safety first :)
- I can drive to you, if it's semi-close to Indianapolis. My father is retired and we enjoy getting out together.
- Many more pictures available upon request

yet another one of my short term items. One month old.  The scope is not included but can be talked about though. 
at atlantic fire arms these are 870 new.  This is the gen2 one in black. The short stroke piston is fun to use with very low recoil. based upon the leader dynamics rifle this newly designed ar style rifle brings new life to a very limited run of the original 2000 or so leader dynamics rifle. The triangular bolt system is the same that is still currently used in the barret 50cals.  I have some youtube videos of this up and you can also locate them by searching for masterpiece arms mpar556.
It is just 34 days old. Has a non reciprocating charge handle and a folding stock from ati. This super compact ar rifle is fun to shoot. The low recoil of it is pleasantly surpising. The short stroke piston system makes it run less dirty then the regular impingement gas tube system. This is a low serial number under 1000 as this just became available this summer. The generation one however came out in 2013. The changes to this one were a newly made forward encasement that is really nice on the hands. Improvements to the gas block and the new muzzle break. thats what I can remember right off

It comes with everything like new. The magpul gen2 30 round magazine
the hard shell case
The manual
some frog lube and breakthrough solvent samples
needs to purchase
local omaha area or so
purchase permit
funding

email me and all that and with cell number to discuss if you want. a voice talk will take place before we meet sometime

as with all of my random whims aggressive marketing and finding a home for this is of utmost importance. 
ask me stuff about it. you can also go see my youtubes by searching for Megzamani and looking for them. i have represented the rifle as accurate as i know at this time.
I have had a few stovepipes and light primer strikes. Maybe a wear in period since the round count through this is oh what about 400 in a month. a hundred each weekend."

Ruger To Auction First Production Run Ruger American Rimfire™ Rifles From Mayodan, NC 
March 14, 2014 
In September 2013, Ruger finalized the purchase of a 220,000 square foot facility in Mayodan, NC. This was the Company's first major expansion in over 25 years, and production was expected to begin during the first quarter of 2014. Production actually began late Fall of 2013! The boxes of the first 1,000 rifles were affixed with a special ""First Production Run"" sticker. Rifles with serial numbers 832-01001 through 832-02000 were the only ones to leave the factory with this special sticker. We are auctioning five of those rifles. The other 995 rifles were circulated through distribution in the Carolinas only.
 The Ruger American Rimfire™ rifle is made of alloy steel with a satin blued finish and features a 22-inch barrel, fiber optic front sight and adjustable rear sight. The stock is black composite and includes two interchangeable stock modules that provide comb height options for scope or sight use. It also features the detachable, flush-mounted 10/22® BX-1 10-round rotary magazine.

550,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3540550,"For Sale/Trade:  AR-15 ""ghost"" gun lower 80% w/ jig","Brookfield, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 85,"Listed On: Saturday, December 6, 2014",Rifles,no type,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic,no type,"I have a few 80% polymer lowers (reinforced around the critical areas, such as the buffer tube) with the jigs (guides that clamp on over the lower to show you exactly where to drill your holes) and screws needed.  These are the G150 model (2nd gen) and normally run $100 plus shipping.  These do not include any drill bits (I can include one new set of the drill bits and mill bit for an extra $25).

These are perfectly legal to transform at home into an AR-15 rifle or pistol lower without needing to get the manufacturing stamp from the ATF.  They have no serial numbers, which is why they're sometimes called ""ghost"" guns because there's no way to track them.  It only requires a drill or Dremel (drill press is easiest, or you can use a mill), and being polymer it's a lot faster and easier to drill and hollow out the requisite spaces than aluminum to make a lightweight gun to add to your collection.  All you have to do is drill/cut out the red part in the fire control group and drill the holes as indicated on the jig and you'll have a stripped lower for your project.

Must meet me locally (Brookfield), or pay $6 extra for priority shipping.  Because these aren't considered firearms by the ATF, I believe I can ship it to you directly no matter where in the US you live (but you're responsible for knowing your local laws, etc.)."

Century Arms ""Centurion"" C39 AKMS.  Milled receiver with some killer mods.  Purchased new earlier this year from Classic Firearms for $619 (plus shipping and FFL/tax, which brought it to about $750).  It's about 6 months old, has about 600 rounds down the barrel. This thing has the Tapco G2 trigger and is fun as hell to shoot - doesn't require a lot of maintenance, and I've never had a problem with ANYTHING - but it's an AK, so you already knew that!  Hits easily at 100 yards with the red dot... amazingly accurate gun.  Only thing that one might want to make this rifle complete is a nice cerakote job.  Here's a link for the gun itself:

http://www.classicfirearms.com/centurionakmsrifle7-62x39milledreceiver

Mods are:
1. Midwest Industries extended AK rail w/ optic specific top cover: $155

2. Primary Arms micro red dot: $50  (I paid $90 for it when I purchased it)

3. Command Arms aluminum stock adapter/tube: $110

4. Magpul AK grip/CTR stock with cheek riser:  $90
5. Magpul XTM hand stop kit and extra rail panels: $30
6. Recoil buffer pad installed as well, cost about $10

All told, I've got about $1,200 in the gun itself  (counting shipping/tax/FFL).  The lower tang was removed to install the CAA stock adapter, which fits tight - you'll never miss the lower tang.

$1,000 firm for the rifle.  I have the factory stock and a few other odds and ends for it (baseplate for the optic, some grease, etc...) And NO, I will not make any changes to the rifle, IE. return it to stock, take parts off of it, etc.  Comes as is."

I love this gun and it's in great shape but I've decided to go with something easier to conceal and carry and just bought an XD-S, so I need to sell this.

I am the second owner so round count is unknown but I'd say less than 500. I added TruGlo TFOs to at along with a DPM Systems Recoil Reduction System [url]http://www.dpmsystemsusa.com/Mechanical-System-for-Glock-29-30-36-1-3-Generation_p_37.html[/url] that really helps tame the recoil, especially with hotter loads.

I have three 10 round mags and two 15 round mags with the X-Grip sleeves. I also have 5 different holsters (Foxx IWB, BlackHawk! Serpa CQC, Remora, MTAC and can't remember the brand of the last one but it's a brown leather OWB). Finally, I have 200 rounds of PPU 180gr range ammo and approximately 80 rounds of mixed Underwood 155 and 180gr SD ammo.

The Model 60 is essentially a “Chiefs Special Stainless”. It is a 5 Shot “J” Frame revolver that was designed after the Model 36, the famous original “Chiefs Special”. You will find this true with a lot of older S&W Models as they were improved upon with the invention of Stainless Steel to make them stronger. The first Model 60 was made in 1965 as Smith & Wesson's (First Stainless Steel Revolver).

This Model 60-9 was produced in the year 2000 before S&W Started adding the Lock above the Cylinder Release so, it is still considered a “Pre-Lock” S&W. 

Features Include,
• 2-1/8” Barrel Length
• Transfer Bar with Internal “Floating” Firing Pin (Safety Feature)
• Black Rubber S&W logo Grips
• .240” Service Hammer, Flat Faced
• .312” Smooth Trigger
• 5 Shot, Fluted Cylinder
Included will be the pair of Rosewood Grips from Altamont. 

This model 60 can handle a variety of ammo from .38 Special, .38 Special +P, and .357 Magnum.

It comes with original Box, and Owner’s Manual. Everything about this revolver is in its original form and has not been altered. Additional Pictures can be supplied upon request."

I'm looking for a place to go shooting.  I know there are ranges in town including; Fort Carson, whistling Pines, and of course the famous Dragon man's. All the mtn.  spots in the hills are closed or closing down; Rampart Range, Mount Herman, etc. I know  67 north of woodland pk but it kinda sucks up there.  I'm hoping to find a private land owner who owns some land maybe out east ( Falcon, Peyton, Callahan, Simla, Black forest ) or wherever and would allow me to take the wife and son out shooting from time to time. Looking to sight in a few rifles at 300 yards or so for elk season so bigger is better... Willing to pay a small "" usage fee""  if necessary but free99 is always best.  Thanks for your time and let me know if you have the place in mind or can point me in the right direction... Thanks again Kris"

Most of which were destroyed or restamped with various European police markings. This particular gun is very rare as it was never proof stamped nor regiment stamped. These were called lunch box guns as near the end of the war, employees started pulling a few from the line to drop in their lunch pails. It has excellent finish for a late war time production and is in near mint condition. Perfect addition to any collection. I will leave this up locally for a couple of days before listing it on gunbroker.

Be over 21, have a valid FL Drivers License and if you have a CCW permit, have it with you. I will want to do a Firearm Bill of Sale. Ideal for concealed carry. Fits great in the pocket. I have been told this is the smallest 40 made. At $495.00 it will come with an additional 3 Factory brand new $45 each magazines.

It is a fantastic carry gun as it actually has 3 safety positions! Comes with case, speed loader, extended mag and regular mag. It is basically 2 sized guns in one. Using the regular mag, it makes for a nice concealed carry weapon. Also comes with an extended mag to make it full size. Be legal and I will do a bill of sale.
The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.
The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights.

Colt MK V
1982 - 1986 As with the MK III, the Mark V series was an entirely new product line of models which included Official Police, Lawman, and Trooper variants. The MK V series was based on a new, slightly smaller ‘V’ frame, similar in size to Smith & Wesson’s ‘K’ frame. Changes from the MK III models were minor and many parts remained identical. Internally, Colt did away with the sintered iron MK III lockwork in favor of cast parts, and improved the trigger action with new components and a shorter hammer fall. These improvements made the MK V triggers smoother, while the diminished lock times increased accuracy. Exterior modifications included a compact grip frame with rounded grips; other changes were engineering-based with the goal of simplifying and facilitating production"
