Being shorter and more compact than any other pistol buffer tube on the market, the new Micro Pistol Buffer Tube is the clear choice of our custom shop when it comes to a AR Pistol build.  This is the complete micro buffer tube kit for the AR-15 pistol. This kit will shorten the overall length of your AR pistol and works with your existing Mil-Spec Bolt Carrier allowing use with both gas impingement and gas piston systems. Shorten your AR pistol and make it more compact. Shorter than any other pistol buffer tube on the market and with its patented locking system still lets you brake open your AR without removing the front pivot pin. The built in ambidextrous Quick Disconnect sling recess give you the ability to attach a sling on either side. Made from 6061 Aluminum and 17/4 ph Stainless Steel.  One of the best features MVB has made is allowing you to use any mil spec BCG you want instead of a proprietary BCG. The benefits of this are pretty obvious to us being able to easily use this kit with both DI and Gas Piston systems and use the BCG of our choice.  Complete kit includes:  3 Piece Micro Buffer Tube with Ambi QD provision and Buffer Lock 4 – 7/8″ total length (from lower receiver) Dedicated Buffer & Spring H1 Buffer  Florida Sales tax for in state shippingVarious payment options: Visa, MC, Amex or Check (by mail).http://armorydynamics.com/MVB-Industries-Micro-Pistol-Kit-MPK-H1_p_232.html Armory Dynamics 3200 Caverns Road Marianna, FL 32446 Main: 850-262-7920 www.armorydynamics.com www.facebook.com/armorydynamics www.instagram.com/armorydynamics www.twitter.com/armorydynamics"

This rifle is in almost new condition.  It has been fired sparingly, has been well cared for, and it functions perfectly.  There are a few very minor usage and handling marks here and there.  The bluing is near perfect.  The stock is a very nice piece of walnut.  This rifle has been a ""safe queen"" for the past three decades.   
Unlike earlier Model 94's, the 94AE ejects cartridges from the side rather than from the top, so it can easily accommodate a scope if desired.  The top of this receiver was drilled and tapped at the factory for scope mounts.  
This rifle does not have the dreaded cross-bolt safety that Winchester introduced in 1992.  Nor does it have the tang safety that was introduced in later models.
I don't expect to be shooting this rifle in the future, so it needs to find a good home.  I am asking $450.  Buyer must be an Arizona resident, non-felon,  21 years old.  CASH only.  Not interested in trades."

No more struggling to find surplus 30-06, or buying expensive 30-06, instead you can fire it with common (and cheaper) 308!I have only fired around 100 rounds through her, it functions flawlessly and have never had a problem. The reason why I am selling my M1 is that I just don't use it that much. Includes Rifle, sling, rifle case, comes with (10) 8 round clips including (80) rounds of 308. This rifle is practically new .Gov issued M1.All Colorado Rules apply, including background check etc. Buyer is responsible for transfer fees.

Has a milled receiver and coldhammer chrome lined Bulgarian barrel. The gun needs re blued or refinished with cerakote. And it does not have the blonde furniture either that is why I'm asking only 1200. Also 600 rnds of ammo and 4 mags with one circle 10 mag. You must come to me. I will meet you in my town at Walmart our at a local gun shop right down the road from me. That's as far as I'm driving. And I know I had a list of things I would trade for but absolutely no trades I'm sorry but your mossberg 500 and high point is not what I meant when I said mossberg 930 jm model. It's not the same gun one is semi and the other is a cheap cop pump. But absolutely no trades no matter what gun you gun have I'm not interested. Now I would like to sell this firearm but I do not need to sell this firearm I just want to get into 3 gun so thinning out some of my collection. Sorry for the long post but as you know armslist has plenty of trolls that have no money and just waste your time please serious inquires only. And bill of sale is a must. And my schedule is going to be crazy here in the next few weeks so don't get mad cause I won't meet you the same day. Thanks again and God Bless America. However if you don't want the ammunition or mags I will lower the price a little. However when I see a wasr selling for $700 and an pap ak for $800 makes me wonder if I should spend and extra $150 for cerakote or hot blue and go ahead and buy the $129 Bulgarian set and sell for a little more. Please people before you ask me about this weapon email k-var or Arsenal about the rest of what the guns have. And no gun trades but rather trade for Honda trx 250r, trx 450r , Yamaha 450r or the 2004-2009 carberater or the 2009 to present full injectors. But consider that or any fourtrax 450r. Hand Yamaha banshee. Any year beside the j arms except the 87 banshee I will not accept unless lonstar fmf or houser race mx banshee. Have extra guns to trade up for the deal but don't think I'm a rookie at mx our firearms. Ok Arsenal with one mag  ill go down to $1000. But please no other dumb questions guys."

Serial # 1656XX left the factory in later 1952 or early '53. Features the Baumann front sight and the steel grip medallions only featured during the Korean War era. I would rate the bluing at 98%, with a light turn ring on the cylinder and some small areas at the end of the barrel. Case coloring is quite vibrant. Diamond magna grips are in excellent condition with a small ding on the bottom of the left panel and they are numbered to the gun. This is a beautiful gun from arguably the peak era of S&W quality, and would be a great addition to a collection. I'm a shooter and a hunter, not a collector, and this one is just too nice for me.
