It has been a safe queen. It has approximately 300 rounds through it and was always cleaned and lubed after each shooting session. Other than shooting it, i have ran snap caps through it on occasion (no dry firing). The trigger is crisp and smooth and it shoots like no other AR/M4 I have ever fired. I have never had a malfunction with this rifle, which is to be expected with a company like H&K. I have never seen another AR/M4 with this exact fit and finish. The tolerances are exact and it easily shoots sub MOA."

RARE SS192 “Green Ammo” was produced for ONLY 3 months before FN turned to the SS195LF. The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

Nice and clean pistol in great condition. Cleaned after each range session and just sits in the safe (more of a safe queen right now).Comes with one original flush 10-round and one extended 14-round extended magazine and original plastic case and manual.  Night sights still glow strong.Excerpts from the web:The P227 Tactical is a P227 Nitron with a number of enhancements. Purpose-built to wear a suppressor, it’s 5.1-inch barrel is threaded .578×28. The barrel comes with a thread protector for use when a suppressor is not installed. The slide is fitted with fixed, raised SIGLITE night sights designed to provide a full 3-dot sight picture above the top surface of the suppressor.Has a short-reset, DA/SA trigger exhibited an average double-action pull weight of 9 lbs. 14 oz, with a stroke length of just under one inch, but with no perceptible creep or stacking. In single-action mode, pull weight averaged 4 lbs. 1 oz., with take-up of 1/4, then not a hair’s width of additional movement before the hammer fell. Trigger reset is, indeed, short, with the trigger fully resetting after only 1/8” of forward travel.More review info here, http://ontargetmagazine.com/2015/07/sig-sauer-p227-tactical/Price: $800These are selling new in between $949-$1129 online, minus shipping, etc.No trades please, only looking for cash sales.Transfer to be done in Beaverton/Tigard area at your FFL dealer of choice (Tigard Pawn is a good one for only a $25 total fee).

When I ordered it, I was an idiot and didn't realise it was a 50mm objective lens. Thus, it's just been sitting in a Burris PEPR mount for a while, never having actually been used. For someone who does not care about having a large objective lens, this is a pretty nice scope. Glass quality hits well above its weight class, that's for sure. The reticle is a ballistic plex E1 model from Burris, so it has holdovers for bullet drop as well as windage. Theoretically useful, though I never got a chance to use it. Was intneding to use it for testing load development, but figured it was more hassle than it was worth constantly switching between scopes. Turrets have caps on them, although it does not come with lens caps. As an aside, I am also selling the Burris PEPR seperately. If you want the PEPR, that's going for $50. Very solid scope mount almost to a fault, it will actually hold a 50mm scope on an AR-15 to the proper level of eye relief, so if you want a hunting scope for an AR-15 or AR-10, this is a good combo."

Some of the good: it's a very lightweight 3-9 power scope with 3 illumination settings for either red or blue. Has a red dot on the top as well if that's your thing, as well as a very nice quick detatch lever for removing the scope. Glass is... not to unclear, surprisingly for a scope I paid only $100 for even at maximum power. Also has the original box and lens caps. As for the bad, well I'm pretty sure it is slightly canted. So there is that. The quality of it seems a little dubious. Not quite ""Amazon Prime Special"" levels of bad, but I wouldn't be putting this onto a duty weapon either. Some distortion around the edges is noticeable. I'm not sure the red dot can actually zero down far enough to work; I've never tried. If you want a scope for a tactical .22 or 9mm carbine I'd say this is perfect. Might even be good for a cheap AR-15 if you want to wait to save up for something better. Will take $70 for it, not opposed to negotiating. I just want it gone, I frankly hate myself for buying it. Hopefully you won't.Also open to trades. Could always use ammo (9mm, .223, 10mm, 45-70, 7.5x55 Swiss, .357/.38) or reloading equipment. Basically, if you have something you want to get rid of slightly more than you actually want this, I'll take it off your hands. Doesn't even have to be gun related."

Thing is fairly beefy almost to a fault, secures the scope with 3 screws per side and has 2 recoil lugs on the bottom. Not a quick detatch system. The idea with these is that they are a 1 piece mount for mounting scopes to an AR-15, so that the scope has proper height and clearance for everything.  Humourously, and as you can see from the picture, it does give enough height for a 50mm objective lens scope if you need that.

Bought this from Classic Firearms last year for $550 plus shipping and have realized that I don't have a need for a second AK right now. Less than 500 rounds shot through it, It still looks damn near new. Before I even shot it, I purchased new old stock FEG standard wood grip for the front and new old stock FEG ""fat"" pistol grip for the rear. I acquired a generic eastern europe beech wood stock and refinished in a light poly coat stain because FEG hungarian stocks are $150-200. It doesn't perfectly match but looks and feels a hell of a lot better than the garbage black plastic stock that came on it. 
The receiver is hungarian FEG as is the bolt and carrier, trunnions, gas system, etc. The barrel and FCG are US as well as the muzzle break. This will still meet 922r compliance with american magazines.Shoots very accurately. great trigger. Over all I love it and is probably the most affordable way to get a military grade fighting rifle, by far. I would consider keeping it if it had the proper AMD63 long gas system but I'm too much of a perfectionist. I didn't mind it having the AMD65 short gas system, obviously, since it was such a great price.
 
Classic is now selling these on sale for $450. Shipping is roughly $20 for the rifle. I have roughly $100 into the wood furniture. Thus, total this rifle would currently cost 570 new in it's form. Asking $500. Obviously for trades, gun values will be equalized by cash on which ever side needs to add cash. More than welcome to test shoot in person. Must have Valid AZ DL, preferably CCW licence."
