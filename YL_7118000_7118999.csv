I purchased it brand new and had to order it from Benelli as they were nowhere to be found. After 7 months of waiting on the gun I never even bothered to use it as intended. It has been sitting in my Liberty ever since.The gun has never been carried in the field or taken on a hunt. I put a total of 5 slugs through it (Hornady) just to test it out when I first got it. It has since been cleaned twice.The gun comes with a ComfortTech Gel cheek riser ($100) as well as the flat one from the factory. My goal was to put a scope on it but never got around to it. If you decided to mount an optic on it you won't have to worry about adding a cheek piece. It also has the three stock shims so you can adjust it to your fit, as well as the assembly tool. Sling is also included.My loss truly is your gain on this one. These CryoBarrels are insanely accurate and the gun is like brand new. I just have no need for it.The cheapest I can find this gun anywhere online in stock is $750, and thats only two websites. I am asking $550 for everything or best reasonable offer. I will not respond to low-balls. NO TRADES!!!Thanks for looking!"

It was brand new less than a month ago and has only 2 mags (60 rounds) fired through it. This rifle fires flawlessly with a nice tight MOA. I have just simply decided to take a different path with a new build.I am mainly looking for cash but but may take partial trade for AR accessories or something.

The SL, which stands for ‘stretchlightweight’, incorporates everything a shooter needs in a quality light-weight base model rifl e. Price and weight were the most important factors when developing the SL. With the M6-SL, LWRCI has brought to the market our lightest factory piston driven rifle to date. The SL utilizes the ‘stretch’ or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots. The most distinct feature of the SL is the barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRCI’s NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight. The ambidextrous SL also comes standard with a LWRCI Rear Skirmish Sight and a fi xed A2 front sight post. The M6 Stretch Lightweight is a great addition to the LWRCI family of rifl es. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifl e that incorporates our patented short-stroke piston operating system It also has all of the advanced coatings that make LWRCI rifles the best in the world, and does so at an entry level price."

The demand was too high, and a few of the Eagle marked 19s made it stateside before production finally caught up. They came with the older, better slide finish. Less than 1K rounds fired. Has an awesome stipple job from Gun Envy. Books, box, test cartridges, etc. Seven mags are included.I can throw in a Larry Vickers extended magazine release and slide catch.

It features: -Match grade stainless steel barrel  -match grade trigger (feels like a custom gunsmith trigger) -extended beaver tail  -lowered and flared ejection port -ambidextrous safety  -lightened match grade hammer -KimPro self-lubricanting finish -custom designed mepro night sights  This is a great gun with many custom features and upgrades directly from Kimber with no need for aftermarket parts. This Kimber SIS Custom is not only an amazing pistol but also a highly sought after collectible piece.   If you’re looking for a SIS then you know how rare it is to find one unfired, in this condition, and with all the original paperwork. With that in mind please don’t bother lowballing me as i won’t reply. If you're truly interested please contact me and we can work out a deal that is fair for both of us.
