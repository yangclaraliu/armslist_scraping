This is a true custom and hand built limited production pistol. This is the 375th one produced.  Considered to be the most accurate 9mm pistol in the world, this pistol shoots 1"" groups at 50 yards. Single-action only.  Stainless steel frame and slide are hand-lapped for a super-tight fit and unbelievably smooth action. Uses standard 5906 15rnd or 10rnd magazines. Briley titanium-nitride spherical barrel bushing. Pistol uses the fully adjustable Aristocrat rear sight and can be preset to quick adjust for 15, 25, and 50 yards to allow a neck hold at those distances which creates a clearer sight picture.  While capable of shooting any 9mm load, this pistol has always been shot in competition using reloaded ammunition to allow for very light loads, and is an accurate as ever.  Only selling it because I no longer shoot in competition.  The pistol comes with 6 magazines with padded bases and the original performance center lockable case.  I might consider a partial trade.  I don't have anything specific in mind, so if you are interested, let me know what you have to trade.  Thanks"

Grip is in excellent, like new condition and both grip and shelf are made from oiled walnut wood with stippling. Grip will fit any standard milspec AR15 lower receiver. Grip is a RIGHT HAND sided grip, lefties will find this grip very unergonomic. Palm shelf can be adjusted up and down to fit shooter's hand. Please note that the grip has a raised lip on the right side that prevents the install and use of ambidexterous safeties (you can install one but it will not fully rotate, the safety's lever will hit the raised lip which prevents full rotation even on 45 degree safeties). Grip doesn't have any packaging outside of some wax paper wrap.Asking $65 cash and carry FTF in Chesterfield MO or nearby.Thanks for looking!"

That's $50 off the cheapest price I could find.Here's what Troy says about them.Building on the well deserved reputation of the Troy BattleSights that have become the industry gold standard, Troy has developed a just as rugged low profile sight system designed specifically for firearms with top rails higher than the standard M4/M16. For shooters who prefer a sightline as close to bore as possible, or for those with raised top rail systems, the Troy Micro BattleSights provide an ideal solution.These Micro BattleSights are perfectly suited for service on rifles such as the IAR, Sig Sauer 556, POF 416, FN SCAR, Robinson Armament XCR, Heckler & Koch 416 / 417, and any other weapon with raised top rail.This sight set combines an HK-style hooded front sight with traditional round rearaperture, providing a fast acquisition, battle proven circle-in-circle sight picture."

The slide is easy to operate, making it a good choice for women. The light weight goes unnoticed in a pocket or purse. Credit Walther Performance Design for another hit.

It’s in superb condition and features a 22” barrel, a receiver factory drilled and tapped for scope and receiver sights, a 3 position wing safety, a jeweled bolt with a face showing hardly any use, the knurled bolt knob, and hinged floor plate. The genuine American walnut stock has the classy fleur-de-lis checkering, a fluted comb, a grip cap, sling swivel studs and the red rubber butt plate with the round Winchester logo that’s highly sought after by collectors. The super high gloss blued metal surfaces are largely free of defects and retain coverage in the 97-98% range, The bore is very good with strong, sharp rifling and the stock has only a few tiny handling marks. The actual weight of this rifle is 6.7 lbs. Sorry, but I don't have the box or manual.The elderly gentleman I bought it from fired it very little, only enough to kill an antelope, a deer, and a cow elk. Since I’ve owned it, this lovely rifle has been a safe queen residing in a dry climate with only a couple of trips to the gun range. This 36 year old rifle is in fantastic condition as seen in the pictures. If you want to see different pictures/ angles please let me know and I’ll try to send them at my earliest convenience. The bolt action Model 70 has earned a place in American sporting culture and has been held in high regard by shooters since its introduction in 1936, earning the moniker ""The Rifleman's Rifle"". It’s time to invest your money in something that will appreciate in value and which you can hold in your hand. This is a classic American rifle made in the historic Winchester plant in New Haven, CN. For only $850, you can add this rifle to your collection or take it out and shoot it! Shipping and full coverage insurance will be extra but only at the actual charges. Please call four zero six, four nine five, zero zero five nine with your questions, thanks."

I have a Enfield no.4 Mk.1* that someone sporterized, but here is the good news: I have all the parts to restore it to it's former glory. (I spent $280 with liberty tree collectors for the stock and hardware alone.) the stock is birch, and will need stained / oiled. All the correct hardware is there. The spike bayonet and frog are there. I have approx. 400 rounds of recent commercial (wolf, Remington, etc.) .303 ammo, and several additional rounds of antique military ball that will look nice on a shelf. (I wouldn't shoot it.) everything is there, I just don't have the time to finish it out . And I have a serious want for a tokarev at the moment. So, here's the deal-for TODAY ONLY: bring me a nice tokarev and $350 cash, it's all yours. I'm not picky on the tokarev, it can be a norinco with a ""flopper"" safety, an old navy arms import, a new cugir, a yugo m57, matters not. Caliber unimportant. Extras a plus. Just as long as it has nice blueing, I'll take it. the only stipulation is this: You must bring a rifle case to put it in, and you must come to me in Leander, no exceptions. ( my only transportation is a motorcycle, I cannot carry all this to meet you ""half way"".) this ad will not be up tomorrow. If the ad is still up, I still have it. Must be over 21 with valid Texas I.d. mike 737.210 nine five two four. CALLS ONLY, PLEASE. (I never check my email, and I do not text...so if you want to reach me, Calling is best!)thanks, and have a pleasant day!"
